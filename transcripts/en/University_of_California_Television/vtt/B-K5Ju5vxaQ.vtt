00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:32.194
- It's an honor and pleasure for me

00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:34.214
to introduce Deborah Tannen.

00:00:34.214 --> 00:00:36.711
I've known her for over 40 years,

00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:38.639
dreadful as that seems,

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:42.598
since before she came to
Berkeley as a graduate student.

00:00:42.598 --> 00:00:44.455
She arrived in 1974

00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:48.472
and earned her PhD in
1979, in the same year

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:51.560
joining the linguistics
faculty of Georgetown.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.743
She's written about 25 books

00:00:53.743 --> 00:00:56.994
for academic as well as
non-scholarly readers,

00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:59.293
over a hundred papers,

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:00.626
op-eds and such,

00:01:02.474 --> 00:01:06.746
and has been the subject of
innumerable media interviews.

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:11.553
That's just a bare-bones
outline of a remarkable career.

00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:13.039
In describing Deborah's work,

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.545
the word important springs
immediately to mind.

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:19.378
Linguists reflect on what words mean.

00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:20.794
What do we mean when we say

00:01:20.794 --> 00:01:24.533
that a linguist's work is important?

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:28.294
I recall a book I last
encountered a very long time ago,

00:01:28.294 --> 00:01:31.777
The Important Book by Margaret Wise Brown.

00:01:31.777 --> 00:01:34.796
It's a children's picture
book that considers,

00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:37.675
in language understandable
to a small child,

00:01:37.675 --> 00:01:40.555
the difference between the
important property of a thing

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:43.178
and its more peripheral properties.

00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:45.315
So for instance, here's a segment.

00:01:45.315 --> 00:01:49.726
"The important thing about a
spoon is that you eat with it.

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:51.793
It's like a little shovel.

00:01:51.793 --> 00:01:53.744
You hold it in your hand.

00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:55.671
You can put it in your mouth.

00:01:55.671 --> 00:02:00.640
It isn't flat, it's hollow,
and it spoons things up.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.474
But the important thing about a spoon

00:02:02.474 --> 00:02:04.285
is that you eat with it."

00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:06.770
In other words, the most
salient quality of spoons

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.114
is what they do for the humans using them.

00:02:10.114 --> 00:02:13.318
So then, what's the important
thing about language?

00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:16.290
And what makes linguistic work important?

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.100
Well, the important thing about language

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.515
is that it makes us human.

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:24.510
It has nouns and verbs and adjectives.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.807
It's built from sounds
and words and sentences.

00:02:27.807 --> 00:02:30.152
It uses grammatical rules that predict

00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:32.730
what we can and can't say.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.495
And there are a great many languages

00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:37.049
that may be very different
from one another.

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.674
But the important thing about language

00:02:38.674 --> 00:02:41.159
is that it makes us human.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.109
And it's that aspect of language

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.361
that Deborah's work has addressed.

00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:48.032
And that's why her work is important.

00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:52.513
How does language enable us
to be the creatures we are?

00:02:52.513 --> 00:02:56.252
Social, cognitive, creative, scary, weird,

00:02:56.252 --> 00:03:00.269
loving, hating, the whole human project.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.639
And if we're so smart,

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.913
why do our linguistic
practices keep tripping us up?

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:07.188
Why do we misunderstand and misuse,

00:03:07.188 --> 00:03:10.137
even with the best will in the world?

00:03:10.137 --> 00:03:12.413
And how do the physical
and social contexts

00:03:12.413 --> 00:03:14.015
in which we use language

00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:16.765
sometimes resolve those problems?

00:03:17.962 --> 00:03:20.516
Consider, just as a kind of,

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:24.069
as they like to say
nowadays, thought experiment,

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.718
how you might try using language

00:03:25.718 --> 00:03:28.829
to accomplish a seemingly simple task,

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.873
like expressing a desire,

00:03:30.873 --> 00:03:32.614
stating an opinion,

00:03:32.614 --> 00:03:34.031
making a request.

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:37.165
What available choices would work

00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:39.557
for, and which would work against you,

00:03:39.557 --> 00:03:43.086
depending on who you are
and who you're speaking to?

00:03:43.086 --> 00:03:46.569
For instance, are you male or female?

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.868
Are you both co-workers?

00:03:48.868 --> 00:03:51.538
Are you professors and students?

00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:55.207
Are the people you're talking
to your family members?

00:03:55.207 --> 00:03:58.783
Is your relationship
equal or hierarchical?

00:03:58.783 --> 00:04:00.826
Close or distant?

00:04:00.826 --> 00:04:02.568
And furthermore, are you,

00:04:02.568 --> 00:04:06.167
in this act that you're engaging in,

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:08.675
are you doing something
easy or complicated?

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:10.555
Hint here, it's never easy,

00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:12.669
no matter what you think.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.432
Is it in a social or a
professional setting?

00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:17.498
And of which kind?

00:04:17.498 --> 00:04:20.563
And how are you engaging
in this interchange?

00:04:20.563 --> 00:04:23.234
Is it orally, face to face?

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:26.539
On the phone, and what kind of phone?

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.999
In writing, like old fashioned snail mail?

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:33.490
Can anyone remember the last time

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.764
they wrote a letter, put it in an envelope

00:04:36.764 --> 00:04:38.597
and put a stamp on it?

00:04:41.036 --> 00:04:44.264
You people look like you're about my age.

00:04:44.264 --> 00:04:46.264
So yeah, we can do that.

00:04:47.213 --> 00:04:49.233
Or is there, did you perhaps,

00:04:49.233 --> 00:04:50.789
are you perhaps more comfortable

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.956
or forced to use some new-fangled way?

00:04:54.968 --> 00:04:57.638
Perhaps something we don't
really understand yet.

00:04:57.638 --> 00:05:01.168
Email, Facebook or Twitter, for instance.

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:03.095
Deborah has addressed
all of these questions,

00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:04.953
and innumerable others.

00:05:04.953 --> 00:05:06.741
How do we do language?

00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:09.713
What do we need to know to get it right?

00:05:09.713 --> 00:05:12.592
Why and how do we get it wrong?

00:05:12.592 --> 00:05:16.238
Deborah's answers are always
profoundly insightful.

00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:18.769
Today, Deborah Tannen will speak to us

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:20.951
on one of these topics,

00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:23.459
one that we find, all of us,

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:27.476
certainly I do, find
especially vexed and vexing.

00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:29.775
Conversation on the Small Screen,

00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:32.097
Talking Over Social Media.

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:33.978
And I know that all of us will emerge

00:05:33.978 --> 00:05:37.461
more knowledgeable and
confident users of language,

00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:41.199
and hence better humans, after her talk.

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.199
So, Deborah.

00:05:49.103 --> 00:05:50.686
- Thank you, Robin.

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.837
I got my PhD in linguistics
at Berkeley, really,

00:05:55.837 --> 00:05:58.089
thanks to Robin Lakoff.

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.314
It was Robin who inspired
me to go into linguistics.

00:06:01.314 --> 00:06:03.985
It was because of her
that I came to Berkeley,

00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:06.585
and everything that I'm
gonna say to you today

00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:09.813
you can trace to things
I learned from Robin.

00:06:09.813 --> 00:06:13.760
So it's an honor and a
personal great pleasure

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.104
to be introduced by you, thank you.

00:06:17.104 --> 00:06:19.124
And I wanna thank the Hitchcock Committee

00:06:19.124 --> 00:06:22.398
for inviting me to give these lectures.

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:24.302
It's quite a few years since I was here,

00:06:24.302 --> 00:06:26.183
and I guess some things are different,

00:06:26.183 --> 00:06:30.200
but it also feels very
nostalgic, very much the same.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.450
And again, a great pleasure to be back.

00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:39.372
So as you heard, I've spent
the last, about 40 years

00:06:39.372 --> 00:06:42.971
studying the language of conversation.

00:06:42.971 --> 00:06:44.387
And I'll say one last thing.

00:06:44.387 --> 00:06:47.174
I think it was about, the 1970s,

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:48.846
when I got into linguistics,

00:06:48.846 --> 00:06:51.075
that many fields were turning

00:06:51.075 --> 00:06:54.233
to analyzing everyday interaction.

00:06:54.233 --> 00:06:56.044
So linguistics previously had been

00:06:56.044 --> 00:06:58.575
kind of formal and kind of abstract.

00:06:58.575 --> 00:07:01.268
At least the major branch was.

00:07:01.268 --> 00:07:04.380
And Robin Lakoff's work was really crucial

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.748
in turning attention to the language

00:07:06.748 --> 00:07:09.465
as it's used in everyday life.

00:07:09.465 --> 00:07:12.507
And that was what
attracted me to the field.

00:07:12.507 --> 00:07:15.325
Well, conversations now take place

00:07:15.325 --> 00:07:18.584
over screens, over social media.

00:07:18.584 --> 00:07:22.044
So at Georgetown I teach classes
on analyzing conversation

00:07:22.044 --> 00:07:24.877
and I had to move toward looking at

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:28.058
conversations that are
taking place on the screen.

00:07:28.058 --> 00:07:31.325
More and more conversations
are taking place that way.

00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:34.622
Everything we say has a
message and a metamessage.

00:07:34.622 --> 00:07:36.990
The message would be the
meaning of the words.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.264
If you know the language then
you would know what that is.

00:07:40.264 --> 00:07:43.470
But what we really react
to is what we might call,

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.931
what I sometimes call the metamessage,

00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:47.441
and it's a term I borrow from

00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:49.205
the anthropologist Gregory Bateson,

00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:51.852
though he used it differently.

00:07:51.852 --> 00:07:54.058
So the metamessage is,

00:07:54.058 --> 00:07:57.123
what does it say about our relationship

00:07:57.123 --> 00:08:00.142
that I say these words
in this way at this time?

00:08:00.142 --> 00:08:02.441
How do I mean what I say?

00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:04.252
It's like a superordinate message

00:08:04.252 --> 00:08:05.970
telling you how to interpret

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.851
the words that you just heard.

00:08:07.851 --> 00:08:10.661
Well we know that in face
to face conversation,

00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:13.354
it could be by various implication,

00:08:13.354 --> 00:08:16.396
tone of voice, facial expression,

00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:19.809
are you taciturn or loquacious,

00:08:19.809 --> 00:08:21.899
and a whole range of ways of speaking

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:23.249
that I've spent a lot of time

00:08:23.249 --> 00:08:26.520
thinking about and writing about.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.213
When you talk to somebody over a screen,

00:08:29.213 --> 00:08:32.464
now I'm not talking
about Skype and Facetime,

00:08:32.464 --> 00:08:35.094
but when you're typing
messages over the screen,

00:08:35.094 --> 00:08:38.856
you don't have the facial
expression, the tone of voice,

00:08:38.856 --> 00:08:42.223
laughter, smiling, all those other things

00:08:42.223 --> 00:08:45.055
that will communicate how
you mean what you say.

00:08:45.055 --> 00:08:49.746
So how are metamessages
communicated on screen?

00:08:49.746 --> 00:08:52.997
And so that's a bit of what
I'll be talking about today.

00:08:52.997 --> 00:08:55.783
So I'm gonna be giving
you a series of examples.

00:08:55.783 --> 00:09:00.311
They are all real, natural
occurring interaction.

00:09:00.311 --> 00:09:01.913
As I said I teach at Georgetown

00:09:01.913 --> 00:09:04.630
and I teach a class in
the use of social media

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.511
as conversation, and I also teach a class

00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:09.436
called Cross-Cultural Communication.

00:09:09.436 --> 00:09:11.178
And in both those classes,

00:09:11.178 --> 00:09:14.870
I have students each
week observe interaction

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.518
and bring in some examples

00:09:16.518 --> 00:09:19.421
of interaction that they participated in.

00:09:19.421 --> 00:09:21.046
And they write it up, they describe it

00:09:21.046 --> 00:09:25.156
and they analyze it in terms
of their own experience

00:09:25.156 --> 00:09:28.128
and what we've studying in class,

00:09:28.128 --> 00:09:30.683
the theories and methods
we've been learning in class.

00:09:30.683 --> 00:09:33.167
And so all the examples that
I'll be giving you today

00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:36.584
are either those that students brought in

00:09:37.753 --> 00:09:40.354
or, many of them also come from

00:09:40.354 --> 00:09:44.789
examples that I use in my
book about women friends.

00:09:44.789 --> 00:09:48.365
It's called You're The
Only One I Can Tell,

00:09:48.365 --> 00:09:51.616
Inside the Language of
Women's Friendships.

00:09:51.616 --> 00:09:54.077
So those are the sources
of those examples.

00:09:54.077 --> 00:09:56.330
So it's either people I
interviewed for that book

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.164
or students that brought
examples into class.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:03.137
In both cases, if I'm using
their language in this way,

00:10:03.137 --> 00:10:04.739
I got permission.

00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:07.340
And I also cleared with them

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.453
exactly what I'm saying about them,

00:10:09.453 --> 00:10:13.702
and they approved that I
pretty much got it right.

00:10:13.702 --> 00:10:16.187
So I'll be giving you these examples,

00:10:16.187 --> 00:10:17.649
talking about them.

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:19.298
I'll be focusing in particular

00:10:19.298 --> 00:10:21.481
on differences that tend to vary

00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:24.648
by gender and sometimes by generation.

00:10:25.544 --> 00:10:27.262
And other influences as well,

00:10:27.262 --> 00:10:30.012
but mostly gender and generation.

00:10:31.628 --> 00:10:34.205
You've probably been
hearing a lot of criticism

00:10:34.205 --> 00:10:37.224
of social media being
used for interaction.

00:10:37.224 --> 00:10:39.197
I think many people feel that it's

00:10:39.197 --> 00:10:41.705
degrading relationships in some way.

00:10:41.705 --> 00:10:44.788
And my inclination is always to maybe

00:10:48.532 --> 00:10:50.970
defend the underdog, you might say.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.640
Or maybe just, as linguists, we wanna know

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.424
why people are using
language in a particular way,

00:10:56.424 --> 00:10:58.340
how are they using it,

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.082
but we're not so much in the business

00:11:00.082 --> 00:11:02.288
of saying this is good and this is bad.

00:11:02.288 --> 00:11:04.331
But I will be pointing out

00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:06.978
what I see as some of the advantages

00:11:06.978 --> 00:11:09.788
of using social media to communicate

00:11:09.788 --> 00:11:13.288
and also what some of the liabilities are.

00:11:15.198 --> 00:11:16.661
A question that often comes up,

00:11:16.661 --> 00:11:19.261
is it more distant or more intimate

00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:21.189
to communicate in that way.

00:11:21.189 --> 00:11:23.975
I'll be addressing that
question toward the end.

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:26.483
And how is it really changing our way

00:11:26.483 --> 00:11:28.316
of being in the world?

00:11:29.548 --> 00:11:30.871
The examples that I'm giving you

00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:32.381
are gonna be mostly of text,

00:11:32.381 --> 00:11:34.540
even though I know that much of what is

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.265
being communicated now
in these conversations

00:11:37.265 --> 00:11:39.239
would be pictures.

00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:40.841
And in fact this is a change that

00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:42.467
I've seen over the perhaps five years

00:11:42.467 --> 00:11:44.162
that I've been teaching this course.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.578
In the beginning I would say

00:11:45.578 --> 00:11:48.132
well you know, at least
everybody's typing,

00:11:48.132 --> 00:11:49.827
and they're typing language
and using language.

00:11:49.827 --> 00:11:52.730
And now, more and more, it's pictures.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.306
So it's emojis and bitmojis and memes.

00:11:56.306 --> 00:11:58.744
But I'm gonna use examples mostly of text,

00:11:58.744 --> 00:12:01.716
because I'm looking for the ways that

00:12:01.716 --> 00:12:04.502
language is being presented

00:12:04.502 --> 00:12:07.002
and framed by the metamessage.

00:12:08.473 --> 00:12:11.770
You know, I first started to think of

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.369
uses of new media as parallel in many ways

00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:17.436
to patterns that I had identified

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:21.035
in studies that I was doing
of everyday conversation,

00:12:21.035 --> 00:12:23.589
by the frequency of which I heard people

00:12:23.589 --> 00:12:27.328
accusing other people of being rude.

00:12:27.328 --> 00:12:29.882
And that's how I really
started, in my work,

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:32.088
analyzing everyday conversation.

00:12:32.088 --> 00:12:33.176
I talked about something that

00:12:33.176 --> 00:12:35.267
I called conversational style.

00:12:35.267 --> 00:12:38.169
As I said last night, my dissertation

00:12:38.169 --> 00:12:41.118
was a comparison of conversational style

00:12:41.118 --> 00:12:45.321
of people from New York compared
to people from California.

00:12:45.321 --> 00:12:47.480
And there were many ways I had encountered

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.199
where ways of using language

00:12:49.199 --> 00:12:51.381
which were considered
quite polite in New York

00:12:51.381 --> 00:12:53.727
were seen as rude in California,

00:12:53.727 --> 00:12:55.631
and it made me think about,

00:12:55.631 --> 00:12:58.719
what are ways that we come to assume

00:12:58.719 --> 00:13:01.923
language is either polite or rude.

00:13:01.923 --> 00:13:05.429
And I started hearing things
like that about social media.

00:13:05.429 --> 00:13:08.448
So many people my age
were frequently frustrated

00:13:08.448 --> 00:13:11.722
by younger people, very
often it was parents

00:13:11.722 --> 00:13:13.371
frustrated by their children,

00:13:13.371 --> 00:13:16.389
because the kids would be
texting under the table

00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:18.433
while we're having
dinner, and they should be

00:13:18.433 --> 00:13:20.591
communicating with us, and it's rude

00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:24.701
to be texting when you're
in communication with me.

00:13:24.701 --> 00:13:27.417
And I heard complaints that kids are rude

00:13:27.417 --> 00:13:30.088
because they don't answer the phone.

00:13:30.088 --> 00:13:34.012
And they don't, often
don't listen to voicemail.

00:13:34.012 --> 00:13:35.679
And that seems rude.

00:13:38.377 --> 00:13:41.140
At the same time, I hear
younger people telling me

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.728
that it's kinda rude to
call people on the phone.

00:13:45.728 --> 00:13:48.408
It's intrusive, you know?

00:13:48.408 --> 00:13:51.938
You don't know what I'm
doing, I might be busy.

00:13:51.938 --> 00:13:53.656
If you really wanna talk on the phone

00:13:53.656 --> 00:13:57.823
you should text and ask me if
it's convenient to talk now.

00:13:59.136 --> 00:14:02.967
And when kids are texting under the table,

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.732
often what they're doing is avoiding

00:14:04.732 --> 00:14:06.775
being rude to their friends,

00:14:06.775 --> 00:14:08.354
because there's an expectation that

00:14:08.354 --> 00:14:11.164
you're gonna answer a text quite quickly.

00:14:11.164 --> 00:14:12.929
And when you think about it,

00:14:12.929 --> 00:14:15.219
why should your friend wait for hours

00:14:15.219 --> 00:14:17.309
to know what time you wanna meet her,

00:14:17.309 --> 00:14:18.507
when you could just take a couple

00:14:18.507 --> 00:14:21.051
minutes and answer the text?

00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:25.137
So these senses of what's
rude and what's polite

00:14:25.137 --> 00:14:27.018
vary very much by generations

00:14:27.018 --> 00:14:28.806
and the uses of social media.

00:14:28.806 --> 00:14:30.455
All very parallel to the kind of thing

00:14:30.455 --> 00:14:33.241
that I was talking about and writing about

00:14:33.241 --> 00:14:36.143
in everyday conversation.

00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:38.442
So I wanna talk about some of the features

00:14:38.442 --> 00:14:41.275
of speaking over on the screen

00:14:41.275 --> 00:14:43.775
that are parallel in some way.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:46.964
Pacing and pausing is something

00:14:46.964 --> 00:14:48.543
that I have talked about

00:14:48.543 --> 00:14:51.678
that I actually mentioned
yesterday as well.

00:14:51.678 --> 00:14:54.278
How long a pause do you
expect between turns.

00:14:54.278 --> 00:14:56.716
Depending on the part of
the country you come from,

00:14:56.716 --> 00:15:01.035
you may expect a longer or
shorter pause between turns.

00:15:01.035 --> 00:15:05.035
What is a normal pause
in a texted conversation?

00:15:06.097 --> 00:15:09.255
How soon do you expect
somebody to return the text?

00:15:09.255 --> 00:15:11.299
When do you start thinking,

00:15:11.299 --> 00:15:13.319
you're communicating something negative

00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:15.455
because you're not answering me.

00:15:15.455 --> 00:15:18.984
Somebody that I interviewed for
the book about women friends

00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:23.698
was telling me about a friend
who stopped talking to her,

00:15:23.698 --> 00:15:26.183
and then she followed up by saying,

00:15:26.183 --> 00:15:30.037
she didn't answer my text for two days.

00:15:30.037 --> 00:15:32.638
So a two-day delay in answering a text

00:15:32.638 --> 00:15:36.028
was equivalent to not
talking to me at all.

00:15:36.028 --> 00:15:38.675
I was also somewhat
amused by a young woman,

00:15:38.675 --> 00:15:40.556
again a college student,

00:15:40.556 --> 00:15:43.296
who told me that she expects her friends

00:15:43.296 --> 00:15:44.549
to answer quite quickly,

00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:46.036
and if the friend doesn't answer quickly,

00:15:46.036 --> 00:15:48.497
she'll call her on the phone and say,

00:15:48.497 --> 00:15:50.414
answer the text please.

00:15:52.537 --> 00:15:54.255
Now, it blew my mind.

00:15:54.255 --> 00:15:56.531
She's got her friend on the phone.

00:15:56.531 --> 00:15:59.712
Why not ask her whatever
it is you wanna ask her.

00:15:59.712 --> 00:16:03.915
But no, the conversation
should be taking place on text.

00:16:03.915 --> 00:16:07.955
The friend violated the norms
by taking too long to answer,

00:16:07.955 --> 00:16:12.038
she wanted her to fix it
but answer on the phone.

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:16.059
Something that I talked about
in everyday conversation

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:18.335
that has become quite significant I think,

00:16:18.335 --> 00:16:20.749
I'll be showing you in
examples of new media,

00:16:20.749 --> 00:16:23.954
something that I call an
enthusiasm constraint.

00:16:23.954 --> 00:16:26.160
Many of us assume that to really believe

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.808
somebody means what they say,

00:16:27.808 --> 00:16:30.037
there has to be a level of enthusiasm.

00:16:30.037 --> 00:16:32.290
I first thought of this in connection with

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.496
cross-cultural communication between

00:16:34.496 --> 00:16:37.119
Greece and the United States.

00:16:37.119 --> 00:16:39.023
A Greek woman that I had interviewed

00:16:39.023 --> 00:16:42.298
was telling me, when she was young,

00:16:42.298 --> 00:16:43.853
if she asked her father if she should

00:16:43.853 --> 00:16:46.640
go to a particular dance or something,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.223
if her father said, if
you want you can go,

00:16:51.075 --> 00:16:53.861
that meant she shouldn't go.

00:16:53.861 --> 00:16:55.579
If he really wanted her to go,

00:16:55.579 --> 00:16:57.855
he would say yes, you should go.

00:16:57.855 --> 00:17:00.897
So there was a level of
enthusiasm that she expected

00:17:00.897 --> 00:17:04.287
to know that what was
said was really meant.

00:17:04.287 --> 00:17:06.609
This is something that varies very much

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.776
by gender in social media.

00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:12.623
And so I'm gonna start showing you

00:17:12.623 --> 00:17:15.247
a series of examples where you see,

00:17:15.247 --> 00:17:17.997
how is enthusiasm expressed using

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:23.141
these written messages on screen,

00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:26.369
and also what are some of
the gender differences.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:28.134
Someone named Susan Haring has written

00:17:28.134 --> 00:17:30.177
far more than I have
about gender differences,

00:17:30.177 --> 00:17:32.290
so if you're interested in pursuing that

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.984
you can follow up some
of what she's written.

00:17:34.984 --> 00:17:37.236
So all these examples
come from field notes

00:17:37.236 --> 00:17:38.838
that students of mine wrote.

00:17:38.838 --> 00:17:41.857
They brought in the
examples, wrote about them,

00:17:41.857 --> 00:17:45.827
and have approved the way
I'm talking about them here.

00:17:45.827 --> 00:17:49.125
So the first one is an
exchange that took place

00:17:49.125 --> 00:17:52.561
between a young woman who
was a student at Georgetown,

00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:55.951
and her brother who was
a student at a college

00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:58.738
between Washington where Georgetown is

00:17:58.738 --> 00:18:01.965
and New York City where they were from.

00:18:01.965 --> 00:18:04.380
And she was proposing that
she would visit her brother

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.713
on her way home for a break.

00:18:08.304 --> 00:18:10.557
So she sent this message to her brother.

00:18:10.557 --> 00:18:14.179
"Hey! So I have an idea for
President's Day Weekend!"

00:18:14.179 --> 00:18:18.451
And he said "Oh God, you
and your ideas, what is it?"

00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:20.820
It's a kind of sarcasm, playful teasing,

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.374
that is not unusual for guys,

00:18:23.374 --> 00:18:25.882
more common among guys than girls.

00:18:25.882 --> 00:18:28.506
She said, "I'm gonna go home
from Saturday to Monday,

00:18:28.506 --> 00:18:30.061
but what do you think of me coming

00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:32.058
to visit you on the way back?"

00:18:32.058 --> 00:18:33.893
She meant on the way there.

00:18:33.893 --> 00:18:35.773
"I can take the train and stay over

00:18:35.773 --> 00:18:36.934
Thursday and Friday night.

00:18:36.934 --> 00:18:39.326
We can do something fun
during the day on Friday,

00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:42.368
it's supposed to be really nice out!"

00:18:42.368 --> 00:18:44.852
He replied, "Okay cool.

00:18:44.852 --> 00:18:46.710
Thursday is fine but I have a club

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.914
baseball tournament I'm
leaving for Friday."

00:18:49.914 --> 00:18:52.120
"Oh, okay. Well we can get dinner

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.791
and go out on Thursday then??"

00:18:54.791 --> 00:18:59.202
"Dinner sounds good, I'll
pick you up at the station."

00:18:59.202 --> 00:19:03.127
"Wow, good thing you sound so excited."

00:19:03.127 --> 00:19:05.588
Can you perceive and had you yourself

00:19:05.588 --> 00:19:09.442
thought that he sounded less
enthusiastic than he should.

00:19:09.442 --> 00:19:11.370
I'm real curious, how many of you thought

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.227
he isn't all that into this?

00:19:13.227 --> 00:19:14.644
How many of you thought, sure,

00:19:14.644 --> 00:19:16.989
he thinks it's good, he's on board?

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:17.987
That's about half and half.

00:19:17.987 --> 00:19:21.080
And he said, "What? Sorry, I am, I am."

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.048
And she commented that she was later

00:19:24.048 --> 00:19:27.202
convinced that he was
enthusiastic about it.

00:19:27.202 --> 00:19:30.337
He wanted to introduce her
to his friends, which he did.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:31.869
And she concluded that there

00:19:31.869 --> 00:19:33.752
was a gender difference going on,

00:19:33.752 --> 00:19:38.372
that for him "sounds good"
really meant it's good.

00:19:38.372 --> 00:19:40.439
For her, it would not mean that.

00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:42.273
And the next example if gonna show you

00:19:42.273 --> 00:19:44.479
what she might have expected,

00:19:44.479 --> 00:19:47.010
and what the young women
that brought in examples

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.750
were more likely to do.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.606
So Jillian and Kimberly were friends

00:19:52.606 --> 00:19:55.485
and previously had lived in the same dorm,

00:19:55.485 --> 00:19:57.320
so they saw each there quite often,

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.108
and now they're living in different dorms.

00:19:59.108 --> 00:20:01.964
So Jillian sent this message.

00:20:01.964 --> 00:20:05.377
"Hey so I haven't seen you the ENTIRE week

00:20:05.377 --> 00:20:07.490
and I reeeally miss you!"

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.184
So you have capitalization, ENTIRE,

00:20:10.184 --> 00:20:12.351
and repetition of letters.

00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:15.849
"What are you doing
tonight/tomorrow for meals?

00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:18.195
Sorry I had to miss lunch yesterday!

00:20:18.195 --> 00:20:19.866
But really, this needs to change

00:20:19.866 --> 00:20:21.469
because I miss McCarthy
8," that's the dorm,

00:20:21.469 --> 00:20:25.636
"Only because I can't just
stop by your room to chat!"

00:20:26.832 --> 00:20:30.803
And Kimberly replied
"I miss you too!!!!!!!"

00:20:30.803 --> 00:20:33.589
Multiple exclamation points.

00:20:33.589 --> 00:20:36.144
"R you going to Justin
and Lance's tonight??

00:20:36.144 --> 00:20:38.349
Slash wanna do din tomorrow??"

00:20:38.349 --> 00:20:40.671
That slash is very interesting.

00:20:40.671 --> 00:20:45.246
She means slash, in other
words here's an option.

00:20:45.246 --> 00:20:49.286
And people often say that we
type things to save keystrokes,

00:20:49.286 --> 00:20:52.281
but using a slash would've
been fewer keystrokes

00:20:52.281 --> 00:20:54.812
than writing out the word slash.

00:20:54.812 --> 00:20:55.881
But I think what she's doing is

00:20:55.881 --> 00:20:57.227
writing what she would've said.

00:20:57.227 --> 00:20:59.712
She explained to me
they say that sometimes.

00:20:59.712 --> 00:21:01.848
"I can't wait to catch up on life!!"

00:21:01.848 --> 00:21:03.938
Exclamation points.

00:21:03.938 --> 00:21:07.444
Now when Kimberly turned it this email,

00:21:07.444 --> 00:21:10.027
this exchange, and analyzed it,

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.576
what she said was,

00:21:12.576 --> 00:21:16.159
I wasn't all that
excited about seeing her.

00:21:18.566 --> 00:21:23.118
I just knew that I had to use
multiple exclamation points

00:21:23.118 --> 00:21:26.740
or she would've thought
that I was unenthusiastic

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.823
and not eager to see her.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.032
A student told me that her mother

00:21:33.032 --> 00:21:36.864
would start a text to her by saying hi.

00:21:36.864 --> 00:21:40.864
And she had to tell her
mother, please add "I"s.

00:21:42.065 --> 00:21:45.065
Because hi with one "I" sounds cold.

00:21:47.881 --> 00:21:49.808
There are many other
ways that people start,

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:52.130
but it's gotta be something special

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.475
that shows you are enthusiastic.

00:21:54.475 --> 00:21:56.475
"Yoooo" with extra "O"s.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.257
"Hayy" with an extra "Y"

00:22:00.257 --> 00:22:03.624
and some people do spell it
with an "A" rather than an "E."

00:22:03.624 --> 00:22:04.971
I think there's a tendency often

00:22:04.971 --> 00:22:08.639
to change things a bit
just to be creative.

00:22:08.639 --> 00:22:11.263
You could have "Hey!"
with an exclamation point,

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:14.003
and you could have "Yo!"
with an exclamation point.

00:22:14.003 --> 00:22:16.279
But you gotta do something to show

00:22:16.279 --> 00:22:18.862
some level of extra enthusiasm.

00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:22.734
A mother gave me this example of

00:22:22.734 --> 00:22:25.985
how she interpreted her daughter's use

00:22:25.985 --> 00:22:28.307
or not use of exclamation points.

00:22:28.307 --> 00:22:31.627
So the situation here, the
daughter was in high school,

00:22:31.627 --> 00:22:33.647
she was a member of the soccer team,

00:22:33.647 --> 00:22:36.570
the soccer team was going on an away trip,

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.172
and she knew that the daughter

00:22:38.172 --> 00:22:40.448
had some concerns about the bus ride,

00:22:40.448 --> 00:22:42.538
for various reasons
that had something to do

00:22:42.538 --> 00:22:45.440
with what was going on
among the girls on the team.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.041
So the mother texted her daughter.

00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:51.541
"bus ride ok????" Multiple question marks,

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.961
speaking her daughter's dialect.

00:22:54.961 --> 00:22:57.283
The daughter said "yah."

00:22:57.283 --> 00:22:59.450
"no exclamation point????"

00:23:03.204 --> 00:23:05.037
"no need for one haha"

00:23:06.594 --> 00:23:08.962
In other words, things
weren't going so great.

00:23:08.962 --> 00:23:11.052
The "haha" is great.

00:23:11.052 --> 00:23:13.002
I always have a unit in class

00:23:13.002 --> 00:23:14.837
where we bring in, students bring in

00:23:14.837 --> 00:23:18.343
all the different variations on "haha."

00:23:18.343 --> 00:23:20.758
When do you say "ha,"
when do you say "haha,"

00:23:20.758 --> 00:23:22.639
when do you say "hahaha,"

00:23:22.639 --> 00:23:26.145
when do you use a smiley,
when do you use a meme,

00:23:26.145 --> 00:23:28.444
and I could give a whole talk about that.

00:23:28.444 --> 00:23:30.835
So it's her way of saying

00:23:30.835 --> 00:23:34.783
I'm not entirely serious
about what I just said.

00:23:34.783 --> 00:23:38.660
It's exactly, these "haha"s
and other variations of it,

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.772
is doing exactly what you
would do by tone of voice

00:23:41.772 --> 00:23:45.772
if you were speaking to
somebody voice to voice.

00:23:47.089 --> 00:23:49.922
Here's an example of a woman who,

00:23:51.757 --> 00:23:54.496
there were two friends, one sent the other

00:23:54.496 --> 00:23:56.981
a picture of earrings she had just bought,

00:23:56.981 --> 00:23:59.981
and this is what her friend replied.

00:24:00.859 --> 00:24:04.086
"OMG!!!!!" Multiple exclamation points.

00:24:04.086 --> 00:24:06.942
"THEY ARE SOSOSOSOSO GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!"

00:24:06.942 --> 00:24:08.614
Multiple exclamation points.

00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:11.308
"Just so YOU" capitalization,

00:24:11.308 --> 00:24:14.280
"and so perfect!!!!!!"
Multiple exclamation points,

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.447
"absolutely beautiful!!!!!!"
Multiple exclamation points.

00:24:19.899 --> 00:24:23.982
How old do you think the
person is who sent this?

00:24:25.263 --> 00:24:27.513
She was a woman in her 50s,

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:33.204
a physician, one of my
sister's close friends.

00:24:33.204 --> 00:24:36.014
And I was with my sister
when she bought the earrings,

00:24:36.014 --> 00:24:37.802
sent her friend a picture,

00:24:37.802 --> 00:24:39.683
'cause her friend knew she
was looking for earrings,

00:24:39.683 --> 00:24:40.820
she wanted to tell her

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.840
I found the kind of earrings
she was looking for,

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.535
and her friend sent this back.

00:24:44.535 --> 00:24:47.118
And I said, I have to use this.

00:24:48.182 --> 00:24:50.133
Please ask her for permission to use it,

00:24:50.133 --> 00:24:53.894
and this is what her friend
replied and my sister passed on.

00:24:53.894 --> 00:24:56.357
"of course, as long as she
recognizes that the note

00:24:56.357 --> 00:25:00.444
was really an intentionally
funny exaggeration."

00:25:00.444 --> 00:25:01.814
And that is one of the things

00:25:01.814 --> 00:25:04.646
that I'll be saying about
these uses of new media,

00:25:04.646 --> 00:25:08.176
that they're, it's used very creatively.

00:25:08.176 --> 00:25:09.476
And I think people are aware

00:25:09.476 --> 00:25:11.752
that they're using it creatively.

00:25:11.752 --> 00:25:15.119
And it's fun to use these funny markings

00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:18.452
and creative uses of exclamation points,

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.780
capitalizations, repetition of letters.

00:25:23.942 --> 00:25:27.216
So, when the sister didn't see all that,

00:25:27.216 --> 00:25:30.003
she thought that her brother
was feeling negative,

00:25:30.003 --> 00:25:31.164
and he wasn't.

00:25:31.164 --> 00:25:34.113
Sometimes people can use
leaving out these things

00:25:34.113 --> 00:25:36.736
to be intentionally negative.

00:25:36.736 --> 00:25:39.058
And so, this next example was,

00:25:39.058 --> 00:25:43.029
the situation is, bunch of
girls were meeting somewhere,

00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:44.260
they were gonna go somewhere,

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.583
and somehow it ended up that

00:25:45.583 --> 00:25:48.300
most of them went away, and one of them,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.786
the student who was in my class,

00:25:49.786 --> 00:25:52.480
she's the one who wrote about
it, her name was Jackie,

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.435
was left waiting for the one late-comer.

00:25:56.435 --> 00:25:59.500
And she sent this text to her friend.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.667
"Thanks for waiting for
Emily with me that's cool"

00:26:04.701 --> 00:26:07.905
No punctuation, no capitalization,

00:26:07.905 --> 00:26:10.274
no exclamation points.

00:26:10.274 --> 00:26:13.014
"JACKIE I AM SO SO SO SORRY!"

00:26:13.014 --> 00:26:14.616
She needs the capitalizations

00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:16.752
and the repetition and
the exclamation point

00:26:16.752 --> 00:26:19.538
to show how badly she
feels about leaving her.

00:26:19.538 --> 00:26:21.744
"I thought you were behind us in the cab

00:26:21.744 --> 00:26:23.340
and then I saw you weren't!!!!!"

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.801
Multiple exclamation points.

00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:27.014
"I feel soooooooo bad!

00:26:27.014 --> 00:26:30.543
Catch another can and I'll
pay for it for youuuuu"

00:26:30.543 --> 00:26:33.748
The repetition of the
letter "U" at the end

00:26:33.748 --> 00:26:35.466
was very intriguing to me.

00:26:35.466 --> 00:26:38.740
When you see the repetition of "O"

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.619
on "I'm soooooooo sorry," you feel like,

00:26:41.619 --> 00:26:43.407
and I did when I read it,

00:26:43.407 --> 00:26:46.449
draw out that sound, I'm soooooooo sorry.

00:26:46.449 --> 00:26:48.191
I don't think this should be read,

00:26:48.191 --> 00:26:50.524
I'll pay for it for youuuuu.

00:26:52.649 --> 00:26:56.066
The repetition in itself shows enthusiasm

00:26:57.223 --> 00:27:01.983
and that you feel strongly
about what you're saying.

00:27:01.983 --> 00:27:04.607
"no its fine we are walking"

00:27:04.607 --> 00:27:08.080
"seriously Jackie please,
get a cab, I feel so bad!!!"

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.417
Exclamation points.

00:27:09.417 --> 00:27:12.000
"we are walking there its fine"

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.976
And of course, you know
it's not really fine,

00:27:15.976 --> 00:27:20.782
because she doesn't have
those markers of enthusiasm.

00:27:20.782 --> 00:27:24.776
Next couple of examples
are cross-generational,

00:27:24.776 --> 00:27:27.260
really misunderstandings in how

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.927
these kinds of punctuation
markers are used.

00:27:31.765 --> 00:27:34.737
This was an example from a student.

00:27:34.737 --> 00:27:38.904
She had gone out to a restaurant
to celebrate her birthday,

00:27:40.264 --> 00:27:44.165
her father knew that, and her
father sent her this text.

00:27:44.165 --> 00:27:46.115
"How did dinner go?"

00:27:46.115 --> 00:27:49.343
And she said, "It was so
good! We went to Papa Razzi!"

00:27:49.343 --> 00:27:51.874
And exclamation points in both cases.

00:27:51.874 --> 00:27:52.707
"Wow..."

00:27:54.288 --> 00:27:57.028
When the student reported it, she said

00:27:57.028 --> 00:28:00.883
to her, the three dots after "Wow" means

00:28:00.883 --> 00:28:02.833
I don't really mean wow.

00:28:02.833 --> 00:28:05.759
It undercuts what you said before.

00:28:05.759 --> 00:28:10.312
So "Wow..." means, couldn't
you have done better than that?

00:28:10.312 --> 00:28:13.358
And she commented in her analysis of it

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:15.587
that her father had a habit

00:28:15.587 --> 00:28:18.254
of signing texts "I love you..."

00:28:20.278 --> 00:28:23.482
Which to her meant, I
don't really love you.

00:28:23.482 --> 00:28:25.618
Undercutting what had come before.

00:28:25.618 --> 00:28:28.428
When I saw this example,
I suddenly understood

00:28:28.428 --> 00:28:30.216
something in an earlier example

00:28:30.216 --> 00:28:32.747
that I had ignored, I
hadn't paid attention to.

00:28:32.747 --> 00:28:36.164
This was Sarah's response to her brother.

00:28:37.785 --> 00:28:41.245
"Wow...good thing you sound excited..."

00:28:41.245 --> 00:28:44.612
Dot dot dot, you don't
really sound excited.

00:28:44.612 --> 00:28:48.838
"Wow..." I'm underwhelmed
by your reaction.

00:28:48.838 --> 00:28:50.278
And I had missed it,

00:28:50.278 --> 00:28:52.284
because frankly, I didn't understand

00:28:52.284 --> 00:28:55.697
that dot dot dot undercuts
what's said before.

00:28:55.697 --> 00:28:59.615
As this young woman's father also didn't.

00:28:59.615 --> 00:29:03.005
Another thing that is different
across the generations

00:29:03.005 --> 00:29:05.088
is the use of the period.

00:29:06.883 --> 00:29:09.948
So this was in a text that a young

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:12.711
student in my class got from her mother.

00:29:12.711 --> 00:29:14.711
Mom texted "Talk in 30?"

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.424
And student, name was Rose, said

00:29:18.424 --> 00:29:21.163
"I'm free now and in 3 hours."

00:29:21.163 --> 00:29:23.580
And her mother replied "Now."

00:29:25.064 --> 00:29:28.965
How many of you got the
impression her mother's mad?

00:29:28.965 --> 00:29:29.965
So did Rose.

00:29:31.566 --> 00:29:34.585
She thought, uh oh, what did I do now?

00:29:34.585 --> 00:29:36.303
And she was pleasantly surprised,

00:29:36.303 --> 00:29:39.205
nothing particular, mother
just wanted to talk.

00:29:39.205 --> 00:29:41.272
Her mother put a period, now,

00:29:41.272 --> 00:29:44.244
because it was the end of the sentence.

00:29:44.244 --> 00:29:46.984
When young people use a period
at the end of a sentence,

00:29:46.984 --> 00:29:48.470
it usually means you're angry.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:51.387
Otherwise, you have no punctuation.

00:29:52.673 --> 00:29:56.179
So those kinds of small differences

00:29:56.179 --> 00:29:58.989
in uses of punctuation are quite common.

00:29:58.989 --> 00:30:02.402
Just one more example here
about a gender difference.

00:30:02.402 --> 00:30:04.863
A student in my class, his name was Matt,

00:30:04.863 --> 00:30:08.068
decided for an assignment to compare

00:30:08.068 --> 00:30:11.017
text messages he got from his father

00:30:11.017 --> 00:30:13.803
and text messages he got from his mother.

00:30:13.803 --> 00:30:18.122
And he decided he would look
at 20 messages from each one.

00:30:18.122 --> 00:30:22.511
Now he discovered a
difference right at the start.

00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:25.529
In order to collect 20
messages from his mother,

00:30:25.529 --> 00:30:28.176
he had to go back three weeks.

00:30:28.176 --> 00:30:30.870
In order to collect 20
messages from his father,

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.287
he had to go back six months.

00:30:34.237 --> 00:30:37.255
So his mother was texting
him far more often

00:30:37.255 --> 00:30:39.113
than the father did.

00:30:39.113 --> 00:30:41.412
But I'll show you two examples

00:30:41.412 --> 00:30:43.316
where he looked side by side

00:30:43.316 --> 00:30:45.638
at how, first his father, then his mother

00:30:45.638 --> 00:30:48.305
texted about the same situation.

00:30:51.721 --> 00:30:53.022
The situation here is that

00:30:53.022 --> 00:30:54.879
he was expecting them to visit,

00:30:54.879 --> 00:30:58.594
they were at the airport
and the plane was delayed.

00:30:58.594 --> 00:31:01.009
So the father said "Good" to something,

00:31:01.009 --> 00:31:02.472
that was an earlier message,

00:31:02.472 --> 00:31:05.537
"American Airlines Flight 3421

00:31:05.537 --> 00:31:08.037
running late, due in at 9:45."

00:31:08.974 --> 00:31:12.085
And Matt replied "Sounds good."

00:31:12.085 --> 00:31:14.198
His mother also texted.

00:31:14.198 --> 00:31:17.217
"Hi honey... At the airport, RDU."

00:31:17.217 --> 00:31:19.330
That's Raleigh Durham.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.536
"...Delayed till 8:45.

00:31:21.536 --> 00:31:23.203
Due into DC at 10pm.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:28.003
I'll keep you posted" Heart, kissy face.

00:31:30.175 --> 00:31:33.925
And his response was
the same, "Sounds good."

00:31:37.232 --> 00:31:39.438
So you see a lot of things
going on with his mother.

00:31:39.438 --> 00:31:40.994
Again, the use of dot dot dot,

00:31:40.994 --> 00:31:44.825
which he knows she didn't mean
to undercut what she said,

00:31:44.825 --> 00:31:46.451
but that's what it would mean,

00:31:46.451 --> 00:31:48.169
using periods at the end of sentences,

00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:50.328
which kids wouldn't mean,

00:31:50.328 --> 00:31:54.810
but more talk, more verbiage,
and enthusiasm markers.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.977
The heart, the kissy face.

00:31:58.293 --> 00:32:00.081
The next two that I'll show you

00:32:00.081 --> 00:32:02.426
were their ways of responding,

00:32:02.426 --> 00:32:04.934
he had just gotten his driver's license,

00:32:04.934 --> 00:32:07.167
and they both texted about it.

00:32:07.167 --> 00:32:10.534
Dad, "Man did u get ur license?"

00:32:10.534 --> 00:32:12.717
"Yessir, got it yesterday."

00:32:12.717 --> 00:32:15.967
Mom, "Hey Matt...What do you think

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:17.825
of your driver's license pic??

00:32:17.825 --> 00:32:20.379
Are you happy with it?"

00:32:20.379 --> 00:32:22.608
"Haha, yup, I'm happy with it."

00:32:22.608 --> 00:32:27.531
"I LOVE it!!!!" Caps,
multiple exclamation points,

00:32:27.531 --> 00:32:30.198
three thumbs up and a big smile.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.751
And this is often how emojis are used,

00:32:35.751 --> 00:32:37.933
as markers of enthusiasm.

00:32:37.933 --> 00:32:40.163
This is very much like what I wrote about

00:32:40.163 --> 00:32:42.392
in the book You Just Don't Understand,

00:32:42.392 --> 00:32:44.180
the book I wrote way back in the '90s

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.221
about differences that
tend to characterize

00:32:47.221 --> 00:32:49.195
women's and men's uses of language.

00:32:49.195 --> 00:32:52.330
And I developed the terms there

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.580
of "report talk" versus "rapport talk."

00:32:57.206 --> 00:32:59.737
Report talk being a focus mostly

00:32:59.737 --> 00:33:01.316
on whatever the information is

00:33:01.316 --> 00:33:02.802
that you wanna get across,

00:33:02.802 --> 00:33:05.612
and rapport talk, where
you add extra words

00:33:05.612 --> 00:33:09.791
to focus on the positive
feelings of the relationship.

00:33:09.791 --> 00:33:11.904
And that very much characterizes this.

00:33:11.904 --> 00:33:13.599
A lot of what the mother was doing

00:33:13.599 --> 00:33:15.387
was a kind of rapport talk,

00:33:15.387 --> 00:33:18.104
a lot of what the father
was doing was report talk.

00:33:18.104 --> 00:33:20.771
Just getting the message across.

00:33:21.695 --> 00:33:23.793
So those are my examples

00:33:23.793 --> 00:33:26.765
of these kinds of markers that we use

00:33:26.765 --> 00:33:29.876
to communicate how we mean what we say.

00:33:29.876 --> 00:33:32.361
What are the metamessages we have in mind

00:33:32.361 --> 00:33:34.028
when we communicate?

00:33:35.774 --> 00:33:38.677
And sometimes the fact that
those metamessages are not there

00:33:38.677 --> 00:33:41.672
can create quite a bit of confusion.

00:33:41.672 --> 00:33:44.041
The taciturnity of messages

00:33:44.041 --> 00:33:47.082
can create, in itself, confusion.

00:33:47.082 --> 00:33:49.126
A young woman in my class made a comment

00:33:49.126 --> 00:33:50.937
in discussion one time,

00:33:50.937 --> 00:33:54.443
she said, I am sick and tired of seeing

00:33:54.443 --> 00:33:56.788
relationship after relationship break up

00:33:56.788 --> 00:34:00.225
because the girls send
these long chatty texts

00:34:00.225 --> 00:34:02.892
and they get one word responses.

00:34:05.355 --> 00:34:08.605
It was rapport talk versus report talk.

00:34:09.604 --> 00:34:13.365
But this was a text message
that one of the women

00:34:13.365 --> 00:34:15.896
wrote a field note about.

00:34:15.896 --> 00:34:18.009
It was a message that had been received

00:34:18.009 --> 00:34:20.006
by a friend of hers

00:34:20.006 --> 00:34:22.073
from a boy that she liked,

00:34:22.073 --> 00:34:24.406
and the message said, "Hey."

00:34:26.926 --> 00:34:29.132
And now I'll read you what
the student wrote about it,

00:34:29.132 --> 00:34:32.383
she said, about the girl
who received the text,

00:34:32.383 --> 00:34:34.728
"She wondered, what did he mean, hey?

00:34:34.728 --> 00:34:36.841
Did he really mean just 'hey?'

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:39.279
Was he checking to see if she was busy?

00:34:39.279 --> 00:34:41.229
Was he actually interested in her

00:34:41.229 --> 00:34:42.599
like she was interested in him?

00:34:42.599 --> 00:34:43.993
Was he bored?

00:34:43.993 --> 00:34:45.548
How should she respond?

00:34:45.548 --> 00:34:46.663
Should she assume that there was

00:34:46.663 --> 00:34:48.358
something implied by his text?

00:34:48.358 --> 00:34:50.959
Address the frame of the conversation?

00:34:50.959 --> 00:34:55.579
Or just respond on the
message level he had set up?

00:34:55.579 --> 00:34:59.898
And she described how
all the group of friends

00:34:59.898 --> 00:35:02.648
spent about 10 minutes discussing

00:35:03.709 --> 00:35:07.376
what this young man
probably meant by "hey,"

00:35:08.635 --> 00:35:11.190
and how she should respond.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.791
And I was quite amused
reading this wondering,

00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:15.086
did the young man realize

00:35:15.086 --> 00:35:16.688
that whatever response he got

00:35:16.688 --> 00:35:20.188
had actually been composed by a committee?

00:35:21.773 --> 00:35:23.793
But I got a lot of examples like that.

00:35:23.793 --> 00:35:25.813
Girls spend a lot of time

00:35:25.813 --> 00:35:27.648
looking at each other's text messages,

00:35:27.648 --> 00:35:29.250
deciding what they mean,

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:33.197
talking about what would
be an appropriate response.

00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:34.823
Especially if it had to do with

00:35:34.823 --> 00:35:38.990
romantic relationships or
potential romantic relationships.

00:35:40.697 --> 00:35:41.928
The one thing they could not do

00:35:41.928 --> 00:35:44.761
is ask him what he meant by "hey."

00:35:46.897 --> 00:35:49.196
Because when something is indirect

00:35:49.196 --> 00:35:52.098
you can't make somebody
be direct about it.

00:35:52.098 --> 00:35:54.513
And here's a rather similar example

00:35:54.513 --> 00:35:56.487
that was written up in a field note

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.437
by a young man that a friend of his,

00:35:58.437 --> 00:36:01.409
again, there's a guy
that his friend liked,

00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:04.742
young woman, and this guy that she liked

00:36:05.873 --> 00:36:08.775
had put a link on a page of hers

00:36:08.775 --> 00:36:11.358
to a song with romantic lyrics.

00:36:13.001 --> 00:36:15.137
And she wondered, did this mean that he's

00:36:15.137 --> 00:36:17.111
trying to communicate that he has

00:36:17.111 --> 00:36:18.992
romantic feelings toward her?

00:36:18.992 --> 00:36:23.159
So she asked him, are you
trying to say something?

00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:27.698
And he replied, uh, no
I just like the song.

00:36:28.767 --> 00:36:29.812
I don't think that means

00:36:29.812 --> 00:36:32.320
he necessarily just liked the song.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.271
If he sent it as a song

00:36:34.271 --> 00:36:36.647
because he didn't feel
comfortable saying it outright,

00:36:36.647 --> 00:36:38.482
he wouldn't feel comfortable
saying it outright

00:36:38.482 --> 00:36:40.937
when she asks him either.

00:36:40.937 --> 00:36:44.844
So there's really no way to
know the answer to that one.

00:36:44.844 --> 00:36:46.914
Switching to the message
level doesn't work.

00:36:46.914 --> 00:36:49.143
Some communication you just have

00:36:49.143 --> 00:36:51.893
to read on the metamessage level.

00:36:53.787 --> 00:36:56.787
I want to talk now about some of the

00:36:58.175 --> 00:37:00.033
possibilities, capabilities,

00:37:00.033 --> 00:37:03.145
and opportunities for creativity

00:37:03.145 --> 00:37:05.884
when conversations are
held on these screens,

00:37:05.884 --> 00:37:08.230
but also some of the liabilities.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:09.785
And some of the liabilities are

00:37:09.785 --> 00:37:11.829
the same as the ones we have

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:13.268
in face to face conversation,

00:37:13.268 --> 00:37:16.435
and some are particular to the medium.

00:37:17.285 --> 00:37:18.535
And here's one.

00:37:19.909 --> 00:37:21.186
Have you ever gotten an email

00:37:21.186 --> 00:37:25.353
where your name is in a
cc line among other names?

00:37:26.295 --> 00:37:30.462
Do you ever pay attention to
where your name is in the list?

00:37:32.425 --> 00:37:35.188
Two women that I was interviewing
for my book about friends,

00:37:35.188 --> 00:37:36.326
and they were good friends and

00:37:36.326 --> 00:37:38.416
I was talking to them together,

00:37:38.416 --> 00:37:40.157
one of them made a comment about that.

00:37:40.157 --> 00:37:42.317
And this is what she said.

00:37:42.317 --> 00:37:43.733
She said, "you feel special

00:37:43.733 --> 00:37:45.962
when you're the first one on there.

00:37:45.962 --> 00:37:48.865
And you feel not special
when you're the last one.

00:37:48.865 --> 00:37:50.281
Because if you're dead last,

00:37:50.281 --> 00:37:51.883
it's like they were thinking,

00:37:51.883 --> 00:37:53.633
who am I forgetting?"

00:37:54.948 --> 00:37:56.411
And then we discussed, well you could

00:37:56.411 --> 00:37:58.083
try to correct for that by putting

00:37:58.083 --> 00:38:00.707
the names on the bcc line,

00:38:00.707 --> 00:38:04.050
so nobody can see what names are there.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:05.815
And she said, yeah but if you do that,

00:38:05.815 --> 00:38:06.930
it looks like you're inviting

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.693
all of Northwest Washington.

00:38:09.693 --> 00:38:11.225
'Cause if you're using bcc you

00:38:11.225 --> 00:38:14.221
must have so many names on there.

00:38:14.221 --> 00:38:16.729
One of the women made a very
interesting observation.

00:38:16.729 --> 00:38:19.040
She worked in a real estate firm

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.612
and she said she had
gotten a message at work,

00:38:21.612 --> 00:38:24.120
she was on the cc line,
her name was first,

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.162
she had this momentary
feeling of pleasure,

00:38:27.162 --> 00:38:28.880
isn't that nice, I'm first.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.108
She happened to be in the
office of another colleague,

00:38:32.108 --> 00:38:34.337
and saw the same message on her screen,

00:38:34.337 --> 00:38:39.120
and on her screen, the
recipient's name was first.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.860
And she realized that there was a program

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.089
that put first the name of whoever

00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:46.172
is receiving the message.

00:38:47.503 --> 00:38:49.848
But you don't know that
that's what they're doing

00:38:49.848 --> 00:38:51.705
so you would overinterpret,

00:38:51.705 --> 00:38:53.284
and think that it means that the person

00:38:53.284 --> 00:38:56.117
who wrote it thought of you first.

00:38:56.953 --> 00:39:00.390
Another liability of
communications on screen,

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.390
it's a kind of enforced overhearing.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.868
It's a little bit like
you're in a bathroom,

00:39:06.868 --> 00:39:10.537
you're behind the door in a
stall with the door closed,

00:39:10.537 --> 00:39:13.741
and there are people sitting
outside, talking outside,

00:39:13.741 --> 00:39:16.969
and they're talking about you.

00:39:16.969 --> 00:39:18.501
'Cause they don't know you're there

00:39:18.501 --> 00:39:19.778
and they don't know you're hearing them.

00:39:19.778 --> 00:39:21.543
It's a kind of enforced overhearing

00:39:21.543 --> 00:39:24.210
and it can be pretty unsettling.

00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:29.763
There are situations
using email or texting

00:39:29.763 --> 00:39:33.513
and all these other
multiple recipient media,

00:39:34.755 --> 00:39:36.799
where you end up overhearing things

00:39:36.799 --> 00:39:38.958
that were really not intended for you.

00:39:38.958 --> 00:39:41.744
And it can happen a lot of different ways.

00:39:41.744 --> 00:39:44.624
Sometimes it's using "reply all,"

00:39:44.624 --> 00:39:48.362
and losing track of who
is on that reply all list,

00:39:48.362 --> 00:39:50.591
and saying things you think
you're saying to one person

00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:53.703
but you're actually
overheard by many more.

00:39:53.703 --> 00:39:56.396
Sometimes it's forwarding things

00:39:56.396 --> 00:40:01.226
without remembering what's
down further on that thread,

00:40:01.226 --> 00:40:02.550
and the person you forwarded to

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.872
sees things you don't
think they should see.

00:40:04.872 --> 00:40:07.472
Or simply sending it to the wrong person.

00:40:07.472 --> 00:40:10.932
I think we've probably
done all of those things.

00:40:10.932 --> 00:40:14.229
But enforced overhearing
can be used strategically,

00:40:14.229 --> 00:40:17.550
and I was very intrigued by this example

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.779
that a student of mine explained.

00:40:19.779 --> 00:40:22.774
She said she had gone to a high school

00:40:22.774 --> 00:40:25.375
that was highly competitive,

00:40:25.375 --> 00:40:28.022
and all her friends, her group of women

00:40:28.022 --> 00:40:29.833
friends in this high school

00:40:29.833 --> 00:40:33.333
knew which colleges others had applied to.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:37.519
And when they got into a college,

00:40:37.519 --> 00:40:39.260
and it was their first choice college

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.607
and they were gonna go,

00:40:40.607 --> 00:40:45.065
they put their status,
what their plans are,

00:40:45.065 --> 00:40:46.319
but it let people know they had

00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:47.805
gotten into this good college.

00:40:47.805 --> 00:40:49.055
So for example,

00:40:49.988 --> 00:40:52.488
"GEORGETOWN CLASS OF 2019!!!!"

00:40:53.517 --> 00:40:56.025
This is also announcing to the friends

00:40:56.025 --> 00:40:58.719
that she got into Georgetown.

00:40:58.719 --> 00:41:01.482
Now the student wrote in her field note,

00:41:01.482 --> 00:41:03.149
she faced a dilemma.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.962
She had applied to a number
of competitive colleges,

00:41:06.962 --> 00:41:09.237
she had gotten into all of them,

00:41:09.237 --> 00:41:10.979
which she was rather proud of,

00:41:10.979 --> 00:41:13.835
but she hadn't decided which one to go to.

00:41:13.835 --> 00:41:16.737
Now she would have liked
to let her friends know,

00:41:16.737 --> 00:41:18.990
but she didn't feel she could.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:22.635
For example, you can't
put a status like this,

00:41:22.635 --> 00:41:25.723
"ACCEPTED AT GEORGETOWN!" That's boasting.

00:41:25.723 --> 00:41:27.418
You can't do that, that's not,

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:28.881
would not have been okay.

00:41:28.881 --> 00:41:30.530
But if she didn't do anything,

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:33.525
all her friends knew that the colleges

00:41:33.525 --> 00:41:35.220
had sent out their acceptances,

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.823
so if she didn't post any,

00:41:36.823 --> 00:41:39.702
they would all think she
didn't get in anywhere.

00:41:39.702 --> 00:41:41.629
So how did she solve it?

00:41:41.629 --> 00:41:44.671
She had her sister post this message.

00:41:44.671 --> 00:41:48.827
"Congrats on UVA acceptance!
So proud of you!"

00:41:48.827 --> 00:41:52.775
She wasn't boasting, it was
her sister who put it up there.

00:41:52.775 --> 00:41:54.934
But her friends could overhear

00:41:54.934 --> 00:41:57.140
from her sister's congratulations

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.390
that she had been accepted.

00:42:00.414 --> 00:42:01.923
So I was intrigued by that.

00:42:01.923 --> 00:42:06.265
Creative use of the affordances
of these social media,

00:42:06.265 --> 00:42:09.168
in ways that they perhaps were not

00:42:09.168 --> 00:42:11.118
intended to be used but

00:42:11.118 --> 00:42:13.868
had turned out to be very useful.

00:42:15.597 --> 00:42:18.151
I want to say something now about the,

00:42:18.151 --> 00:42:19.660
something I referred to in the beginning,

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.160
a sense of scorn and criticism

00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:25.953
that I sometimes perceive,

00:42:25.953 --> 00:42:28.879
especially among older people
but also some younger people,

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:31.688
toward the use of social media.

00:42:31.688 --> 00:42:33.685
There was one woman
that I was interviewing,

00:42:33.685 --> 00:42:36.982
she was in her 80s, and she said,

00:42:36.982 --> 00:42:38.167
she was talking about this,

00:42:38.167 --> 00:42:41.882
how destructive she thought
all this social media are,

00:42:41.882 --> 00:42:43.066
and she said,

00:42:43.066 --> 00:42:46.108
"All that stuff out there
that nobody needs to know.

00:42:46.108 --> 00:42:48.894
I don't care what
somebody had for dinner."

00:42:48.894 --> 00:42:51.959
And I was intrigued by that because

00:42:51.959 --> 00:42:54.328
what I was hearing from women friends

00:42:54.328 --> 00:42:57.161
was how much they appreciated a friend

00:42:57.161 --> 00:43:01.108
to whom they could say
what they had for dinner.

00:43:01.108 --> 00:43:02.873
In fact last night I quoted someone

00:43:02.873 --> 00:43:04.777
who said about someone,
"she's not that good a friend,

00:43:04.777 --> 00:43:08.353
I wouldn't tell her
what I had for dinner."

00:43:08.353 --> 00:43:10.280
It's that end of the day conversation

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.580
where you know somebody cares

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.391
about the details of your life,

00:43:13.391 --> 00:43:14.993
and that's a positive thing.

00:43:14.993 --> 00:43:17.037
I think a lot of what
we see on social media

00:43:17.037 --> 00:43:20.954
are things that we would
do with close friends,

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:25.837
but it's now possible to do
to a larger number of people.

00:43:25.837 --> 00:43:28.229
And I think that's what
results in a feeling

00:43:28.229 --> 00:43:30.365
that it's insincere.

00:43:30.365 --> 00:43:32.734
And I don't think it necessarily is,

00:43:32.734 --> 00:43:35.961
quote, insincere, but it's rather,

00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:38.121
using more widely something that you may

00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:41.162
have expected to be used more narrowly.

00:43:41.162 --> 00:43:45.226
So sending pictures of
food would be one example.

00:43:45.226 --> 00:43:46.758
It's kind of a feeling that people

00:43:46.758 --> 00:43:49.289
are with you when they're not with you.

00:43:49.289 --> 00:43:51.681
There's a phrase that is sometimes used,

00:43:51.681 --> 00:43:53.631
it's "absent presence,"

00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:55.675
a sense of presence of people
who are not physically there.

00:43:55.675 --> 00:43:58.258
So the ability to send pictures

00:43:59.158 --> 00:44:02.246
or send texts telling what you're up to

00:44:02.246 --> 00:44:06.124
gives a sense of connection
to people who aren't there.

00:44:06.124 --> 00:44:08.005
Maybe in the past if they were there

00:44:08.005 --> 00:44:10.698
you would elbow them and
say, hey look at that,

00:44:10.698 --> 00:44:12.927
so now they're not
there, you take a picture

00:44:12.927 --> 00:44:16.224
and it's like saying, hey look at that.

00:44:16.224 --> 00:44:18.268
A woman that I interviewed, and again,

00:44:18.268 --> 00:44:23.047
I'll mention she was a
physician, professional woman,

00:44:23.047 --> 00:44:25.346
told me that she's busy
now, she has kids at home,

00:44:25.346 --> 00:44:27.830
she doesn't have time to shop with friends

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.617
that she used to really
enjoy shopping with.

00:44:30.617 --> 00:44:31.824
So what she will do is,

00:44:31.824 --> 00:44:34.123
if she sees something online,

00:44:34.123 --> 00:44:35.841
she'll take a picture of it,

00:44:35.841 --> 00:44:37.954
send the link to her friend

00:44:37.954 --> 00:44:41.371
and ask the question, frumpy or fabulous.

00:44:43.643 --> 00:44:45.338
And she said, I'll imply that

00:44:45.338 --> 00:44:48.867
I'm thinking of buying it
and I need her opinion.

00:44:48.867 --> 00:44:51.143
Is it frumpy or fabulous?

00:44:51.143 --> 00:44:53.140
If we were shopping together,
that's what you would do.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.231
You'd get her opinion about

00:44:54.231 --> 00:44:55.950
something you're considering buying.

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.875
And then she said, I know
I'm not gonna buy it,

00:44:58.875 --> 00:45:02.149
but by sending it I tell
her I'm thinking of her.

00:45:02.149 --> 00:45:05.005
It's a way of saying,
we're still connected

00:45:05.005 --> 00:45:07.490
even though we don't have
time to see each other.

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.973
So I think this ability to create

00:45:10.973 --> 00:45:13.086
more connection over social media

00:45:13.086 --> 00:45:18.078
is really a very powerful
and very positive thing.

00:45:18.078 --> 00:45:21.166
However, it also has a downside,

00:45:21.166 --> 00:45:23.442
and here's one of the downsides.

00:45:23.442 --> 00:45:25.810
I mentioned last night,

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:28.272
there's a common expression, F-O-M-O,

00:45:28.272 --> 00:45:30.439
FOMO, fear of missing out,

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.961
which explains why we're
always checking our phones,

00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:35.934
make sure we don't miss
something important

00:45:35.934 --> 00:45:37.536
that we should know about.

00:45:37.536 --> 00:45:41.577
And I devised the
acronym FOBLO, F-O-B-L-O,

00:45:41.577 --> 00:45:44.224
fear of being left out.

00:45:44.224 --> 00:45:45.687
Which is worse.

00:45:45.687 --> 00:45:47.962
And as I said last night,

00:45:47.962 --> 00:45:49.379
with FOMO you miss the party

00:45:49.379 --> 00:45:51.515
'cause you didn't check
your phone in time,

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:54.905
with FOBLO you miss the party
because you weren't invited.

00:45:54.905 --> 00:45:56.577
And that hurts.

00:45:56.577 --> 00:45:58.922
When you think about it,

00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:01.685
every single person that you know

00:46:01.685 --> 00:46:05.852
is doing something without
you when you're not there.

00:46:08.837 --> 00:46:10.636
But you don't have to know that.

00:46:10.636 --> 00:46:13.144
And you don't have to think about it.

00:46:13.144 --> 00:46:15.698
But if they're constantly posting pictures

00:46:15.698 --> 00:46:17.672
of where they are and what they're doing,

00:46:17.672 --> 00:46:19.762
you have to think about it.

00:46:19.762 --> 00:46:21.875
And it's very intriguing to me,

00:46:21.875 --> 00:46:26.042
I often talk about how things
have more than one meaning

00:46:27.217 --> 00:46:29.562
and can have different
meanings to different people.

00:46:29.562 --> 00:46:32.186
So a student of mine wrote a field note.

00:46:32.186 --> 00:46:33.695
She was one of three sisters,

00:46:33.695 --> 00:46:35.599
the sisters were very close,

00:46:35.599 --> 00:46:37.410
and she had all these examples of how

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:39.965
if two of the sisters were together,

00:46:39.965 --> 00:46:43.006
they would take a picture
and send it to the third one

00:46:43.006 --> 00:46:45.700
so she would feel included.

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.533
And I thought, I don't wanna see pictures

00:46:48.533 --> 00:46:51.644
of what my two sisters are
doing when I'm not there.

00:46:51.644 --> 00:46:54.152
Because it's gonna make me feel left out.

00:46:54.152 --> 00:46:55.917
So I think different people react

00:46:55.917 --> 00:46:58.378
differently to these things.

00:46:58.378 --> 00:47:01.211
But putting these pictures
up without being asked

00:47:01.211 --> 00:47:05.321
means you're subjected to
seeing what everybody's doing,

00:47:05.321 --> 00:47:08.904
and there is that risk
of feeling left out.

00:47:10.081 --> 00:47:13.007
Another dilemma that exists

00:47:13.007 --> 00:47:15.212
in face to face communication as well

00:47:15.212 --> 00:47:18.231
is the question, what's
real and what's fake.

00:47:18.231 --> 00:47:22.225
And I know the issue of fake
news is very current now.

00:47:22.225 --> 00:47:23.363
But when you think about it,

00:47:23.363 --> 00:47:25.197
this has always been
an issue in our lives.

00:47:25.197 --> 00:47:27.496
People tell you things, is it true or not?

00:47:27.496 --> 00:47:29.818
They could be mistaken,
they could be intentionally

00:47:29.818 --> 00:47:32.568
saying something that's not true.

00:47:33.533 --> 00:47:34.949
When you see things online,

00:47:34.949 --> 00:47:36.748
what's true and what's not?

00:47:36.748 --> 00:47:40.965
And I think it makes it
particularly challenging.

00:47:40.965 --> 00:47:43.124
There's a phrase that
people sometimes use,

00:47:43.124 --> 00:47:45.655
that again, my students told me about.

00:47:45.655 --> 00:47:47.738
"No pics, didn't happen."

00:47:49.185 --> 00:47:51.298
Which they say to each other to mean,

00:47:51.298 --> 00:47:52.760
send us a picture,

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.479
if you really want me
to believe it happened,

00:47:54.479 --> 00:47:55.979
send me a picture.

00:47:57.242 --> 00:48:00.825
But what's really
interesting about that is

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:04.881
sometimes a picture can be deceiving.

00:48:04.881 --> 00:48:06.205
Just because it's a picture

00:48:06.205 --> 00:48:08.898
doesn't mean that it really happened.

00:48:08.898 --> 00:48:11.661
This is something one
young woman I interviewed

00:48:11.661 --> 00:48:14.100
for the book about
friends commented to me.

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.095
She said, "I'll get a phone
call from one of my friends

00:48:17.095 --> 00:48:19.138
saying she had a terrible
time at this party,

00:48:19.138 --> 00:48:21.832
and she wishes she hadn't gone.

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:24.293
Then I'll get off the
phone and check Instagram

00:48:24.293 --> 00:48:26.615
and I'll see a picture of her smiling

00:48:26.615 --> 00:48:28.844
and having fun at the party,

00:48:28.844 --> 00:48:31.491
which if I didn't just have
that conversation with her,

00:48:31.491 --> 00:48:35.973
I would think I was missing
the party of the century."

00:48:35.973 --> 00:48:37.807
So when you think about it,

00:48:37.807 --> 00:48:40.361
the pictures that people put up are often

00:48:40.361 --> 00:48:43.659
always cheerful, always smiling,

00:48:43.659 --> 00:48:46.700
always acting like they're
having a great time.

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.721
And they may not be having a great time.

00:48:48.721 --> 00:48:49.765
But when you see them there,

00:48:49.765 --> 00:48:53.224
you think they are, and
you might feel left out.

00:48:53.224 --> 00:48:55.542
Another young woman told me that

00:48:55.542 --> 00:48:57.353
she put up a picture
of herself at a party,

00:48:57.353 --> 00:48:59.118
her boyfriend got angry at her

00:48:59.118 --> 00:49:01.509
because there was a guy behind her

00:49:01.509 --> 00:49:03.759
that he really didn't like.

00:49:04.853 --> 00:49:07.523
And she said she hadn't even
talked to the guy at the party.

00:49:07.523 --> 00:49:09.451
But he was there in the picture,

00:49:09.451 --> 00:49:12.098
so her boyfriend got the wrong impression.

00:49:12.098 --> 00:49:15.848
So pictures can be
actually quite misleading.

00:49:17.972 --> 00:49:20.852
Another liability with
conversations over social media

00:49:20.852 --> 00:49:24.195
is that norms are changing so quickly.

00:49:24.195 --> 00:49:26.703
And things that some people
think are quite appropriate

00:49:26.703 --> 00:49:29.188
others think are not appropriate at all.

00:49:29.188 --> 00:49:33.355
Do any of you sign off
messages with "X"s and "O"s?

00:49:35.155 --> 00:49:36.455
A friend of mine was telling me

00:49:36.455 --> 00:49:37.802
how much she hates that.

00:49:37.802 --> 00:49:39.033
She thinks it's terrible, it's not,

00:49:39.033 --> 00:49:41.889
she said, oh it doesn't mean anything,

00:49:41.889 --> 00:49:44.141
it's just keys to hit.

00:49:44.141 --> 00:49:46.277
And I said, why is that just keys to hit,

00:49:46.277 --> 00:49:48.901
and the word love is not just keys to hit?

00:49:48.901 --> 00:49:52.895
Just assumptions that she
has in connection with that.

00:49:52.895 --> 00:49:55.635
And when she said that I
started feeling really nervous.

00:49:55.635 --> 00:49:57.957
'Cause I use XOXO sometimes.

00:49:57.957 --> 00:50:00.707
And it's really difficult to know

00:50:01.626 --> 00:50:02.837
what is gonna be approved of

00:50:02.837 --> 00:50:07.528
and what is not gonna be
approved of by other people.

00:50:07.528 --> 00:50:09.873
Two friends, actually quite close friends,

00:50:09.873 --> 00:50:12.729
were telling me that they

00:50:12.729 --> 00:50:15.028
had been really good
friends in high school,

00:50:15.028 --> 00:50:17.373
they went to college together

00:50:17.373 --> 00:50:19.138
and they're now living
in different cities,

00:50:19.138 --> 00:50:22.899
and one of them was really
pretty upset with the other.

00:50:22.899 --> 00:50:26.568
Because she was texting things
that were bothering her,

00:50:26.568 --> 00:50:28.820
really intimate things that she would

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.096
have talked to her friend about.

00:50:31.096 --> 00:50:33.673
And she was getting
very minimal responses.

00:50:33.673 --> 00:50:35.670
Well they talked about
it, and the friend said

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:38.085
she really didn't think
texting was appropriate

00:50:38.085 --> 00:50:40.709
for those kinds of interchanges.

00:50:40.709 --> 00:50:44.424
So good friends, same age,
but different assumptions

00:50:44.424 --> 00:50:46.885
about what's appropriate
and what's not appropriate

00:50:46.885 --> 00:50:48.718
over particular media.

00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:52.714
I have two sisters, as I just mentioned.

00:50:52.714 --> 00:50:56.127
One is very comfortable
talking about personal things,

00:50:56.127 --> 00:50:57.961
the other is less so.

00:50:57.961 --> 00:51:01.746
One time I was talking to
that sister on the phone,

00:51:01.746 --> 00:51:03.604
and we had a nice
conversation and we hung up,

00:51:03.604 --> 00:51:04.951
and then I opened email

00:51:04.951 --> 00:51:07.365
and she told me about
something really significant

00:51:07.365 --> 00:51:09.455
that had been going on in her life.

00:51:09.455 --> 00:51:11.870
So I answered on email,

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:14.540
we just talked on the phone,
why didn't you mention it?

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:18.290
And she said, the
telephone is so impersonal.

00:51:22.533 --> 00:51:25.663
And at first this sounded illogical to me.

00:51:25.663 --> 00:51:29.096
Isn't email impersonal?
Isn't the phone personal?

00:51:29.096 --> 00:51:29.984
You hear the voice.

00:51:29.984 --> 00:51:33.205
But we talked about it, and she explained,

00:51:33.205 --> 00:51:34.830
when you're writing email,

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:37.268
it's like you're writing in a journal.

00:51:37.268 --> 00:51:39.962
It's just you and the
screen and your thoughts.

00:51:39.962 --> 00:51:42.260
And many people find it easier to express

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:46.138
that way something
intimate than they would

00:51:46.138 --> 00:51:48.298
with a person facing them.

00:51:48.298 --> 00:51:51.177
That person facing you sort
of makes you uncomfortable.

00:51:51.177 --> 00:51:53.151
It's like they're bearing down on you.

00:51:53.151 --> 00:51:56.610
And there are many examples of that.

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:58.932
The whole question about whether

00:51:58.932 --> 00:52:03.182
using social media is more
intimate or less intimate.

00:52:03.182 --> 00:52:05.527
Here's a cartoon from the New Yorker

00:52:05.527 --> 00:52:09.637
that shows the view that
it is less intimate.

00:52:09.637 --> 00:52:11.285
So two guys at a bar,

00:52:11.285 --> 00:52:13.143
and one says to the other,

00:52:13.143 --> 00:52:16.231
"I used to call people, and
then I got into emailing,

00:52:16.231 --> 00:52:20.398
and then texting, and now
I just ignore everyone."

00:52:22.919 --> 00:52:26.355
So clearly he thinks using social media

00:52:26.355 --> 00:52:28.840
is less personal, you
get further and further

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.395
away from people until you might as well

00:52:30.395 --> 00:52:32.717
just write them off entirely.

00:52:32.717 --> 00:52:35.225
But my students gave
me many examples of how

00:52:35.225 --> 00:52:37.594
people could say things through texting

00:52:37.594 --> 00:52:40.241
that they wouldn't say
that were more intimate.

00:52:40.241 --> 00:52:41.912
For example, a young man whose mother

00:52:41.912 --> 00:52:43.793
was born in the Philippines.

00:52:43.793 --> 00:52:46.324
And he said his mother
never said, I miss you.

00:52:46.324 --> 00:52:48.553
She would say dad misses you,

00:52:48.553 --> 00:52:50.318
she would say we miss you.

00:52:50.318 --> 00:52:52.245
But then they started texting,

00:52:52.245 --> 00:52:54.531
and she would write, I miss you.

00:52:54.531 --> 00:52:56.605
And he was very touched by that.

00:52:56.605 --> 00:53:01.063
And it was more intimate
given social media.

00:53:01.063 --> 00:53:02.596
Here's another one.

00:53:02.596 --> 00:53:04.755
I think many people feel quite strongly

00:53:04.755 --> 00:53:09.190
that condolence notes should
not be written on email.

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:12.302
That is something that really
requires handwritten notes.

00:53:12.302 --> 00:53:14.484
And when Robin said, have any of you

00:53:14.484 --> 00:53:15.692
recently written something,

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:18.037
I wouldn't be surprised if
it was a condolence note.

00:53:18.037 --> 00:53:20.406
That is something that people do write.

00:53:20.406 --> 00:53:23.424
And yet, one woman that I talked to

00:53:23.424 --> 00:53:25.746
commented that she appreciated

00:53:25.746 --> 00:53:29.918
condolence notes she
got by email even more.

00:53:29.918 --> 00:53:31.404
What she said is,

00:53:31.404 --> 00:53:33.703
"They're wonderfully comforting.

00:53:33.703 --> 00:53:36.234
I feel no obligation to respond,

00:53:36.234 --> 00:53:40.646
and in general, they're more
feeling and less stilted

00:53:40.646 --> 00:53:43.363
than what people write on cards."

00:53:43.363 --> 00:53:45.360
Another example about how

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.915
using social media can actually

00:53:46.915 --> 00:53:49.748
be more intimate rather than less.

00:53:51.977 --> 00:53:53.440
And some of you may know uses of things

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.295
like CaringBridge and
other, or group emails.

00:53:57.295 --> 00:53:59.129
And this is a way that I think

00:53:59.129 --> 00:54:02.612
social media can be extremely useful.

00:54:02.612 --> 00:54:05.143
Again, I talked yesterday about

00:54:05.143 --> 00:54:07.744
the requirement that
many women in particular

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:09.648
have that you have to tell friends

00:54:09.648 --> 00:54:11.482
what's going on, they need to know

00:54:11.482 --> 00:54:13.549
what's going on in your
life or they're gonna feel

00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:15.801
that you've let them down.

00:54:15.801 --> 00:54:17.960
Well if you're going through a crisis,

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.654
having to tell one person after another

00:54:20.654 --> 00:54:23.092
about what's going on
can really be exhausting.

00:54:23.092 --> 00:54:25.159
So if you can use social media,

00:54:25.159 --> 00:54:27.839
either group emails or CaringBridge,

00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:31.422
it is a much more
effective way to do that.

00:54:32.868 --> 00:54:36.391
But I wanna conclude with what I think is

00:54:36.391 --> 00:54:39.015
maybe the most significant, in my view,

00:54:39.015 --> 00:54:40.663
one of the most significant

00:54:40.663 --> 00:54:44.564
ways that social media and
communication over social media

00:54:44.564 --> 00:54:48.395
have changed our lives and our world.

00:54:48.395 --> 00:54:50.532
There's a way that I think it's a totally

00:54:50.532 --> 00:54:53.318
different way of being in the world.

00:54:53.318 --> 00:54:57.485
In the past, the default
situation is that you're alone.

00:55:00.377 --> 00:55:02.513
Unless there's a person in front of you,

00:55:02.513 --> 00:55:06.096
or someone comes in
your sphere physically,

00:55:07.366 --> 00:55:09.340
maybe calls on the phone,

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:12.614
maybe even you receive a letter.

00:55:12.614 --> 00:55:14.866
If it's not one of those things,

00:55:14.866 --> 00:55:17.490
you're basically alone.

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:18.906
I have increasingly perceived,

00:55:18.906 --> 00:55:20.764
especially from my students,

00:55:20.764 --> 00:55:23.086
but maybe all of us too,

00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:24.851
that they're never alone.

00:55:24.851 --> 00:55:29.146
They are always in an open
state of communication.

00:55:29.146 --> 00:55:31.840
If they are not available for texting,

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.208
they need to let their friends know

00:55:34.208 --> 00:55:36.043
I'm not gonna be available,

00:55:36.043 --> 00:55:39.294
because the default case
is you are available.

00:55:39.294 --> 00:55:43.032
Your friends can get
through to you at any time.

00:55:43.032 --> 00:55:45.749
Again, this sense of absent presence.

00:55:45.749 --> 00:55:47.513
And I think that's a very different way

00:55:47.513 --> 00:55:49.092
of being in the world.

00:55:49.092 --> 00:55:51.902
Being alone can have
very different meanings.

00:55:51.902 --> 00:55:53.829
It can be lonely.

00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:55.037
And I think that's one of

00:55:55.037 --> 00:55:56.987
the wonderful things about social media.

00:55:56.987 --> 00:55:59.054
I think there's a lot less loneliness.

00:55:59.054 --> 00:56:00.795
Because you can be in communication

00:56:00.795 --> 00:56:03.512
with people who aren't there.

00:56:03.512 --> 00:56:06.693
But what you have less of us solitude.

00:56:06.693 --> 00:56:09.456
And solitude can be a very positive thing.

00:56:09.456 --> 00:56:14.263
So soul-searing loneliness
or soul-salving solitude.

00:56:14.263 --> 00:56:18.396
And we have to work harder
to get the solitude,

00:56:18.396 --> 00:56:20.718
whereas in the past, we had to work harder

00:56:20.718 --> 00:56:24.642
to get the sense that we're
in communication with people.

00:56:24.642 --> 00:56:26.128
So that is what I think is really

00:56:26.128 --> 00:56:28.545
one of the major differences.

00:56:29.565 --> 00:56:30.656
So I'm gonna end, I just
have one more example

00:56:30.656 --> 00:56:33.025
that I'm gonna end with.

00:56:33.025 --> 00:56:35.439
And it's another example of how

00:56:35.439 --> 00:56:39.271
some of the liabilities
of these social media

00:56:39.271 --> 00:56:42.771
are actually built into the medium itself.

00:56:43.868 --> 00:56:46.655
Again, an example brought in by a student.

00:56:46.655 --> 00:56:48.396
This was a texting exchange

00:56:48.396 --> 00:56:50.393
between his 13 year old brother

00:56:50.393 --> 00:56:54.560
and one of their cousins,
also a 13 year old, a girl.

00:56:55.943 --> 00:56:58.706
And this is how it went.

00:56:58.706 --> 00:57:02.328
She sent him a message, "hi wats up?"

00:57:02.328 --> 00:57:03.745
And he sent her a message,

00:57:03.745 --> 00:57:07.328
"nothing much. Wats up
with u? saints suck"

00:57:11.454 --> 00:57:13.474
"oh, ur upset about the football game"

00:57:13.474 --> 00:57:15.146
They lived in New Orleans so,

00:57:15.146 --> 00:57:17.142
you know, the New Orleans Saints.

00:57:17.142 --> 00:57:19.070
"oh, ur upset about the football game"

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:21.070
"yeah I am, saints suck"

00:57:23.551 --> 00:57:25.943
"u already said that"

00:57:25.943 --> 00:57:28.276
"wat do u mean? saints suck"

00:57:31.725 --> 00:57:34.697
Are you beginning to
figure out what's going on?

00:57:34.697 --> 00:57:36.694
"u said it again"

00:57:36.694 --> 00:57:40.548
"wat are u talking about? saints suck"

00:57:40.548 --> 00:57:42.298
"oh its ur signature"

00:57:44.472 --> 00:57:46.446
Many of us have signatures on our email,

00:57:46.446 --> 00:57:48.791
he apparently had a program that

00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:52.739
put a signature on his
texting, and he forgot.

00:57:52.739 --> 00:57:55.406
"wats my signature? saints suck"

00:57:58.102 --> 00:58:00.587
"nev mind. g2g moms here"

00:58:00.587 --> 00:58:02.087
"bye, saints suck"

00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:10.246
So I'll end with that because

00:58:10.246 --> 00:58:13.822
it encapsulates, I think, in
a somewhat simplified way,

00:58:13.822 --> 00:58:17.822
but, we do have a whole
extra set of liabilities

00:58:19.039 --> 00:58:21.059
that we have to be attuned to,

00:58:21.059 --> 00:58:23.200
where metamessages that get sent

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.033
might not be the ones we intended,

00:58:26.033 --> 00:58:30.630
and we might be missing
metamessages that are intended.

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:33.130
So I'll stop there, thank you.

00:58:44.005 --> 00:58:45.282
I think we have time for questions.

00:58:45.282 --> 00:58:46.815
- [Robin] We have time for questions.

00:58:46.815 --> 00:58:48.254
If people will come up to the mic

00:58:48.254 --> 00:58:50.754
and ask their questions there.

00:58:52.527 --> 00:58:55.615
- I relate to everything
that you're saying

00:58:55.615 --> 00:58:58.718
about younger people, and I work in,

00:58:58.718 --> 00:59:02.008
happen to be an architectural firm,

00:59:02.008 --> 00:59:05.425
but I'm curious of how it translates from

00:59:06.692 --> 00:59:10.048
getting out of school, going
into the business world

00:59:10.048 --> 00:59:13.131
and how do you relate that difference

00:59:14.034 --> 00:59:15.915
for business communications

00:59:15.915 --> 00:59:19.537
that's now broader, more generations

00:59:19.537 --> 00:59:23.229
sort of across the line,
and what that means.

00:59:23.229 --> 00:59:26.341
Or the misunderstandings
that now can occur,

00:59:26.341 --> 00:59:29.777
as well as being inappropriate in a way.

00:59:29.777 --> 00:59:31.194
- Yes, I do have a lot to say about that.

00:59:31.194 --> 00:59:34.027
Yes, I have heard a
lot about the confusion

00:59:34.027 --> 00:59:36.256
that people confront,

00:59:36.256 --> 00:59:39.599
again because there are
such different assumptions

00:59:39.599 --> 00:59:42.525
about what's appropriate
and how you use it.

00:59:42.525 --> 00:59:43.872
And so many people ask me,

00:59:43.872 --> 00:59:45.474
I often get asked advice and I say

00:59:45.474 --> 00:59:47.517
I don't give tips, I don't know,

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:49.909
but I get asked, is it appropriate

00:59:49.909 --> 00:59:52.277
to use smiley faces in the workplace?

00:59:52.277 --> 00:59:53.276
Is it appropriate to use

00:59:53.276 --> 00:59:55.946
exclamation points in the workplace?

00:59:55.946 --> 00:59:58.059
Some people think it is,
some people think it isn't.

00:59:58.059 --> 00:59:59.777
And I'll give you one example

00:59:59.777 --> 01:00:02.935
that I think is pretty chastening.

01:00:02.935 --> 01:00:06.873
I've written a lot about
what I call the double bind,

01:00:06.873 --> 01:00:11.784
that women in positions of
authority face a double bind,

01:00:11.784 --> 01:00:16.102
that is, two requirements,
either of which,

01:00:16.102 --> 01:00:19.075
both of which they have to fulfill,

01:00:19.075 --> 01:00:22.581
but anything they do to
fulfill one violates the other.

01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:24.949
And this is something that
Robin Lakoff wrote about

01:00:24.949 --> 01:00:26.532
years before I did.

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:29.872
But in the workplace,

01:00:29.872 --> 01:00:33.703
and I wrote about this in a
book I wrote about the workplace

01:00:33.703 --> 01:00:37.395
called Talking From Nine to
Five: Women and Men at Work.

01:00:37.395 --> 01:00:39.973
I looked at women in the
highest positions of authority

01:00:39.973 --> 01:00:42.898
in the workplaces where I did my research,

01:00:42.898 --> 01:00:44.454
and if they were using language

01:00:44.454 --> 01:00:46.079
in a way that was authoritative,

01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:48.053
they were often not liked.

01:00:48.053 --> 01:00:49.493
If they were using language in a way

01:00:49.493 --> 01:00:51.699
that you expected of women,

01:00:51.699 --> 01:00:55.089
they were often underestimated.

01:00:55.089 --> 01:00:58.272
A woman that I interviewed,
actually for the friends book,

01:00:58.272 --> 01:00:59.895
happened in the course of our discussion

01:00:59.895 --> 01:01:02.124
to give me this example.

01:01:02.124 --> 01:01:04.284
She, I dunno, a few years out of college,

01:01:04.284 --> 01:01:06.002
she's got a job, there's an intern

01:01:06.002 --> 01:01:09.415
assigned to her in the
workplace, young man.

01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.993
And she worked with him
and was training him,

01:01:11.993 --> 01:01:14.640
and they seemed to be
having a nice relationship.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.962
And after they'd been
working together a few months

01:01:16.962 --> 01:01:19.121
they had one of these
conversations we often have,

01:01:19.121 --> 01:01:22.070
what did you think of me when
you first met me, you know.

01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:25.948
And he said, I thought you were a bitch.

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:27.448
And she said, why?

01:01:28.943 --> 01:01:31.219
And he said, your emails.

01:01:31.219 --> 01:01:34.493
They were just right to the point.

01:01:34.493 --> 01:01:37.326
No exclamation points, no smileys.

01:01:38.557 --> 01:01:41.738
He had come to expect that from women.

01:01:41.738 --> 01:01:43.340
And because she hadn't done it,

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.010
And that's something I often say,

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:48.053
that women in the workplace know

01:01:48.053 --> 01:01:50.886
that one false move, and
there's this word bitch

01:01:50.886 --> 01:01:52.767
that's always hovering here,

01:01:52.767 --> 01:01:56.204
and one false move it's stuck on us.

01:01:56.204 --> 01:01:58.665
So her comment to me
was that she said to him

01:01:58.665 --> 01:02:01.266
welcome to the world of work.

01:02:01.266 --> 01:02:02.984
But I was thinking, it's also

01:02:02.984 --> 01:02:05.143
welcome to the world of work to her.

01:02:05.143 --> 01:02:08.232
The double bind that she was subjected to.

01:02:08.232 --> 01:02:12.399
So yes, this all presents new
challenged in the workplace.

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:14.919
- Have these sorts of communications,

01:02:14.919 --> 01:02:17.334
foibles and conundrums attended every

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:21.501
technological shift onto a
new communications platform?

01:02:23.348 --> 01:02:27.644
I'm thinking back as far as
the telegraph and morse code,

01:02:27.644 --> 01:02:29.083
would it have, you know,

01:02:29.083 --> 01:02:33.541
you wrote dot dot, did
you leave out a dash?

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:35.236
- I'm sorry, so your question is?

01:02:35.236 --> 01:02:37.837
- Just if these sorts of, scrutiny,

01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:39.764
clarifications around communication

01:02:39.764 --> 01:02:41.631
have attended every migration

01:02:41.631 --> 01:02:43.512
onto a new communications platform.

01:02:43.512 --> 01:02:44.812
- Absolutely, absolutely.

01:02:44.812 --> 01:02:46.438
And something I have to say,

01:02:46.438 --> 01:02:48.597
that Robin has written
about very eloquently,

01:02:48.597 --> 01:02:52.127
at every stage, there's a hue and cry,

01:02:52.127 --> 01:02:55.679
these new media destroying communications.

01:02:55.679 --> 01:02:57.839
And you know the details more than I do,

01:02:57.839 --> 01:03:02.006
but was it Aristotle that was
complaining about writing?

01:03:04.467 --> 01:03:06.059
Yeah I can't hear, but you wanna go

01:03:06.059 --> 01:03:08.559
to the microphone and tell us?

01:03:14.232 --> 01:03:16.252
- Socrates was kind of the last generation

01:03:16.252 --> 01:03:20.687
of Athenians who were not
expected to be literate.

01:03:20.687 --> 01:03:24.054
And he sort of glorified this into,

01:03:24.054 --> 01:03:28.280
you know, I teach people
things by talking.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.697
And so he had a kid of theory

01:03:31.577 --> 01:03:33.713
that he would articulate from time to time

01:03:33.713 --> 01:03:36.964
about how if you put something in writing,

01:03:36.964 --> 01:03:40.447
if you become dependent on writing,

01:03:40.447 --> 01:03:43.744
that is, you don't use
your memory anymore,

01:03:43.744 --> 01:03:46.995
you will not be Greek anymore,

01:03:46.995 --> 01:03:48.922
'cause you won't have
that thing in your head,

01:03:48.922 --> 01:03:52.103
you will have to go to
the library and get it.

01:03:52.103 --> 01:03:54.890
Or you'll have to go to Google and get it.

01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:57.307
So you know, he was, he felt,

01:03:58.164 --> 01:04:01.345
he professed, there's this Socratic irony,

01:04:01.345 --> 01:04:04.845
he professed to be frightened of literacy.

01:04:07.707 --> 01:04:09.704
I have a sneaky feeling in my mind

01:04:09.704 --> 01:04:12.026
that he knew perfectly
well how to read and write.

01:04:12.026 --> 01:04:16.905
This was just a bunch of
shtick, he was so good at.

01:04:16.905 --> 01:04:18.969
- Thank you, yeah, quite parallel.

01:04:18.969 --> 01:04:20.391
You know, kids are gonna be ruined

01:04:20.391 --> 01:04:21.658
because they're doing this,

01:04:21.658 --> 01:04:23.569
they should be talking face to face.

01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:25.590
And Socrates thinking,
you're all gonna be ruined

01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:28.655
'cause your writing, you
should use your heads.

01:04:28.655 --> 01:04:31.116
So yeah, I think there's
always this fear of the new.

01:04:31.116 --> 01:04:31.949
Yeah.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.153
- Thanks so much, I've
been such a fan of yours

01:04:37.153 --> 01:04:39.150
from your PhD thesis,

01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:42.447
and you've made an incredible difference

01:04:42.447 --> 01:04:45.697
in my life as a New Yorker living here.

01:04:47.969 --> 01:04:50.198
En expatriate New Yorker, now I don't get,

01:04:50.198 --> 01:04:54.122
I'm losing my sense of
sarcasm when I go to New York.

01:04:54.122 --> 01:04:56.862
But at any rate, you said that

01:04:56.862 --> 01:05:00.195
you could lecture a lot more on "ha ha."

01:05:02.435 --> 01:05:05.018
And I'm a little confused about

01:05:05.918 --> 01:05:09.418
"ha ha" and "lol" with my younger friends.

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:13.650
Yes, yeah, so I have my students bring in

01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:15.624
every instance they encounter

01:05:15.624 --> 01:05:17.946
of some variation of laughter.

01:05:17.946 --> 01:05:22.609
One thing is clear, lol
does not mean laughing.

01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:24.211
It can mean all kinds of other things,

01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:25.674
but it's not laughter.

01:05:25.674 --> 01:05:28.948
And various versions of ha, haha, hahaha,

01:05:28.948 --> 01:05:31.409
the number of "ha"s that you have,

01:05:31.409 --> 01:05:35.241
often just means, I don't
mean what I said literally.

01:05:35.241 --> 01:05:36.680
It doesn't mean I'm literally laughing.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.536
It means I don't mean it seriously,

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:42.036
don't take this at face value.

01:05:42.926 --> 01:05:44.343
And this has also gender differences.

01:05:44.343 --> 01:05:46.897
They brought in, in my class,

01:05:46.897 --> 01:05:48.522
this class is mostly women

01:05:48.522 --> 01:05:50.380
but I had a number of
young men in the class,

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.634
and they had written on the board

01:05:51.634 --> 01:05:54.467
all the things that mean laughter.

01:05:56.696 --> 01:05:59.134
And I said, are there
any others we've missed?

01:05:59.134 --> 01:06:01.247
And this young man got up and puts

01:06:01.247 --> 01:06:03.580
"lmao," laughing my ass off.

01:06:04.939 --> 01:06:08.561
And then all kinds of things
with the letter F in it.

01:06:08.561 --> 01:06:10.906
Which the girls didn't
use, but the guys did.

01:06:10.906 --> 01:06:12.416
So yeah, there were gender differences.

01:06:12.416 --> 01:06:14.389
But a lot of it, I think it basically

01:06:14.389 --> 01:06:17.989
comes down to, do I mean
what I say literally,

01:06:17.989 --> 01:06:19.521
or do I want you to realize

01:06:19.521 --> 01:06:22.168
that I'm saying it tongue in cheek.

01:06:22.168 --> 01:06:24.513
And that's the big challenge

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:27.021
with seeing things on the screen.

01:06:27.021 --> 01:06:29.552
Teasing, you can be insulted.

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:31.270
It can happen face to face too.

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:32.478
Somebody means it to be teasing

01:06:32.478 --> 01:06:35.380
and you take it literally
and you're offended.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.630
But it's a real risk there.

01:06:39.188 --> 01:06:42.787
- And equally so with
the lol and the hahaha.

01:06:42.787 --> 01:06:47.106
- Well the lol of course
was one of the first ones

01:06:47.106 --> 01:06:49.614
that was pointed out to
me as a gender difference.

01:06:49.614 --> 01:06:53.515
So you know, a young woman
rights about something

01:06:53.515 --> 01:06:55.326
terrible that's bothering her,

01:06:55.326 --> 01:06:57.834
and her mother rights
sympathy and then says lol.

01:06:57.834 --> 01:07:00.853
By which the mother meant lots of love.

01:07:00.853 --> 01:07:03.853
But you don't say laughing out loud,

01:07:05.172 --> 01:07:07.911
for the kids lol was laughing out loud.

01:07:07.911 --> 01:07:09.072
But I think it has morphed,

01:07:09.072 --> 01:07:11.232
and it isn't really
about laughter anymore.

01:07:11.232 --> 01:07:14.158
It's just one more way to signal,

01:07:14.158 --> 01:07:16.325
don't take this literally.

01:07:22.308 --> 01:07:25.234
- Thanks so much for
speaking, first of all.

01:07:25.234 --> 01:07:28.206
I guess a question I
have is, well I have two,

01:07:28.206 --> 01:07:31.248
but I'll just do the first
one first and then we'll see.

01:07:31.248 --> 01:07:35.415
So I did a project on speech
in people, well I guess,

01:07:37.215 --> 01:07:41.298
the corpus of Tinder
biographies of millennials.

01:07:42.257 --> 01:07:43.130
- Corpus of what?

01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:45.518
- Tinder biographies, like the dating app.

01:07:45.518 --> 01:07:47.422
And one of the biggest challenges I had

01:07:47.422 --> 01:07:49.929
was that there's so
much visual information

01:07:49.929 --> 01:07:52.925
in people's photographs and in emoji use.

01:07:52.925 --> 01:07:54.411
And so I guess I was wondering,

01:07:54.411 --> 01:07:56.129
you mentioned the use of

01:07:56.129 --> 01:08:00.216
sort of, emojis, emoticon, bitmoji, memes,

01:08:00.216 --> 01:08:03.049
and how do you compensate for that

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:05.719
or accommodate for that

01:08:05.719 --> 01:08:08.784
when so much of corpus
linguistics analysis

01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:11.547
is so like, quantitative,

01:08:11.547 --> 01:08:12.894
which is part of why I like it.

01:08:12.894 --> 01:08:15.912
Because it's quite easy
to sift through things,

01:08:15.912 --> 01:08:18.118
but when images come into play,

01:08:18.118 --> 01:08:21.091
it really kind of messes with my data.

01:08:21.091 --> 01:08:22.948
And so, I guess a question would be,

01:08:22.948 --> 01:08:25.526
how do you accommodate for
that in doing your work?

01:08:25.526 --> 01:08:28.289
- Yeah, corpus linguistics is a very very

01:08:28.289 --> 01:08:30.053
burgeoning field right now.

01:08:30.053 --> 01:08:32.735
And it's an amazing capability.

01:08:32.735 --> 01:08:35.313
You can get millions of words, data,

01:08:35.313 --> 01:08:37.147
and find answers that you know.

01:08:37.147 --> 01:08:39.260
I give you examples from a couple people,

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:40.862
you gotta take my word for it

01:08:40.862 --> 01:08:42.511
that this is more widespread.

01:08:42.511 --> 01:08:43.858
And I trust you.

01:08:43.858 --> 01:08:45.158
Does it ring true?

01:08:45.158 --> 01:08:47.201
If it rings true, maybe
there's something to it.

01:08:47.201 --> 01:08:48.920
If you say, I've never
seen anything like that,

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.149
maybe I got a weird example.

01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:53.285
So corpus linguistics is great that way.

01:08:53.285 --> 01:08:56.118
But I don't think it is capable of

01:08:57.325 --> 01:08:59.742
identifying these subtleties.

01:09:00.646 --> 01:09:02.178
So I think we need both.

01:09:02.178 --> 01:09:03.687
There are certain kinds of questions

01:09:03.687 --> 01:09:06.358
that can be addressed that
way and others that can't.

01:09:06.358 --> 01:09:08.633
I guess my concern is,

01:09:08.633 --> 01:09:11.907
there's a tendency to do
the things you can do.

01:09:11.907 --> 01:09:14.322
And that's my one concern, that

01:09:14.322 --> 01:09:17.759
as corpus linguistics
and computational methods

01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:19.547
become more and more widespread,

01:09:19.547 --> 01:09:21.079
we won't be asking the questions

01:09:21.079 --> 01:09:24.493
that have to be answered this way.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:27.952
Could call it a case study
method or microanalysis.

01:09:27.952 --> 01:09:30.089
But I think we need both.

01:09:30.089 --> 01:09:31.505
- And then I guess, perhaps this,

01:09:31.505 --> 01:09:33.804
you've just answered this potentially,

01:09:33.804 --> 01:09:35.568
but I guess, do you think that

01:09:35.568 --> 01:09:37.519
the changes you've seen like the one

01:09:37.519 --> 01:09:39.725
you just described with lol initially

01:09:39.725 --> 01:09:41.234
meaning I'm actually laughing

01:09:41.234 --> 01:09:42.952
to meaning just sort of, I'm amused,

01:09:42.952 --> 01:09:45.619
do you think there's any sort of

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:51.127
language change analyses
that can be applied

01:09:51.127 --> 01:09:54.656
to the corpus of text-based speech.

01:09:54.656 --> 01:09:55.655
- What a great question.

01:09:55.655 --> 01:09:57.988
Maybe you'll figure one out.

01:09:59.254 --> 01:10:02.110
You can ask questions
like, where does it appear?

01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:04.617
And this is something that has been done,

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:07.358
they tend to appear where punctuation

01:10:07.358 --> 01:10:09.604
would have appeared in the past.

01:10:09.604 --> 01:10:12.576
So in some ways, lol and hahaha

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:14.295
are just like punctuation.

01:10:14.295 --> 01:10:16.059
'Cause you don't put a period at the end,

01:10:16.059 --> 01:10:18.335
but you put haha at the
end or lol at the end.

01:10:18.335 --> 01:10:21.330
And it functions a bit like punctuation.

01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:25.881
So you can ask, computationally,
where does it appear?

01:10:25.881 --> 01:10:27.321
You could ask, I guess,

01:10:27.321 --> 01:10:30.131
what sorts of verbs does it appear after?

01:10:30.131 --> 01:10:32.824
You can ask questions like that.

01:10:32.824 --> 01:10:34.751
- Actually, I found something similar

01:10:34.751 --> 01:10:36.005
in my Tinder biography thing,

01:10:36.005 --> 01:10:38.954
I found that people used
emojis in place of a period.

01:10:38.954 --> 01:10:39.787
- Thank you.

01:10:39.787 --> 01:10:41.287
- Okay, thank you.

01:10:44.906 --> 01:10:48.073
- Thank you, this was quite wonderful.

01:10:49.434 --> 01:10:52.851
So, I'm thinking about intimacy, and what

01:10:54.055 --> 01:10:57.747
- Can you talk louder
and get the mic closer?

01:10:57.747 --> 01:11:00.301
- Thinking about intimacy.

01:11:00.301 --> 01:11:03.668
So I'm a therapist as
well as other things,

01:11:03.668 --> 01:11:05.618
and so I think a lot about that.

01:11:05.618 --> 01:11:08.591
And it's a theme in
what you were describing

01:11:08.591 --> 01:11:11.841
that is intriguingly deep and complex,

01:11:11.841 --> 01:11:14.326
about what represents intimacy.

01:11:14.326 --> 01:11:16.137
And as I was standing, waiting,

01:11:16.137 --> 01:11:18.088
I was reminded of Marshall McLuhan's

01:11:18.088 --> 01:11:20.784
cool and warm media, years ago.

01:11:20.784 --> 01:11:21.791
- What was the last thing you said?

01:11:21.791 --> 01:11:24.531
- Marshall McLuhan's cool
media and warm media.

01:11:24.531 --> 01:11:25.622
- Oh yes yes yes.

01:11:25.622 --> 01:11:28.385
- And these new technological ones

01:11:28.385 --> 01:11:31.009
seem to be cooler media.

01:11:31.009 --> 01:11:34.260
Not necessarily less intimate, different.

01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:37.766
So if we choose to be more available,

01:11:37.766 --> 01:11:40.529
which means texting, what does that mean?

01:11:40.529 --> 01:11:42.758
Does that mean I'm being more
available or less available?

01:11:42.758 --> 01:11:45.754
If I choose to do a phone
call because I can talk now

01:11:45.754 --> 01:11:48.285
but I can't do Facetime
because there's other stuff,

01:11:48.285 --> 01:11:50.746
is that being more
intimate or less intimate?

01:11:50.746 --> 01:11:52.487
And there's so much room,

01:11:52.487 --> 01:11:54.670
because there's less data,

01:11:54.670 --> 01:11:58.083
for misinterpretation on the one hand,

01:11:58.083 --> 01:12:01.334
or for, potentially for connection,

01:12:01.334 --> 01:12:03.447
because I'm more involved.

01:12:03.447 --> 01:12:05.096
Like the "hey."

01:12:05.096 --> 01:12:08.184
The recipient of hey has to spend

01:12:08.184 --> 01:12:10.970
much more time trying to understand

01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:13.548
who that person is and
what they're communicating

01:12:13.548 --> 01:12:16.009
that if it were going on in person.

01:12:16.009 --> 01:12:18.679
So for those of us of my generation

01:12:18.679 --> 01:12:22.882
it's interesting to think
about the subtleties of it.

01:12:22.882 --> 01:12:24.799
A, B, in doing therapy,

01:12:26.203 --> 01:12:29.291
I do have, as many of us probably have,

01:12:29.291 --> 01:12:31.938
the experience of someone talking to me

01:12:31.938 --> 01:12:33.494
about their relationship,

01:12:33.494 --> 01:12:35.769
and this terrible argument that they had

01:12:35.769 --> 01:12:37.418
with their boyfriend or girlfriend,

01:12:37.418 --> 01:12:39.183
where she said this and I said that,

01:12:39.183 --> 01:12:40.715
and I couldn't believe she said this

01:12:40.715 --> 01:12:41.923
and so I said that.

01:12:41.923 --> 01:12:43.594
And it takes me a while to get it,

01:12:43.594 --> 01:12:45.197
that this was all texting.

01:12:45.197 --> 01:12:46.845
- Yeah yeah yeah.

01:12:46.845 --> 01:12:48.178
- So, thank you.

01:12:49.841 --> 01:12:52.924
So any thoughts about the complexity

01:12:54.113 --> 01:12:56.530
of intimacy in the new world?

01:12:57.503 --> 01:12:59.848
- Yes yes, and all these observations

01:12:59.848 --> 01:13:02.217
are very significant and helpful.

01:13:02.217 --> 01:13:05.382
I guess the one thing I would say is that

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:08.344
there's no one answer,
that it can be done,

01:13:08.344 --> 01:13:09.877
kind of like what I said,

01:13:09.877 --> 01:13:12.524
it can be more intimate and
it can be less intimate.

01:13:12.524 --> 01:13:14.381
Yeah, it's a cool medium,

01:13:14.381 --> 01:13:16.262
but Marshall McLuhan was
thinking of television.

01:13:16.262 --> 01:13:19.536
These things go right into your face,

01:13:19.536 --> 01:13:22.485
and in a way, what could
be more intimate than that?

01:13:22.485 --> 01:13:24.993
You could be in the
most personal situation,

01:13:24.993 --> 01:13:27.152
and here's this message right there.

01:13:27.152 --> 01:13:29.707
And it can be different
things for different people.

01:13:29.707 --> 01:13:31.216
So I think the crucial thing is

01:13:31.216 --> 01:13:33.886
to look at how it is being used

01:13:33.886 --> 01:13:35.767
by these people in this context,

01:13:35.767 --> 01:13:39.389
and ask, is it being more intimate

01:13:39.389 --> 01:13:41.433
or less intimate in this way.

01:13:41.433 --> 01:13:43.522
So some people maybe would find

01:13:43.522 --> 01:13:45.752
better communication if they occasionally

01:13:45.752 --> 01:13:48.259
backed off and texted or emailed.

01:13:48.259 --> 01:13:50.883
And other people have
to just put that aside

01:13:50.883 --> 01:13:53.112
and just talk to each other face to face.

01:13:53.112 --> 01:13:55.040
And maybe it's doing it differently

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.479
than you did it before

01:13:56.479 --> 01:13:59.893
that might be some sort of a breakthrough.

01:13:59.893 --> 01:14:01.425
But I guess my strongest feeling is

01:14:01.425 --> 01:14:04.165
that there's no one way to look at it,

01:14:04.165 --> 01:14:05.999
and to be really cautious about

01:14:05.999 --> 01:14:07.927
how we respond to other people's

01:14:07.927 --> 01:14:09.877
uses of these media because

01:14:09.877 --> 01:14:12.547
their sense of it may
be different from ours.

01:14:12.547 --> 01:14:13.380
Thank you.
