00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.040
Smoking is bad for you and everyone around
you.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:12.389
So if vaping is less bad for you, is it also
less bad for everyone around you?

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.169
Hi everyone, Julian here for DNews from YouTube
Space LA!

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.500
Let’s kick this off by saying the obvious:
cigarettes are bad for you.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.949
The nicotine in them is highly addictive and
causes increased blood pressure, higher cholesterol,

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.130
and heart disease.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.911
Cigarettes yellow your teeth and nails, cause
premature wrinkling, and the American Cancer

00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:33.710
Society estimates about half of people who
start smoking and never quit will die of cancer.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.230
But, if despite knowing all this you still
choose to smoke, it’s your decision and

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.270
you know the risks.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.120
The problem really arises for people around
you who choose not to smoke, and yet they’re

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.079
going to suffer a lot of the same effects
if they breathe in your smoke regularly.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.560
Yes, even the cancer part, unless you don’t
believe the EPA, the U.S. National Toxicology

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.899
Program, the Surgeon General, and the International
Agency for Research on Cancer.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.030
Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke
have a higher instance of respiratory infections,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.790
asthma, sudden infant death syndrome, and
nicotine negatively affects the prefrontal

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.659
cortex of developing brains.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.060
While the standalone effects of nicotine as
a carcinogen have not been investigated thoroughly,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.159
researchers from the Virginia Bioinformatics
Institute have found exposure to it causes

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.119
DNA mutations which can increase cancer risk
over time.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.100
On top of that many people don’t like the
smell of cigarette smoke, cigarette butts

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.520
are the most common piece of litter, and dealing
with people who have gone too long without

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.450
their nicotine fix is just terrible.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.869
Enter the e-cigarette.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.060
The idea is you do away with tobacco and instead
have extracted nicotine in water.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.389
A heating element vaporizes the water, that
carries the nicotine into your lungs and you

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:41.039
exhale water vapor that’s harmless to the
people around you.

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.619
At least that’s what the advertisements
say, but what does the science say?

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.319
Short answer: It’s less bad but still not
great.

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.259
Yes, it’s true, without the tobacco and
tar, the vapor you exhale has a tenth the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.009
carcinogens as normal cigarette smoke so second
hand vapor indoors from one e-cigarette is

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.909
considered no significant risk, while a regular
cigarette is.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.009
Still the vapor can have a negative effect
on your immune system.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.250
Mice exposed to e-cigarette vapor were more
susceptible to bacterial and viral infections

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.430
because of free radicals in the smoke that
damaged cell DNA.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.750
There’s a new problem e-cigs have too: because
you’re heating a metal tube, the vapor can

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.099
carry heavy metals.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.460
Some of them, like lead or zinc, are in lower
levels than you find in normal tobacco smoke.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.610
But one heavy metal in the vapor that’s
not found in cigarettes is chromium.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.909
Chromium comes in a couple different forms
based on how easily it bonds with other elements,

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.480
trivalent chromium [Cr (III)] and hexavalent
chromium [Cr (VI)].

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.430
Trivalent Chromium isn’t absorbed well by
the body so it’s pretty harmless, but hexavalent

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.980
chromium is a different story.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.810
Chronic inhalation can cause lung scarring
and lung cancer.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.670
The thing is, both these forms of chromium
are used to keep metals from corroding, it’s

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.860
where we get the term “chrome” from.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.390
So either of them might be used in manufacturing
e-cigarettes.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.219
The USC study doesn’t specify which they
found because it’s difficult to differentiate

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.219
in tests.

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.330
And with so many makes and models of e-cigarettes
and very little regulation, it’s impossible

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.650
to know which maker is using which form of
chromium.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.980
But let’s assume that regulations and manufacturing
standards can eliminate hexavalent chromium

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.980
from the vapor.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.980
There’s still the nicotine.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.810
That’s what this is all about right? that
sweet nicotine fix?

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.780
E-cig smokers can choose different cartridges
with a range of nicotine levels from none

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.780
to pretty high.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.200
The nicotine will still cause a wealth of
cardiovascular problems so that aspect is

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.030
no better than regular cigarettes.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.920
How much of that nicotine is in second hand
vapor?

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.739
According to Oxford University, about a tenth
as much that’s in tobacco smoke.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.900
it’s still present and so the Oxford researchers
warn to hold off on vaping near children,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.049
pregnant women, or people with cardiovascular
conditions until more studies are done.

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.090
So as of right now, for the most part, it
looks like second hand vapor poses a significantly

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.970
lower health risk than tobacco smoke.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.700
But remember, it took decades of observation
and study to realize the effects of passive

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.489
tobacco smoke inhalation.

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.791
E-cigarettes have only been on the market
since 2007, and to really know what we’re

00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:54.200
getting into we need to be able to see the
effects of the vapor over a person’s lifetime.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.110
That’s right, say it with me, more research
is needed.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.980
E-cigarette smoke is apparently a lot less
bad, nice, myth confirmed.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.139
We can’t say as much for Hookah smoke though.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.299
For the details on smoking hookah and why
it’s really really really bad for you, check

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.999
out Trace’s video down here.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.950
So, knowing what you now know, would you be
comfortable with someone vaping in the room

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.950
with you?

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.700
Or if you use e-cigs yourself, would you respect
someone asking you to vape outside?

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.180
Let us know in the comments!

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.400
Oh and sidebar, if you’re under 18, don’t
smoke.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.801
Even if you can buy e-cigs legally, that nicotine
hooks you easier and is still bad for your

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:28.910
developing brain.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.021
Plus they don’t even look cool, they’re
like a weird light-up version of those little

00:04:33.021 --> 00:04:37.190
recorders they made you play hot crossed buns
on in 3rd grade, it’s not a good look.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.900
Ok, I’ll see you next time on DNews!
