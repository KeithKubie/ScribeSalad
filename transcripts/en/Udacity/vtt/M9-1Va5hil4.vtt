00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.855
Now that you've seen the computation with specific values, let's do it in

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:07.718
general. So what did we do? We started with the width of the floor, subtracted

00:00:07.718 --> 00:00:13.528
the size of the first white tile. Divide it by the sizes of the pairs, took the

00:00:13.528 --> 00:00:18.260
integer part. And that gave us the number of pairs. Now that's of course the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.813
same as the number of red tiles, because every pair has one red tile. And, the

00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:27.076
white tile says one more. All right, now, we're ready to program, and what I'd

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:32.439
like you to do is to complete the program that we started for you. The program

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.300
will read as inputs, the width of the floor and the tile sizes. And your job

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.500
will be to run the computation that I've just developed, and to print the

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.773
answer. Here's the program for you to fill in. You already give the commands

00:00:46.773 --> 00:00:50.891
for the input and for the output and your job was to put in the part of the

00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:56.384
program that asked computation. Now we did this by hand, and let me show you

00:00:56.384 --> 00:01:00.876
again the formula that we obtain. That's the formula here. So we take the width

00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:05.759
minus the tile size divided by twice the tile size, take the integer part.
