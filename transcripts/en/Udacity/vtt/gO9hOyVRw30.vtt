MapReduce--for those of you who aren't familiar, it's basically this programming technique

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
for doing batch jobs across a huge amount of data.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There's two functions, if you programming functionally, map and reduce.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Map basically says given this list of things, apply this function to it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And then reduce basically says given these two things,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
apply this function to it and combine it into one thing.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So if you're working over a huge chunk of data--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Google made MapReduce famous building their indices for the web.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Basically, they take all the webpages on the Internet and you can apply this function to it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which is basically find the words in this document.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And then you can reduce on that to basically reduce that content down to

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the kind of target output you want.
