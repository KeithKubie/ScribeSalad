00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.060
A mother’s scent can have profound effects
on her baby - but can it teach them to develop

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.460
certain fears?

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.710
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and we’ve
long been taught that smell is the most powerful

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.760
sense we have.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.890
We associate memories with it, we use it subconsciously
when picking mates, and now, science suggests,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.289
it may play a role in how we develop fears.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.539
A new study published in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences, shows that

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.399
babies have an innate ability to acquire fears
from their mothers, just by smelling them

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.890
in times of distress.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.760
Which answers the age-old question, of how
a mother’s traumatic experiences can affect

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.661
her child, even if those experiences occurred
BEFORE the child was born.

00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:48.780
For this study, researchers trained a group
of female rats to fear the smell of peppermint,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.129
by exposing them to mild electric shocks whenever
they smelled it.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.960
They then allowed the rats to mate, and after
they gave birth, they exposed them to the

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.770
smell again - without the shock this time
- in order to provoke the fear response.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.790
In one experiment, they had the pups of the
rats there with the mom as they were exposed

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.170
to scent, and they found the pups also feared
the smell of peppermint, despite never having

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.970
learned to associate it with fear.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.490
Now one could argue that the pups were only
scared because they saw that their mothers

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.170
were scared - so they repeated the same experiment
with another group of rats.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.860
But this time, the mothers were not present.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.510
Instead, researchers piped in the odor of
the mother reacting to the scent, and still

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.040
- the pups continued to fear the smell of
peppermint.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.920
What’s even more fascinating, is that the
pups they used for this experiment, were too

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.530
young to have even developed the natural ability
to learn fears.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.040
So how does something like this happen?

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.100
Well, to figure that out - researchers used
special brain imaging, and zeroed in on the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.659
lateral amygdala.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.079
This is the part of our brains that helps
us detect and respond to threats later in

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.189
life - but the results of this study, shows
that it’s also key in helping our brains

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.450
develop fears.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.369
Sure enough, when they repeated the experiment
with that part of the brain blocked, the pups

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.090
failed to acquire the fear of peppermint from
their mothers.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.079
According to the author of the study, rats
are immune to learning information about environmental

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.620
dangers during their early stages of infancy.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.559
But, if their mother is the SOURCE of that
threat information, then it’s possible for

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:13.200
them to learn from her - and those memories
that do develop, are long-lasting.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.500
Of course with most studies done on rats,
it’s hard to say exactly how these behaviors

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.419
translate to humans - but remember that part
of the reason we use rats for experiments

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.379
like this, is because we share many of the
same genetics and behaviors.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.810
And the phenomenon of acquiring fears from
your parents - isn’t unheard of in humans.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.379
One example the author gives, are children
of Holocaust survivors - who frequently experience

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.469
nightmares, avoidance instincts, and even
flashbacks of traumatic events that they themselves

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.129
never actually experienced.

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.249
Cases like that, are what makes this study
all the more exciting.

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.680
Being able to identify - and possibly prevent
- the mechanism by which this happens, can

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.819
have very real effects for people living with
anxieties and phobias.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:50.999
What do you guys think?

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.719
Do you have any irrational fears, and if so
- where do you think acquired them?

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.569
