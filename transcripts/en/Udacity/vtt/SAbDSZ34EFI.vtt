00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I want to close with some general comments about the uses of models and simulation.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
All simulation of Apollo 13 is just one example of what can be done with these techniques

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
from mathematics and computer science.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
These techniques allow us to do experiments that can't be done in real life.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
They may be too expensive in real life.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For instance, building 1000 cars to find the right aerodynamic shape.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
They may be too dangerous.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
For instance, if we ask the astronauts to actually try out different boost

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or they may be outright impossible--for instance, we want to look at the universe

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that has different fundamental constants of nature.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We may use simulations for simple prediction, for optimization, to study causes and effects

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
for instance of earthquakes or climate change,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we may use models and simulation to determine unobservable quantities

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
such as the composition of the interior of the earth.
