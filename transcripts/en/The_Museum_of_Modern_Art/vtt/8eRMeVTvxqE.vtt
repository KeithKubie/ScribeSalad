00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.440
I started my research on Wright with the project
of the Midway Gardens.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.930
It was a large, vast in fact, entertainment
complex in Chicago.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:18.369
And the reason I was interested in it is that
Wright has the most elaborate ornamental program

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:26.890
for this project where ornament expands from
the plan to the facade to the interior courtyard,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.450
and the interior decorations until even the
cutlery, the plates, the chairs and the furniture

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.650
for that building.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.270
We can start with this mural that was in fact
installed in the tavern, one of the interior

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:47.530
spaces of the complex and what interests me
a lot here is first it has this graphic quality

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.090
with the circles that you see are hanging
in certain sequences like pendants.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.060
So there is an element of both levity and
gravity and these two forces compensate one

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.070
another on the mural.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.580
Also, I find it very interesting that they
were supposed to represent the bubbles of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.030
sparkling drinks.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.490
Midway, I find it very interesting that ornament
has a spatial quality.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.799
All of these ornaments that we see here on
these electric needles, high columns installed

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.170
at the facade and the courtyard were supposed
to orient visitors, driving to the complex

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.639
from a distance in Chicago at night, but also
act as modes of disorientation.

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:39.490
That is, it was supposed to attract and suck
them in the atmosphere, this phantasmagoric

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.180
atmosphere of the complex and make them stay
more.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.740
So these elements of both orientation and
disorientation balancing themselves, I find

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.880
them very interesting.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.039
And both of them are achieved through ornament.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:01.819
As we know in Wright in some of his projects,
perhaps the majority of even the budget is

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:09.910
about the cost of these ornaments or side
objects, lamps, furniture, rugs, murals and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.860
we see that both in public buildings like
the Midway but also in residential buildings

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.920
as well.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.640
One of the interesting discoveries I made
while researching the project was in fact

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:30.280
a drawing for the Barnsdall House that shows
a series of furniture, but quite unexpectedly

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.500
it shows the price of each and every of these
items.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.230
We realize that they cost a lot including
the rugs, the lamps and all the pieces of

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.550
furniture for each residence, and they might
even represent the majority of the expense

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.120
for the house.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.290
One of the qualities of what Frank Lloyd Wright
calls organic ornament, that is an ornament

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.310
that holds the building together that has
an integral quality and brings all the elements

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.090
together is that in fact it's very hard to
extract anything from that scheme.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.600
So it makes these costs for things that might
seem marginal or secondary absolutely essential

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.030
and very hard to extract from the project.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.230
Another interesting discovery, which I think
speaks a lot to the amplified function of

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.120
ornament in Wright is the transition from
a surface element to the plan.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.840
For example, this graphic design for the Liberty
journal covers called “March Balloons”

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.430
while it was originally intended to be a journal
cover and that never happened, the original

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:50.240
publisher rejected those- it kept transforming
and at some point it turned into the plan

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:59.380
of a rug that would cover the floor of the
living room for Wright's son, David Wright,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:08.890
in his house in Arizona around 1950, '51,
that is about 25 years after the original

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.440
design was made for the Liberty covers.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.299
Overall, the sequence of drawings shows the
process of transformation of ornament as a

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:26.260
very interesting and privileged category of
object, a unique object that as I said throughout

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.730
modernism is under the threat of extinction
but in Wright it survives and in order to

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.730
survive, it has to change.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.730
&nbsp;
And that change is precisely the transformation

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.730
we see in Wright from a graphic surface element
to the very building the interior organization

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.730
and the structure of that building that is
both on the exterior, the interior and even

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.737
the interior structure of the building itself.
