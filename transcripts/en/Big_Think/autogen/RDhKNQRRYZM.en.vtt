something but almost nobody actually

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920
something but almost nobody actually
 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.890
something but almost nobody actually
believes that in any of these religions

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900
believes that in any of these religions
 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.210

if you look at the way people actually

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220
if you look at the way people actually
 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.920

live they're much more practical than

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930
live they're much more practical than
 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.190
live they're much more practical than
that and and so I wouldn't say that

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200
that and and so I wouldn't say that
 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.680
that and and so I wouldn't say that
they're any mainstream beliefs that have

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690
they're any mainstream beliefs that have
 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.120
they're any mainstream beliefs that have
to be abandoned and we don't we don't

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130
to be abandoned and we don't we don't
 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.610
to be abandoned and we don't we don't
have to have like a single religion that

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620
have to have like a single religion that
 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.420

all that's really required is tolerance

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430
all that's really required is tolerance
 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.650
all that's really required is tolerance
of other of other beliefs and and in

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660
of other of other beliefs and and in
 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.479
of other of other beliefs and and in
that sense maybe a certain amount of

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489
that sense maybe a certain amount of
 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.110
that sense maybe a certain amount of
intellectual humility but I don't think

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120
intellectual humility but I don't think
 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.170
intellectual humility but I don't think
you need some sort of merger of

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180
you need some sort of merger of
 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.700
you need some sort of merger of
religious beliefs

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710
religious beliefs
 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.910
religious beliefs
there are doctrines that could help like

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920
there are doctrines that could help like
 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.710
there are doctrines that could help like
the notion of the Godhead

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720
the notion of the Godhead
 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.080
the notion of the Godhead
the idea that the different gods that

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090
the idea that the different gods that
 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.850
the idea that the different gods that
are worshipped may be made all just

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860
are worshipped may be made all just
 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.500
are worshipped may be made all just
different manifestations of a single

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510
different manifestations of a single
 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.780
different manifestations of a single
underlying divine unity that might be a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790
underlying divine unity that might be a
 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.180
underlying divine unity that might be a
productive thing for people to agree on

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190
productive thing for people to agree on
 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.920
productive thing for people to agree on
but even that I wouldn't say is

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930
but even that I wouldn't say is
 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.380
but even that I wouldn't say is
essential
