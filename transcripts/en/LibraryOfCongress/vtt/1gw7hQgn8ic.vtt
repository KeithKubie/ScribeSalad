00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.620
&gt;&gt; orraine Tong: Good
afternoon everyone,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.850
and welcome to The Library's
National Book Festival.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.010
It's our sixteenth year.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.870
My name is Lorraine Tong and I
work at The Library of Congress

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.000
in a department that
conducts nonpartisan objective

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.480
and confidential research
and analysis for congress.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.480
Now today I am privileged to
represent The Library of Congress

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.100
in thanking you for your presence
here today, and your support

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.520
for the Library and this festival.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.630
The Library is grateful
for the phenomenal support

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.210
of the co-chairman of the
festival, David Rubenstein,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.830
and many national book festival
sponsors who make this event,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.900
this and every year, possible.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.110
We also extend our thanks to
AARP, for sponsoring this stage

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.250
and many other library programs.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.760
One more thank you
to Kristin's parents,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.550
because tomorrow is
Kristin Hannah's birthday.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.550
Happy birthday!

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.800
Without her parents,
she wouldn't be here,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.390
and we wouldn't be here,
and reading her books.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.470
So Kristin was born in
California, and then now she lives

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.310 position:56%
in Washington, the other Washington,
Washington state, and also Hawaii.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.040
She practiced law in Seattle before
turning to writing and fortunately

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.130
for us, she decided not
to write briefs anymore,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.440
but rather tell stories.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.300
I think she would only take
a break if she were nominated

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.790
to the Supreme Court, we discussed
that a little bit earlier.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.200
Her words have made us
feel, cry, and laugh.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.540
There's a real charm and poetic
theme throughout her books.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.860 position:56%
As you know, she is an award winning
New York Times Best Selling Author

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:29.640
of 21 novels, including Firefly
Lane, Home Front, Winter Garden,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.270
and the Nightingale,
her current book.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.240
And some of them have been
optioned already for movies.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.600
Kristin's books resonate with
readers across the country

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.260
and the world because her
books have no borders.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.370
They are about ordinary
people who are thrust

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.010
into extraordinary circumstances.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:59.610
In fact, I recently understand and
saw, some postings on the internet

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.570 position:56%
by Reese Witherspoon, Brooke Shields

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.720
and Elizabeth Banks,
among so many others.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.120
In the Nightingale, a story
about the Vianne and Isabelle,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.350
two sisters who lived in France

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.150
under the German occupation
during World War II.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.580
She wrote, Kristin wrote, in love,
we find out who we want to be.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.830
In war, we find out who we are.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.670
It is impossible to express how
compelling I found Nightingale.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.220
In two consecutive week nights,
I was reading until 4 AM,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.790 position:56%
and then I was sorry I had finished.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.450
Kristin will take questions at
the end of her presentation,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.540
but please be aware that
the questions and people

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.050
in the audience will be
filmed for our archives.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.170
Finally, thank you for
turning off your cell phones.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.410
Kristin will favor us with a
book signing at 2:30 until 3:30

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.290
in the expo section
on the lower level.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.580
So it is my honor and
a personal pleasure

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.510
to introduce Kristin Hannah.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:27.510
[ Applause ]

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.750
&gt;&gt; Kristin Hannah: Okay,
so first order of business.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.570 position:56%
You guys are officially the
biggest crowd I have ever spoken to.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.800
I am terrified, so
everybody smile and say hi.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.750
Okay. Now I hope my
son doesn't call.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.150
Okay, gosh it's so strange,
I can't see any of you,

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.450
these lights are so bright.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.750
I'm sure you've heard that before,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.870
so if you think I'm looking
dazed, I'm just blind.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.310
So obviously it's a
real honor to be here.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.150
It's exciting to be in Washington
D.C. at this time of year,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.790
and on this special
weekend, and I thank you

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.760
so much for coming to see me.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.490
So I'm going to tell you a little
bit about sort of, my journey,

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.050
and how I came to be
standing here, and then yes,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.050 position:56%
I would love to answer any questions
from any of you that you would like.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.940
And frankly, I'm really
interested in the questions

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.410
that you would've asked
if we weren't filming,

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.740
but I guess I don't get that, so.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.580
I'm not one of those
people who always thought

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.600
that they would be a writer.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.890
In fact I would have said that
writing was a job for dreamers

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.020
and I'm not much of a dreamer.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.730
The way it sort of came to me,
was when I was in my third year

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.830
of law school, I was, I don't
know maybe 24 years old,

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.690
I don't know how old I was then.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.520
Young. My mother was
dying of breast cancer.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.680
And so every day after
class I would you know,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.070
go hang out in her hospital room,
and I'm sure a lot of you have been

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.820
in these situations, and you know
that there are just a lot of things

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.800
that you don't want to talk about,
or you aren't ready to talk about,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.720 position:56%
and I was there one day, and because
I was young and because I was

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.820
in school, I was complaining
about my classes.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.340
I had signed up for a
corporate tax, which for a girl

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.600
who can't add, is a very bad idea.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.680
And I was complaining to my
mother that I was not doing well

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.190
in the class, and she said,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.590
well don't worry you're
going to be a writer anyway.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.530
And of course, my dad's in the
back going, we just got her

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.560
into law school, you know.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.030
And my thought is, somebody
needs to check her morphine drip

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.880
because this makes no sense at all.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.510
I had never written
a word of fiction.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:08.030
But, I think you know, I didn't
want to think about, at that point,

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.820
all of the heaviness that was
coming, that she wouldn't be

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.510
at my wedding, that she wouldn't
be there when I had my first child,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.210 position:56%
that we didn't have a life together.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.480
And so she said, you know I think
we should write a book together.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.190
And I jumped on this opportunity.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.550
I said definitely, let's do that.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.180
So being mother and daughter, we
immediately locked into battle

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.630
about what kind of
book we should write.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.920
I wanted to write horror and she
wanted to write historical romance.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.820
So, now today you could
do those together,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.990
but not so much in the late 80s.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.290
And so, you know, we
kind of battled,

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.310
and ultimately my mom said
look, I'm sick, I win,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.850
we're writing historical romance.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.150
And so I said okay.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:03.420
So this was you know,
the pre-internet era,

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.230
so that meant going to the
library every single day,

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.280
standing in the dusty stacks
of Suzzallo at the University

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.380
of Washington and just
xeroxing pages

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.170
and pages and pages of material.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:20.590
And I would bring all of my
material back to her hospital room

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.630
and we would talk about, you
know, we could spend a whole day

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.090
on what did her dress look like,
what did her shoes look like,

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:31.360
and just collected all this
research, plotted this book,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.090
which by the way, we thought
was a revolutionary idea,

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:43.570 position:56%
about a woman who dresses as a cabin
boy and sneaks onto a pirate ship.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:50.380
And so we did all this research
and I actually, in 1986,

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.350
I wrote my very first words of
fiction, I wrote Chapter One,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.500
I wrote a scene, and I hadn't
even finished the scene

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.070
when I got the call from
my dad saying you need

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.870
to come to the hospital.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.860
So I was able to sort of whisper
in my mother's ear, I started.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.060
But she was never able to
read anything, unfortunately.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.150
And so, after she passed
away I really had no interest

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.790
in being a writer.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.700
I was a lawyer.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:25.110 position:56%
And so I finished law school and you
know, went back with ordinary life,

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:31.010
packed up everything into this
box, and put it into my closet.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.710
And several years later, when
I got pregnant with my son,

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.130
I went into labor at 14 weeks.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.990 position:56%
And that's when I realized I wasn't
going to have an ordinary pregnancy,

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.870
and I knew, you know, that
I wasn't going to be able

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.760 position:56%
to have any more kids, and I would
be very lucky to keep the one I had,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.070
and I was in bed for
the entire pregnancy.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.040
&gt;&gt; This was 1987, I guess.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.710
So of course all my girlfriends
are working, my husband is working,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.950
there is no good day time TV.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:11.660
For those of you old enough to
remember, Erica Kane was bedridden

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.720
with Bianca at the exact same time.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.700
Bianca's now like 60.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.520
But so I tried watching
All My Children

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.140
and Erica was just not having
the same bedridden pregnancy

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.600
that I was, so I turned off the TV.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.580
And then I tried The Price is
Right, but when you start yelling

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.270
out refrigerator prices
to an empty room,

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.340
you know that you need
to do something fast.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.360
And I think at some point in there
my husband sort of poked his head

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.230
in the room, well what
about that book that you

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.490
and Sharon were going to write?

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.700
And I thought, oh that's right, the
book that we were going to write.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.780
So I pulled down this box, and
here's this gift from my mom,

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.630
of all of this research
and everything

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.100
that you need to write a book.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.940
And I thought, how hard can it be?

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.240
I can do this.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.420
I've got like seven months.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:09.390
And you know, so I learned to boot
up a computer and I got out all

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.730
of these things and I started
writing, and you know what?

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.320
It wasn't hard.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:22.910
In fact, I was so talented,
like right from the start,

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.210
that I didn't need to edit.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.640
I didn't need to change a word,

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.050
it just came out perfectly
the first time.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:39.400
So I wrote this entire historical
romance novel, unedited, unchanged,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.550
in one pass, and then
I thought, okay,

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.190
what lucky agent should
I send this to?

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:52.990
And I did all my lawyer research,
you know, and I sent it off,

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.210
and I sent it off I think about
a week before I had my son.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.460
And then I started
dreaming of book tours,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.650
and how I would handle
multiple offers from publishers,

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.460
and you know, waiting
for all of that stuff.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:12.380
And ultimately, I heard
back from the agent,

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:17.260
and she said you may have
talent, frankly how could I tell?

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:23.340
And I thought, wait a
minute, it's going to be hard?

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.820
You know, I really, honestly I
was young and I didn't understand.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.290
I had made the decision
to be a writer.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.930
I had written a book.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.390 position:56%
That seemed like what was necessary.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.360
And that was when I
really understood

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:44.260
that writing was unlike anything
else I had undertaken in my life.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:50.260
And that I would have to sort
of embrace the concept of effort

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:56.140 position:56%
and failure and uncertainty, and I
would have to try to learn something

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.470
that you almost have
to learn internally.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:04.890
And I thought, well, okay, I'm
going to give myself five years.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.870
I'm going to try to do this.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:13.960
I mean always go back to the law if
I have to, and so I undertook sort

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.160
of this, journey, of
beginning to write.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.900
Because I had a young son, I
couldn't go take a lot of classes,

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.890
I couldn't do a lot of
things, so I had to you know,

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.310
do it sort of, as best I could.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:34.150
And one of the first things I
did, was I went to a conference,

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:39.520
not unlike this, but smaller than
this, but it was some authors

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.480 position:56%
that were speaking about their work.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.250 position:56%
I remember walking into the room,
there was maybe 100 people in there,

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:50.390
and what I remember
was they were so old.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.710
They were at least 40.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.540
And I thought I just don't belong
here, I don't know what to do.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.400
So I did what I always
do which is race

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.910
to the restroom to collect myself.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:04.410
I was about 29 at this point.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:08.660 position:56%
And there was another woman standing
in there who was my same age,

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:14.670
who was also hiding out from the
old people at the conference.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.400
And we still how it
happened, but we decided

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.170
to start critiquing each other.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.790
So we said, we traded
books, I read hers

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.530
and I went oh man,
you are so talented.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.520
And she read me, you, too.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.040
And so we just started,
you know, working,

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.910
and she was a TV news
producer, I was a lawyer

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.310
so we had this really
strong work ethic.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:46.700
And we just never took
no, we never gave up.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.150
My dad, you know, kept thinking,
so you're still writing,

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.180
I thought macrame would be next,
then paint by numbers, you know,

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.940
but we just sort of
kept working at it.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:05.620
And I was fortunate enough to sell
my first book when my son was two.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:11.710
And so I just kind of, you
know, moved into this wonderful,

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:16.710
wonderful job, which was a
novelist and an at home mom,

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:25.050 position:56%
who was able to go to every you
know, field trip, party, everything,

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:30.350 position:56%
until my son said, you know, for the
love of God, stop coming to school,

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.220
I can't stand it anymore.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.910 position:56%
And in what has become a pattern
for me, I seemed to have about a six

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.700
or seven year attention span.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:49.090
And so I did, I worked, I wrote
romances for about six years,

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.860
and then I started
to feel constrained.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.280
I started to feel like I wanted
to tell different stories.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.650
I wanted to tell them
in a different way.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:06.550
I wanted to focus on prose and
relationships of all kinds.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:12.560
And so I said to my agent, I'm
going to write a hard cover novel.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.180
And she said, oh no,
that doesn't happen.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.440
You can't go from romance you know.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.070
And so I said, yeah I think I can.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:24.600
And I wrote my first hard cover,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.890
what they now call
women's fiction novel,

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:31.370
in about 1998 or something I think.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:36.110
And did that for a long time,
about six years actually.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.070
Loved it. Had a great time.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.450
And about six years after
that I started to feel

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.860
that I had this story to tell.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.010
But I wasn't exactly
sure what it was.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:51.600
I just knew it was a story about
my generation, about girls, women,

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.810
of the 70s and 80s coming of
age, and about friendship.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:02.100
What I didn't realize was
that I had come to the point

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.880
where it was finally time
to look at my mom's life,

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.670
and to try to understand her.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.240
And I think anyone who
has lost a mother, early,

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.920
you know that you spend a life
trying to know her anyway.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.980
And what I did was I wrote
a book called Firefly Lane,

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.000
it was kind of a game changer
for me and it was actually

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.920
about breast cancer
and about friendship.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.660
It was sort of very
autobiographical in a lot of ways.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:37.880
What I didn't realize was that I
was exactly the age my mother was

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.720
when she was diagnosed
when I began in.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.450
And when I ended it, I was
exactly the age she was

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.260
when she passed away.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.640
And so I sort of feel in retrospect

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.390
like she was guiding me
through that process.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:55.490
And Firefly Lane really
changed the course of my career.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:00.550
That was really the first
big epic commercial novel.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:05.230
And it is really the
precursor to The Nightingale,

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.840
and I think it's the book that
allowed me to be standing here,

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.690
you know, having written
The Nightingale.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:18.020
The way The Nightingale started
was about eight years ago I think,

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:24.210
I was writing a book called Winter
Garden, set in World War II Russia,

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.890
and I came across the story

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:31.580
of a young Belgian woman named
Andrée De Jongh , who at 19,

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:39.150
started one of the early escape
routes out of Nazi occupied France.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:43.670
And obviously I couldn't
use this in Winter Garden,

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.440
but I was fascinated by this story.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:53.590
And I was not only fascinated by
it, I started to, I guess I kind

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:58.470
of have a pet peeve about
women's lost history.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.730
And I found myself very frustrated
that with all that I read,

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.270
I hadn't read this story.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:09.720
I hadn't read about this heroic
woman or women like here.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:15.000
So I sort of kept reading,
and that led me to the women

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.820
of the French Resistance, the
women who were couriers and spies

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:24.190
and helped downed airmen get out,
and did all of these amazing,

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.760
remarkable things, courageous acts.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:35.850
And then on to women who hid Jewish
children or helped Jewish children

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.650
and Jewish families
get out of France.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:42.850
And by this time I was just, I
thought this was an epic story,

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.980
I was absolutely blown away by it.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.930
And I thought, please
somebody write this book.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.230
This is the book I want to read.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.150
And so I waited for somebody
else to write the book.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.660 position:56%
And I don't know why but nobody did.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.560
And time passed, and time
passed, and I kept waiting

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.360
and I kept reading, but I
thought, I'm not writing it.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:12.490
This is a huge important subject
and I'm not a historian, you know,

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.490
I'm a writer, and I
was actually afraid

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:20.490
that I couldn't do
justice to this story.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:26.050
&gt;&gt; But finally, I really sort of
came to the point where I felt

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:32.680
that this story was so important,
and needed to be told, so much,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.610
that I thought okay, I'm diving in.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.340
I'm going to give it a try.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:47.750
Because I was so amazed by
the risk these women had taken

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:52.920
and the way they had sort of, put
their children's lives at risk,

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.150
their lives at risk,
and I was consumed

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.360
by the question of what would I do?

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.970
When would I, as a
woman and as a mother,

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.800
risk my son's life
to save a stranger?

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.580
And I think that you
know, part of the reason

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.050
that the book has resonated so
much with people in the last couple

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:17.960
of years is that we
don't have enough

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.980
out there about female heroism.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.330
And you know, the amazing things

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:25.960
that women have done throughout
history to change the course

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:31.030
of history, sometimes in quiet ways
and sometimes in remarkable ways.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:38.200
And I think this just one of those
stories that resonates with people.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.160
And you know, we live
in a very dangerous,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:49.490
intolerant world right now,
and I believe that the lessons

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:54.280
of history are more important
than ever, and so I'm really happy

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.750
to see people embracing this book.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:02.100
And I guess I would just
say, you know, sort of,

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:06.750
before I take some
questions, I'm pretty sure

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:13.190 position:56%
that my mother is sitting somewhere
with a martini and an Eve cigarette,

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:19.770
and probably a red pen, and
you know, telling the people

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.560
around her how proud she is
that I have finally gotten here,

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.750 position:56%
and I think that's because I finally
understand now that I'm older

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:35.650
than she ever was, that this
dream of being a writer was hers,

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:41.920
and she you know, never got to get
there because she had her children

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.940
so young and it was
such a different time.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:49.070
So I really feel like it's
us together on this journey.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.790
And I think she would have
really liked this book.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.510
So, that's it.

to know which sister

you related most to, and why?

&gt;&gt; Kristin Hannah: Well,
that's pretty easy.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.330
For me, I am Vianne
because she's a mother,

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:36.420
and because motherhood is really
sort of the bedrock of who she is.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:42.140
And to me, that idea
of the bravery it takes

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:47.660
when you're risking a life beyond
your own, you know, your child.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.400
To me, you know, she's much more
the heroic figure than Isabelle is

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:58.100 position:56%
because Isabelle is young and
frivolous and she risks her own life

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:03.110
in an almost thoughtless way
whereas a mother doesn't have

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:10.510
that opportunity and so, that's
who I identify with and why.

I guess, I wasn't familiar with
your story at all or how you came

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.530
to writing, and to me it's
just a very poignant story.

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:20.130
Is that a book you've
thought of writing?

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:25.370
And if yes or no, what
are you thinking of next?

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:27.780
&gt;&gt; Kristin Hannah: You know, it's
funny because one of the things

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:32.600
that I hear most you know, about
all of my books, is oh I read it

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.910
on a train and I was
sobbing, you know I was

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.090
on an airplane, they gave me CPR.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:47.840
And they never seem, they generally
don't seem sad to me going in.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.800
Taking on my mom head on, I think
I'm not quite ready for that yet.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.500
You know, maybe at some point.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:02.720
She appears in every single
book at some point in some way,

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:08.430
the way that we writers mine our
families and friends for you know,

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.410
story lines, characters,
that sort of thing.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.060
And I do every year, I
guess that I get older,

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.830
that I live more, feel
more like her.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.370
But no, I don't see
a book in there yet.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.760
I don't think my sister
could take it, she'd kill me.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.010 position:56%
And she gets mad at me often
enough, let me tell you, with books.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.310
And what's next?

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:35.710
I'm working on I guess, I'm going
to call it a coming of age novel

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:39.690
about a girl growing up in
a very dysfunctional family,

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.700
in a very unusual time period.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.590
But The Nightingale has been
a little tough to follow

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.290
so it has taken me a while.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hi. I just wanted to let you know
how much I loved The Nightingale.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.350
I thought it was one
of the most intricate

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.300
and complicated books
I've ever read,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.170
and I was wondering how long did
it take you to do the research,

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.550
and how long was the
writing process?

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.850
&gt;&gt; Kristin Hannah: Oh,
thank you very much.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.740
You know, like I said,
there was years of sort

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.420
of generalized research
and getting information

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.130
and hoping someone
else would write it.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.640
That took up a lot of the time.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:25.120
And probably, eight months of
solid research, daily research,

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.760
where I'm reading you know,
six, to eight, ten books a week,

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.190
or you know, doing
that sort of thing.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.030
And then I continued having
to research as I wrote.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:40.250
It took about, it was a two and
a half year period altogether.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.620
And this was the only
book I've ever written

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:47.170
which I couldn't really
write a paragraph

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.870
without going through
research first.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.110
I didn't know France, I didn't know
the era, I didn't know anything,

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:56.000
so if I wanted to tell you
what the sky looked like,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.420
what the plant was, I
had to go to research.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.980
So it was a lot of stop and go.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:05.790 position:56%
And what I essentially did with this
book was I wrote a historical draft

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.940
that was just the timeline,
all the scenes in place,

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.240 position:56%
and then I really tried to create
living, breathing characters to move

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:19.020
through that, because I
couldn't do it all at once.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.990
&gt;&gt; So this question is building
more upon what you just said

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:26.020
about how you wrote this
book, but you've written a lot

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:32.010 position:56%
of different types of books
throughout your tenure an an author.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.070
Could you talk about
your writing style?

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:38.140
Like how do you go about it,
and like when do you write?

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.440
That sort of a thing.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.800
&gt;&gt; Kristin Hannah: So the
writing process question.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.670
You know, in the early days,

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:49.350
when the books were more straight
forward, I was very analytical,

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:53.660
I did outlines, I did character
biographies, I did scene lists,

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.740
and then I wrote the
book as I envisioned it.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:02.040
But at some point along the way,
somewhere between Mystic Lake

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.290
and Firefly Lane, when
I got to the big books,

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:07.470
that no longer worked for me.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:11.340
I ended up going wrong so often.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:16.000
That now what I do, it's
an unwieldy process,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.570
and if anyone has a new one I
am looking for a new process,

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:22.390
please you know, give it to me.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:27.990
I come up with a question or
an issue, there's one thing,

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:32.520
that interests me enough to spend
two years of my life exploring.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:40.250
And I write draft after draft after
draft trying to find the point.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.300
For example, The Nightingale,
the first three drafts,

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:49.970 position:56%
there was only Isabelle, and I
thought this story's not big enough,

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:55.240
but I was nervous about opening
it up to that second story line.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.070
&gt;&gt; But I ultimately did, and there
was a draft where they were twins.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:04.170
I mean, I write all kinds of
different drafts trying to get

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:06.690
to the core of what I have to say,

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.990
and tragically I don't know
what that is when I start.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.550 position:56%
I have to discover it along the way.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:19.690 position:56%
And in terms of timing, I write
from about eight to four, most days.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.850
And then I usually take
a month off per year

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:25.720
to just read other
people on the beach.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:30.830
&gt;&gt; Well I'm another admirer.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.550
It was a wonderful book.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.000
And I'm wondering if you
actually went to France?

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.880
The descriptions were so
wonderful of the countryside

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.690 position:56%
and of the villages, and I'm just
wondering if you went to the country

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:42.990
to walk around and see it?

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:46.850
&gt;&gt; Kristin Hannah: You know
sadly, I thought I should.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:51.500
And it's interesting because you
know, I've written a lot of books

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.600
and I've written a books set in
other places that I hadn't been,

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.380
and even World War II Russia,
I never felt that I had

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:03.550
to go someplace to understand
it, and to describe it.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.890
But there was something
special about France.

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:09.930
Perhaps it is that almost everyone
or a lot of people have been there,

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:11.420
or you know, know the era.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.500
And there's so many people
who read World War II

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.620
and I just had a very
difficult time picturing it

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.060
in my head with all the research.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:26.240
So I wrote the first draft and
then I went to France and allowed

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.890
to that to inform from there on.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.960
And it did make, I think,
a really big difference.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.400
I loved it, too.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.000
It was fun.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.780
I think I'll set a book in Italy.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.380
&gt;&gt; Also beautiful.

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:45.660
Also, as an attorney and a
frustrated writer who came

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:52.160
to the enlightenment that
it's very different setting

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.440
out to write fiction.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.080
And so after so many years
of successful writing,

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.900
what tip or tips would you have?

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:12.890
&gt;&gt; Kristin Hannah: You know, I
mean, the thing about writing is,

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:18.090
it's a journey of hope,
it's a journey of the heart.

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:24.510
And you just simply have to go
undertake it without knowing

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:28.690
if you're any good, or without
knowing if you'll ever be any good.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:30.900
But you don't quit.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.590
You know, I often say to
people when I give classes,

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:37.050
you really only fail when you quit.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:44.440
You know, so I guess what I would
say read, read, read, and write.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:50.620
And don't be afraid to write the
bizarre thing, the different thing,

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.000
the thing that nobody
else is writing.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.140
Just write what it
is you have to say.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:59.530
The great thing about writing
is ultimately, in my opinion,

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.280
it's about what you have to say.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.730
And the older we get,
the more we have to say,

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.720
and the more we know who we are.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.030
So it's this great thing where
you're never, it's never too late

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.700
to start, you always can begin.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.190
Anybody else?

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:22.210
&gt;&gt; Our book club read The
Nightingale this summer

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.880
and everyone loved it, hands down.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.950
My question, love the two sister,

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:31.790
but was about the captain
that stayed with Vianne.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:38.480
Did you find it challenging to
write about a Nazi who had heart,

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.360
and was sensitive in a way that we
haven't really read about before?

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.660
&gt;&gt; Kristin Hannah: Yes.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.890
The easy answer is that
was very challenging.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:51.530
And it was something that gave me
a lot of pause, and I gave a lot

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.260
of thought to how I
wanted to do this.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:34:00.320
But the bottom line was my goal
in writing The Nightingale,

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.900
and what I thought, the
reason that I finally jumped

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.070
and said okay I'm going
to write this story,

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:09.880
was because what I
think my skill set is

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:14.400
as a writer, is emotional impact.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.870
My job is to make you actually
feel it, not just read the words,

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:21.440
not just understand what's
going on, but actually feel it.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:30.720
And the idea of the bad
Nazi was so easy to do.

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.940
And it felt like it had
been done so many times.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.460
And so I wanted to
explore something,

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.000
a man with a little bit
more shading than that.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.710
And sort of imply that he was
caught up in this in the same way

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:51.020
that the sisters were
and you know, that,

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.100
just humanize him I
guess is the best answer.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.260
And actually I'm really
glad that I did that.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.540
I think it actually gave
a resonance to the book.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:02.920
And I'm glad your book
club liked it.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.220
&gt;&gt; We loved it.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.710
&gt;&gt; Kristin Hannah:
Thanks for picking it.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:11.190
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm in a book group also,
and the first book of yours

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.980
that we chose was In
The Winter Garden,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.270
which is the first book
of yours I ever read.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.100
I really loved it and then
I listened to it on tape,

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.070
and tears going down my face.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.430
So and it really resonated
with me the whole,

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:29.720
siege and eating wall
paper paste and everything.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.020
I still think about it.

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.430
So I wanted to ask you, how
did you do research for that?

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.830
How did you find out
about these things?

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.290
Did it really happen?

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.470
And did you go to Russia?

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.770
&gt;&gt; Kristin Hannah: No
I didn't go to Russia.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:43.070
I would so like to.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:45.410
She's asking about Winter Garden
if you can't hear back there,

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.220
and how I did the research.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.380
You know, it's interesting having
done now two World War II books

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:56.570
about women, trying to
survive in difficult times,

00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:02.290
in the French research, there's
a lot of research about the women

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:07.020
who did the cool stuff, like
the couriers, the spies,

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.310
the downed airman over the
Pyrenees, or you know those roots.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:14.600
There's a lot of really good
memoir material about that.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:20.660
About the women who saved
Jewish children, very little.

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:24.910 position:56%
And about the women who survived
The Siege of Leningrad, very little.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.910
Because Stalin kept a
lid on it for so long,

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:31.290
so a lot of those stories
are you know, coming out now.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:36.930 position:56%
But it was really, you know, trying
to find the few memoirs that existed

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:39.200
and you know, try to
talk to survivors,

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.880
but it was very difficult, you
know, in World War II Russia.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.510
But that was the book
that made me believe

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.550
that The Nightingale was possible,

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:50.720
so I have a very warm
feeling for that book still.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.970
I think I'm done?

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:56.150
Okay. Oh. One more.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:57.450
Last question.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.860
&gt;&gt; I also have question
about Winter Garden.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:04.070
What gave you the idea to
go into that specific topic?

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:07.550
&gt;&gt; Kristin Hannah: Well for any of
you who have seen The Descendants,

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:12.910
which seems like a non sequitur,
but there's a little bar in Kauai,

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:16.230
called The Tahiti Nui, that's been
there since the 60s and that's

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:18.180
where it was in the movie.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:21.340
I was sitting with a girlfriend
and we're having a Mai Tai,

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:26.550
everybody's shoulder to shoulder,
and I was saying to my girlfriend,

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.900
this was right after Firefly Lane,
I said I want to write a book

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:34.810
about how amazing we women
are to protect our kids,

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:38.260
how we can like move a truck,
you know, to save their lives.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.930
And my girlfriend says yeah
well good luck with that,

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:44.670
and the guy sitting next to me says
well you know, if you're interested

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:47.730
in strong women, you
should check the Siege

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.090
of Leningrad, World War II.

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:52.570
And first thought was how long
have you been listening to us?

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:56.120 position:56%
And what have we been talking about?

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.600
But it turns out he was a
pilot and he just sent me

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.920
to World War II Russia, and when
I found the story of the Siege

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.070
of Leningrad, my heart
was so broken.

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:09.170
And again, it's a lost story.

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:12.550
You know, I mean, it became,
they called it a city of women

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.250
because the men were all gone
and you know, they were starving

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:18.560
in there, and again I just
wanted this story told

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.170
because I thought it was amazing.

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:22.970
Thank you.

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:31.020
[ Applause ]

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.670
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
