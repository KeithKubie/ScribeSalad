00:00:06.995 --> 00:00:08.747
When you hear the word art,

00:00:08.747 --> 00:00:10.250
what comes to mind?

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.197
A painting, like the Mona Lisa,

00:00:12.197 --> 00:00:14.834
or a famous sculpture or a building?

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:17.948
What about a vase or a quilt or a violin?

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:21.259
Are those things art, too, or are they craft?

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.706
And what's the difference anyway?

00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:26.847
It turns out that the answer is not so simple.

00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:29.559
A spoon or a saddle may be finely wrought,

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:33.122
while a monument may be, well, uninspired.

00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:36.440
Just as not every musical instrument is utilitarian,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.039
not every painting or statue is made for its own sake.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.489
But if it's so tricky to separate art from craft,

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.826
then why do we distinguish objects in this way?

00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:48.038
You could say it's the result

00:00:48.038 --> 00:00:50.745
of a dramatic historical turn of events.

00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:52.748
It might seem obvious to us today

00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:55.500
to view people, such as da Vinci or Michelangelo,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.588
as legendary artists,

00:00:57.588 --> 00:01:00.423
and, of course, they possessed extraordinary talents,

00:01:00.423 --> 00:01:02.972
but they also happened to live in the right place

00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:04.453
at the right time,

00:01:04.453 --> 00:01:06.617
because shortly before their lifetimes

00:01:06.617 --> 00:01:10.117
the concept of artists hardly existed.

00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:13.680
If you had chanced to step into a medieval European workshop,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.619
you would have witnessed a similar scene,

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.310
no matter whether the place belonged to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.060
a stonemason, a goldsmith, a hatmaker,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.953
or a fresco painter.

00:01:21.953 --> 00:01:25.201
The master, following a strict set of guild statutes,

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:27.152
insured that apprentices and journeymen

00:01:27.152 --> 00:01:28.536
worked their way up the ranks

00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:30.367
over many years of practice

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:32.952
and well-defined stages of accomplishment,

00:01:32.952 --> 00:01:36.661
passing established traditions to the next generation.

00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:38.453
Patrons regarded these makers

00:01:38.453 --> 00:01:40.749
collectively rather than individually,

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:43.921
and their works from Murano glass goblets,

00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:45.420
to Flemish lace,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.703
were valued as symbols of social status,

00:01:47.703 --> 00:01:49.600
not only for their beauty,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.953
but their adherence to a particular tradition.

00:01:51.953 --> 00:01:55.261
And the customer who commissioned and paid for the work,

00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:56.766
whether it was a fine chair,

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.786
a stone sculpture, a gold necklace,

00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:00.453
or an entire building,

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:02.145
was more likely to get credit

00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:06.286
than those who designed or constructed it.

00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:08.118
It wasn't until around 1400

00:02:08.118 --> 00:02:09.903
that people began to draw a line

00:02:09.903 --> 00:02:11.903
between art and craft.

00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:13.036
In Florence, Italy,

00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:15.191
a new cultural ideal that would later be called

00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:16.933
Renaissance Humanism

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:19.081
was beginning to take form.

00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:21.764
Florentine intellectuals began to spread the idea

00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:25.015
of reformulating classical Greek and Roman works,

00:02:25.015 --> 00:02:28.294
while placing greater value on individual creativity

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:30.434
than collective production.

00:02:30.434 --> 00:02:32.089
A few brave painters,

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:33.213
who for many centuries,

00:02:33.213 --> 00:02:35.354
had been paid by the square foot,

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:37.516
successfully petitioned their patrons

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:41.182
to pay them on the basis of merit instead.

00:02:41.182 --> 00:02:42.765
Within a single generation,

00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:45.517
people's attitudes about objects and their makers

00:02:45.517 --> 00:02:47.229
would shift dramatically,

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.898
such that in 1550,

00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:50.265
Giorgio Vasari,

00:02:50.265 --> 00:02:52.985
not incidentally a friend of Michelangelo,

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:55.069
published an influential book called,

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.182
"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects,"

00:02:59.182 --> 00:03:00.955
elevating these types of creators

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:05.990
to rock star status by sharing juicy biographical details.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.541
In the mind of the public,

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.250
painting, sculpture and architecture

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.045
were now considered art,

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:15.548
and their makers creative masterminds: artists.

00:03:15.548 --> 00:03:17.219
Meanwhile, those who maintained

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.387
guild traditions and faithfully produced

00:03:19.387 --> 00:03:21.421
candelsticks, ceramic vessels,

00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:23.835
gold jewelery or wrought iron gates,

00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:26.170
would be known communally as artisans,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.648
and their works considered minor or decorative arts,

00:03:29.648 --> 00:03:31.649
connoting an inferior status

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:33.359
and solidifying the distinction

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.629
between art and craft that still persists

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.281
in the Western world.

00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:40.281
So, if we consider a painting

00:03:40.281 --> 00:03:43.105
by Rembrandt or Picasso art,

00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:45.837
then where does that leave an African mask?

00:03:45.837 --> 00:03:47.455
A Chinese porclein vase?

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:49.246
A Navajo rug?

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:51.253
It turns out that in the history of art,

00:03:51.253 --> 00:03:53.251
the value placed on innovation

00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:55.796
is the exception rather than the rule.

00:03:55.796 --> 00:03:57.170
In many cultures of the world,

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.825
the distinction between art and craft

00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:00.467
has never existed.

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:03.262
In fact, some works that might be considered craft,

00:04:03.262 --> 00:04:04.825
a Peruvian rug,

00:04:04.825 --> 00:04:06.325
a Ming Dynasty vase,

00:04:06.325 --> 00:04:07.560
a totem pole,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.741
are considered the cultures' preeminent visual forms.

00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:14.071
When art historians of the 19th Century

00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:16.574
saw that the art of some non-Western cultures

00:04:16.574 --> 00:04:19.324
did not change for thousands of years,

00:04:19.324 --> 00:04:22.159
they classified the works as primitive,

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.492
suggesting that their makers were incapable of innovating

00:04:25.492 --> 00:04:28.953
and therefore were not really artists.

00:04:28.953 --> 00:04:30.493
What they didn't realize was that

00:04:30.493 --> 00:04:33.659
these makers were not seeking to innovate at all.

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.796
The value of their works lay precisely

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:37.629
in preserving visual traditions,

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.992
rather than in changing them.

00:04:39.992 --> 00:04:41.824
In the last few decades, works such as

00:04:41.824 --> 00:04:44.263
quilts, ceramics and wood carvings

00:04:44.263 --> 00:04:46.682
have become more prominently included

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:48.559
in art history textbooks

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:49.893
and displayed in museums

00:04:49.893 --> 00:04:52.524
alongside paintings and sculpture.

00:04:52.524 --> 00:04:55.065
So maybe it's time to dispense with vague terms

00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:56.579
like art and craft

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:58.991
in favor of a word like visual arts

00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:02.909
that encompasses a wider array of aesthetic production.

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.537
After all, if our appreciation of objects

00:05:05.537 --> 00:05:07.241
and their makers is so conditioned

00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.400
by our culture and history,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.316
then art and its definition

00:05:11.316 --> 00:05:14.483
are truly in the eye of the beholder.
