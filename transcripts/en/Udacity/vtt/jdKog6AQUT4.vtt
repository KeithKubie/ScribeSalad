00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And now for the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The correct answer after all we've discussed, of course, is relevant,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
meaning that every single information that remains in the input,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
changes the outcome if it is changed as well.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If we say that Mozilla crashes with these 8 characters,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
removing any of these characters changes the outcome.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Therefore, all of these 8 characters are relevant for the failure of Mozilla.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Of course, this input also is simple, but this is not necessarily always the case.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You can have very, very complex failures where lots and lots of information is relevant

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but still hard to understand and therefore not necessarily simple.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Everything is correct. I don't know what a correct input is.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This cannot be generalized.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Elegant? Well, I'm not sure what an elegant test case is.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
There is elegant code and elegant fixes,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but this does not necessarily apply.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So, the correct answer is relevant.
