00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.510
Is the proportion true or false
that 3/12 or 3:12 is

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.300
equal to 5/35 or 5:35?

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.010
Now to figure this out, we
just have to figure out

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.370
whether these are equivalent
fractions, and the easiest way

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.670
to do that, is to put both of
them in simplified form, and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.380
see if we get the same answer.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.660
So let's try with 3/12 first.
So if we have 3/12, both the

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.400
numerator and the denominator
are divisible by 3.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.090
So let's divide by 3.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.920
So divide the numerator by
3, and let's divide the

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.490
denominator by 3.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.930
We get 3 divided by 3 is 1.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.120
12 divided by 3 is 4.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.460
So 3/12 is the same
thing is 1/4.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.290
Now let's try do the same
thing for 5/35.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.640
5 over 35-- I'm leaving some
space so we can divide-- well,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.550
these are both divisible by 5,
so let's divide the numerator

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.230
and the denominator by 5.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.950
So if we divide the numerator by
5 and the denominator by 5,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.480
the numerator, 5 divided
by 5 is 1, and then 35

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.420
divided by 5 is 7.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.170
So this thing is equivalent to
saying that 1/4 is equal to

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.930
1/7, which is clearly
not true.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.880
This is clearly not true, so
the proportion is false.
