00:00:01.413 --> 00:00:03.297
Yeah.

00:00:03.297 --> 00:00:04.650
Nancy, I didn't bring my wallet.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.182
You going to buy
me a cup of joe?

00:00:06.182 --> 00:00:07.030
I got it.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.900
The amazing thing to me, though,
about the University of Arizona

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.510
is the comprehensive
nature of the scholarship.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.290
So that the cardiologists
can go across campus and work

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.240
with the psychologists
and the brain

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.084
people is really
pretty extraordinary.

00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:22.500
And at the same time, we're
working with the chemists, who

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.610
are helping us design the drug.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.760
I mean, that's amazing.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.254
You don't find that
just at any university,

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:29.420
that level of collaboration.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.170
In fact, you find is
so rarely, they can't

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.006
deal with it at the NIH, right?

00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:36.029
That's exactly right.

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:38.070
And your students are
going to get-- in post-docs

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.480
get such experiences.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.299
Your post-docs working
with cardiologists,

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:42.590
that doesn't happen very often.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.500
No.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.270
And to your credit,
Meredith, you're

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.420
the person who initially
straddled the barriers

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.370
and said, I'm
interested in both.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.080
Let's do some work.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.240
And that's the most fun
type of science to do

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.774
is when you get to
do bigger things.

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:56.940
And nobody else is doing it.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.960
Like you said, the NIH,
it's an important area,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.660
but they're like,
where do we put it?

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.165
Right.

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:02.623
They don't know
what to do with it.

00:01:02.623 --> 00:01:03.490
Yeah.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.459
Hopefully they'll fund it again.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.250
The next one, yeah.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.083
The next one, right?

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:07.750
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.220
Well, and I mean, you've got
at it with your students.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.940
The ability to learn
from people who

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.030
think completely differently
from you improves your science,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.720
don't you think?

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.940
I mean, you just
expand your horizons

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.380
because you're
dealing with people

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.900
who aren't like all the
people you've dealt with.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.740
Did you ever notice that
everyone we're working with

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.780
is a woman?

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.800
That's true.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.054
I mean, that's pretty unique.

00:01:34.054 --> 00:01:34.553
Yeah.

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:36.010
Pretty exciting.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.940
We have one male
collaborator at NIH.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.660
But everybody else on this
team pretty much is female.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.970
That's unique.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.990
This is a cool place to
work because of that.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.490
Yes.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.250
Yeah.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.190
And for me, it's just
probably the most

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.920
fun I've ever had in my
life in terms of science.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.050
Instead of just always
testing mice and rats,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.550
actually getting
to work with humans

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.000
and making a
difference possibly.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.666
It's going to be
really exciting for me.

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:03.730
Also I'm always struck that
whenever we having a meeting

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.290
together, we start
laughing and joking.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.729
Our staff doesn't think
it's very funny, though.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.710
They're all sitting
there like stone faced,

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.160
like, they think we're weird.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.412
They don't laugh or cry, right?

00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:20.100
But it's ultimately good
role modeling, right,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.750
that we're having
fun doing what we do.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.841
It's not a job.

00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:24.340
Yeah.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.210
Right?

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.247
Well, it is a job,
but it's a fun job.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:28.205
It's a great job, yeah.

00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:28.704
Yeah.

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:30.544
I wouldn't want to
do anything else.

00:02:30.544 --> 00:02:32.200
Exactly.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.140
You're very, very laser focused.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.220
You don't have the luxury
of looking too far afield

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.130
and collaborating
too far afield.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.780
And I think that's
something that we

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.880
need to give young
scientists, whether it's

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.840
a post-docs or a junior
faculty, credit and opportunity

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.070
to look far afield.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.310
Because when I started and you
started, you did psychology

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.870
or you did cardiology
or medicine,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.786
and you didn't think
about anything else other

00:02:54.786 --> 00:02:56.230
than that for neuroscience.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.699
So now how do we actually reward
faculty for collaborating?

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.490
It's not all about just
being first author.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.781
It's about being second author.

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:03.360
Team science.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.960
Team science.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.310
So we have to reward team
science in ways that we

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.800
haven't done in the past.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.710
Imagine if we could actually
decrease the number of patients

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.880
who experience these cognitive
impairments after surgery

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.120
and don't go through delirium.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.380
And then beyond that, if
we can decrease the risk

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.810
for them developing
Alzheimer's disease,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.210
that would be the
apex of my career.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.060
There's no question about it.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.910
And also, I think if we can find
that this drug doesn't just--

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.350
It's not just for heart failure
patients, but aging patients,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.960
anybody who has
surgery and who's older

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.467
and has the chance of
cognitive impairment.

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:54.800
It might be effective in a
number of different patients.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.258
I mean, that would
just be stunning

00:03:56.258 --> 00:03:59.500
if actually we can bend that
curve of cognitive decline.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.340
Yeah.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.080
Well, as a clinical
trialist, I think

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.970
about a lot of clinical
trials I've been involved in

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.830
and drugs that we've proved
work in heart disease.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.220
Doctors don't prescribe
the drugs often.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.690
It's not taken up.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.380
You know, well,
it's one more drug.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.260
Really how good is it?

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.100
How much better?

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.449
Even if people are dying
at a much lower rate

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.240
in the clinical trial,
it takes a long time

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.830
to convince the community.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.250
I think if this drug worked,
convincing the community would

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.300
not be hard.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.510
People understand cognitive
dysfunction and memory

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.800
impairment and how
horrible it is.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.160
But here is a condition where
there's no therapy at all.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.300
If we had something, this would
be prescribed rapidly, I think,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.190
and taken up very rapidly.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.260
And having that kind
of impact, to me,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.600
after watching how slow medicine
evolves, would be really--

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.100
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.660
A joy.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.340
It'd be really exciting.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.839
Yeah.

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:51.490
Yeah.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.556
I agree.

00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:53.895
Well, it's been a great ride.

00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:54.561
Here to success.

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:55.520
That's right.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.390
Let's keep it going.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.030
Here's to the next grant.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.880
That's right.
