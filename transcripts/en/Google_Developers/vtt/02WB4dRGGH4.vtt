00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:05.901
man:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:08.267
please welcome Chief Executive
Officer of Google,

00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:10.834
Dr. Eric Schmidt.

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:11.934
Schmidt: Thank you.

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:15.133
[applause]

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.234
Thank you all.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
First let me start
by welcoming everybody.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.400
Many of you traveled
a long distance

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.634
to come here
to, uh, spend two days with us

00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:28.968
to talk about the thing
I like the most,

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:30.901
which is programming.

00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:34.300
And let me tell you
that it's time.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.501
It's time for us
to take advantage

00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:40.067
of the amazing opportunity
that is before us.

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:41.334
And that's what I want
to talk about

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:43.367
for just a few minutes.

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:44.767
Today and tomorrow,

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:47.033
you're going to have interesting
product announcements,

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:50.200
some fun stuff,
and perhaps most important,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.667
you're gonna spend time

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:53.567
with the best programmers
in the world

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:54.701
who are here in the room.

00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:55.934
Literally you all.

00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:58.601
And we're very excited
to have you here.

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:02.334
Uh, from my perspective,
it's time.

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:04.934
We have spent 20 years

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:08.834
trying to build
a programming model

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:10.467
that's the right one.

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:11.968
We started
with the mainframe model.

00:01:11.968 --> 00:01:13.467
Then we moved
to the PC model.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:17.567
And it had brilliant parts
and very frustrating parts.

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:19.434
And then
the internet arrived.

00:01:19.434 --> 00:01:21.067
And internet programming.

00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:23.334
The way we think
about it now

00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:24.901
is something
we have all worked on

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:26.634
for all of our career.

00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:28.167
It's time.

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:29.567
Why is it time?

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:32.367
We finally now have
the networks,

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:35.133
the businesses,
the programmers,

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.968
the programming tools,

00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:39.234
that can build
the kind of platforms

00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:43.834
and the kind of opportunities
that I want to highlight.

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:45.868
Today and tomorrow,
you're going to hear a lot

00:01:45.868 --> 00:01:48.601
about some
of the Google technologies

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:50.100
many of you,
you--you are already using.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.567
For example,
Google Web--Web Toolkit.

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:52.834
You know, we used
to say "write once,

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:54.934
run anywhere with Java"
back in my old--

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:56.400
in my old job.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.501
Now it's write "write once,
run on any browser," right?

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:01.701
Uh, because the browsers
have become so complicated.

00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:04.033
That's what GWT
is all about.

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:05.701
We're going to see
a lot more things

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.968
about a product
called App Engine,

00:02:07.968 --> 00:02:09.601
which now today includes,
by the way,

00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:11.667
support for Java, right,
which is great,

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:13.868
and more,
presumably, coming.

00:02:13.868 --> 00:02:18.434
The notion of these platforms
as powerful platforms

00:02:18.434 --> 00:02:21.567
are part of a story
that's been true forever.

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:24.701
And it's a story that innovation
always occurs elsewhere.

00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:27.501
It never is in the little world
that I sit in

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:28.501
or that you sit in.

00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:30.167
It's always somewhere else.

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:33.567
There's always a programmer,
an inventor,

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:35.400
a brilliant person

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.501
who's somewhere other than
where you are.

00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:40.000
They need to use a platform
that you build.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.501
They need, for example,
to be able to use a platform

00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:44.667
even if they don't
speak English

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:46.400
and even if they don't
really understand

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.367
some of the other things
that you've done,

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:51.968
but because they have an idea
and they have a vision.

00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:53.801
And maybe they use
the wrong operating system

00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:54.968
or they have
the wrong background

00:02:54.968 --> 00:02:56.234
or whatever,

00:02:56.234 --> 00:02:57.901
but they're clever
and they're smart.

00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:59.734
And that's
how innovation occurs.

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:03.267
It's always been true
and it will always be true.

00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:05.667
And that's why
we're here today.

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:07.667
Maybe you're here
to talk about Android

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:09.834
and some of the things
that we're doing there.

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:12.267
Android looks like it's going
to have a very strong year.

00:03:12.267 --> 00:03:14.167
Not only do we have
many thousands

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:15.300
of applications now

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.567
as part of our Android
application store,

00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:19.400
but we also have
many hardware partners

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.868
that are coming along

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:23.100
to build innovative
new hardware platforms

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.234
which look like phones,

00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:25.601
but do a lot of things

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.200
that--that are not
normally associated with phones.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.300
Again, the innovation cycle
continues.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.100
So what we want you to do
is we want you here

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.734
to spend your time
with our teams and vice versa

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:39.434
and yourselves
with each other

00:03:39.434 --> 00:03:42.634
to try to figure out
what we can do now.

00:03:42.634 --> 00:03:45.000
So why is it time?
Why is it time?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.133
Why is it time
to take the challenge?

00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:49.033
Because people
are frustrated.

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:50.701
They're tired
of the complexity

00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:52.334
of all of the systems
that have been built up

00:03:52.334 --> 00:03:54.334
over the last 10, 20 years.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.734
They don't work that well.

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:57.501
Where's the "it works"
option?

00:03:57.501 --> 00:04:00.434
Where's the button where it
just installs and works?

00:04:00.434 --> 00:04:03.634
Why do we keep adding complexity
after complexity in our--

00:04:03.634 --> 00:04:04.968
in our world?

00:04:04.968 --> 00:04:08.334
Well, here's an opportunity
using Ajax programming,

00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:09.834
the new programming
languages,

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:12.033
the new programming paradigm
that we're going to talk about

00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:15.968
in the next couple of days
to build another step higher.

00:04:15.968 --> 00:04:18.934
To bring another level
of functionality

00:04:18.934 --> 00:04:23.334
that ultimately means power
can generate simplicity

00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:25.033
and ultimately
make these systems

00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:26.901
simpler and easier to use

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:29.834
by the people we serve
who are not programmers.

00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:31.434
They're not computer
scientists.

00:04:31.434 --> 00:04:33.534
They're not engineers.

00:04:33.534 --> 00:04:34.834
I'm one of these people
who believes

00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:35.834
that computer science

00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:37.801
is at the center
of the universe.

00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:39.167
I'm one of these people
who believes

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:44.100
that what we do as scientists,
as programmers,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.567
as people who care
about making the world

00:04:45.567 --> 00:04:46.934
a better place,

00:04:46.934 --> 00:04:48.334
can really scale.

00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:51.300
I'm a person who believes
that scalability

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.234
and the power as r--
as evidenced by the power

00:04:53.234 --> 00:04:55.901
of the internet
is just beginning.

00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:59.501
And I would tell you
that we're just at the beginning

00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:01.167
of getting this right.

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:03.434
When we talk
about cloud computing,

00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:05.801
we talk about all
the new kinds of devices,

00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:10.167
you're seeing a whole new set
of companies, ideas,

00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:12.234
product solutions,
competitors.

00:05:12.234 --> 00:05:15.501
All sorts of things all coming
from this shared vision

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:17.567
around a new
programming model.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:18.801
It's not the old
programming model

00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:20.601
where I was handed a book
and said program

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:22.901
against these interfaces
against this standard OS

00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:25.067
and everything
will work locally.

00:05:25.067 --> 00:05:27.133
But it's a similar model

00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:29.868
where I can go pick
the very best

00:05:29.868 --> 00:05:31.133
of this code
and that code.

00:05:31.133 --> 00:05:33.400
Put it together.
Mash it if you will.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.934
Have it automatically
compiled.

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:38.133
And have it deliver
tremendous performance

00:05:38.133 --> 00:05:39.634
for all of us.

00:05:39.634 --> 00:05:42.300
With this, we can take
the collective intelligence

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.567
of the internet,
which is astounding--

00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:47.167
all the information,
all those things going on--

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:48.968
and do amazing things.

00:05:48.968 --> 00:05:51.167
We can tell people
what's going to happen.

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:52.767
We can tell people
what's happening nearby.

00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:55.267
We can follow
what they care about.

00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:56.400
As you walk down the street,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.000
we can tell them the history
of the buildings

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.467
as we walk along.

00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:02.868
We can do image recognition
to sort of see what's happening.

00:06:02.868 --> 00:06:06.734
All of these are applications
that someone in this room

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:08.734
has already built.

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:11.400
All of you are busy building
the version 2

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.033
of all of those kinds
of things.

00:06:13.033 --> 00:06:14.767
It's phenomenal.

00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:17.934
So my message to you
is this is the beginning

00:06:17.934 --> 00:06:20.300
of the real win
of cloud computing.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.801
Of the real win
of applications.

00:06:22.801 --> 00:06:24.634
Of the real win
of the internet,

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.434
which is changing
the computing paradigm--

00:06:27.434 --> 00:06:29.400
the one that we've all
grown up with--

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.801
so it just works.

00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:32.901
It works no matter what device
you're using,

00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:34.901
whatever operating system
you're using,

00:06:34.901 --> 00:06:36.667
as long as you're connected--

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:39.234
and even if you're no--
offline with some caching,

00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:41.267
you're on and you have
everything you need.

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:44.667
That's the promise
of our new web computing model,

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:46.400
which we're all
talking about.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.667
We're going to show you
some amazing technology

00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:50.367
and some amazing partnerships
that we've done

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:51.834
in the next hour and a half.

00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:54.200
I'm delighted
that you're here

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.033
and I'm excited
about what we're doing.

00:06:56.033 --> 00:06:58.701
And I want to take a minute
to thank you for coming

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:00.968
and also introduce
Vic Gundrota,

00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:02.534
who's the executive
who's in charge

00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:04.601
of all of our develop programs,
all of our mobile programs,

00:07:04.601 --> 00:07:05.868
and lots of our businesses.

00:07:05.868 --> 00:07:06.868
Vic, can you join me
on stage?

00:07:06.868 --> 00:07:08.100
Thank you very much.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.834
Gundrota: Thank you, Eric.
Schmidt: Take care, Vic.

00:07:09.834 --> 00:07:11.267
Gundrota: Appreciate it.
Schmidt: Thanks.

00:07:11.267 --> 00:07:12.667
Gundrota: Thank you.
Schmidt: Thank you.

00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:16.100
[applause]

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.901
Gundrota: Thank you for those
opening comments, Eric.

00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:22.267
And good morning, everybody.
Welcome to I/O.

00:07:22.267 --> 00:07:25.534
Never underestimate the web.

00:07:25.534 --> 00:07:28.734
It's a mistake
that I once made.

00:07:28.734 --> 00:07:30.167
It was about a half
a decade ago

00:07:30.167 --> 00:07:33.834
and I was leading a team
at Microsoft responsible

00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:37.067
for driving the developer
adoption of Windows.

00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:39.801
Of course we had seen
the emergence of the web.

00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:45.300
But we argued that web apps
could never rival desktop apps.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.400
In fact, our favorite
and our canonical example

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.968
was from a small Bay Area
company called Keyhole.

00:07:52.968 --> 00:07:54.801
Keyhole had made the fan--

00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:57.667
most fantastic
geovisualization software

00:07:57.667 --> 00:07:58.934
for Windows.

00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:01.400
And it was exactly
that kind of software

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.534
that we argued
could never be done on the web.

00:08:05.534 --> 00:08:07.667
In November of 2004,

00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:10.434
Google acquired
that small company

00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:13.968
and a few months later
released maps.google.com

00:08:13.968 --> 00:08:15.334
with satellite views.

00:08:15.334 --> 00:08:19.167
A web app
that simply left us stunned.

00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:21.300
Maybe you remember
the first time you

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.467
from any browser
were able to zoom down

00:08:23.467 --> 00:08:25.300
into your own backyard.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.467
You know, Google Apps--
Google Maps was amazing--

00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:29.968
is amazing.

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:33.634
But what was even more important
was what that application

00:08:33.634 --> 00:08:35.234
was foretelling.

00:08:35.234 --> 00:08:37.033
That we would see
what we formerly thought

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:40.267
was impossible
become possible,

00:08:40.267 --> 00:08:42.934
even commonplace
in the browser.

00:08:42.934 --> 00:08:46.234
Yes, the web has won.

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:50.400
It has become the dominant
programming model of our time.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.734
In many respects,
this conference, Google I/O,

00:08:52.734 --> 00:08:56.000
is about a celebration
of that open web platform.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.667
And this morning,
I'd like to talk to you

00:08:57.667 --> 00:09:01.000
about the ongoing evolution
of--of the web.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.200
Of making a more powerful web
made easier.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.968
And this morning's keynote
is broken up

00:09:06.968 --> 00:09:08.868
into two broad sections.

00:09:08.868 --> 00:09:10.067
In the opening section,

00:09:10.067 --> 00:09:11.400
I'm going to show you,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.734
uh, what's making the web
more powerful.

00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:16.467
Some new HTML 5 standards

00:09:16.467 --> 00:09:18.534
that are enabling us
to build applications

00:09:18.534 --> 00:09:21.300
that I think
will surprise users.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.834
And in the second half
of the keynote,

00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:26.133
I'm going to highlight
some Google services

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:29.667
that we believe can help you,
uh, build those apps

00:09:29.667 --> 00:09:30.767
much easier.

00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:33.434
So let's get started here.

00:09:33.434 --> 00:09:36.167
Let me find the clicker.

00:09:36.167 --> 00:09:38.267
You know, I think when you
look back over the last year--

00:09:38.267 --> 00:09:41.334
in fact, just the last
eight, nine months--

00:09:41.334 --> 00:09:43.334
you have to be amazed

00:09:43.334 --> 00:09:47.067
at the rate our web platform
is accelerating.

00:09:47.067 --> 00:09:48.901
It seems like almost
every other month,

00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:50.567
we've had a browser released

00:09:50.567 --> 00:09:53.167
even--either for the desktop
or for mobile.

00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:55.167
And these new browsers
are not just faster--

00:09:55.167 --> 00:09:57.000
I mean, of course
they're faster--

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.300
but even more importantly,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.334
these browsers are incorporating
.NET new functionality

00:10:02.334 --> 00:10:05.601
that, frankly, I'm not sure
most developers know about.
