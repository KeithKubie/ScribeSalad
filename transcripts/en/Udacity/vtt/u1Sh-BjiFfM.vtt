00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.240
In this lesson, we are discussing basics, statistics and

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.500
machine learning methods that you can use to analyze your

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.100
data. Not only can we draw conclusions that are statistically

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.040
sound about existing data, we can also make predictions about

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.300
the data that we might collect in the future. During

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.520
this lesson, we have chosen to really zero in on

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.080
a couple of methods. Specifically Welsh's T-test and linear regression

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.850
with gradient descent, but as you can imagine, this is

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.258
just the tip of the iceberg. There are tons of

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:32.250
statistics and machine learning techniques out there. If you're interested, I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.440
would really encourage you to go out there and read more

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.930
about those stats and machine learning. Now that you're familiar with

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.060
these statistics and machine learning techniques, you'll use them to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.150
make predictions about subway ridership in New York and also to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.950
draw some conclusions about the existing subway data that we have.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.870
Once you have made these conclusions and predictions you might find

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.920
that you'd really love to communicate them to other people.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.160
Be they your friends, or your teachers, or your family.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.900
One of the most effective ways to do that is

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.120
through data visualization. That's what we'll cover in the next lesson.
