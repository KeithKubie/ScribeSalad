KATHERINE KUAN:
The reason why I'm

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.950
an Android developer is
because of the platform's

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.010
massive reach.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.055
Building for Android means that
you can build something here

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:11.310
and it will reach people all
the way across the world.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.365
In fact, the next billion
people coming online

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:16.362
will interact with the internet
for the very first time using

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:17.700
only a mobile device.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.347
There's so many people who
are consumers of technology,

00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:21.930
but I think it's so
much more powerful

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.000
to be a creator of technology.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.100
Everyone has unique
experiences and strengths.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.390
And they can draw
on that and use

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.764
that to identify problems
in their community

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:34.260
and then use technology
to solve that.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.450
I really feel like there
is a big opportunity

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.270
to show people that
they can create

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.610
something really amazing.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.960
You can imagine something
that you think should exist,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.760
and you can actually
go and build it.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.412
I can't think of anything
more powerful than that.

00:00:48.412 --> 00:00:50.370
You can start your journey
to become an Android

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.250
developer today with Udacity
and Google's nanodegree.
