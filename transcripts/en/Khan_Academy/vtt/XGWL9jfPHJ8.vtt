00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:01.557
- [Voiceover] In the last video,

00:00:01.557 --> 00:00:04.459
we had just started to get into meiosis,

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:06.398
and to be more precise, meiosis I,

00:00:06.398 --> 00:00:08.964
and to be even more precise
than that, prophase I,

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:11.018
but we spent a good bit
of time on prophase I

00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:12.783
because some interesting things happened.

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:15.198
Some things happened just
like prophase in mitosis where

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:19.226
the nuclear envelope disappears
or starts to disappear,

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:23.022
you have the chromosomes
going into their dense form

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:24.705
that has kinda this classic shape that you

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:26.505
could see from a microscope,

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:29.395
but what was unique or
what was interesting

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:32.820
about meiosis I and
prophase I in particular

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.479
is that you have this
chromosomal crossover,

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:39.484
that is a pretty typical
thing to happen in meiosis I,

00:00:39.484 --> 00:00:43.303
and it tends to happen
in a fairly clean way

00:00:43.303 --> 00:00:47.238
where homologous sections
of these homologous pairs

00:00:47.238 --> 00:00:51.329
crossover, so these
sections of the chromosome

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.139
tend to code for the same genes.

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:55.892
They're just different
variants of those same genes.

00:00:55.892 --> 00:00:57.343
They might have different alleles,

00:00:57.343 --> 00:00:59.653
and then once again, this
just adds more variation

00:00:59.653 --> 00:01:02.277
as we get into sexual reproduction,

00:01:02.277 --> 00:01:04.970
so it's a kind of neat
thing that happens here.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.036
But now let's continue with meiosis,

00:01:07.036 --> 00:01:09.718
and in particular meiosis
I, and you could guess

00:01:09.718 --> 00:01:11.993
what the next phase is going to be called.

00:01:11.993 --> 00:01:16.993
It is metaphase I, metaphase, metaphase I,

00:01:17.554 --> 00:01:21.814
and it has some similarities
with metaphase in mitosis.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:24.943
So in metaphase I, let me draw my cell,

00:01:25.727 --> 00:01:30.231
so this is the cellular
membrane right over there.

00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:32.413
I have my centrosomes,
which are now going to play

00:01:32.413 --> 00:01:34.800
more significant roles.

00:01:35.153 --> 00:01:38.032
The nuclear membrane is now gone,

00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:41.527
and just like in metaphase in mitosis,

00:01:41.527 --> 00:01:43.674
my chromosomes are going to line up

00:01:43.674 --> 00:01:48.225
along the, here I'll draw it,
kind of this up, down axis.

00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:49.595
So let's do that.

00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:52.956
So you have this one right over here.

00:01:53.774 --> 00:01:57.182
This is one chromosome,
two sister chromatids,

00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:58.905
and we had the chromosomal crossover,

00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:00.507
so it has a little bit of pink here.

00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:01.285
I'm gonna take a little bit of time

00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:03.189
to switch colors a little
bit more frequently.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.685
And then you have the one,
at least most of which

00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:07.792
you got from your mother,

00:02:07.972 --> 00:02:09.063
yeah but there's been a little bit

00:02:09.063 --> 00:02:12.134
of chromosomal crossover here as well.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.096
So let me draw that.

00:02:14.403 --> 00:02:15.587
Let me draw that.

00:02:15.587 --> 00:02:17.004
And then you have this one,

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:19.082
and just for the sake of,

00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:23.221
so you have this one, this
chromosome from your father.

00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:26.692
It has replicated, so it's
now two sister chromatids.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.661
And this one from your mother,

00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:30.226
and I'm not gonna show the
chromosomal crossover here.

00:02:30.226 --> 00:02:32.171
Maybe it didn't happen over here.

00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:34.818
No homologous recombination over here.

00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:37.360
So these are, I guess, shorter.

00:02:38.248 --> 00:02:40.379
Now let me draw the centromeres.

00:02:40.605 --> 00:02:43.095
The centromeres I started
doing in this blue color.

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:47.442
So the centromeres, the centromeres,

00:02:47.442 --> 00:02:48.824
and then the centrosomes,

00:02:48.824 --> 00:02:51.262
you have these microtubules that start,

00:02:51.262 --> 00:02:54.303
they can push the centrosomes
away from each other.

00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:58.529
But they also attach at the
kinetochores to the chromosomes,

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.629
to the chromosomes, just like that.

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.146
And these are, the microtubules,
you'll see people talk

00:03:05.146 --> 00:03:07.398
about oh these connect, and they're able

00:03:07.398 --> 00:03:08.223
to move things around,

00:03:08.223 --> 00:03:10.579
but I find this incredible
that you just have

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.447
a bunch of proteins through
just kind of chemical

00:03:13.447 --> 00:03:17.986
and thermodynamic processes,

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:19.901
are able to do really interesting things

00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:24.684
like move chromosomes to
different parts of the cell,

00:03:24.684 --> 00:03:27.401
so that we eventually can
get these gametes that can

00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.965
participate in sexual reproduction.

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:32.300
This is an amazing thing,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.300
and it's developed over
billions of years of evolution,

00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:41.157
but it's just mind boggling
to think about the complexity,

00:03:41.157 --> 00:03:42.504
and not all of this is
completely understood

00:03:42.504 --> 00:03:43.874
exactly how all of this works.

00:03:43.874 --> 00:03:45.836
I mean you have these
kind of motor proteins

00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:50.836
that help move the chromosomes
along, these microtubules

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.753
can elongate and shorten
in interesting ways.

00:03:53.753 --> 00:03:55.761
So it's a really fascinating process.

00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:58.733
But anyway, this is what's
happening in metaphase I.

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:01.252
Now you can probably guess
what happens after that.

00:04:01.252 --> 00:04:03.632
We then move to anaphase I.

00:04:03.632 --> 00:04:06.581
So let me, we now go to anaphase I.

00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:08.004
I'll write that over here.

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:11.533
Anaphase, anaphase I,

00:04:12.014 --> 00:04:14.881
and just like anaphase in mitosis,

00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:19.072
over here, the chromosomes
start getting pulled apart,

00:04:19.072 --> 00:04:21.893
except for one significant difference,

00:04:21.893 --> 00:04:24.349
and this is actually a very
significant difference.

00:04:24.378 --> 00:04:29.378
In mitosis, the sister
chromatids get pulled apart.

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.121
The sister chromatids get pulled apart

00:04:32.121 --> 00:04:34.779
to become two daughter chromosomes.

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.554
That does not happen in anaphase I.

00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:41.849
In anaphase I, the sister
chromatids stay together.

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.942
It's the homologous pairs
that get pulled apart.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.370
So let me draw that.

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:49.952
So this homologous pair
up here gets pulled apart.

00:04:49.952 --> 00:04:52.959
The two sister chromatids do
not get pulled apart here.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.901
So you have this one is
getting pulled onto this side.

00:04:57.533 --> 00:05:00.017
So this one's getting
pulled onto this side.

00:05:00.017 --> 00:05:03.395
It has a little bit from the original,

00:05:03.395 --> 00:05:06.037
so a little bit of that right over there.

00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:09.102
And then you have this one
getting pulled on this side.

00:05:09.548 --> 00:05:14.517
So draw it the best I can, the colors,

00:05:14.517 --> 00:05:15.515
alright, so it looks like that,

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:17.628
although it's nice to have,
it's kinda easy to keep track of

00:05:17.628 --> 00:05:19.787
cause these switch colors like that.

00:05:19.787 --> 00:05:22.824
And then you have this one
getting pulled on this side.

00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:25.035
This one getting pulled on this side.

00:05:25.035 --> 00:05:30.035
And finally finally this one
getting pulled onto that side.

00:05:32.372 --> 00:05:34.728
And let me draw the centrosomes.

00:05:34.728 --> 00:05:37.410
So that's my, oops, centrosome,

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.290
and once again, it's pulling,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.844
or I guess you could say the
chromosomes are being moved

00:05:41.844 --> 00:05:43.667
and these things are
pushing each other apart.

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:45.072
The two centrosomes might be pushing apart

00:05:45.072 --> 00:05:48.671
to get to the opposite
ends of the actual cell,

00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:50.609
but they're bringing,

00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:52.165
there's all sorts of
interesting mechanisms

00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:54.313
that are bringing along
these microtubules,

00:05:54.313 --> 00:05:56.530
bringing the chromosomes,

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.794
once again splitting the homologous pairs.

00:05:58.794 --> 00:06:00.732
And how they split is random.

00:06:00.732 --> 00:06:02.926
You know, this pink one could
have been on the right side,

00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:04.087
this orange one could have
been on the left side,

00:06:04.087 --> 00:06:05.388
or vice versa, and once again,

00:06:05.388 --> 00:06:10.388
this adds more variation
amongst the gametes,

00:06:12.365 --> 00:06:15.685
so even all of the resulting
gametes that get produced,

00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:19.423
they all will have different
genetic information.

00:06:19.423 --> 00:06:20.932
So this is anaphase I.

00:06:20.932 --> 00:06:22.209
You're pulling these apart, and

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:25.315
then you could imagine what
happens in telophase I.

00:06:25.332 --> 00:06:30.332
So telophase I, telophase, telophase I.

00:06:32.564 --> 00:06:36.553
Telophase I, and this is fairly analogous

00:06:36.553 --> 00:06:39.502
to what happens in mitosis in telophase.

00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:44.221
So now you have your
cytokinesis is beginning,

00:06:44.412 --> 00:06:47.001
and actually, it might even begin earlier,

00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:49.811
in mitosis it happens
as early as anaphase,

00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:51.540
at least the cytokinesis is starting,

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.119
but you're starting to see that.

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:58.119
The homologous pairs
are fully split apart,

00:06:58.378 --> 00:06:59.794
and they're at opposite ends,

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:03.451
and actually they can begin to unravel

00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:04.856
into their chromatin state,

00:07:04.856 --> 00:07:09.856
so this one began to unravel
into its chromatin state.

00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:12.327
It has a little bit of the magenta.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.877
Oops, it has a little bit of
the magenta right over here.

00:07:17.278 --> 00:07:19.530
This is unravelling as well.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.177
This is unravelling like that,

00:07:22.177 --> 00:07:24.127
once it gets into its chromatin state.

00:07:24.127 --> 00:07:28.376
The cellular, and let me
do the other ones as well.

00:07:28.376 --> 00:07:32.207
So this is this one right over here.

00:07:32.207 --> 00:07:34.686
It's beginning to unravel.

00:07:35.248 --> 00:07:39.114
This one over here, beginning to unravel.

00:07:39.114 --> 00:07:41.384
It's got a bit of orange on it.

00:07:41.668 --> 00:07:42.968
It's got a little bit of orange on it.

00:07:42.968 --> 00:07:45.847
The nuclear membrane begins to form again.

00:07:45.847 --> 00:07:50.822
The nuclear membrane begins to form again.

00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:54.368
In some ways, it's reversing
what happened in prophase I

00:07:54.368 --> 00:07:55.750
where the nuclear membrane disappeared,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.159
and the chromosomes condensed.

00:07:58.524 --> 00:08:03.522
And let me draw, let me
draw the centrosomes,

00:08:03.632 --> 00:08:06.732
which are outside the nuclear
membrane, just like that.

00:08:06.732 --> 00:08:09.664
And the microtubules are also dissolving.

00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:11.747
The microtubules are also dissolving.

00:08:11.747 --> 00:08:14.591
And you have your cytokinesis.

00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:17.006
So your cytokinesis, so these separate.

00:08:17.006 --> 00:08:20.379
These separate into two cells.

00:08:20.512 --> 00:08:22.311
So once again, when we did the overview

00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:26.406
of meiosis, we said look,
the first phase of meisosis,

00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:31.406
you go from a diploid germ
cell to two haploid cells.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.283
And these aren't quite
our end product yet.

00:08:35.283 --> 00:08:37.546
This right over here, what
we have just gone through,

00:08:37.546 --> 00:08:39.323
what we have just gone through,

00:08:39.323 --> 00:08:42.608
all of this combined that
we have just gone through,

00:08:42.608 --> 00:08:44.268
this is meiosis I.

00:08:44.268 --> 00:08:48.482
And in the next video, we're
gonna go through meiosis II.

00:08:48.482 --> 00:08:50.775
Whoops, I didn't mean to do that.

00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:56.141
This is, so let's see,
all of this is meiosis I.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.610
Let me write that in a
different color, in bold.

00:09:00.103 --> 00:09:04.712
So this is all meiosis, meiosis I here,

00:09:04.712 --> 00:09:07.242
and you can see each of these cells now

00:09:07.242 --> 00:09:08.740
have a haploid number.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.186
They now have a haploid, haploid number

00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:15.183
of two chromosomes each.

00:09:15.183 --> 00:09:16.460
Now each of those two chromosomes

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.418
do have two sister chromatids,

00:09:20.418 --> 00:09:22.543
and as we'll see in meiosis II,

00:09:22.543 --> 00:09:24.598
which is very similar to mitosis,

00:09:24.598 --> 00:09:27.419
is going to split up the sister chromatids

00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:28.661
from each of these chromosomes,

00:09:28.661 --> 00:09:32.120
which gives us two daughter chromosomes.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.583
So we're gonna see that over here.

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:35.278
So your haploid number here is two.

00:09:35.278 --> 00:09:37.008
You have two chromosomes here and

00:09:37.008 --> 00:09:38.517
you have two chromosomes there.

00:09:38.517 --> 00:09:42.017
And we'll explore meiosis
II in the next video.
