00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.220
Let's

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.880
get going with more examples
of function problems, and

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.200
hopefully as we keep doing
this, you're going to get

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.665
the idea of how all
this stuff works.

00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:12.740
So let's do another problem.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.720
I'll use green this time.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.580
Let me clear everything.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.650
So I'll show you-- I showed you
that 1, you could define a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.920
function as just kind of a
standard algebraic expression,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.710
you could also do it a kind of
if number is odd, this is what

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.980
you do, if a number is
this, is what you do.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.030
You could also define
a function visually.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.810
Let's say-- let me draw a
graph, and I'll use the line

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.060
tool so it's a reasonably
neat graph-- that's

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.480
the x-axis there.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.380
That's pretty good.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.830
And let's draw the f of x-axis,
or you might be used to calling

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.650
that the y-axis, but-- OK.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.492
I almost had it vertical,
but let's see.

00:00:57.492 --> 00:00:59.490
Let's draw a few slashes here.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.740
And a couple here, like this.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.760
Sorry if you're getting bored
while I draw this graph.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.750
I should really have some
type of tool so that the

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.410
graphs just show up.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.830
Let me draw a-- let's
say that-- let me

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.500
draw this function.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.070
So this is what?

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.950
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, this is
negative 5, this is 5, this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.770
is 5, this is negative 5.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.410
And this is x-axis, and
this is-- we'll call

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.770
this the f of x-axis.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.460
Now that might not seem obvious
to you at first, but all this

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.210
is saying is let's say when x
is equal to negative 5, this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.450
function-- I'm creating a
function definition-- let's say

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:59.436
it equals 2, that's negative 1,
that stays the same, that stays

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:10.140
the same, then it goes to here,
and then it goes to here, to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.830
here, and then-- let's see.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.936
I hope I'm not boring you.

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.450
And it just keeps moving up.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.910
Let me see, what would
this look like-- this

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.820
would look like this.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.240
So if I-- you might think I'm
doing something very strange

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.930
right now, but just bear
with me while I draw this.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.983
I hope I don't
mess up too much.

00:02:32.983 --> 00:02:35.640
And, see, one like that.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.220
See one like that.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.630
So we're like, Sal, this is a
very strange looking graph.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.570
And it is.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.820
But what this is, is this
is a function definition.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.200
This tells you whenever I input
an x, at least for the x's that

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.660
we can see on the graph, this
graph tell me what

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.030
f of x equals.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.830
So if x is equal to negative
5, f of x would equal plus 2.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.230
And we could draw a
couple of examples.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.550
f of 0, well we go to 0 on
the x-axis, and we say

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.840
f of 0 is equal to 0.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.980
f of 1 is equal to-- well, we
go to x equal to 1, and we

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.800
just see where the chart is,
well, it equals negative 1.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.620
I think you get the idea.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.990
This isn't too difficult, but
this is a function definition.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.960
So we've defined this graph
right here as f of x.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.330
So if that graph-- that's the
graph of f of x, and let's say

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:41.230
that we define g of x is equal
to f of x-- let's say

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.620
it's equal to f of x
squared minus f of x.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:04:03.090
And let's say that h of x
is equal to 3 minus x.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:18.640
So what if I were to ask you,
what is h of g of negative 1?

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.120
So just like we did in the
previous problems, first we'll

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.590
say, well, let's try to figure
out what g of negative 1 is,

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.020
and then we can substitute
that into h of x.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:35.130
So g of negative 1 is equal
to-- and this is how I do it.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.390
There's no trick to it.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.360
Wherever you see the x, you
just substitute it with the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.940
number that you're saying
is now the value for x.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.680
So you say, well, that's equal
to f of negative 1 squared

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.240
minus f of negative 1.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.203
All I did is at g of negative
1, I just substituted

00:04:53.203 --> 00:04:56.050
it wherever I saw an x.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.190
Well what's f of negative 1?

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.740
Well, when x is equal
to negative 1, f of

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.620
x is equal to 1.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.300
So f of negative 1-- let's
write that, f of negative

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.660
1 is equal to 1.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.040
So g of negative 1 is equal
to-- well, that's just

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.940
1 squared minus 1,
well that equals 0.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.050
Because f of negative 1 is
1, so it's 1 squared minus

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.020
1 that equals 1 minus 1.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.500
0.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.940
So g of negative 1 is
0, so this is the

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.410
same thing as h of 0.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.070
Because g of negative 1,
we just figured out is 0.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.960
h of 0, we just take that 0 and
substitute it here, so it's 3

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.600
minus 0, so that just equals 3.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.660
And we solved the problem.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.710
Let's do another example, and I
don't want to erase my graph

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.470
since I took four minutes to
actually draw it, let me

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.230
erase what we just did here.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.500
And what you might want to do
after you watch it the first

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.710
time-- and this isn't true just
of this video, actually of all

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.080
the videos-- but especially the
functions, after watching it

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.890
once, you might want to rewatch
it and pause it right after I

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.380
give you the problem and try to
do it yourself, and then see--

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.600
and if you get stuck, you can
play it, or if you get an

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.150
answer, just you can play the
video and make sure that

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.630
we did the same way.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.205
Let's see.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.750
I'm going to create
another definition

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.640
for g of x this time.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.565
Let's say that g of x-- oh
whoops, I was trying to write

00:06:26.565 --> 00:06:38.440
in black-- let's say that
g of x is equal to f of x

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:51.000
squared plus f of x plus 2.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:07:01.380
So now, in this case, what is
g of-- let's pick a random

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.320
number-- what is g of minus--
no, let's pick a, let's

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.760
say-- what is g of minus 2?

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.290
After we try and pick a
number that we could find

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.820
an actual solution for.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.010
Well g of minus 2, wherever
we see the x, x is not

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.610
going to be minus 2.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:25.230
That is equal to f of
minus 2 squared plus

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.080
f of minus 2 plus 2.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.380
All we did is wherever we
saw an x, we substituted

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.090
it, minus 2 there.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.120
And let's simplify that.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.110
Well, f of minus 2 squared, we
know what minus 2 squared is,

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:45.270
that's the same thing as f of
4, plus f of minus 2 plus 2.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.670
That's 0.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.720
Plus f of 0.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.680
And now we just figure out
what f of 4 and f of 0 is.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.120
Well, f of 4, we go where x
equals r, it's right here,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.220
and when x equals 4,
f of 4 is equal to 2.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.210
So this is equal
to 2 plus f of 0.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.710
And just as a reminder, this
is the definition of f.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.560
We didn't define it in terms of
an algebraic expression, we

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.320
defined in terms of an
actual visual graph.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.290
So what's f of 0? f of 0 is 0.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.580
When x is equal to 0-- f of 0
is 0 so that's 2 plus 0-- so g

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.880
of negative 2 is equal to 2.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.110
An interesting thing, you might
want to make problems like this

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.330
for yourself and keep
experimenting with different

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.420
types of functions, and a very
interesting thing would

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.870
actually be to graph g of x,
and actually that's a

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:34.670
good idea, I think.

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.510
I think maybe we'll do that in
the future modules to kind of

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.330
play with functions and
actually to try graph

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.090
the functions and see
how they turn out.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.580
I will-- I don't know if I have
enough time-- actually, I'm

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.320
going to wait until the next
lecture to do a couple

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.250
more examples.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.940
I want to do as many examples
on the functions as I can with

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.410
you, because I think as you
keep watching and watching the

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.220
function problems and seeing
more and more variations on

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.170
functions, you'll see both how
general of a concept this is,

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.900
and hopefully you'll get an
idea of how the functions

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.170
actually work.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.290
Well, I'll see you in
the next lecture.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.780
Have fun.
