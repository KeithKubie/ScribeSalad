1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,300
And then go, Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.
Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

2
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:09,020
And today it's inheritance today. Yeah.
We're exploring questions of like, uh,

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,950
what can you pass down to your
kids in their kids? What can't you,

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,340
how much of you will echo into the
future and how much of you won't?

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,990
And I gotta say, I'm feeling pretty good
about this show so far because, well,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,420
if, uh, if, if a mother,

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,230
a little IRAP mother licking her
baby can have such a profound effect,

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,630
basically change the expression of the
genes in the baby. Well that's you.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,340
You think you can get deep down. Look,
in the end, what do I know? But, uh,

10
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,580
I take it that we have more control over
our destinies and our kids' destinies.

11
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:45,100
And we would have thought, well, let's
not get too excited too fast because, uh,

12
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,930
well we, we, we have a story
to tell. And this, this one,

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,790
this tale leaves me a little
queasy. Oh, there was a contact.

14
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:59,410
Hello? Hello. Yup, it's me. Oh, lamb.
This is Oola. Hi Libby. You get in.

15
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,790
I'm in public health,

16
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,930
the Karolinska Institute in Sweden
where he studies population data,

17
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,430
looking for patterns in cardiovascular
diseases, high blood pressure and such.

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,030
But the story he told us
begins around 25 years ago,

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,840
way up in northern Sweden
that Sam keen again,

20
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:21,130
he's the guy who told us about Auden's
work in our little community called over

21
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,450
colleagues. What does it look like?
Is it a big town, a little village?

22
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,510
It's a small forest area. Very beautiful.

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,190
But this was a really, really
tough history. Grow Up.

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,330
Very isolated and very cold.

25
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,650
Are you near the Arctic circle or north
of it? North of the Arctic Circle. Yeah.

26
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,240
My home village was 10 miles
north of popular. The goes, oh,

27
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:50,670
so you grew up in uh, over Kaylee's.
Yeah, we had a, an expression here.

28
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,480
Dig where you stand

29
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,650
and it just so happened is this
town is a perfect place today. Okay.

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,353
I'm here.

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,040
They are the kingdom archive
because there is more data,

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,540
more information about the people of
overkill going farther back into the past

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,020
and you can find almost anywhere else
on earth. Yeah. We a really data rich.

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,460
This is the Uber Colleagues
Church parish. Yes, it is.

35
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,750
Because he used to think the churches up
and over calyx kept incredibly detailed

36
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:25,440
records.

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,770
We actually sent our friend
Pike Malinowski to the
archives and Stockholm to

38
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:31,620
check it out. Says like Easter Register.

39
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,520
In those books you can meet everything
about the citizens of over calyx going

40
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,800
back hundreds of years. What's
his name? Even their names? Yes.

41
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,320
[inaudible] what year they were born?

42
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:48,321
1814 1881 she was born 1904 and this is
everything happening in the family is in

43
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:56,010
these books. Nielsen, who was an
idiot? He was an idiot. It's, sorry,

44
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,380
what? What does that mean? He was
an idiot, I guess. Yeah, he was,

45
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:00,250
you know retarded,

46
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,570
right? Yeah. He or landing
at score that he was this.

47
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,450
He was miserable to look at. It's
not very politically correct.

48
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,160
No.

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,490
In any case, these books tell you
when each of these folks died,

50
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,830
how they died from disease.

51
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,110
She's from a pneumonia accident.
She drowned. Oh my God.

52
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,580
A lot of diagnosis actually
influence cancer, heart disease,

53
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,840
brain disease.

54
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,350
Interestingly, the church has also
kept track of the farmers. Crows crops,

55
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,470
livestock, how much they
were growing each year,

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,770
which turned out to be kind
of an interesting thing
to look out because every

57
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,750
time the people in over calyx who were
farming trying to eco living out of the

58
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:45,200
soil, we have um, how
much they harvest it.

59
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,340
They would experience these wild
changes from harvest to harvest.

60
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,370
What you see in the records
is that one year potatoes,

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,210
crops that do great a hundred teachers.
Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.

62
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,100
A few years later there'd
be a harsh winter.

63
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,800
The crops failed and when the
crops failed, famines, yeah,

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,710
they basically start, I mean
when you look at the records,

65
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:13,610
you don't see huge spikes in mortality.
So it didn't starve to death.

66
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,540
They suddenly had to get by on a tiny
fraction of the food that they were used

67
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:17,850
to.

68
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,960
I didn't have grains. I
mean they didn't tell the of

69
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,490
and so they just had to hold
on for the entire winter.

70
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,410
But then a few years would
pass crops would bounce back.

71
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,230
Would we have a lot more grain
here and suddenly plenty of food.

72
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,250
I could eat twice, three
times as much, then oh no.

73
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,830
Total crop failure, famine. Again,

74
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,300
these changes would just
bounce back and forth. Famine,

75
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,973
feast,

76
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,313
Salmon East again,

77
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,090
and looking at these swings and Fortune
Oola realized what he had here was a

78
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,990
nice natural experiment
because with all this data,

79
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,880
he and his team could follow families
forward in time through the generations.

80
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,370
So if they saw somebody who was starving
as a kid in 1820 they couldn't see well

81
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,260
when those people had children and
grandchildren, did anything change?

82
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,690
Were there any consequences?

83
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,720
They wanted to see basically the effects
of starvation on multiple generations.

84
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,380
What did you discover?

85
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,543
Well, it,

86
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,950
it was some very interesting discovery.

87
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,370
That's a little odd actually.
Here's what [inaudible] says. He,

88
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,390
he found in the data,

89
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,360
if you were a boy in over [inaudible]
between the ages of nine and 12 years old,

90
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:41,790
so that's the window,
nine to 12 year old boy.

91
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,360
And then we have one of those terribly
rough winters and you're eating much less

92
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:46,020
than normal,

93
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,310
assuming that you can survive the ordeal
and you grow up and you have kids of

94
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:51,030
your own.

95
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,030
The data seems to say that your kids
will benefit from your suffering.

96
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,953
Yeah, yeah.

97
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,970
They'll do better if you
have a starving daddy.

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,120
It turns out that the baby actually
gets some sort of health benefit really.

99
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,440
And these effects in fact were so
strong that you could trace it to the

100
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,620
grandfather, the
grandfather, two generations.

101
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,590
It seemed to have been passed
down from multiple generations.

102
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,110
You mean if you had a
starving grandfather,

103
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,900
you would be a healthier
grant boy for the,

104
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,700
because you had a starving grandfather,

105
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,130
you got a health boost. If you
had a starving grandfather,

106
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,110
what, what sort of health boost? Well,
um, well they told us take heart disease,

107
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,183
vascular disease.

108
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,730
You said if you were a boy and you
starved between the ages of nine and 12,

109
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:43,970
and then you went on to become
a father, then a grandfather,

110
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,090
your grandkids were protected.

111
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,190
Meaning that they had less incidents of
heart disease, much less. How much less?

112
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,570
Well, it's um, one fourth then can we say

113
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,520
one fourth? Let me say this again.

114
00:06:57,521 --> 00:07:00,860
If you're a starving boy between
nine to 12 years old now,

115
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,810
it doesn't matter a whole lot.
What happens to you after this?

116
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,890
Your grandchildren will have one quarter
of the risk of heart disease and if you

117
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,020
eating a whole lot between
nine and 12 one quarter.

118
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,050
Not only that, apparently those
grandkids were less prone to diabetes.

119
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,400
They lived longer lives. Something
like 30 years on average.

120
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,400
This was [inaudible] the Alere instead
of dying at 40 I'd live to 70 that kind

121
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:30,600
of 30 years. Yes, exactly.
I just don't, I wonder.

122
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,040
It's such a surprising result. I
wonder how much you believe in it.

123
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,100
Yeah, it sound saw that it's only
a, the mechanisms are not so clear,

124
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,800
but the results are very clear.
The results are obvious to you.

125
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,110
[inaudible] the results are quite obvious.

126
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,550
Just to be sure. We asked Francis
Champagne, which she thinks of this data.

127
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,430
I believe that. Well you do,
and I'm Michael Meaney as well.

128
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:55,570
I think the Swedish data are really,
really strong and very reliable.

129
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,390
Everybody we talked to seems to think
there's something really interesting going

130
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:01,870
on here, but what exactly. Maybe
you can explain this to me, Robert.

131
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,910
What exactly happens between nine to
12 that makes this big difference? Wow.

132
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,610
So here's the thing. How
old are your boys right now?

133
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,050
Three and eight months. Okay. So
here's what you're going to notice.

134
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,980
Your boys will first grow taller
and taller for the next few years,

135
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,310
and when they get to be
about nine, 10 years old,

136
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,150
they're gonna stop growing
just for a few years.

137
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,410
This is what's called
d slow growth period.

138
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,410
Just for those years. That's
nine 10, 11 just before puberty,

139
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,140
they won't grow much on the
outside, but on the inside,

140
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,770
that is the time when the
sperms, while developing

141
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,840
what's happening during this time is
that you're setting aside the stock of

142
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:53,370
cells that you're going to draw on
in the future to make sperm cells.

143
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,210
So they are sperms. So the thought

144
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,390
is when those little boys in over
KLX were really, really hungry,

145
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,600
their hunger started a chemical process
that reached all the way down to the

146
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:10,330
DNA. Inside the boys' spurn.

147
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,390
Something happens on the molecular
level. What exactly? Well,

148
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,680
uh, the DNA, the RNA
micro RNA is a histone.

149
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,360
Anyway, that's it that
you're just renaming

150
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,360
methylations phosphorylation
and so on that just judo,

151
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,223
that's all this is.

152
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,590
We don't know precisely how this happens,

153
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:35,910
but somehow the experience
of starvation marks the DNA.

154
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,050
Maybe like those methyl things we were
telling you about with the rats. Yeah.

155
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,200
Telling some genes to turn off
now or the genes to turn on.

156
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,930
And the incredible thing is
those marks stick around.

157
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,110
This sperm carries these marks to the
next generation and then the next one

158
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:54,990
after that, right.

159
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:57,630
[inaudible]

160
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,010
so somehow by some kind
of chemical mechanisms,

161
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:05,970
starving grandpa back when he was about
nine to 12 years old turned out to be a

162
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:08,100
good thing. So it's like, um,

163
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:08,910
[inaudible]

164
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,630
GRANDPA's struggle is sort of jumping
forward and giving me a leg up.

165
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,890
Well that's the good news.
But unfortunately there's um,

166
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,910
there is some bad news here. Yeah.
If your grandpa didn't starve,

167
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:25,290
instead he lived through great times.
He stuffed himself silly nine, 10,

168
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,540
11 years old. So he's a happy
grandpa. You the grandson, you then

169
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,670
would have high frequency.

170
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:36,340
So heart attacks as two
diabetes, it was, uh,

171
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,140
a fourfold risk.

172
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,700
Four, four, four, 400%
greater. Yeah. I got to say,

173
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:46,580
this is spooky. This is spooky
because it's like, it does get, yeah.

174
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:49,690
I mean it's like what if GRANDPA has a
bad day? Suddenly you're marked. Yeah.

175
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,310
Frankly, this makes being
nine, 10, 11, 12 like a,

176
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:56,900
a rather crucial and at a time and you're
not making the best decisions anyway.

177
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,030
Yeah. Cause GRANDPA's just
nine. I should add to that.

178
00:10:59,031 --> 00:11:02,960
They have found very similar
effects for smoking. For instance,

179
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,460
if you start smoking when your, you
know, 10, 11, something like that,

180
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,790
you end up heading children
with more problems. I,

181
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,320
I initially felt very hopeful and excited
about this research because it seems

182
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,041
to suggest that a,

183
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:21,041
that a body one body can respond to an
environment and change and be flexible in

184
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:22,550
a way we didn't think was possible.

185
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,720
But this stuff you're telling
me about Sweden feels very, um,

186
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,620
grim in a certain way. Oh, you know,

187
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:31,670
sometimes that your grandfather's
suffering helps you, even if it helps.

188
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,800
It's horrifying. Claim
makes me claustrophobic.

189
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,950
You feel kind of hemmed in by what your
grandfather did? A little bit, I guess.

190
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,750
I guess the way I would I
would look at it is that, um,

191
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,590
you can change your environment a lot
more easily than you can change your

192
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,143
genes.

193
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:50,690
[inaudible]

194
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,090
I think it's, is, what's
weird here is that,

195
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,180
is that we started trying to make a
difference in our children and now we're

196
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,700
surprised attacked by our GRANDPA.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do though.

197
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,050
When a meal gets to be eight, I'm
cutting him off. He's not eating it all.

198
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,590
This may hurt you, my son, but
I'm doing it for my grandchildren.

199

thanks to [inaudible] reporter Pike Mellon
off ski and Cardin Berquist young and

I'm a senior archivist at a the
national archive in Maria. Bye.
