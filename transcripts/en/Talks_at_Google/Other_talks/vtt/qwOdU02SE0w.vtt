CAL NEWPORT: Good morning,
everybody.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.760
So I'm going to talk about
career advice, my topic.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.790
I want to push back a little bit
on some of the ideas that

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.980
we assume are true and don't
question much anymore.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.340
And I'm going to try to replace
them with some ideas

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.260
that I think the evidence
actually supports better.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.900
And I figured being at Google,
the right place to start would

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.580
be saying controversial things
about Steve Jobs.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.390
So I think that's a good place
for us to get going.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.380
So in particular, I want to talk
about the summer, early

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.990
summer of 2005, when Steve
Jobs took the podium at

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.035
Stanford Stadium to give his--

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:42.160
I recognize someone down there,
Chris [? Pleho ?]

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.920
AUDIENCE: Hey, how's
it going, man?

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.220
CAL NEWPORT: All right.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.110
There we go.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.210
You remember those ages.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.340
Anyways, I'm sorry.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.780
I'm not going to get distracted
with Chris stories.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.410
So let's go back to
summer of 2005.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.490
Steve Jobs takes the podium,
Stanford Stadium.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.130
He's there to give the
commencement address to the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.260
graduating class of Stanford.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.650
So this is kind of a big deal,
because Jobs did not give a

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.250
lot of these sort of personal
talks, reflective talks.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.130
It wasn't really his style.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.110
But he did give this talk.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.410
He came.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.210
He did wear sandals under his
robe, but he did come.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.510
And he gave this talk, and
it was a good one.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.350
And if you look at, say, YouTube
views-- and I think

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.880
that's the authoritative way
of ranking social impact--

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.830
the two videos of this talk
have 6 million views.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.160
So this was an important talk.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.750
It went really far.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.110
So he had a lot of points that
he made, but I went back and

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.710
looked at the social media
reactions and the news

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.940
reactions that immediately
surrounded the talk's release.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.770
And what you could see is
there was one point in

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.510
particular that seemed to
get people excited.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.170
And that's about halfway through
this speech where he

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.870
says, "You have to
do what you love.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.430
And if you haven't found
it yet, keep looking.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.490
Don't settle."

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.840
So, again, if you go to these
social media reactions, you go

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.110
to the news reports that
surround the speech, it's

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.390
pretty clear how people
interpreted what Steve Jobs

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.110
was saying there.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.890
They interpret him as saying,
guys, if you want to love what

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.280
you do for your living, you need
to figure out what you

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.270
love, and then you need to go
match this to your job, and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.410
then you'll have a career
that you love.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.270
This was people's
interpretation.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.270
Now, in popular slang we often
summarize this with the phrase

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.090
"follow your passion." Jobs
didn't say the phrase "follow

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.020
your passion," but this was
people's interpretation of

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.550
what he meant with that
point in his talk.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.050
So, of course, Jobs was not the
first person to introduce

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.830
this idea that you should
follow your passion.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.200
In fact, I actually went
back to research where

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.220
did this come from.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.420
When did this phrase enter
into our cultural

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.150
conversation?

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.350
Right?

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.820
What's the history of this
phrase there right now that

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.180
seems so universal?

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.740
And once again, because I seem
to rely on Google for just

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.440
about everything I do, I used
Google's Ngram Viewer.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.500
Do you guys know this tool
from Google Labs?

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.890
So I used Google's Ngram Viewer
to try to understand

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.970
where this phrase came from.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.060
So if you don't know this tool,
you can put in a phrase.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.810
And it will actually
go through the--

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.430
Google's corpus of digitized
books and try to understand

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.810
the occurrences of this phrase
in the printed English

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.350
language over time.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.640
So you can put "follow your
passion" into this tool and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.810
see where does it show up in
printed books, and when do we

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.570
actually see it raised.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.980
And I was actually surprised.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.060
Here's my early-morning
trivia question--

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.460
when you think the first decade
was that we actually

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.970
see the phrase "follow your
passion" show up in the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.984
printed English language?

00:03:25.984 --> 00:03:28.975
What would you guess?

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:29.470
AUDIENCE: '60s.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.210
CAL NEWPORT: '60s.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.370
AUDIENCE: '80s.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.213
CAL NEWPORT: '80s.

00:03:32.213 --> 00:03:32.960
AUDIENCE: 1700s.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.820
CAL NEWPORT: I don't think they
go back that far in the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.640
Ngram Viewer.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.880
But I'm sure if they did,
it might be there.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.940
It was actually in the
1940s and '50s.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.380
There was a play in which a
group of three woodcutters

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.020
stood around.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.470
And someone uttered for the
first time that I can find in

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.810
the printed English language,
"Follow your passion." But

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.150
they were talking about a
different type of passion, and

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.720
I wouldn't recommend using this
play as the foundation

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.750
for your career advice.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.740
So that was the '50s.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.450
You see a kind of spike up
throughout the '60s as that

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.210
play is reprinted.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.490
It's really the 1980s that we
start to see "follow your

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.580
passion" show up in the context
of career advice.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.320
In the '90s that graph
of occurrences

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.950
begins to trend upwards.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.660
By the early 2000s, it's really

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.120
spiked and hit its peak.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.300
By the time Jobs stood up there
and gave his speech at

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.150
Stanford Stadium , "follow your
passion" had become a

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.250
sort of de facto piece of advice
for American career

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.880
planners and seekers.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.910
It got to the point where
non-technical career guides

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.080
don't bother anymore to try to
explain what the strategy is

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.840
or try to give a justification
for why

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.890
this is a good strategy.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.970
They assume you know it.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.940
They assume that you agree that
it's the right strategy.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.850
They just jump right into how do
you figure out what you're

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.480
passionate about, how do we
build up the courage to go

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.810
after our passion.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.420
So when Jobs stood up there and
said something that people

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.310
interpreted as saying "follow
your passion," this was not

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.490
the introduction of the idea.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.620
It was more like the idea
was being canonized.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.720
So we can think of this as sort
of the de facto moment

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.850
when "follow your passion"
became the

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.990
American career gospel.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.680
I mean, this is how we think
about building a meaningful

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.380
career in this country.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.710
So as I mentioned, this got
people very excited, if you

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.620
look at the reports surrounding
the talk.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.650
We shouldn't be surprised
that they got excited.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.120
If you look at this idea
"follow your passion"

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.700
objectively, we see that it's
a sort of astonishingly

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.580
appealing concept.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.220
Because it tells us that not
only can you have this working

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.490
life in which you love what
you do and it's very

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.610
meaningful and engaging, but
that it's actually not that

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.950
hard to get there.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.810
It's a simple equation.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.160
You have to figure out what you
love, which maybe takes

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.530
you a month of introspection.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.890
You do some strength finders
or whatever.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.920
You got to figure out what
you love, and then you

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.050
match it to your work.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.550
Problem solved.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.490
You'll love what you
do for a living.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.140
So it's sort of a astonishingly

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.760
appealing piece of advice.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.940
But here's the problem.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.510
The problem is that "follow your
passion," in addition to

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.290
be astonishingly appealing,
also happens to be

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.570
astonishingly bad advice.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.160
And that's the idea that
brought me here

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.460
today for this talk.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.880
So I just published this new
book, and the idea of this

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.380
book was to answer a
simple question.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.400
Why do some people end up loving
what they do for a

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.550
living, while so many
other people don't?

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.670
Now, obviously I'm young.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.230
So this book was not me saying
I will now draw for my years

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.250
of career wisdom and share my
advice, having been in the

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.380
career market for two
years now, if you

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.470
don't count grad school.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.430
The point was I didn't
have these answers.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.680
I was at a key transition
point in my own

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.450
early working life.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.340
I was just finishing up my
academic training, was about

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.050
to enter the academic
job market.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.350
And if this is done right, a
professorship is supposed to

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.450
be a job for life.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.240
So I was about to do what might
have been my first and

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.910
last job interviews
of my life.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.640
And on the other hand, I had
these really tight geographic

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.400
constraints, and it was a really
bad academic market.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.810
So there was this chance that I
would have more or less have

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.440
to start from scratch after
having trained for something.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.000
So in that period of transition
I said if there's

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.350
any time in my life that I need
to understand how people

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.070
build careers they love, this
has to be the time when I

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.660
understand this.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.890
If I wait 10 more years,
it might be too late.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.210
So the book actually came out
of me needing an answer for

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.810
that question.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.250
It doesn't chronicle
my own wisdom.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.080
It chronicles my own
quest to get this

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.240
wisdom from other people.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.300
So you can think of the book as
roughly being in two parts.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.580
The first part I lay out my
argument for why "follow your

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.620
passion" is actually bad advice
if your goal is to end

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.880
up passionate about what
you do for a living.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.880
And then, roughly speaking,
the second part is about,

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.300
well, what should
you do instead.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.500
If you study people who do end
up loving what they do, if

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.420
they're not following their
passion, what was it that they

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.925
did instead.

00:07:48.925 --> 00:07:51.640
And that's more or less
the second part.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.680
So I thought what I would do
today was tell two stories.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.800
I can tell one story from the
first part, and we can draw

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.730
some lessons from that about
why I think "follow your

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:00.880
passion" is bad advice.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.920
And then I'll tell a story from
the second part, and then

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.820
we can draw some lessons from
that about what I observed

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.150
seems to work better instead.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.780
And then we can go to questions
after that.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.450
So let's jump right in.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.640
The first story, I want to
return to Steve Jobs.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.910
But now I want to rewind time
back a little further.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.210
Let's say you had a time machine
and you could go back

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.910
to meet a young Steve Jobs.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.370
Probably the first thing you
would do is go buy Apple

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.090
stock, but let's say you go back
even earlier than that in

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.660
a high-school age Steve Jobs.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.250
The biographical sources we have
today suggest that if you

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.970
talk to a young Steve Jobs, you
would not come away with

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.539
the idea that he was passionate
about building a

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.425
technology company.

00:08:40.425 --> 00:08:43.309
He did not have at that point
in his life a passion for

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.100
changing the world through
technology.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:46.340
Right?

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.190
So Steve Jobs did not go to
Berkeley to study electrical

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.310
engineering, which is what you
would have done in that time

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.660
and that place if you were
really passionate about

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.750
electronics.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.550
And he didn't go to Stanford
or UCLA to study business,

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.280
which is probably what you would
have done in that time

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.410
and that place if you're
very passionate about

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.055
entrepreneurship and business.

00:09:03.055 --> 00:09:05.570
But he instead went to Reed
College, a liberal arts school

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:06.160
up in Oregon.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.100
He studied history,
studied dance.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.040
Pretty soon afterwards he
dropped out and hung out on

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.960
campus, walking around barefoot,
experimenting with

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.400
sort of extreme diets, bumming
free meals from the Hari

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.820
Krishna temple.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.030
Eventually, he got fed up with
being completely destitute,

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.210
came back to California, took
a night shift job at Atari.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.900
And that was very specific,
because he wanted flexibility

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.430
and not too much
responsibility.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.360
And he began to study Eastern
Mysticism, way more seriously.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.240
It had just arrived on the
shores of the West Coast in

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.690
this period.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.980
He went on a mendicant's
journey to

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.190
India in this point.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.780
Months' long mendicant's journey
to India, came back,

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.620
started to study seriously at
the Los Altos Zen Center, and

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.420
began to spend an increasing
amount of time with the All

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.780
One commune upstate.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.410
So the point of this is that is
a portrait of someone who

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.820
is seeking.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.480
The classic example of someone
young, early in their life,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.390
trying to figure out what life's
about, what they want

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.940
to do with their life.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.070
A lot of us go through this
stage, but Jobs being Jobs

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.510
couldn't just read Kerouac.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.430
He had to actually go to India
and spend three months,

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.090
because he's intense about
everything he does.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.190
But he's basically reflecting
something that a lot of us

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.780
went through ourselves.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.060
Trying to understand what are
we doing here, what's the

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.600
meaning of life.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.240
He was in a seeking mode.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.900
But what's clear about that is
this was certainly not someone

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.480
with a crystal-clear vision of I
am passionate about starting

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.640
a technology company, and I'm
going to find a way to do that

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.860
one way or the other.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.560
It was not at all his mind frame
in the years leading up

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.370
Apple Computer.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.230
So Apple Computer, how
did it come about?

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.420
I think the right word is that
him and Woz stumbled into the

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.180
opportunity.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.200
Woz had been working on a
circuit board for what was

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.920
essentially the Apple I. Steve
Jobs had recently met Paul

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.500
Terrell, who had one of the
first computer stores in the

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.440
world up in Mountain View.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.920
So Jobs came back and said,
look, this circuit board was

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.640
popular at the Homebrew
Computing Club.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.890
I want to sell you 50 so you can
sell it to the hobbyists

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:58.880
around here.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.650
An earlier biographer of Jobs,
Jeffrey Young, actually

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.010
crunched the numbers.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.010
And they were looking to make
around 1,000 to $2,000 profit

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.780
off of that exchange.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.750
And I thought that
number was low.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.230
So I even got back in touch with
Paul Terrell recently,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.600
and he confirmed the
details of it.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:13.780
Yeah.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.660
He came in to sell 50 of these
things to hobbyists basically.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.520
It was a small-time
transaction.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.260
They had done several other
quick money-making schemes

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.750
like this before.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.410
But Paul Terrell said to
Jobs, I don't want

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.760
to buy circuit boards.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.280
I want to buy fully assembled
computers.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.820
Paul Terrell had the vision that
there was going to be a

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.820
market for computers
as appliances,

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.150
that this was coming.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.290
And Jobs, to his credit,
understood that opportunity

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.710
when he saw it.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.260
And he went at it full out.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.210
He did some trickiness,
COD ordering.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.290
He didn't have money.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.630
But he got those together, and
Apple Computer was eventually

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.290
borne out of that.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.280
So there's a couple lessons
to draw from that story.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.470
The first lesson is the path to
passion is often way more

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.350
complicated than simply figuring
out in advance this

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:01.520
is what I want to do and then
going out and doing it.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.020
So when looked at Jobs's story
there, he did not have a

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.260
preexisting passion to go start
a technology company.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.060
His path in the Apple Computer
and the passion he had for

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.580
that company was more
complicated than him figuring

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.940
out in advance what
he wanted to do.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:20.300
So if you go out and study
people like Jobs, who ended up

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.590
loving their work -- and I
studied this extensively

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.210
researching the book-- you
find that that more

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.920
complicated path is more the
rule than the exception.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.010
That it's actually very rare to
find someone who really did

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.540
have clarity about what they
were passionate about in

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.610
advance and then went after it
to form their career that

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.640
ended up being a real source
of satisfaction.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.810
The paths there are often
way more complicated.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.710
One of my favorite quotes about
this is from the NPR

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.590
host Ira Glass, "This American
Life" host, who is someone who

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:52.210
loves his work.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.350
And there's this great interview
online where some

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.500
college students come to Glass
to ask him, how do we build a

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.820
career like yours.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.100
And he says there's this idea
in the movie that you should

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:01.880
follow your dreams.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.940
I don't buy that.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.430
He starts talking for a while
about how you have to force

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.650
skills to come and
it's really hard.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.990
And when he sees their faces
fall, he finally says, guys, I

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.820
see you're trying to figure this
all out in the abstract,

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.340
and I think that's your
tragic mistake.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.560
So I like the way
Glass put it.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.450
The idea that you can figure
out in the abstract what

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.130
you're supposed to do with
your career is not just a

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.000
mistake, but it's a
tragic mistake.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.500
And I think we all sort
of feel that.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:27.790
Right?

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.010
I mean, this notion that if you
think that you can figure

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.280
out in advance what you're
supposed to do, well, what

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.895
happens when you don't have
that clear passion?

00:13:33.895 --> 00:13:34.470
It's confusion.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.370
It's anxiety.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.610
It's chronic job hopping.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.485
It's reading too many blogs,
spending too much time on the

00:13:40.485 --> 00:13:40.990
four-hour workweek.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.860
You know what I mean?

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.820
This is what happens if you
get too caught up in this

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.080
notion that with one grand
gesture you can be loving your

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.590
life next week.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.780
So that's the first lesson
to draw from that story.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.130
The path to passion in reality
when you really study it is

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.710
often way more complicated
than what that

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.570
advice tells us.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.830
The second lesson to draw from
that story is that we really

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.020
don't have any reason to believe
that that advice

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.760
should work.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.600
We're so used to hearing "follow
your passion" that we

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.100
think about it as just
being self-evident.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.790
Well, of course, that's
a good thing to do.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.810
But if we put on our
anthropological hats and say,

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.960
well, let's actually look at
this advice, what's it really

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.050
saying, you notice that it's
some really strong claims.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.350
Claims that really beg
supporting, and it's hard to

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.150
find that support.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.870
So "follow your passion," first
of all, claims that most

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.660
of us have preexisting passions
we can follow.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.570
In order to follow a
passion, everyone

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:34.920
has to have my passion.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.120
Right?

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.010
People talk about, well, I think
my passion is this, I

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.510
think my passion is that.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.120
"Follow your passion" relies
on this idea that we have

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.760
preexisting passions that for
some reason are well suited to

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.720
a modern knowledge work economy
and that we just have

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.460
to identify those.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.400
We don't have evidence
that that's the case.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.520
So one study I talk about in
the book is a Canadian

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.570
psychologist who's an
expert on passion.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.270
He developed "the" survey that
psychologists use to determine

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.930
is this a passion of yours, or
is this just an interest.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.120
He gave it to 500 Canadian
university students.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.250
And while most of them did have
passions, when I went

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.340
through the breakdown, it seemed
to be roughly 4% of

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.040
those passions were relevant
to a career or a job.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.430
The most popular passion by far
was hockey, if that helps.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.800
Again, it's possible that
there's this sort of

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.210
astonishing collection of hockey
talent at this school

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.330
and they could follow their
passion and all go to the NHL.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.360
But more likely, the point is if
you told these 500 students

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.930
figure out what you're
passionate about and follow

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.210
it, all but 4% were going
to be in trouble.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.140
So we don't have a lot evidence
that most people have

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.140
preexisting passion.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.140
The second claim being made by
this advice that you should

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.330
follow your passion is that
matching your work to a

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.440
preexisting interest is going
to make you have an engaging

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.720
and satisfying career.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.680
It sort of seems self-evident
at first.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.790
But if you actually dive into
this sort of voluminous

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.480
research on workplace
satisfaction--

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.670
it's an incredibly well
studied field.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.140
And it turns out that building
a satisfying, engaging career

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.470
is a complicated thing to do.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.470
And the idea that we can reduce
it down to all that

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.570
matters is that you've matched
this job to something you're

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:12.230
interested in just doesn't
match the literature.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.490
So yesterday I was on NPR with
a Harvard Business School

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:21.470
professor who talked at some
detailed length, I will say,

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.330
about her research
on this topic.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.420
And she could easily fill an
hour talking about the subtle,

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.120
detail things they found about
what really matters in making

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.850
a creative career that's
satisfying.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.360
So this idea that I was
interested in this and I

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.660
matched it to my career is all
you need to make a satisfying

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.200
career, again, is just not
backed by the evidence.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.430
So that's the second lesson
about "follow your passion" is

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.780
that we don't have any evidence
that this should

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.030
actually work.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.420
So that's my case against
that advice.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.690
It doesn't match the stories
we find in reality, and we

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.670
don't have a lot of
support for it.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.080
So we can move to the more
positive section.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.820
Well, if "follow your passion"
doesn't work, what are people

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.620
doing that do end up loving
what they do?

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.500
So when I went out there, when I
studied people who love what

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.520
they do, I did find a pattern
that shows up pretty often.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.960
Not everyone followed it, but
it was pretty common.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.530
And it is different than
following your passion.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.910
So that's what I want to talk
about in the second story.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.030
I want to tell the story of
someone whose path, I think,

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.960
is a great case study in this
pattern so we can draw lessons

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.950
from a pattern about
his story.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.770
So let's talk about
Bill McKibben.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.940
So Bill McKibben is a writer.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.040
Some of you might know him.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.730
He writes environmental books.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.550
"End of Nature" is what made him
famous, but he has a dozen

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.970
different books out.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.180
He's also an activist now.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.960
He was arrested last year in
front of the White House for a

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.600
climate change protest.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.820
Anyway, so Bill McKibben
is someone who's always

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.370
fascinated me, because his life,
to me, always resonated.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.550
He sort of lives in this cabin
in Vermont and writes these

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.780
important books, and it all
seemed very cool to me.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.020
So I somewhat stalkerishly have
read basically everything

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:51.680
written about him.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.780
I've gone to his events.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.180
I probably know as much about
Bill McKibben as his analyst.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.730
So I don't know that's a good
thing, but this is sort of a

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.520
trait of nonfiction authors.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.530
We have to obsessively
follow things.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.250
So here's Bill McKibben's
story.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.640
Short story is he shows up at
Harvard as an undergraduates,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.600
so he's a smart guy.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.050
Now, I don't know if there's
Harvard people here.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.320
But at Harvard grades aren't
really the thing that you

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.350
focus on, because Harvard you
get an A for getting half the

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.140
letters in your name correct
when you signed the test.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.518
That's not what people
care about.

00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:25.760
I'm a Dartmouth guy,
so I have to--

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.210
this is how the

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.490
Dartmouth-Harvard rivalry works.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.760
Dartmouth makes really witty
put-downs about Harvard, and

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.620
then Harvard forgets we exist.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.410
So that's how that rivalry goes,
but I take my punches.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.060
So it's all about
extracurriculars there

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:38.720
for the most part.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:38.930
Right?

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.600
They have these serious,
full-time job style

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.560
extracurriculars.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.340
If you don't, you sort of feel
like you're a slacker.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.220
So McKibben got involved with
the Crimson, which is the

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.460
student newspaper.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.270
And he worked hard there.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.790
He worked his way up in
the ranks, ended up

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.740
in an editor position.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.210
Left Harvard, could parlay the
editor position at the Crimson

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:01.070
to getting a staff position
at The New Yorker.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.360
Not writing McPhee style 10,000
word essays, doing the

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.265
little talk at a town things,
but that's where you start at

00:19:06.265 --> 00:19:07.450
The New Yorker.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:08.310
So he goes to The New Yorker.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.240
Now he's working with some of
the best editors and writers

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.600
in the world, again
honing his craft.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.320
And where his story takes this
nice pivot is that just as

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.190
he's becoming known in that New
York world, he leaves The

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:22.080
New Yorker.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.925
He moves to a cabin
in Vermont.

00:19:23.925 --> 00:19:26.330
He has a book deal to write a
book about something that

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.650
people weren't really
talking about at the

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.420
time, global warming.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.050
And he wrote "The End of
Nature," which was sort of one

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.950
of the first big books
about this topic.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.880
It put him on the map as
an important thinker in

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.150
environmental thinking and
allowed him to then have this

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.550
career where he could live up
in Vermont and write books

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.640
about topics that were
important to him.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.820
He eventually got a thinker
in residence position at

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.540
Middlebury, and now he's
doing activism.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.700
So it's a career that he's
very passionate about.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.175
But it's a good example--

00:19:52.175 --> 00:19:53.720
and the reason I'm telling you
is because it is a good

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.320
example of the pattern that
comes up often when you study

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.590
people who do love
what they do.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.120
So let's figure out what is that
pattern, what did he do

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.380
that we can learn from.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:07.740
So the first observation about
his path is often the most

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.080
controversial observation I make
when I talk about this

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.840
topic, which is what he did for
a living did not matter

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.130
all that much.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.440
So he built the life
that he was

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.780
passionate about as a writer.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.570
I would conjecture that
there's any number of

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.880
different fields in which Bill
McKibben could have built up a

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.300
working life that he loved
equally as much.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.580
There's nothing intrinsic in
his DNA about writing.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.440
There's no mutated gene that
evolved a couple hundred years

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.400
ago that means you are destined
to be a writer.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.690
So what mattered for McKibben?

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.880
Well, based on all the
interviews I've read with him

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.050
and the books I've read, it
seems that what really matters

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:45.990
from him is more general.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.190
That he wants autonomy in his
life, and he wants to be

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.650
having an impact on the world.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:55.020
He achieved this as an
environmental writer.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.670
But I would say in conjecture
that any career path would

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.530
allow him to have a strong sense
of autonomy and a strong

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.690
sense of an impact on the
world, would have been a

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.820
career path that he would have
found just as much passion in

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.810
and he would have enjoyed
just as much.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.460
And this is something that
came up time and again.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.080
When you study people who love
what they do, the specifics of

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.320
the work is not what's
important.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.560
There's almost always some
general lifestyle traits.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.050
Maybe you want autonomy.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.740
Maybe you want power
and respect.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.220
Maybe you really
want an impact.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.530
Maybe you really want
to be creative.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.020
Maybe what you're looking for
is a great amount of time

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.490
affluence, that you want to have
a schedule where you can

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.000
have work play a very
little role into it.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.470
Different lifestyle traits
resonate differently with

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:40.660
different people.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.400
But ultimately, it seems from my
research that this is what

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.610
matters in someone feeling a
real sense of satisfaction and

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.500
engagement in their career, that
their career has given

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.620
them the sort of more general
traits that matter.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.000
And these traits are more
general than specific jobs.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.250
There's often many, many
different paths that can lead

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.420
you to these traits.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.900
So there's no need to sweat
the decision of what is my

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.150
true calling, what is the
job I'm meant to do.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:05.940
Because it doesn't matter.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.430
The specifics are much
less important than

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.030
these general traits.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.260
So that's sort of the
first observation.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.740
The specifics of what
you do might be less

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.870
important than you think.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.900
The second observation is that
McKibben started by getting

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.370
really good at something.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:23.910
So in his case he got really
good at writing, and this took

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:24.360
him some time.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.210
He had to go through
the Crimson.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.420
He had to work his way
up to The New Yorker.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.160
But he got really good
at some writing, and

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.930
that was how he started.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.380
This pattern is remarkably
consistent in the lives of

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.650
people who end up really
loving their work.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.800
They have this period where they
build up what I like to

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.520
call a rare and valuable
skill.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.340
And when you think of this in
the context of the first

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.220
lesson, that suddenly
makes sense.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:44.410
Right?

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.160
We can start putting these
pieces together.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.600
The way they build satisfying
careers is they start by

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.520
building up rare and
valuable skills.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.210
This gives them an actual value
in the marketplace, in

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:54.980
the work marketplace.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.200
Now they can look to these
general traits that they want

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.430
in their working life, be it
autonomy or impact like

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:00.950
McKibben or something
else depending what

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.050
resonates for you.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.325
And they say these traits are
rare and valuable, too.

00:23:05.325 --> 00:23:06.460
They'd be great to have.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.640
Therefore, they're not
being handed out

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.380
on the street corner.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.820
I need something rare and
valuable to offer in return

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.490
for these rare and valuable
traits that are going to make

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.130
my career great.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.915
So they are then able to
leverage their rare and

00:23:15.915 --> 00:23:19.030
valuable skills to gain more
of these traits in their

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.500
working life.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.890
That's exactly what
McKibben did.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.420
If he said as a senior at
Harvard I want to live a life

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.670
that's autonomous and has a big
impact, I'm going to move

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.240
to Vermont and write
these big books, it

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.780
wouldn't have worked.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.310
He didn't have enough writing
skill yet to write "End of

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.530
Nature." He had to build up more
of a rare and valuable

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.980
skill to actually offer in
return for the rare and

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.020
valuable trait of being able to
live in Vermont and write

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.830
books about what he wanted and
have them sell and support him

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.080
and have an impact.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.080
So this equation is in some
sense my replacement for

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.970
"follow your passion," and this
is sort of based off of

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.400
observing actual
people's lives.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.262
They start by building up rare
and valuable skills.

00:24:01.262 --> 00:24:03.970
They then use these skills as
leverage to gain the type of

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.030
general traits that matter to
them, and that's why they care

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.960
less about what specific job
they do and care a lot more

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.990
about how they're approaching
the job they have.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.000
In my building skills,
have I plateaued?

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.490
How can I continue
to build skills?

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.380
In the book I call it "career
capital." How big is my career

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.230
capital store?

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.380
If I want to enjoy my working
life more, maybe I should look

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.420
at increasing that
store faster.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.270
So it's a different way of
looking at these same issues.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.490
And if we go back, we see,
actually, this is exactly what

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.950
Steve Jobs himself did.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.830
He didn't have some clear
preexisting passion he wanted

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.610
to start a technology company.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.880
But when he saw an opportunity,
he went after it,

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.560
and he went after
it intensely.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.100
He said, if I'm going to make
a go at this computer thing,

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.100
I'm going to do it at the
absolute limit of my ability.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:52.670
I want to be so good that
I can't be ignored.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.380
And by doing that, by building
machines that were better than

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.470
anyone else was able to build
that could blow the MITS

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.420
Altair out of the water, the
most advanced personal

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.870
computer machines at the time
that were in existence, he

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.520
built up a huge store
of career capital.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.200
He was able to more or less
control the way that his

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.100
working life progressed.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.280
He couldn't control exactly how
Apple went, but he could

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.990
be working on technology.

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.210
He could set the
tone for Apple.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.610
He could go do these other
companies afterwards.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.550
He built a life that he was
very passionate about.

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:25.270
Not by following a passion, but
by passionately doing the

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.370
work that he was doing.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.710
So to bring it back to where we
very began, right where we

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.550
started, right with Jobs, we
can summarize everything we

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:37.830
said today by noting that when
it comes to thinking about

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.730
your own career and building a
career that's meaningful to

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.060
you, we can look
to Steve Jobs.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.730
But we should do what Steve
Jobs actually did

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.400
and not what he said.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.176
Thank you.

00:25:49.176 --> 00:25:54.590
[CLAPPING]

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.650
CAL NEWPORT: So I guess we just
do questions, so yeah.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:57.630
AUDIENCE: So it seems--

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.924
I really liked your talk.

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:00.721
And it seemed like a lot
of what you're saying

00:26:00.721 --> 00:26:01.342
seems true to me.

00:26:01.342 --> 00:26:04.022
But it also seems that if you
really want to build up that

00:26:04.022 --> 00:26:06.640
skill, don't you have to love
the skill that you're building

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.324
up to build it up?

00:26:08.324 --> 00:26:11.424
Because if I wasn't interested
in computers, I don't think I

00:26:11.424 --> 00:26:13.571
would ever have become a
reasonably competent

00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:14.525
programmer.

00:26:14.525 --> 00:26:15.002
Right?

00:26:15.002 --> 00:26:15.956
CAL NEWPORT: Yeah.

00:26:15.956 --> 00:26:16.630
AUDIENCE: Because it would
be too painful.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.696
CAL NEWPORT: Yeah.

00:26:16.696 --> 00:26:19.330
I call this the argument from
preexisting passion, because

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.790
it's one of the more common
questions that actually comes

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.800
up when you talk about this
philosophy about how people

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.960
build work they love.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.570
There's actually interesting
research on this.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.530
There's research on how
virtuosos, for example, build

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.120
up their virtuoso
level of skill.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.640
This came out of Bloom's work
at University of Chicago.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.470
And they studied a whole
variety of virtuosos.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.260
Not just musicians and
athletes, but also

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.190
mathematicians and scientists.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.220
And they tried to understand
how did they build up this

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.520
huge level of skill.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.730
And their most surprising
finding was there was not a

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.200
clear, burning passion
in advance.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.490
And, in fact, what tends to
happen when people build up a

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.390
huge amount of skill is that
it's a snowball effect.

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.890
So something happens early
on that gives you an

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.300
interest in a field.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.620
So you might have an interest in
computers early on in your

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.760
life because some encounter
with them seemed

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.070
interesting to you.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.540
That interest gives you enough
intrinsic motivation to get

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.722
through that first stage of
deliberate practice where you

00:27:12.722 --> 00:27:14.710
build up some skill and get a
little bit of separation from

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.640
other people and oh, yeah,
you're good with computers.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.100
That becomes part of
your identity.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.020
That gives you enough intrinsic
motivation to do the

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.620
next hard stage of deliberate
practice.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.590
You come away from that.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.410
And now you've separated
yourself more, and you feel

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.280
more strongly about it.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.400
So this is what happens is that
over time the snowball

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.550
effect pushes up your ability
in something better and

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.460
better, because at each
stage you feel like

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.110
you're better at it.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.600
And it feels more and more
like your identity.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.400
In other words, an initial
interest blossoms into a

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.810
stronger and stronger passion
as time goes on.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.515
So what I counsel people is if
something is interesting to

00:27:47.515 --> 00:27:50.130
you, the research says that's
enough to begin the skill

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.410
acquisition phase.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:53.090
It is a really long road.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.110
It's thousands of hours of
deliberate practice, but you

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.260
can be assured that you're
not going to have

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.290
to do that all blind.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.530
As you move along, you're
going to have little

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.570
milestones of accomplishment
which is going to give you

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.160
more motivation to get
to the next one.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.290
AUDIENCE: Is this that
10,000 hours thing?

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:07.560
CAL NEWPORT: Yeah.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.050
So 10,000 hours is Anders
Ericsson's rule that for

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.670
expert level performers, it
takes usually 10,000 hours of

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:17.640
deliberate practice, which works
out to about 10 years of

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.290
more or less full-time work.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.180
My argument is that in a lot
of fields, especially

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.560
knowledge work fields, very
few people are doing any

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.570
deliberate practice.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:28.655
Deliberate practice like a
surgeon would do to get better

00:28:28.655 --> 00:28:30.776
at surgery-- they require
10,000 hours to

00:28:30.776 --> 00:28:31.750
become great surgeons--

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.260
is very uncomfortable.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.070
You have to stretch yourself.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.190
You have to be systematic about
here's where I'm weak,

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.050
and I'm going to have to do what
I don't like doing to get

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.520
better at it.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.480
Most people in knowledge
work don't do that.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.600
We avoid discomfort.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.440
We use email to get away from
any sort of mental discomfort

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.410
if something requiring focus.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.070
So I conjecture that in
knowledge work fields , if you

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.540
put systematic deliberate
practice into what you do,

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.280
you're going to find a
separation from your peers

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.470
well south of 10,000 hours.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:02.540
So it might take 10,000 hours to
become a chess grandmaster.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.550
But it may only take a few
hundred systematic work at

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.580
learning some, say, new
programming paradigm to

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.350
actually open up a pretty large
and invaluable gap.

00:29:14.308 --> 00:29:14.801
Yes.

00:29:14.801 --> 00:29:18.248
AUDIENCE: I really like the
notion of rare and valuable

00:29:18.248 --> 00:29:23.218
skills, but I'm curious about
valuable to who and how you

00:29:23.218 --> 00:29:25.678
decide that it's valuable.

00:29:25.678 --> 00:29:29.368
I raised my hand because I was
talking about something

00:29:29.368 --> 00:29:30.598
similar to my girlfriend.

00:29:30.598 --> 00:29:35.935
And she said, but I really
wanted to be a social worker.

00:29:35.935 --> 00:29:39.810
But it turns out that being
valuable to people who have no

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.230
money doesn't really
get you that far.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.180
CAL NEWPORT: Yeah.

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:43.370
Yeah.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.040
This is a crucial point.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.850
I think one of the more
difficult points of the career

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:50.690
capital approach to work
is understanding

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.130
where to build capital.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:55.070
So something I noticed that
caught my attention when I

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:58.350
studied people who had seemed
to apply this philosophy is

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.470
that they tended to be people
who either by design or

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:06.580
happenstance had had exposure
to stars in their field or

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.640
otherwise people in their field
whose current status

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.540
really resonated with them.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.130
So they're rarely
flying blind.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.330
Right?

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.500
They have some sense of in my
field this person sort of

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.270
represents where I'd
like to get.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.460
And now I can sort of understand
what was the skill

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.040
that got him there.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.340
What does he do that other
people don't do?

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.920
Now, for a lot of people I
studied, this was just

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.210
happenstance.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:29.820
It's not a surprise why often
you'll find someone successful

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.380
in a field has parents
in that field.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:31.600
Right?

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.440
That means they have this expert
level knowledge of what

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.730
capital to build.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.270
But I posit that once you
understand that, you can go

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:41.020
out deliberately and try to
find this information.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.020
So when you're in a particular
field, you can say who within

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.700
Google, for example, represents
where I would like

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.940
to be with my career.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.760
You can actually systematically
go and try to

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.320
understand what do they do well
that other people don't

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.050
that's given them that
sort of control.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:31:00.040
So I actually counsel people to
systematically investigate

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.290
working backwards from stars,
trying to understand what

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.160
specific skills are.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.460
And I think it's really
good to point out.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.050
Because if you're not deliberate
in trying to

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.140
understand what capital you
should build, it's very hard

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.390
to get it right just by luck.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:13.190
Yeah.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:14.150
AUDIENCE: Is there any
kind of cutoff point?

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:16.430
You mentioned it could be 10
more years before you even

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:17.030
have these opportunities.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:17.990
Right?

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:21.115
Is there any point at which the
game changes, right, like

00:31:21.115 --> 00:31:24.300
after a certain period of time
in a career or down one track

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.280
it's more difficult
to make a leap?

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.290
Sometimes you see people who
are like, I have been in my

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.750
job at this advertising
firm, and now I am a

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.480
beekeeper or whatever.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:31.860
CAL NEWPORT: Yeah.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.435
AUDIENCE:Is there a point
at which it becomes more

00:31:33.435 --> 00:31:34.380
difficult to change?

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.400
CAL NEWPORT: Well, it's
a good question.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.650
I think career capital as sort
of a metaphor helps you

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.810
understand those type
of decisions.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:44.740
So I tell a story in my book
about a marketing executive.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.020
Exactly your example here.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.040
Except for instead of the
beekeeper, she quit and did a

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:48.520
four-month--

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.840
or four-week, actually, yoga
instruction course to become a

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.300
yoga instructor in the
New York area.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.100
And by the end of that first
year, she was on track for

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.840
making something like $15,000,
which supposedly in the New

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.170
York area doesn't go as far as
you might like it to be.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.400
Career capital helps you
understand what was flawed

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.520
about that move.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.920
She had a huge amount of
capital in marketing.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.470
She had zero capital in yoga.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:15.080
So by jumping to a four-week
instructional course, she give

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.830
herself just a little bit
of career capital.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:17.720
Not very much at all.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.670
So she shouldn't expect to be
able to gain much great traits

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.890
in her life right away, because
she doesn't have much

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.310
capital there.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:27.620
So when you think about things
like that, it helps temper the

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.530
impulse to try to start over or
do something from scratch.

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:32.790
Because if you believe that it's
building up capital and

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.100
leveraging it is what makes you
love your work and not the

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.700
matching problem, I'm more meant
for this job than that,

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.350
you'll be much less likely
to jump into

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.690
something completely new.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.770
Because you're actually
retarding your progress at

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.660
having more control
and leverage.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.900
So I think this metaphor of
career capital helps you

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.800
assess whether a change you're
making is I'm bringing my

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.160
capital with me, but I'm
bringing it into a new market

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.960
within my field that it's going
to have some impact,

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.200
versus I'm leaving my capital
on the table and doing

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.120
something completely new.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.990
It allows you to have those
nuances that without the

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:04.785
metaphor can get sort
of confused.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:11.780
Yeah.

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.880
AUDIENCE: So I'm, I guess, old
enough that I sort of missed

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.380
the whole "follow your
passion" thing.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.470
CAL NEWPORT: It was really
my generation.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.356
Yeah.

00:33:17.356 --> 00:33:19.990
AUDIENCE: And the advice that
I got, although it was never

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:23.560
sort of so summarized in just
a handful of words, was more

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.120
like try as many things
as possible.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.410
Don't be afraid to try things.

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:29.170
Don't be afraid to
fail at them.

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.230
And does this in some ways
might have the same end

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.970
result, as long as you're
willing to be paying attention

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:36.614
to what you're doing and
being persistent?

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:37.470
Is this--

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.870
CAL NEWPORT: Yeah.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.665
It's an interesting point,
because in some sense--

00:33:39.665 --> 00:33:41.500
AUDIENCE: Is that
bad advice or--

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.500
CAL NEWPORT: So I think it's
good advice if it's within the

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.515
context of a particular
career capital source,

00:33:49.515 --> 00:33:50.740
if that makes sense.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.600
So if you're building capital
in technology, to expose

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.720
yourself to lots of things is
actually a great way to find

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.830
potential opportunities
asymmetries in the market,

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.380
someplace where you can
really make a move

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.100
like Steve Jobs did.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.660
But to be at Google and to also
be exploring theater and

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.770
to also be exploring filmmaking
and also be

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:13.350
exploring beekeeping, well,
you're crossing strong career

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:14.380
capital division lines.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.840
They're completely unrelated.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.070
And then you run the risk of
slowing down your acquisition

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.230
of capital in any particular.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.230
So I always understand the sort
of hybrid approach that

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:26.120
you have a general field in
which you're building capital.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.480
By doing exposure within there,
you're actually gaining

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.070
more knowledge.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.380
More expertise can actually help
you build and apply it.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.570
So I think that's where that
advice is valuable.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:37.010
I think it's dangerous when
people apply too broadly and

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:41.540
are covering too many things
that are way too disparate, if

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.577
that makes sense.

00:34:42.577 --> 00:34:45.500
AUDIENCE: It does.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.620
CAL NEWPORT: Again, what I'm
sort of doing here is

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.370
geekifying something
that's not geeky.

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:48.590
Right?

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.719
It's my life and my passion.

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:51.280
I'm a scientist.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.650
I'm a computer scientist
like you guys, so

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.340
you understand this.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.270
So I'm coming at it from
that point of view.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.150
But I think it's helpful-- and
I'm surprised that people

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.910
haven't done this before--
to have a bit of a more

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.060
systematic approach to this,
even if it's a little bit

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.170
overkill in some cases.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.390
I think it actually gives us
lots of insight into these

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:09.670
sort of more fuzzy questions.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:10.417
Yeah.

00:35:10.417 --> 00:35:12.325
AUDIENCE: If you were a parent
and you wanted your kids to

00:35:12.325 --> 00:35:15.187
[? learn ?], would it make sense
to get them interested

00:35:15.187 --> 00:35:16.618
in things that you believe will

00:35:16.618 --> 00:35:18.530
someday be rare and valuable?

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:19.920
CAL NEWPORT: Well, it seems like
it's more important if

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.440
you're young, that you need to
build up the ability to build

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.820
up skill, to focus deliberately
on something.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.720
I see college, for example--

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.670
you are picking up specific
skills there, but you're also

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.880
picking up the ability to
do tough, intellectual

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.030
challenges.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:37.470
Or if you're given a term paper,
you have a month to go

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.520
understand this topic and write
about it intelligently.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.580
The reason you should try to
get an A on that is not

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.670
because you're looking for a job
in which you're going to

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.200
have to write term papers
for a living.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.760
It's because you're going to
be in a knowledge work

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.740
economy, and you're going
to have to tackle tough,

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.010
cognitively demanding tasks.

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.610
And you want to do it not only
well, but stretch yourself

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:55.500
while you're doing it.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.730
So my assumption-- and I'm not
a parent yet, but in two

00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:59.480
weeks I will be.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.160
So I'm thinking quite
a bit about this--

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.250
is but focus less--

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:06.750
I'm thinking that I will
be focusing less.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.880
We'll see.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.800
We'll see what actually
happens.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.350
But I will be focusing less on
the specifics of you need to

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.950
choose right now what you want
to do, because that goes to

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.260
this whole myth that you have
a preexisting aptitude, a

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.560
passion that you have
to uncover.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.850
And really put the more focus on
working hard at something,

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.620
taking something and building
the skill because that's--

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.040
ability to do that is what's
going to serve you well, not

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.730
the particular skills you pick
up when you're 16 years old.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:32.730
Yeah.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:35.230
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:38.020
Have you discovered any best
practices in terms of like

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.690
daily habits that knowledge
workers do to

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:42.870
mimic deliberate practice?

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:44.400
I mean, you mentioned being
distracted by email.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.410
We all work at a company where
we probably get hundreds of

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:47.895
emails a day.

00:36:47.895 --> 00:36:51.750
And it's very easy to just like
push the email button.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:52.635
CAL NEWPORT: Yeah.

00:36:52.635 --> 00:36:54.600
AUDIENCE: What are the ways that
like if I wanted to put

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.830
in, even if it's a couple
hundred hours of deliberate

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:59.820
practice are there things that
high performers do that--

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.280
CAL NEWPORT: Yeah.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.130
AUDIENCE: --lead more
to success?

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:02.286
CAL NEWPORT: Yeah.

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:02.390
There are.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.670
There are.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.290
In fact, I have a chapter in
the book where I take two

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:07.280
particular high performers,
a venture capitalist and a

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.290
television writer, and I tried
to understand how they apply

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.310
deliberate practice in their
work right now and how they

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.140
used it to get where
they were.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.870
And there's tips.

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.770
Like the venture capitalist
actually used a spreadsheet to

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:18.710
track his time.

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:21.740
And, in particular, to
track is email time.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.690
And he had these well-chosen
goals for how much time he

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.800
should be spending on email
because he wasn't getting much

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.810
value out of there as compared
to actually vetting deals.

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:31.870
And he would track his time
daily to make sure that he hit

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:32.560
his numbers.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.240
Because he was tracking it, it
forced him to check much less

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.820
often in the batch, because he
had particular numbers that he

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:39.440
was trying to hit.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.750
And that helped him become
more efficient.

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.070
The television writer,
similarly, his whole thing was

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:46.200
that he had--

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.720
he was very clear on
what good meant.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.290
He had a whole group of sort of
collaborators and advisers

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:52.670
that could look at scripts and
say what was bad with them.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.520
And he wrote this sort of
intense amount of writing.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.490
He was working on four or five
projects at a time when he was

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.910
trying to break in and getting
intense feedback on them,

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:02.130
which is another piece of
deliberate practice.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.930
So there are a lot of
specific strategies.

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:05.850
I talk about some of them.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:08.020
I think having the general idea
of deliberate practice

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.190
which I go through can help
you craft your own.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:13.420
I also think that it's a rich
topic that needs to be

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.080
explored by itself.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.950
This is one of the number-one
questions I get.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:19.500
People are really interested in
the specifics of deliberate

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.580
practice of knowledge work.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.340
I think this is actually going
to be a convergence.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.200
It's going to be a big deal in
the next five, ten years.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.330
So you're asking the
right questions.

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:25.610
Yeah.

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:28.400
AUDIENCE: Let me back up a
question on what you teach

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.880
your kids, for whatever
it's worth.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.090
My wife and I have looked to the
professionals and so forth

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:33.130
for our kids.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:34.900
So it worked out
decently well.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.753
But, in fact, David Brooks and
folks have written about a

00:38:37.753 --> 00:38:40.400
fair amount of this and a lot
of-- the thing that you really

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.480
learn from your parents, if
you're lucky, which my kids

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.090
weren't necessarily, is
sort of fortitude

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.040
and stick to itiveness.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:51.400
The idea that you don't give
up, that you learn how to

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.980
concentrate deeply
on a problem.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.110
CAL NEWPORT: Yeah.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:58.045
AUDIENCE: It's a much more
fundamental, more attitudinal

00:38:58.045 --> 00:39:03.580
approach to life, approach to
stuff thing, than anything

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.820
that has something to do
with your specific

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.260
professional skills.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.150
That seems to be better
correlated with

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:11.606
how successful kids--

00:39:11.606 --> 00:39:13.550
how successful parents
have successful kids.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.710
CAL NEWPORT: Yeah.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:14.500
That's right.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.860
And Angela Duckworth's research
on grit, actually, is

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.360
sort of in vogue right now,
and it captures a

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.600
lot of these ideas.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.490
I think it's absolutely true.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:24.200
I work with a theoretical
computer scientist at

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.240
Georgetown who's a phenomenal
problem solver.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.360
It turns out his dad was a
mathematician that used to

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.730
give him these puzzles when he
was young, and he would slip

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:34.670
in there every once in a while
unsolved problems.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:37.940
And it gave him great practice
with sticking with problems

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.370
and working on them and not
expecting to get an answer

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:40.850
right away.

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:43.020
It turns out that's exactly
a skill you need to be a

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.150
successful professional
mathematician, because you

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.170
have to be able to just I'm
going to spend 10 hours with

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:47.750
this problem today.

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:48.270
And I don't know.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:49.110
Maybe it's unsolvable.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.120
Maybe it's not, but you're
getting the hours in.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.040
AUDIENCE: But it probably
generalizes, too.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.670
CAL NEWPORT: I think it
absolutely does, which is why

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.540
I think thinking of school as
practicing, taking on hard

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.950
intellectual challenges, not
only doing them well, but

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:02.450
stretching your ability is a
great way to think about it at

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.780
least in today's economy.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.380
All right.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.220
Well, again, thank you.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.090
It was great to come here.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.400
It was great to meet you all.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.510
If you're interested, the book
is called "So Good They Can't

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:14.700
Ignore You." Get it on Amazon,
Barnes &amp; Noble, or wherever.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.220
I want to thank you again
and thank you for

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.610
having me come speak.

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:18.280
I really enjoyed it.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.530
Thank you.
