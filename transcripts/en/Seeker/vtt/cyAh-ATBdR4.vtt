00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.509
Tired of everyone telling you that social
media is making you sad?

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.650
Now science says its might actually make you
less stressed!

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.639
[DNews Open]

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.119
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.930
Some people say technology is taking over
our lives.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.790
Over half of those online use two or more
social networks.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.110
Some worry this is making us more isolated
and more stressed out as we try to keep up

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.680
with the joneses.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.270
Recent study from the Pew Research Center
suggests otherwise.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.450
Social media can make us feel a little lonely,
we have a constant stream of other people’s

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.000
business and it’s too easy to keep comparing
ourselves to them.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.930
People carefully craft their online personas
and some people get stressed out from the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.930
comparison.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.110
But it’s like comparing your outtakes to
everyone elses highlights.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.670
And then there’s keeping up with yourself,
just like other people try to position themselves

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.940
in a good light, you can get too wrapped up
in doing the same.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.190
Trying to show only your best angle, your
wittiest statuses and your best days at work

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.220
and home.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.400
And there’s the fact you're keeping up with
other’s stress.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.450
Using social media makes you more likely to
be aware of the stress going on in the lives

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.950
of your family and friends.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.380
This could make you your stress levels rise
as well.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.770
This is what researchers call “The Cost
of Caring.”

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.729
Yet there’s a flipside to all of that.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.209
Being better connected through technology
means well, you’re better connected.

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:26.810
Previous studies show that active social media
users, have more close friends, feel more

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.700
supported, are more trusting, and even more
politically active than their disconnected

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.149
or less connected peers.

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.389
For this study, participants in the survey
were asked about their social media use, what

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:38.719
websites they use and how they use them.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.429
They found the link between social media and
stress is pretty indirect.

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.500
But it did show that women seemed to benefit
more than men from being better connected,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.549
even though women report being more stressed
overall.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.369
On a Perceived Stress Scale, women reported
overall stress levels 7% higher than men.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.714
But with all the keeping up with the Joneses
stuff, how is this possible?

00:01:56.714 --> 00:01:58.990
How does social media reduce stress?

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.719
Well it’s a few things.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.579
Women might be burdened with “maintaining
household relationships” and typically,

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.749
they tend to share their emotional experiences
more than men.

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.140
Social media allows for a low-demand easily
accessible way to share.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.930
It’s more efficient and saves time.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.370
Also, there’s kind of a schadenfreude effect
here.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.519
Well the researchers say it’s a little nicer
than that, they call it “the joy of missing

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.519
out.”

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.540
For some women who are more aware of stressful
events in the people who aren’t so close

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.720
to them, their level of stress was lower by
6%.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.330
I guess putting your stress into context and
realizing you don’t have it as bad as that

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.290
other guy is kind of a relief.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.780
And using these technologies more frequently
can be key to being less stressed.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.750
On average those women who send pictures through
their phones, send and receive around 25 emails

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.239
a day and who more frequently use twitter,
have 21% less stress than their peers who

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.280
don’t use any of these.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.129
And these benefits aren’t entirely just
for women.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.219
Social media users of both genders report
higher feelings of social support and are

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.970
more aware of the resources available in their
network.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.439
And like anything, how you use it matters.

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.010
So rather than just scrolling facebook and
browsing twitter, interacting with PEOPLE

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.609
on these sites leads to a better feeling.

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.811
Just like in days of old, communicating, sharing
and supporting make us feel better and feel

00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:18.640
less stressed, we just have a new way of doing
it.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.680

like it check out the links in the description,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.989
and check out THIS video, Tara will tell you
the reason some people in your facebook feed

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.530
are prone to oversharing.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.620
We all know that one guy.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.069
What do you think?

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.290
do you feel close to people with texting and
social media? or does it make you feel lonely?
