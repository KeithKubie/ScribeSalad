00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:02.799
Sal: So I'm here with Sean Logan,

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:04.665
who's the Director of College Counseling

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:07.531
at Phillips Andover
Academy, and Jim Ventre,

00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:09.097
Ven-tree, am I pronouncing it right, Jim?

00:00:09.097 --> 00:00:09.931
Jim: Ven-tree, yes.

00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:11.215
Sal: Ven-tree, who's the Director of

00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:13.665
Admissions and Financial
Aid at Phillips Andover,

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:15.916
and what we're hoping to talk, or start

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:19.298
talking about in this
video, is really just the

00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:22.883
financial aid process, and
in particular, the FAFSA,

00:00:22.883 --> 00:00:25.014
so, I guess, wait a
minute, I should probably

00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:28.082
do that in all caps, my first question for

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:31.048
either of you is, I
guess, "what is the FAFSA,

00:00:31.048 --> 00:00:33.514
"and what does it actually stand for?"

00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:36.599
Sean: Right, so the FAFSA
is the free application

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:39.532
for federal student aid,
and it's really important

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:43.848
for students to realize
that free part of this name,

00:00:43.848 --> 00:00:46.648
because there is an
opportunity to get on the web

00:00:46.648 --> 00:00:49.698
and go to FAFSA.com and
somebody will happily

00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:51.764
help you with it, but
you need to pay for it.

00:00:51.764 --> 00:00:53.666
So the first thing we talk
with students a lot about

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.465
is the FAFSA is a free form.

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:57.097
You should not be paying for it.

00:00:57.097 --> 00:00:59.799
And the title again, it's
by the federal government,

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.882
they use a rubric to sort of figure out,

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:05.498
based on this form, how
much your family should

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.531
contribute to a college education.

00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:10.931
Sal: And it's Free Application
for Federal Student Aid?

00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:12.583
Sean: Student, yes, student aid.

00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:14.109
Sal: And just to hit
the point home of what

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.716
you just said, it should
absolutely be free,

00:01:16.716 --> 00:01:18.666
and there are places where
people will charge you

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.243
to kind of optimize it, or
fill it out for you, or...

00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:23.666
Sean: That's correct, so the first thing,

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:27.197
normally when you start to type in on

00:01:27.197 --> 00:01:29.514
a search engine, FAFSA, a lot of times

00:01:29.514 --> 00:01:31.564
FAFSA.com pops up.

00:01:31.564 --> 00:01:33.931
It's a legitimate site,
but they charge you

00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:35.231
something like 80, 85 dollars

00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:37.182
to help you fill out the form.

00:01:37.182 --> 00:01:40.165
So you want to go to FAFSA.ed.gov

00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:42.614
to start this process.

00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:45.697
Sal: .ed.gov, and there it will be free,

00:01:45.697 --> 00:01:48.531
and what is, when you
fill out this form, in a

00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:49.449
future video we'll actually

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:50.698
take a look at the form itself,

00:01:50.698 --> 00:01:54.848
but what do you input
into it, and what comes

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:57.415
out of it, and then who
uses that information?

00:01:57.415 --> 00:02:00.114
Jim: I think for many
students who are applying

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:02.075
to college right now, they are accustomed

00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:04.981
to telling their story,
in essays and in various

00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:07.715
pieces of their application,
and they have to

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:11.833
think of the FAFSA as just their family's

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:15.384
financial story, and
their financial story has

00:02:15.384 --> 00:02:18.822
many variables, but most
importantly, the things

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:23.832
that the FAFSA asks for are
simplified as things that

00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:26.465
would be questions that
students could probably

00:02:26.465 --> 00:02:28.748
answer right off the top of their head,

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:31.565
in terms of their family
income, and whether they

00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:34.582
own a home, or whether
they rent where they live,

00:02:34.582 --> 00:02:36.382
it's things like that.

00:02:36.382 --> 00:02:37.904
Sal: And, I mean, I
remember filling this, we

00:02:37.904 --> 00:02:39.882
were talking about this
before, I guess clicking

00:02:39.882 --> 00:02:42.803
record, all of us were
significant recipients

00:02:42.803 --> 00:02:45.248
of financial aid, of
need-based financial aid,

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:46.382
and I remember filling it out, I remember

00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:49.048
I kind of had my mom's
tax form, which I had to

00:02:49.048 --> 00:02:51.347
fill out for her, right
before filling out the FAFSA,

00:02:51.347 --> 00:02:52.482
Sean: Exactly (laughing)

00:02:52.482 --> 00:02:53.582
Sal: But that's essentially, I remember,

00:02:53.582 --> 00:02:55.415
at least this was in the early nineties,

00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:59.564
kind of the inputs that I
needed to be able to fill out

00:02:59.564 --> 00:03:01.748
most of the form.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.632
Sean: And that's correct,
yeah, I mean, one of the

00:03:03.632 --> 00:03:06.739
things that specifically
looking at, in working with

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.498
a lot of low-income
families, one of the things

00:03:09.498 --> 00:03:10.932
to realize, is that it generally is

00:03:10.932 --> 00:03:12.865
actually a pretty simple
form, because there

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:14.882
aren't a lot of things
that make it complicated.

00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:17.820
There aren't trust funds,
there aren't investments,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.582
there aren't probably, in a lot of times,

00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:21.481
sometimes there are homes that are owned,

00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:23.148
but a lot of times they're just renting.

00:03:23.148 --> 00:03:24.799
Usually it's a paycheck that comes in,

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.715
and it's sort of a standard
paycheck that comes

00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:30.671
in for the year, so it's actually a pretty

00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:33.397
simple form, it's just
getting students to step up

00:03:33.397 --> 00:03:35.765
and do it, is the real challenge.

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:37.432
Sal: And the reason obviously, it's

00:03:37.432 --> 00:03:38.800
pretty obvious why they care about income,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.814
that's kind of the total amount of money

00:03:41.814 --> 00:03:42.999
your family's making, but then the reason

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.332
why they care about things
like home ownership,

00:03:44.332 --> 00:03:46.465
and if I remember
properly, they ask things

00:03:46.465 --> 00:03:48.064
about the number of siblings you have,

00:03:48.064 --> 00:03:49.431
and they try to understand your family's

00:03:49.431 --> 00:03:52.498
expenses too, and the
whole reason is to kind of

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:55.847
figure out their ability
to pay for college?

00:03:55.847 --> 00:03:59.798
Jim: That's right, so at
the outset, students are

00:03:59.798 --> 00:04:02.134
asked questions to fill
out on their family's

00:04:02.134 --> 00:04:04.965
financial circumstances,
basically what the colleges

00:04:04.965 --> 00:04:07.998
are trying to do, is come to a conclusion,

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:12.048
which allows them to have a
picture of what the family

00:04:12.048 --> 00:04:14.764
is up against every month, every week,

00:04:14.764 --> 00:04:17.549
and what's left in the bank, so to speak,

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.981
at the end of all the
family operating expenses.

00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:23.415
Sal: And so what, after
you fill out the form,

00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:26.082
where does that go, this is at the

00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:28.299
Department of Education site, but do they

00:04:28.299 --> 00:04:30.231
process it, or do they just give the form

00:04:30.231 --> 00:04:32.749
to the universities,
what happens after that?

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.332
Sean: That's a great point Sal, I think

00:04:34.332 --> 00:04:37.431
one of the misperceptions
about the FAFSA is,

00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:40.032
I'm gonna submit this form to the

00:04:40.032 --> 00:04:42.466
government, basically, and
then they're gonna crunch

00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:44.466
all these numbers, and then
they're gonna determine

00:04:44.466 --> 00:04:46.332
a financial aid package for my family.

00:04:46.332 --> 00:04:48.499
I think that's a really
common misperception.

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.165
All the FAFSA does, is it
looks again at your family's

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:54.115
income, number of kids in the family,

00:04:54.115 --> 00:04:55.915
other assets, those
sorts of things, and it

00:04:55.915 --> 00:04:58.998
determines an Estimated
Family Contribution.

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:02.165
What a college does with
that varies greatly.

00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:04.165
And I think that's something that families

00:05:04.165 --> 00:05:05.248
need to understand.

00:05:05.248 --> 00:05:07.681
So all it is going to do
is determine a number.

00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:10.620
That number might mean
your family should be able

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.156
to contribute 1000 dollars towards your

00:05:13.156 --> 00:05:15.415
son or daughter's education, 5000 dollars,

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:17.582
or zero dollars for that matter, but

00:05:17.582 --> 00:05:19.000
that's all it does.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.514
Sal: I see, and the reason
why this exists is so

00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:24.625
that colleges would
have a somewhat uniform

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.193
way of looking at this,
and they can feel good

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:30.599
that the data is real?

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.182
Jim: That's right, and so
one of the things in this

00:05:32.182 --> 00:05:35.299
Estimated Family Contribution
is sort of this sense

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:38.614
that the family is
self-reporting where they stand

00:05:38.614 --> 00:05:41.018
in their family circumstances financially.

00:05:41.018 --> 00:05:42.715
And one of the things
we want to caution about

00:05:42.715 --> 00:05:44.564
is that when you receive a sort of

00:05:44.564 --> 00:05:46.697
Estimated Family Contribution,
or what they call

00:05:46.697 --> 00:05:50.614
the EFC, you want to make
sure that's in line with

00:05:50.614 --> 00:05:52.748
your expectations, because
sometimes that number

00:05:52.748 --> 00:05:57.249
can seem odd to the family
when they understand

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:58.798
where it came from, and they may have made

00:05:58.798 --> 00:06:00.832
a mistake in some way on the form.

00:06:00.832 --> 00:06:02.499
Sal: I see, but then that Estimated Family

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:05.166
Contribution, then that gets
sent to the universities

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:08.115
that you have, usually at
this point, have gotten

00:06:08.115 --> 00:06:10.293
admission to.

00:06:10.293 --> 00:06:13.395
Sean: It'll go to every
university ahead of time,

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:15.594
so if the student
applies to seven schools,

00:06:15.594 --> 00:06:18.029
you're gonna want it there
well before decisions

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.244
come out, there are usually
very strict deadlines

00:06:20.244 --> 00:06:23.278
to get things there in time, but then,

00:06:23.278 --> 00:06:24.895
usually what happens in
the admissions office

00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:28.359
is if Sal, if I'm reading your application

00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:29.645
in the admissions office, and I say great,

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:31.229
Sal Khan is gonna be
admitted, and I call down

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.530
to our financial aid
office, this is all done

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.715
electronically now, but
the financial officer,

00:06:35.715 --> 00:06:37.765
what he will do is open
up your electronic file,

00:06:37.765 --> 00:06:40.015
and he will see the
FAFSA sitting in there,

00:06:40.015 --> 00:06:42.016
and then he will see
that, and it will say, ok,

00:06:42.016 --> 00:06:45.549
the Khan family should be able to pay

00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:47.897
1000 dollars towards Sal's education,

00:06:47.897 --> 00:06:50.481
we cost 50 thousand
dollars, so now we're gonna

00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:51.997
have to create a financial aid package for

00:06:51.997 --> 00:06:54.267
49 thousand dollars to make it possible

00:06:54.267 --> 00:06:55.697
for you to come here.

00:06:55.697 --> 00:06:57.431
Sal: And so that's before you've been

00:06:57.431 --> 00:06:59.480
officially admitted?

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.099
Sean: It's typically
when you get admitted,

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:03.814
then the admissions
office will say, ok now

00:07:03.814 --> 00:07:05.581
calculate a financial aid package.

00:07:05.581 --> 00:07:08.116
Sal: And are these, I can imagine a lot of

00:07:08.116 --> 00:07:09.796
students would worry about this, are these

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:13.270
kind of separate processes,
you know, or will

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.717
the admissions officers
be able to see the kind of

00:07:15.717 --> 00:07:17.570
Estimated Family Contribution,
and then does that

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.984
have the potential to kind of affect your

00:07:19.984 --> 00:07:22.926
chances of admissions?

00:07:22.926 --> 00:07:25.951
Jim: Oh absolutely, I
think colleges are mindful

00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:29.200
of the programs that they
have in place to support

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.999
these students, and so the
college's overall mission

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:36.551
plays a role in how they're
distributing financial aid,

00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:39.119
and the way they view
students that they are going

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:44.368
to support, through what
they uncover in the FAFSA.

00:07:44.368 --> 00:07:46.502
Sean: And Sal, let me add to that, there's

00:07:46.502 --> 00:07:48.467
two important definitions here.

00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:51.568
One is institutions
that are need blind, and

00:07:51.568 --> 00:07:53.857
institutions that are need sensitive.

00:07:53.857 --> 00:07:56.133
And that's an important
question for students to ask

00:07:56.133 --> 00:07:58.368
as they are starting to research colleges.

00:07:58.368 --> 00:08:03.017
Typically need blind
schools mean, whether or not

00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:04.822
you are applying for aid has no impact on

00:08:04.822 --> 00:08:06.534
an admissions decision.

00:08:06.534 --> 00:08:09.917
And, we will fund you
to 100 percent of your

00:08:09.917 --> 00:08:13.318
demonstrated need, based on the FAFSA.

00:08:13.318 --> 00:08:15.050
Ok, so that's an important one.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.201
Needs sensitive, and this
is getting to your point,

00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:18.952
there are schools, and
again, the great majority of

00:08:18.952 --> 00:08:20.901
schools are need sensitive,
because they have limited

00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:23.601
budgets, so they might
take into account at

00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:26.750
some point in the process, financial aid.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.500
If we're sort of talking
to really high-achieving,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.600
low-income students right now, typically

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.701
they are still gonna make out very well,

00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:35.533
because even though the school might take

00:08:35.533 --> 00:08:37.285
into account need, and
the student may need

00:08:37.285 --> 00:08:39.667
as much as a full ride,
if they were really

00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:41.617
top, top students, that's
still somebody they are

00:08:41.617 --> 00:08:43.451
going to support and probably pay for.

00:08:43.451 --> 00:08:45.701
If you are a student that's not as strong,

00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:47.338
that's when you might get
caught in exactly what

00:08:47.338 --> 00:08:49.001
you are asking about, is though you need

00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:50.969
x number of dollars,
you're sort of right in

00:08:50.969 --> 00:08:53.670
a range where we have
a lot of choices, that

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.470
may make you less attractive.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.754
So, again the story I
always tell students is,

00:08:58.754 --> 00:09:00.685
the better student you
are, not only the more

00:09:00.685 --> 00:09:02.003
opportunities you'll have for admission,

00:09:02.003 --> 00:09:03.353
but the better financial aid packages

00:09:03.353 --> 00:09:04.370
you'll be eligible for.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.135
Jim: That's right.

00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:06.586
Sal: And is it possible it might even go

00:09:06.586 --> 00:09:09.135
the other way, where when
they look at your need,

00:09:09.135 --> 00:09:12.144
and they say wow, he or
she comes from a family

00:09:12.144 --> 00:09:14.470
that didn't have all the resources of many

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.836
of our other applicants,
that that actually

00:09:15.836 --> 00:09:20.026
could be a positive, when you apply?

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:22.969
Jim: Oh absolutely, I
think the, for example

00:09:22.969 --> 00:09:25.336
Andover operates on a need blind admission

00:09:25.336 --> 00:09:28.370
initiative, and we're
looking for students who meet

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.170
the demands of our
program, and when you see

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.503
students who may not have
had all the preparation

00:09:34.503 --> 00:09:36.812
in terms of leading up
to coming to Andover,

00:09:36.812 --> 00:09:39.303
it's very compelling to
find students who could

00:09:39.303 --> 00:09:43.132
manage the rigor of our
program, and not have

00:09:43.132 --> 00:09:44.828
had that preparation, and so we would

00:09:44.828 --> 00:09:47.736
be very attracted to
them, and want to provide

00:09:47.736 --> 00:09:49.602
a financial aid package that supports them

00:09:49.602 --> 00:09:50.852
at our school.

00:09:50.852 --> 00:09:52.536
Sal: Right.
Jim: Colleges operate the same way.

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:53.421
Sal: And Phillips Andover, obviously

00:09:53.421 --> 00:09:57.503
a well-recognized high
school, and colleges,

00:09:57.503 --> 00:09:58.363
you're saying, are operating

00:09:58.363 --> 00:10:00.004
in a very similar way, or many do.

00:10:00.004 --> 00:10:01.136
Jim: Exactly, yes they do.

00:10:01.136 --> 00:10:04.903
Sal: Very cool.
