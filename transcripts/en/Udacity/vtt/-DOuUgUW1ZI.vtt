00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hey, welcome back.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, as we've said, this class is all about managing complexity.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now many types of software manage complexity

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
by trying to artificially rule out any type of uncertainty.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That is, say you have a checkbook-balancing program,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and it says you've got to enter the exact amount.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You've got to say $39.27.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You can't say, oh I don't know about $40.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's easier to write programs that deal that way, but it constrains what you can do.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So, in this unit we're going to learn about how the laws of probability

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
can allow you to deal with uncertainty in your programs.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now, the truly amazing thing is that you can allow uncertainty

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and what you know about the world, or what's true right now

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and uncertainty in your actions,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
if the program does something, what happens next?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Even though both of those are uncertain you can still use the laws of probability

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to calculate what it means to do the right thing.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That is, we can have clarity of action.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We can know exactly what the best thing to do is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
even though we're uncertain about what's going to happen.

00:01:08.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So follow with this unit, and we'll learn how to do that.
