00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:09.355
Good afternoon, everyone,
my name's Cliff Samaniego,

00:00:09.355 --> 00:00:11.480
and I work on the business
development team focused

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.857
on Google Play Games.

00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:14.940
And today, we're going to
talk about understanding

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.150
and engaging with your
Google Play audience.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.920
The foundation of
success for Google Play

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.930
is building a great game.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.340
But how do users know
what's a great game

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.300
versus a mediocre game
before they download the APK?

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.300
The answer lies with
consumer ratings and reviews

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.410
that are found on every product
page listing on Google Play.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.100
Ratings and reviews largely
shape the install and purchase

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.530
journey for users and will
help forge your success

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.510
on our platform.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.510
Over the years, we've
seen a direct correlation

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.890
between ratings and
quality and revenue.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.800
The game developers
that have higher ratings

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.580
will have a greater
opportunity to make

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.230
more revenue on Google Play.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.730
So it makes sense that
you spend the time looking

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.090
at what users have
in terms of feedback

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.855
and actively managing
their feedback.

00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:10.970
With ratings and
reviews, we also

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.920
feel that you have
a great opportunity

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.320
to talk with your most
passionate and engaged

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.260
audience.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.680
After all, they're the ones
that are leaving you feedback

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.254
directly on Google Play.

00:01:22.254 --> 00:01:23.670
However, the burden
that sometimes

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.640
comes with popular games
is the influx of reviews.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.000
How can you manage all
these reviews that come in?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.850
With 1,000 different
reviews, you're

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.450
going to see that not
all feedback is equal,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.990
and you're going
to also experience

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.876
the good, the bad, and ugly.

00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:39.250
However, this
shouldn't deter you

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.970
from mining that
great information

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.360
and understanding user
satisfaction and, in the end

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.612
result, making improvements
to your game quality.

00:01:49.612 --> 00:01:51.320
We've recently announced
new improvements

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.690
that will address a lot of
these issues that you face.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.240
That's going to allow you to
search, organize, diagnose,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.030
as well as take
action very quickly.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.530
Some of these
recent enhancements

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.020
include ratings over
time, where you're

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.960
going to see upswings and
downswings of ratings for a set

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.590
period of time, ratings by
device, app version, Android

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.222
version, country and
language, and more.

00:02:16.222 --> 00:02:17.930
You're going to be
able to look at review

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.500
highlights where we're going
to bubble up common themes that

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.290
are found in the
reviews, the ability

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.910
to search through
text in reviews,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.720
and also look at
device on a per review

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.110
basis-- device metadata
on a per review basis.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.670
And last but not least, we
also made an enhancement

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.150
to receive notifications
for updated reviews.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.910
Now let's take a look at
mastering ratings and reviews

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.180
with five very easy tips.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.060
First, be sure to
always reply to reviews,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.880
whether they are good or bad.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.345
What you want to do is build
your community on Google Play

00:02:54.345 --> 00:02:58.590
and make sure that they
are being listened to.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.660
Thank them for
their suggestions.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.960
Also let them know if any
bugs are being addressed.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.320
Include, if you can, your email
support alias in the reply,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.990
especially if
you're going to have

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.150
a lot of bugs that need
to be handled in mass,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.510
and your user support
team can handle that.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.120
If you follow these
steps, users will often

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.590
positively change their rating.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.420
Next, make sure you're
looking at reviews

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.470
and how they change over
time, and overlay these

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.930
with your updates.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.884
If they do coincide
with recent updates,

00:03:31.884 --> 00:03:34.300
you're going to be able to
drill down a little bit further

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.970
to troubleshoot the issue.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.250
Next, take advantage of our
new search functionality.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.830
This powerful new
release is going

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.650
to allow you to run queries on
a lot of different parameters

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:53.560
that include ratings, language,
app version, devices, and more.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.660
We also recently launched
review highlights,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.970
where we're going to bubble
up common keywords that

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.310
are found in your user reviews.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.800
This will help you drill
down on immediate needs.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.330
It will also help you
prioritize surface topics.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.580
These will actually be surfaced
on the product page listing,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.269
so be sure to prioritize
these when you see them.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.040
Last but not least, after
you've identified key themes

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.420
is to have dialogues
and take actions.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.470
There's two tools that are
going to help you out with this.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.280
The first is our recently
launched notifications tool.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.500
That's going to keep you
updated any time a user has

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.090
amended their feedback or
their ratings or comments.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.290
Also, set alerts
within the developer

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.340
console, and that'll
keep you informed

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.890
of any swings in terms of
crashes, installs, and ratings.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:45.760
Thank you very much.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.980
And, hopefully, you are having
a bit better understanding

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.590
of your Google Play audience.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.240
And with that, I'd like to
introduce Mark Chambers.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.460
