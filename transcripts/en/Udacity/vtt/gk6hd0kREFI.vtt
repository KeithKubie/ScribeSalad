00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.740
Here's a new packet layout when IPSec
operates in transport mode and uses ESP.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.720
An IPSec header,
in this case the ESP header,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.850
is inserted after
the original IP header.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.720
The ESP header includes
the security parameter index and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.540
a sequence number, and
we will discuss these shortly.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.530
The ESP header also includes the IV for
encryption.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.860
The ESP trailer has
the padding information, and

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.870
pointer to next header,
such as the TCP or UDP header.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.450
The packet payload and
the ESP trailer are both encrypted.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.510
But the ESP header is not,
because it provides information,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.680
in particular, the security perimeter
index that tells the receiving end

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.500
how to decrypt the payload.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.220
For example, which algorithm and
shared secret key to use.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.790
The ESP header, and

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.300
the encrypted payload, are then
hashed together with a secret key.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.950
And the hash value is stored as
the message authentication code for

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.290
the receiver to verify the authenticity
and integrity of the message.
