00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.430
The man was Ian Fleming.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.510
Born May 28, 1908 to a wealthy family in London,
he and his three brothers were educated at

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.500
Eton College, the same school Princes William
and Harry attended.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.119
Fleming was supposedly a master of athletics.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.530
After Eton, he attended Sandhurst and chose
to study in Munich and Geneva, where he had

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.160
the Alps as a backdrop.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.070
He would later learn to ski and climb the
mountains, perhaps not surprising given his

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.660
athletic history, which would also set the
stage for some of his yet-to-be-conceived

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.180
character in the James Bond books.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.030
Fleming jumped from career to career almost
as often as he switched girlfriends.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.010
He was known to be a “womaniser,” not
that the ladies seemed to mind—apparently

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.730
they thought him very attractive.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.350
In this way, he didn’t differ much from
Bond himself.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.520
He first tried to establish himself in the
military, followed by an attempt to become

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.310
a foreign diplomat—both were unsuccessful.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.360
He later enjoyed a stint working for Reuters,
where he learned basic journalism skills and

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.329
covered a case about a Russian spy.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.320
However, he knew there wasn’t a lot of money
to be had in journalism—at least not for

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.980
him—and he decided to pursue a career as
a stockbroker.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.780
However, the world was fast approaching World
War II.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.460
Despite the fact that his father had died
while serving in World War I when Fleming

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.750
was just nine, it didn’t deter him from
entering the war effort when World War II

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.750
broke out.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.640
He started out as a Lieutenant Commander RNVR
in Naval Intelligence, gathering information

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.520
that helped the smooth-running of the Allied
war effort.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.280
He later became the personal assistant to
the director.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.400
His work took him on many overseas visits,
notably to the United States where he had

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.860
a hand in the establishment of what would
become the CIA.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.350
Specifically, while on a trip to D.C., Fleming
worked with a group to come up with a blueprint

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.040
for the Office of the Coordinator of Intelligence—a
department that eventually evolved into the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.250
CIA.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.170
Much of what Fleming learned during his time
with Naval Intelligence likely helped to shape

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.780
the Bond books, though Fleming was never able
to speak openly about his work because he

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.299
signed the Official Secrets Act.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.390
However, it is thought that his director,
Admiral John Godfrey, was the inspiration

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.280
for the character M. In Diamonds are Forever,
published in 1956, where he wrote, “There

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.400
was a creak from M’s chair and Bond looked
across the table at the man who held a great

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.709
deal of his affection and all his loyalty
and obedience.”

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.859
After the war, Fleming had taken up a job
as the Foreign Manager of The Sunday Times,

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:27.249
but he started talking about wanting to write
“the spy novel to end all spy novels.”

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.249
No doubt after his experiences during the
war, in which he liaised with spies but never

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:34.159
truly became one, he had quite a lot of fodder
waiting to be turned into a book.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.189
Before any writing could be accomplished,
however, Fleming decided to get his life in

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.189
order.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.169
First, he negotiated a contract with his employers
that allowed him three months off a year.

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:45.669
Then, he started building a house in Jamaica.

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.669
He’d fallen in love with the country when
he visited during a naval intelligence meeting

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.640
and vowed to return someday.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.340
Naming his house Goldeneye, after a mission
during the war, he settled in to write.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.780
Some say that he started writing the novels
to impress his soon-to-be wife, Ann, Lady

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.780
Rothermere.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.569
He had been having an affair with Ann for
several years.

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.169
After she became pregnant with their second
child (the first was stillborn) she divorced

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.419
her husband and joined Fleming in Jamaica.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.200
But Ann had surrounded herself with writers
in London, and perhaps he thought publishing

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.879
a book would allow him into that circle.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.620
Whatever the case, the first James Bond novel,
Casino Royale, was published in 1953.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.589
It was written in just two months while Fleming
was on “vacation” in Jamaica, a trend

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:27.329
he continued for subsequent books.

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.030
He kept on working for The Sunday Times until
1959, using his three months’ vacation to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.030
write.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.919
The job was actually pretty useful for his
book writing career: it allowed him to connect

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.760
with people from all over the world, so he
was able to check facts about geography, history,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.810
and culture with people who lived in the areas
he was writing if he was not able to visit

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.810
himself.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.230
This, along with his tendency to include brands
of items in his books, added a level of realism

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.230
to his stories.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.480
For the most part, the popularity of the books
rose steadily, though they received a few

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.150
big surges as well.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.181
First, President John F. Kennedy cited From
Russia With Love as one of his favourite reads,

00:04:02.181 --> 00:04:05.040
resulting in sales rising sharply in the United
States.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.349
(Incidentally, he actually met President Kennedy
and the First Lady in Washington, D.C. and

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.310
reported that it was one of his favourite
fan encounters.)

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.699
Secondly, the first James Bond movie—Dr.
No—was released in 1962, starring the talented

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.120
Sean Connery as Bond.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.900
Fleming would also live to see From Russia
With Love made into a hit film, as well as

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.650
some of the filming of Goldfinger.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.810
Many more Bond films have since been created,
of course, with a range of actors playing

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.479
the title character including, most recently,
Daniel Craig.

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.770
But Fleming wouldn’t live to see exactly
how huge his books—and subsequent movies—would

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.770
become.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.330
He was suffering from heart disease and had
his first heart attack in 1962.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.080
Told not to work during his recovery, he started
writing a book on the sly for his only son,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.930
Caspar, who was ten at the time.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.979
Was this his next great Bond book or perhaps
some sort of “James Bond Jr.” novel geared

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.410
for a younger audience?

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.410
Nope.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.420
The adventuresome novel was a fantastical
tale about a flying car: Chitty Chitty Bang

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.420
Bang.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.689
This book would, of course, go on to be made
into a movie that would become a family classic,

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.229
but Fleming was never able to see it for himself.

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.990
Ian Fleming died on his son’s twelfth birthday—August
12, 1964—after suffering from many different

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.990
health issues.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.870
Needless to say, that was quite the traumatic
experience for a boy to suffer at such a young

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.189
age, and Caspar was plagued by mental health
issues in his teen years until he committed

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:28.270
suicide in 1975 at the age of 23.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.789
Nevertheless, Fleming’s legacy lives on.

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.110
His Bond books as well as Chitty Chitty Bang
Bang have never left print.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.990
Fleming proved to be a talented writer whose
books were able to stand the test of time

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.349
with great descriptions, interesting characters,
and an engaging plot.

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.410
In an article about how to write a thriller,
Fleming said it was easy:

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.670
There is only one recipe for a best seller.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.500
You have to get the reader to turn over the
page.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.280
The name “James Bond” is actually that
of an ornithologist.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.530
Originally, Fleming wanted James bond to be
a boring, ordinary man who happened to experience

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.740
some extraordinary things.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.849
He knew about an ornithologist named James
Bond from Bond’s book, Birds of the West

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.139
Indies, which he had read in his youth and
thought the author’s name was one of the

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.939
most boring names he’d ever heard.

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:15.289
However, the boring name soon became rather
exciting.

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.960
Mrs. Ornithologist Bond actually sent Fleming
a letter thanking him for using the name.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:31.500
Fleming wasn’t the only writer in his family.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.639
His elder brother, Peter, made a career out
of travel writing.

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.080
He also has two nephews and a niece who are
published authors.
