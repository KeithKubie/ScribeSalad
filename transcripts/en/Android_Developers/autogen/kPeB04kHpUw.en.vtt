00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:02.560
 Say hello to Android Things 1.0, 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.019
 It’s Google’s managed operating system. 

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.421
 Used to build and maintain IoT devices on a large scale. 

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:08.925
 I am Wien Piecass, 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.279
 Today I will explain the new features in version 1.0. 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.130
 How does it provide long-term support for production equipment, 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.940
 And a new system-level module hardware lineup. 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.690
 So what is Android Things? 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.480
 Android Things is Google's managed operating system. 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.344
 Allows you to build and maintain IoT devices on a large scale. 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.920
 We provide a powerful platform, 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.680
 Rich developer API with certified hardware 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.900
 And using the security of the Google backend infrastructure, 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.060
 Manageable software updates to do heavy work, 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.990
 So you can focus on building your product. 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.250
 Version 1.0 is the first version of Android Things. 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.650
 Available for your production equipment. 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.290
 We just finished the developer preview. 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.450
 The preview SDK has been downloaded more than 100,000 times. 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.570
 Developer feedback and participation 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.120
 It is critical to our process of moving towards 1.0. 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.925
 We are very grateful to the 10,000 developers, 

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.430
 They submitted the error, 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.460
 Participate in the event and post it in our community to provide us with feedback. 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.880
 The core part of our IoT platform is the supported hardware. 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.730
 Based on system level modules or SOM design. 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.760
 So what is this? 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.940
 SOM is a fully integrated component. 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.690
 With CPU, memory, Wi-Fi Bluetooth and flash storage, 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.970
 You can go directly to the final design. 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.135
 It's like using a library when writing software. 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.285
 SOM is certified by Google and we have a motherboard support package. 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.124
 These include the kernel, drivers and libraries for Android support. 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.970
 With Android Things 1.0, we announce support 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.510
 Based on NXP, SOM designed by Qualcomm and MediaTek, 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.910
 These modules have been certified for production. 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.444
 It can be mass produced to create real consumer products. 

00:01:41.444 --> 00:01:44.440
 If you want to try Android Things right away without buying SOM, 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.860
 You can even use any kind of development platform, 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.301
 Even the Raspberry Pi 3, 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.260
 This highlights an important feature of Android Things. 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.160
 It can be prototyped quickly and easily. 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.720
 When you are ready for production, 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.992
 According to your needs, you can easily purchase small or large quantities of SOM. 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.410
 Then your software will run. 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.380
 Then you can design your own printed circuit board or PCB. 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.279
 Connect your hardware to the SOM. 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.499
 When building an IoT device, 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:10.533
 It is very important to stay safe. 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.460
 Provide timely software updates over the Air or OTA 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.102
 Is one of the basic parts, 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.916
 The production hardware platform supports stability fixes and security patches. 

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:24.557
 Automatic updates are enabled by default for all devices. 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.610
 For each Android Things version, 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.850
 Google will offer three years of free stability fixes and security patches. 

00:02:30.863 --> 00:02:33.163
 Additional extension support options are available. 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.404
 Even after the official support window ends, 

00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:38.873
 You can still continue to push app updates to your device. 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.630
 Upload using the Android Things console 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.663
 Contains updated Android APKs, 

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:47.606
 So that the OTA mechanism can push them to your device. 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.610
 You can initially try to use 100 active devices 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.367
 For non-commercial use. 

00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:53.950
 When you are ready for mass production, 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.035
 We will provide you with a distribution agreement. 

00:02:56.053 --> 00:02:59.716
 You are now ready to mass sell your equipment to the public. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.003
 With Android Things, 

00:03:01.003 --> 00:03:06.130
 You can build apps using the rich framework provided by the Android SDK and Google Play services. 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.264
 Including today’s mobile developers 

00:03:08.273 --> 00:03:12.873
 Use the same UI toolkit, multimedia support and connection API. 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.300
 You can also easily transfer your app 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.750
 Integrate with popular Google services such as Firebase, TensorFlow 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.165
 And Cloud IT Core. 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.723
 This is done using many existing Android client libraries. 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.245
 Since it is Android, 

00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:29.490
 So you can use Android Studio and all its languages ​​and tools directly. 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.060
 This means you can do it in Kotlin as needed. 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.461
 Easy programming and debugging in Java, C++ or C. 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.670
 Who else is using Android Things? 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.291
 You may have seen it 

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:43.318
 New voice-activated speakers from Polk, LG and iHome, 

00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:46.691
 And smart displays from Lenovo, LG and JBL. 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.620
 These devices showcase the power of Google Assistant. 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.816
 And will be launched soon to the store near you. 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.857
 There are also many startups and design agencies that use Android Things. 

00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:02.096
 Come and create new ideas for the variety of devices you will soon see. 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.553
 We want to make it easy for anyone to start building IoT devices. 

00:04:06.553 --> 00:04:08.430
 Without having to own your own factory, 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.560
 Also does not require a lot of money. 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.935
 This is part of our efforts to democratize hardware development. 

00:04:13.935 --> 00:04:17.245
 Make it available to more software developers. 

00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:19.579
 If you want to start using Android Things, 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.209
 We have a great community website 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.880
 AndroidThings.withgoogle.com, 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.516
 You can view the developer kit in it 

00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:27.726
 And interesting projects created by others. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.010
 What is next? 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.290
 Get some hardware, view the documentation, 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.260
 Download some sample source code and try it. 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.180
 Join our community and ask questions 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.513
 And share your thoughts with others. 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.160
 Android Things 1.0 is now open. 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.690
 And ready to put into production. 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.340
 I really look forward to seeing 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.310
 All the exciting products you build. 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.510
 I am Wien Piecass, looking forward to seeing you next time.
