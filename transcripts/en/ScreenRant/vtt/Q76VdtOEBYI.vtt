00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.920
When you think of animated films, Disney is
the first company to come to mind because

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.330
their films have shaped our childhood.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.309
Despite their longevity they sometimes don’t
get scenes right the first time around and

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.270
that’s why there are alternate versions
of scenes or even deleted scenes.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.830
Recording segments and storyboarding a scene
only to decide to cut it from the film is

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.830
not uncommon.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.490
Let’s take a look at some of your favorite
Disney films and the process behind these

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.490
changes.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:46.250
Here is Screen Rant’s list of 10 Disney
Movie Moments Deleted From The Final Cut.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.530
Beauty and the Beast

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.780
Disney’s 1991 film, Beauty and the Beast
was the first animated film to be in the category

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.740
of Best Picture at the Oscars.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.840
The film ultimately lost the award to Jonathan
Demme’s The Silence of the Lambs but it

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.039
did win Oscars for Original Score and Original
Song.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.510
Maybe they wouldn’t have been as fortunate
if they kept the 11-minute version of the

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.290
song Human Again in there.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.300
They ultimately cut the song to help move
the story but later released a shorter version

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.610
of the song on DVD in 2002.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.330
So if you want a little more enchantment in
your life check it out.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.430
Tangled

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.380
A storybook opening with the reveal of a story
is nothing short of clichéd and was even

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.990
mocked in the 2001 film Shrek.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.270
When the filmmakers behind Tangled were working
on an opening sequence of their 2010 film

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.610
they did just that.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.520
But remember filmmaking is a process and with
each step the film hopefully gets better.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.110
In this deleted sequence the filmmakers did
pull ideas to use in final opening out of

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.810
the film including the teardrop from the sun.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.950
So it was worth the extra steps.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.950
Toy Story

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.100
Lee Unkrich moved from editor of Toy Story
to director of Toy Story 3 because of his

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.000
keen eye to story telling.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.360
One example of this came from his choice to
delete a scene of Sid torturing Buzz and Woody

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.470
at his home in the original film.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.860
He felt the audience would be too fond of
the main characters and wouldn’t want to

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.510
see them tortured, so he cut the torture and
went straight to the interrogation.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.489
Smart move Unkrich, you made many of us cry
in Toy Story 3 when we thought our beloved

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.170
characters were doomed.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.170
Moana

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.030
Disney’s 2016 animated film Moana splashed
into theaters and the hearts of theatergoers.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.480
Some fans of the film would be surprised to
learn that there was another song that was

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.599
cut from the film.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.900
The songs name was Warrior and Moana and Maui
actually did a duet together.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.280
It was a way for the filmmakers to show the
two characters bonding but despite enjoying

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.359
the song they ultimately had to cut it out
of the film.

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.989
The Little Mermaid

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.950
The two most important scenes of a movie are
the first ten minutes and the last ten minutes.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.950
The first ten you need to grab the audience’s
attention and the last ten you need them to

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.689
leave talking about the film.

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.860
In the final scene of The Little Mermaid the
filmmakers did just that but originally they

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.030
had some issues.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.930
In an alternate version the film, the character
of Ursula wasn’t as scary during the ending.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.459
She was much closer to their heroine’s scale,
which made her not as frightening.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.459
Sleeping Beauty

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.200
In the film Sleeping Beauty, Princess Aurora
was cursed by Maleficent and her family were

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.549
told that before the sun sets on Aurora's
sixteenth birthday, she shall prick her finger

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.909
on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:33.079
In the film you hear a spooky vocal note calling
her to a spindle of a spinning wheel.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.849
But it really wasn’t a musical note.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.389
The films audio track was recorded on magnetic
tape and because of the poor quality you heard

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.769
that note instead of the word, which was actually
calling the name, “Aurora”.

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.719
Lilo &amp; Stitch

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:50.870
Stitch is a mischievous character but he is
in no way is he evil but originally the animators

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.870
wanted him to be.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.260
In a deleted scene Lilo shows Stitch her other
best friend Pudge the Fish and gives him a

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.260
kiss.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.609
Instead of Stitch giving him a kiss too he
throws Pudge on the ground and before Lilo

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.879
can save him birds come and attack her.

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.609
The fish dies as Stitch watches laughing.

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.140
We know Stitch isn’t the sweetest guy in
the world but he’s not a killer.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.879
Maybe the animators were having a bad day
when they wrote that scene.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.120
The Emperor's New Groove

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.450
Like many other cut scenes from this list,
in The Emperor's New Groove featured another

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.780
scene was a little too violent.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.440
Warriors gathered together to practice the
destruction of Pacha's Village.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:37.450
This dark and irrelevant scene was animated
but then later cut out due to being unnecessary.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.340
Luckily the sarcastic Emperor Kuzco learned
his evil ways and became a better ruler before

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.410
they had a chance to execute his plans.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.410
Robin Hood

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.190
There have been many versions of Robin Hood
made and it seems like a few different endings

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.280
for Disney’s 1973 animated film too.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.440
At the end of the film when a fire engulfs
Robin Hood he is hurt by an arrow and Little

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.010
John carries him away.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.060
As Prince John follows blood droppings into
a church he finds Maid Marion tending to Robin’s

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.060
wounds.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.800
He offers to take away Robin’s pain as he
reveals a dagger and she bravely tells him

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.160
not to come closer.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.680
Then King Richard arrives and ends Prince
John tyranny.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.130
We kinda like this ending more, what about
you?

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.130
Frozen

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.620
It’s hard to imagine Elsa being anything
but the lovable character she is on screen

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.000
but that is not the case.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.590
Originally she was meant to be the villain
but someone at Disney wised up and saw the

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.710
potential of a story between sisters.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:40.700
In a deleted scene she uses her powers to
lift and torture two guards for information

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.700
showing a very evil side.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.250
Do you prefer good Elsa or evil Elsa?

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.020
We think Disney preferred good Else due to
the box office success of Frozen.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.850
There you have it, 10 Disney Movie Moments
Deleted From The Final Cut.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.040
