Welcome back.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.245
In this session we're
going to talk about objects.

00:00:03.245 --> 00:00:06.720
An object is a way of organizing data
and functionality, and something

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.722

the term Object Oriented Programming.

00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:13.590

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.470
in this session, we'll practice
