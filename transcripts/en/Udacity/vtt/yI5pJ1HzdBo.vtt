00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.719
Let's put everything together now by looking at a trace

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.320
of an entire lookup. Now in the examples before, we didn't

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.420
get to see the full lookup hierarchy because we issued

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.570
a recursive query. But let's suppose we wanted to see every

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.010
step of the DNS lookup process. You can do this

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.850
by using the trace option in dig. Here you can see

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.140
exactly what we saw before, which is the local resolver.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.880
In this case, issuing a query to a local resolver and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.840
receiving a referral to an authoritative server

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.480
for dot which could be any of the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.415
following. That query, lists an answer for the

00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:37.450
.edu servers which subsequently issues a referral to

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.700
the servers that are authoritative for gatech. Which

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.882
ultimately reply with the appropriate a records as

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:47.657
well as the authoritative nameservers for gatech.edu. A

00:00:47.657 --> 00:00:50.937
final interesting example explores how to map an

00:00:50.937 --> 00:00:52.898
ip address. Back to a name, in

00:00:52.898 --> 00:00:56.486
this case, we're ultimately looking for PTRrecord, which

00:00:56.486 --> 00:00:59.394
the name corresponding to this ip address. But

00:00:59.394 --> 00:01:02.576
first, what happens is we receive a special

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:05.672
referral when we ask the root servers about

00:01:05.672 --> 00:01:09.658
this particular IP address. Instead of being referred

00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:12.736
to a particular .com or .edu. We referred

00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:16.344
to a special top level domain called inaddr.arpa,

00:01:16.344 --> 00:01:20.034
which maintains referrals to authoritative servers

00:01:20.034 --> 00:01:23.314
that are maintained by the respective internet

00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:28.406
routing registries, such as ARN, RIPE, APNIC and so forth. So here we

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:32.030
see a referral to inaddr.arpa. Subsequently,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.510
we see a referral to 130.in-addr.arpa corresponding

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.590
to the first octet of the IP address. Next when we ask errant

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.090
about 130.in-addr.arpa we receive another referral, which is to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.160
207.130.in-addr.arpa. And because 130.207

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.890
is allocated to gatech.edu. Aaron knows that the appropriate referral

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.170
for this part of the address space is to DNS 1,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.730
2, or 3.gottech.edu. Next we issue a query for the next part

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.700
of the octet. 7.207.130.inanter.arpa

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.732
corresponding to the first 3 octets. And now we actually get the PTR.

00:02:16.732 --> 00:02:21.700
Because DNS3.gatech.edu knows the reverse mapping

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.960
between 130207.7.36 and the name for that IP address. So you can see

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.840
that the PTR records, or those that map IP

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.195
addresses to names, are resolved through a special hierarchy through

00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:40.300
in-addr.arpa at the root. Followed by a walk through the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.640
regional registries and ultimately, to the domains, such as gatech,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.480
that are responsible for particular regions of the IP address space.
