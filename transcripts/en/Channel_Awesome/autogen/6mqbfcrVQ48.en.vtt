built around however I'm going to have

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240
built around however I'm going to have
 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.850
built around however I'm going to have
to be doing a lot of modifications to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860
to be doing a lot of modifications to
 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.200

cut the barrel down I'm going to have to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330
cut the barrel down I'm going to have to
 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.109
cut the barrel down I'm going to have to
grind some pieces out screw pieces onto

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119
grind some pieces out screw pieces onto
 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.029

it and I'd rather not ruin a perfectly

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039
it and I'd rather not ruin a perfectly
 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.800

good replica so we're going to use this

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810
good replica so we're going to use this
 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.749
good replica so we're going to use this
and make a two part mold using the same

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759
and make a two part mold using the same
 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.370
and make a two part mold using the same
materials that we talked about in the

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380
materials that we talked about in the
 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.199
materials that we talked about in the
previous episode only this was going to

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:25.209
previous episode only this was going to
 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:27.449
previous episode only this was going to
be two parts and we're going to pour our

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:27.459
be two parts and we're going to pour our
 

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:29.490
be two parts and we're going to pour our
resins into it and get an exact copy of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500
resins into it and get an exact copy of
 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.460
resins into it and get an exact copy of
this Luger so it'll be made out of resin

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470
this Luger so it'll be made out of resin
 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.609
this Luger so it'll be made out of resin
leaving hard plastic but it'll be easier

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619
leaving hard plastic but it'll be easier
 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.249
leaving hard plastic but it'll be easier
to sand and cut and grind and I don't

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259
to sand and cut and grind and I don't
 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.589
to sand and cut and grind and I don't
have to worry about ruining a perfectly

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:40.599
have to worry about ruining a perfectly
 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.620
have to worry about ruining a perfectly
good replica I just have to pour about

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630
good replica I just have to pour about
 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.300
good replica I just have to pour about
$15 worth of resin into mold so as I

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310
$15 worth of resin into mold so as I
 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.380
$15 worth of resin into mold so as I
said the rest of the component can be

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390
said the rest of the component can be
 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.730
said the rest of the component can be
pretty simple they can ever be things

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740
pretty simple they can ever be things
 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.839
pretty simple they can ever be things
that you can buy at the hardware store

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:51.849
that you can buy at the hardware store
 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.460
that you can buy at the hardware store
the barrel size that I'm going to go

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470
the barrel size that I'm going to go
 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.370
the barrel size that I'm going to go
with I think I'm going to use a 3/4 inch

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380
with I think I'm going to use a 3/4 inch
 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.449
with I think I'm going to use a 3/4 inch
PVC and the 3/4 inch PVC coupling we're

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459
PVC and the 3/4 inch PVC coupling we're
 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.400
PVC and the 3/4 inch PVC coupling we're
also going to be using some half inch

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410
also going to be using some half inch
 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.219
also going to be using some half inch
PVC I'm just going to cut the tip off to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229
PVC I'm just going to cut the tip off to
 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.770
PVC I'm just going to cut the tip off to
fit for the tip of the barrel and then

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780
fit for the tip of the barrel and then
 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.040
fit for the tip of the barrel and then
for the ribbing there's some like

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
for the ribbing there's some like
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.330
for the ribbing there's some like
machining and ribbing on the barrel

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340
machining and ribbing on the barrel
 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.440
machining and ribbing on the barrel
rather than doing any machining and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450
rather than doing any machining and
 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.600
rather than doing any machining and
stuff on this PVC and really have

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610
stuff on this PVC and really have
 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.610
stuff on this PVC and really have
materials I only have the tools to do

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620
materials I only have the tools to do
 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.750
materials I only have the tools to do
that

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760
that
 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.100
that
I would have to do it by hand which

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110
I would have to do it by hand which
 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.380
I would have to do it by hand which
would take a lot of time so instead I'm

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390
would take a lot of time so instead I'm
 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.559
would take a lot of time so instead I'm
going

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569
going
 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.239
going
use this piece of flexible tubing as the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:30.249
use this piece of flexible tubing as the
 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.640
use this piece of flexible tubing as the
ribbing is really close together I got

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650
ribbing is really close together I got
 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.429
ribbing is really close together I got
this at Home Depot while back and I've

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439
this at Home Depot while back and I've
 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:36.720
this at Home Depot while back and I've
used it for different projects and stuff

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730
used it for different projects and stuff
 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.640
used it for different projects and stuff
like that so I have a bunch of this hose

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650
like that so I have a bunch of this hose
 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.410
like that so I have a bunch of this hose
but it was pretty inexpensive and then

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420
but it was pretty inexpensive and then
 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.789
but it was pretty inexpensive and then
we're also gonna be using some various

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799
we're also gonna be using some various
 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.030
we're also gonna be using some various
size dowel rods and we'll be kind of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040
size dowel rods and we'll be kind of
 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.459
size dowel rods and we'll be kind of
hanging it all together using super glue

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:47.469
hanging it all together using super glue
 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.720
hanging it all together using super glue
and jb weld plastic weld so the first

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730
and jb weld plastic weld so the first
 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.149
and jb weld plastic weld so the first
process is we have to make the gun by

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159
process is we have to make the gun by
 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.339
process is we have to make the gun by
pouring our resins into our mold so

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349
pouring our resins into our mold so
 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.050
pouring our resins into our mold so
let's take a look at it so in the future

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060
let's take a look at it so in the future
 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.149
let's take a look at it so in the future
I will be doing a tutorial on making a

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159
I will be doing a tutorial on making a
 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.679
I will be doing a tutorial on making a
two-part mold it's very similar to the

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689
two-part mold it's very similar to the
 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.619
two-part mold it's very similar to the
one part mold obviously but when making

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629
one part mold obviously but when making
 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:08.849
one part mold obviously but when making
a two-part mold you have to build

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859
a two-part mold you have to build
 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.580
a two-part mold you have to build
registration keys into your mold so that

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590
registration keys into your mold so that
 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.069
registration keys into your mold so that
the two pieces fit together the same way

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079
the two pieces fit together the same way
 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.319
the two pieces fit together the same way
every time that way don't get any

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329
every time that way don't get any
 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.030
every time that way don't get any
shifting or anything like that in your

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040
shifting or anything like that in your
 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.420
shifting or anything like that in your
mold then here I'm just and whinging the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430
mold then here I'm just and whinging the
 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.750
mold then here I'm just and whinging the
two pieces between some scrap plywood

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760
two pieces between some scrap plywood
 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.599
two pieces between some scrap plywood
and clamping it down so that is airtight

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609
and clamping it down so that is airtight
 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.800
and clamping it down so that is airtight
has to be careful not to clamp it down

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810
has to be careful not to clamp it down
 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.780
has to be careful not to clamp it down
too much so it doesn't compress the mold

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790
