00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.120
A calendar year is made of three hundred and
sixty five days -- a number that refuses to

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.769
be divide nicely, which is why we end up with
uneven months of either 30 or 31 days.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.580
Except for February -- the runt of the litter
-- which only gets 28... except when it gets

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.870
29 and then the year is 366 days long.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.870
Why does that happen?

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.640
What kind of crazy universe do we live in
where some years are longer than others?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.190
To answer this we need to know: just what
is a year?

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.610
Way oversimplifying it: a year is the time
it takes Earth to make one trip around the

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.610
sun.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.320
This happens to line up with the cycle of
the seasons.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.730
Now, drawing a little diagram like this showing
the Earth jauntily going around the sun is

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.190
easy to do, but accurately tracking a year
is tricky when you're on Earth because the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.430
universe doesn't provide an overhead map.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.500
On Earth you only get to see the seasons change
and the obvious way to keep track of their

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.260
comings and goings is to count the days passing
which gives you a 365 day calendar.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.210
But as soon as you start to use that calendar,
it slowly gets out of sync with the seasons.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.079
And with each passing year the gap gets bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.810
In three decades the calendar will be off
by a week and in a few hundred years the seasons

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.100
would be flipped -- meaning Christmas celebrations
taking place in summer -- which would be crazy.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.100
Why does this happen?

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.100
Did we count the days wrong?

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.079
Well the calendar predicts that the time it
takes for the Earth to go around the sun is

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:06.189
8,760 hours.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.670
But, if you actually timed it with a stopwatch
you'd see that a year is really longer than

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.880
the calendar predicts by almost six hours.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.020
So our calendar is moving ever-so-slightly
faster than the seasons actually change.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.630
And thus we come to the fundamental problem
of all calendars: the day/night cycle, while

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.749
easy to count, has nothing to do with the
yearly cycle.

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.189
Day and night are caused by Earth rotating
about its axis.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.189
When you're on the side faceing the sun, it's
daytime and when you're on the other side

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.189
it's night.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.389
But this rotation is no more connected to
the orbital motion around the sun than a ballerina

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:36.619
spinning on the back of a truck is connected
to the truck's crusing speed.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.259
Counting the number of ballerina turns to
predict how long the truck takes to dive in

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.360
a circle might give you a rough idea, but
it's crazy to expect it to be precise.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.479
Counting the days to track the orbit is pretty
much the same thing and so it shouldn't be

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.790
a surprise when the Earth dosen't happen to
make exactly 365 complete spins in a year.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.310
Irritatingly, while 365 days are too few 366
days are too many and still cause the seasons

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.740
to drift out of sync, just in the opposite
way.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.069
The solution to all this is the leap year:
where February gets an extra day, but only

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.439
every four years.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.040
This works pretty well, as each year the calendar
is about a quarter day short, so after four

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.390
years you add an extra day to get back in
alignment.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.390
Huzzah!

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.390
The problem has been solved.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.540
Except, it hasn't.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.740
Lengthening the calendar by one day every
four years is slightly too much, and the calendar

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.130
still falls behind the seasons at the rate
of one day per hundred years.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.459
Which is fine for the apathetic, but not for
calendar designers who want everything to

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.680
line up perfectly.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.740
To fix the irregularity, every century the
leap year is skipped.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.540
So 1896 and 1904 were leap years but 1900
wasn't.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.239
This is better, but still leaves the calendar
ever-so-slightly too fast with an error of

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.000
1 day in 400 years.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.030
So an additional clause is added to the skip
the centuries rule that if the century is

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.879
divisible by 400, then it will be a leap year.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.160
So 1900 and 2100 aren't leap years, but 2000
is.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.180
With these three rules, the error is now just
one day off in almost eight thousand years

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.569
which the current calendar declares 'mission
accomplished' and so calls it a day.

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.390
Which is probably quite reasonable because
eight thousand years ago humans were just

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.730
figuring out that farming might be a good
idea and eight thousand years from now we'll

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.549
be hopefully be using a calendar with a better
date tracking system.

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.150
But perhaps you're a mathematician and a 0.0001
percent error is an abomination in your eyes

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.150
and must be removed.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.370
"Tough luck" says The Universe because the
length of a day isn't even constant.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.360
It randomly varies by a few milliseconds and
on average and very slowly decreases by about

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.110
1 millisecond per hundred years.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.970
Which means it's literally impossible to build
a perfect calendar that lasts forever.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.090
In theory the length of a day will expand
to be as long as a curent month -- but don't

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.019
worry in practice it will take tens of billions
of years, and our own expanding sun will destroy

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.799
the earth long before that happens.

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.129
Sorry, not quite sure how we got from counting
the days of the months to the fiery unavoidable

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.299
end of all human civilization -- unless of
course we have an adequately funded space

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.349
program (hint, hint) -- but there you have
it.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.409
For the next eight millennia Leap years will
keep the calendar in sync with the seasons

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.890
but in a surprisingly complicated way.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.290
You can learn a lot more about orbits, different
kinds of years and supermassive black holes

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.290
and over at Minute Physics.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.170
As always, Henry does a great job of explaining
it all in his new video.
