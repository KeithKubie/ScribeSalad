00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:08.029
CORY O'CONNOR: Hello, everybody.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:08.860
Hello, hello.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.250
Thanks for coming.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.370
My name is Cory
O'Connor, and I'm

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.250
Product Manager on Android TV
for major platform features,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.965
including the system
UX set up and more.

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:21.840
ISAAC KATZENELSON: Hi,
I'm Isaac Katzenelson,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.850
and I'm the Technical Lead for
the Home Screen and Launcher

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.540
experience.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.540
CORY O'CONNOR: So I know
happy hour is coming up

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.760
and we'll try to keep
this really interesting,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.140
to the point, and get to
the drinks shortly after.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.232
I'm going to start and give
you all an ecosystem update

00:00:37.232 --> 00:00:39.190
and walk through some of
our new announcements.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.023
And then I'm going to
hand it over to Isaac,

00:00:41.023 --> 00:00:43.990
and he's going to give you the
technical details about how

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.320
you as Android developers
can bring the new experiences

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.810
to your apps.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.440
So there are big changes
coming to Android TV.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.940
But before we dive into them,
we wanted to take a little bit

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.950
look back this year.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.760
In short, it's been a
great year for Android TV.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.890
We continue to
see amazing growth

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.269
in the number of devices.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.540
Our strong partnerships with
pay TV operators and hardware

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.570
manufacturers have allowed us
to more than double the number

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.630
of devices that have
activated in 2016.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.450
And we actually expect that
to continue, if not increase

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.820
in 2017 and going forwards.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.740
We're seeing this growth
both in the set-top box form

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.310
factor, which includes streaming
devices and cable and satellite

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.850
form factor boxes, and in
addition to the smart TV form

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.530
factor.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.720
Since last year at
I/O, we've launched

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.620
a number of new
devices with partners,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.520
including the Dish, AirTV with
Dish, the MiBox with Xiaomi,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.460
and with Airtel we actually
launched the first satellite

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.985
set-top box based on Android
TV in India this year.

00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:50.416
So that's pretty exciting.

00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:52.540
The list of partners up
here is actually just a few

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.730
that we wanted to call out.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.250
We've also expanded our
international footprint

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.360
to 70 countries, and there
are now more than 3,000 apps

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.440
on the Play Store.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.490
So that's pretty
exciting, Android TV apps.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.160
In addition, though
mobile viewing has grown,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.730
the TV still dominates
for lean back content.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.250
There's a recent Netflix
report came out shows

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.170
that while acquisition
of a user can

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.120
happen across a number
of form factors--

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.150
that could be laptops,
computers, phones, tablets,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.560
and the TV itself--

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.320
67% of long-term viewing
happens on the TV

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.220
and in the living room.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.170
Now this just validates
what we've long held,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.770
which is that the
TV app experience is

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.500
critical for content providers.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.210
It's what you have
to nail in order

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.580
to deliver long-term,
highly satisfied users.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.530
As Dave said in the
keynote this morning,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.720
Android TV has seen
tremendous growth.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.870
I think his stats were a million
new activations every two

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.960
months.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.760
But as they say, the
best is yet to come.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.400
So we launched Android
TV three years ago,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.890
and since then
we've learned a lot.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.540
But this year we
took the opportunity

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.730
to take a step
back and take stock

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.520
of where we were on
the platform, and also

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.950
how changes--

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.200
to how people were engaging with
content in the living rooms.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.210
Now across the
industry, we found

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.120
these three common issues,
these three core needs that

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.340
were really going unaddressed.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.980
So the first thing we saw
was that it's really hard

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.290
to come to grips with
all the different content

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.530
available to us.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.290
So families now have
multiple sources

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.870
for what they want to watch
depending on the mood,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.550
the time of day,
who's in the room,

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.050
and a bunch of other factors.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.550
And it's interesting
because content

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.370
is mostly visible within
the app or service.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.460
So what you do is
you turn on the TV,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.640
and you have to actually
like deep dive into the app

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.010
to see if it has
something you're actually

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.780
interested in watching.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.900
So it's become really hard
to know what's available

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.180
before you figure out who
you want to watch it from,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.810
which we kind of realize is
a bit of a weird situation.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.340
Also, the problem
gets a bit harder

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.560
because there are so many
different types of content

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.000
available to watch.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.650
Could be video on
demand, and that

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.400
could be through a
subscription, paid or rented.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.450
It could be digital, web-driven
sort of social content.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.420
Or it could be live
television through a pay TV

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.170
subscription or an antenna
or over the air source.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.089
So as of yet, it's
been really hard

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.580
to fold all of these
different types of content

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.550
into an empowering
experience for users.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.240
So the second thing we saw
is that the emotional hook

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.720
from a piece of content that
we see, it's diminishing.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.700
You can imagine that
we may have found

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.550
our way into a list of options.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.820
It could be recommendations
or something like that.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.960
And we're seeing the movie art
or poster art and we're just,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.970
we're not feeling
connected to any of it.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.740
Now with this huge
number of options

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.890
for content available
to us, which we love,

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.830
we like a big menu, but
we're losing our ability

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.690
to make a decision.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.640
Now we saw users
with these huge lists

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.920
of options available to them.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.420
Maybe there's a watch
list that they've curated,

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.420
or maybe there's recommendations
that they've made sure,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.580
you know, as much as
possible that it reflects

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.930
what they want to watch.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.600
But when the time comes to
actually play something off

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.662
of that, they really
can't find the spark

00:05:12.662 --> 00:05:14.620
that they originally had,
why they put it there

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.950
in the first place.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.130
So the watch list
had become more

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.910
aspirational than actionable.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.000
The third thing we saw, people
were really looking for ways

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.120
to tweak the content on
a device to customize it

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.830
for how they want to watch.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.450
So when you bring
a TV into your home

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.147
and you sign up for a service or
an app, the shows, the actors,

00:05:36.147 --> 00:05:37.480
they become part of your family.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.380
They're part of your routine.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.600
You watch them every night.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.650
It's like a ritual.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.230
We think that part of this
should be being able to nest

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.290
with the device, to customize
the experience so that it fits

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.330
with your life and your needs.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.860
If you watch people get
a new TV or a new phone,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.440
one of the first things they
do is they sort of move things

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.130
around, right?

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.420
You move the apps around.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.440
You set the background.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.610
You set your ring tone.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.480
You customize it to how
you want to use the device.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.720
But with TV, from a
content perspective,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.750
people really can't do that.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.967
Now these concerns have
been around for some time.

00:06:12.967 --> 00:06:14.050
We're not surfacing these.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.240
These are the only people
to have ever discovered

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.170
these things.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.220
But they come out now and again
in user research and market

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.530
and analyst reports.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.160
They're known issues.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.340
But what we've done is we've
taken these issues to heart

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.700
in Android O, and we've set
out to directly address them

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.690
with a major refresh
of Android TV.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.700
Now the first major
change you probably

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.076
have already heard about.

00:06:38.076 --> 00:06:40.450
Earlier this year, we announced
that the Google Assistant

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.490
will be coming to Android TV.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.950
The Google Assistant is
your own personal Google.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.250
You can ask it questions.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.692
You can tell it to do things.

00:06:47.692 --> 00:06:49.150
It's always ready
to help, and it's

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.810
available across
all of your devices,

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.850
so you can integrate
it into your life.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.200
Now what does that
really mean for TV?

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.600
Well, one of the core
design principles

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.730
in bringing the
assistant to the TV

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.110
was that people are
trained from a young age

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.710
to talk about media
with others, to use

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.950
our voice in the discussion
about what we want to watch

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.000
or what we feel.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.490
I do this frequently
with friends and family.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.250
We go back and forth about what
we're interested in, figure out

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.550
if it's a show or a movie,
how much time we have left,

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.240
what's available to us, and
we arrive at a decision.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.241
This sort of interaction
feels very natural.

00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:25.990
It's what we're used
to when we're dealing

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.340
with people in everyday life.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.810
Now we think that voice is an
amazing augmentation for media

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.700
consumption in the living room.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.990
So what we've done is we've
optimized the assistant on TV

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.390
from the ground up
to fill this role.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.510
That means with an Android TV,
you can use the remote alone

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.980
to navigate the UI.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.810
You can use the voice
button on the remote

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.880
and you'll be able to
talk to the assistant.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.580
Or you can use the assistant
in a hands-free mode

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.160
to discover and play content.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.530
Even better, you can transition
between these modes seamlessly.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.360
So whatever you want to do, it
fits the situation you're in.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.940
If you want to talk, it's there.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.820
If not, no big deal.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.430
Now there was a bunch of work
that went into us getting here.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.250
We had to build multiple
speech models, UI that's

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.700
responsive to the situation
and context of a user,

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.490
and a number of other things.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.270
But what it's resulted in
is a new, more natural,

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.150
and transparent way of
interacting with your TV.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.250
In addition, because it's
the same assistant that

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.136
connects your Google and third
party services and devices,

00:08:27.136 --> 00:08:29.260
you can use it in a bunch
of interesting scenarios.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.930
So actually, let's take
a look at one of these.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.280
Let's imagine it's Friday night
and I'd like to watch a movie.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.010
I might say, show me some
recent action movies.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.289
Now the Google
Assistant knows it's me,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.150
and it knows the
context, where I'm

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.000
at, and what sorts of things
I'm interested in, like actors,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.107
for example.

00:08:47.107 --> 00:08:49.690
So it's going to bring up a list
of things that might interest

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.209
me from multiple sources.

00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:54.250
There might be a way to
further refine the search

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.260
or broaden it, but
let's assume for now

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.279
that I see what I'm looking for.

00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:00.070
One thing to note is
that the assistant can

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.081
work in a conversational
manner, meaning

00:09:02.081 --> 00:09:04.330
that it's going to remember
the context I have in case

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:05.496
there's a follow up request.

00:09:05.496 --> 00:09:08.060
So I think I see something
I'm interested this.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.170
In this case, I want to watch
Deadpool, which is a hilarious

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.560
movie, by the way.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.280
But if, for example,
it's a complicated title,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.310
or if I'm feeling a
bit lazy, I might just

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.604
refer to it by the
order it is in the list,

00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:23.770
like I might be talking to
someone else in the room.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.932
So I might say,
play the third one.

00:09:26.932 --> 00:09:29.140
Now what's happened is that
the assistant understands

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.670
where we're at in
the conversation

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.753
and what I'm trying to do.

00:09:31.753 --> 00:09:34.270
And so it's going to play
the content that I requested

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.700
from the source that I had.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.320
And maybe the movie
is just starting

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.450
and the family is sitting
down ready to watch,

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.030
and we realize we want to make
the experience a little bit

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.840
more comfortable.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.290
So because it's
the assistant, it's

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.070
connected to the other
devices in my house

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.070
and I can control the
lighting in my living room

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.300
just by asking.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.390
So I might say, dim the lights.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.890
And the lights dim, and we're
ready to watch the movie.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.720
Now the second major change.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.000
They say home is
where the heart is.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.230
So in order to truly change
the way people use Android TV,

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.980
we had to make a
change to our home.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.700
For Android O, we've redefined
the home screen on Android TV

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.960
to be a channel-based,
content first experience.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.190
This new home enables
users to engage

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.770
with the content
and apps that they

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.460
love all in the same place.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.000
Now instead of showing you
more screen shots up here,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.930
we decided--

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.430
at a bit of risk to ourself--

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.414
to actually give you a live
demo using a developer device

00:10:34.414 --> 00:10:36.830
that we have, and we'll walk
through the features on that.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.830
So could we switch to the
next displayer please?

00:10:42.157 --> 00:10:43.740
Isaac's going to
help me out for this.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.469
So I wanted to call
out that we're still

00:10:45.469 --> 00:10:47.510
putting the finishing
touches on this experience.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:51.200
So you should expect to
see further visual changes

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.990
and performance improvements
as we move closer to launch.

00:10:56.946 --> 00:10:58.570
So let's walk through
the layout a bit.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.180
So at the top, you're going
to see the same quick access

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.650
to search that you used to.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.840
And below that, we're
introducing a favorites row

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.600
for favorite apps to easily
launch into the favorite apps

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.310
right from the
top of the screen.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.700
You'll see watch
next below that.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.200
And we'll come back
to favorite apps

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.764
and watch next a
little bit later.

00:11:14.764 --> 00:11:16.180
In the middle and
continuing down,

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.400
we have a number of
rows full of content

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.540
that we call, perhaps
unsurprisingly, channels.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.090
So a row is a channel.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.540
These channels are the core of
the new home screen experience.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.090
Each of these channels
is created by a media app

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.970
to display content
relevant to you.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.490
You might think of each
channel as a window

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.210
into the content
available inside the app.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.310
Now app surface
content in channels

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.670
by displaying programs, which
are the boxes you see here,

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.130
with TV shows or movies
or video on them.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.350
So we've got a channel
inside a bunch of boxes.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.760
Those are called programs.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.400
These are recommendations
for content

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.620
that's available right
now for you to watch,

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.330
and they could be
on-demand content

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.400
like a movie a TV series.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.230
Could be a video
clip, live TV show,

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.790
could even be a live
traditional TV channel.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.260
And actually there's
a couple more.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.800
Isaac will talk
about that later.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.850
Now each app gets to decide
what the channel is named,

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.510
what it looks like, what content
appears in it, what metadata

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.760
goes with that content,
and in what order

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.697
the content is displayed
in that channel.

00:12:22.697 --> 00:12:25.030
When you select a program
that seems interesting to you,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.220
it's going to launch the
app and take you directly

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.550
into the content, starting
playback immediately.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.989
If you decide to press the
Back button from there,

00:12:32.989 --> 00:12:35.530
the app has the ability to sort
of re-engage you and take you

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.520
to a higher level
screen inside the app.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.510
Now by structuring the
experience this way,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.020
what we're allowing apps to
do is surface different types

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.130
of content in the
same experience,

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.610
giving you the choice of
what you're in the mood for.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.820
Now you could see in the same
experience what's on your DVR,

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.100
what movies are recommended
for you to rent,

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.990
and what on-demand
shows maybe you haven't

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.910
finished binge watching yet.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.890
In addition, apps
have a lot of control

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.660
about how they want
to present what they

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.430
think is most relevant to you.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.630
So there's a good balance there.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.630
All right, actually, let's
go to the play movies

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.860
channel and let's select
"Fantastic Beasts."

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.940
Now what you're
seeing right now is

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.960
a feature we're really excited
about called video previews.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.730
From our research,
we found that seeing

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.210
short previews of the content
has a significant boost

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.310
to engagement and decision
making, and that kind of makes

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.810
sense.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.837
So lets use "Fantastic
Beasts" as an example.

00:13:36.837 --> 00:13:38.670
I know it's set in the
Harry Potter Universe

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.230
and I love the Harry
Potter Universe.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.440
And I've seen it come across
my recommendations often,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.050
but I haven't yet, you
know, pulled the trigger.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.390
But when I focus on it in
this discovery experience

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.000
and it plays the
preview, I see the world

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.750
and I see the characters and I
hear the music and, you know,

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.910
it's no longer a poster to me.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.770
I'm drawn in.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.020
Now apps have the ability
to provide video previews

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.030
for each program they
put in the channel

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.440
regardless of what type
of content that be.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.850
That might take the form of a
live preview for live content.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:14.050
It might be a trailer for
a movie, for a TV show,

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.650
it could be the series
trailer, or it could be--

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.990
like a season trailer.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.200
And for video or
digital social content,

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.220
it might be maybe
the first 15 seconds

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.105
of what that content is.

00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:28.230
We think this is going to
drive a lot of engagement

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.110
for our app partners and
we're seeing many developers

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.280
integrating already.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.040
And you can see it's quite
a compelling experience

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.390
as we're in the discovery
mode here over a poster.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.120
So maybe I'm not in the mood for
"Fantastic Beasts" right now.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.290
Let's actually go
to the next one

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.790
and take a look at
"Hidden Figures."

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.630
So you can see how powerful
these video clips are,

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.880
where we're sort of
previewing the content that we

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.282
may want to watch right from
the discovery experience.

00:15:02.282 --> 00:15:03.990
It's almost like I'm
in the movie theater

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.810
and I'm watching the previews
and getting excited about what

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.490
I'm about to watch.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:09.660
Now what happened when--

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.360
actually, this looks great,
so let's-- let's open it up

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.049
and watch it.

00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:15.840
JOHN GLENN: What do
you ladies do for NASA?

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.140
KATHERINE G. JOHNSON:
Calculate your trajectories--

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.700
CORY O'CONNOR: Now what
happened is we clicked on it,

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.741
and it launched directly
into the Play Movies app

00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:22.134
and it's playing the content.

00:15:22.134 --> 00:15:23.550
This experience
works really well,

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.905
you can tell with the
existing app model.

00:15:25.905 --> 00:15:27.780
So we've hopped into
the middle of the movie.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.840
Let's pretend for a moment
that I've watch half the show,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.531
but I have to stop and let's
go back out to the Home screen.

00:15:34.531 --> 00:15:36.030
And let's go back
to the top please.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.510
So what you're seeing is that
the content has been added

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.310
to my Watch Next row, because
I wasn't done with it yet

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.200
and the system is
helpfully saying, look,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.560
you have this available
still to watch.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.710
The Watch Next row is a single
system delivered channel that's

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.980
always at the top where content
you previously engaged in

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.660
will be presented, and
this will be from all apps.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.380
Watch Next is designed
to give you an easy way

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.540
to get back to content
that you know and love,

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.998
especially if it's
something you're

00:16:06.998 --> 00:16:08.930
binge watching or
actively recording

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.939
or you haven't finished.

00:16:10.939 --> 00:16:12.980
In addition, if you haven't
watched something yet

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.750
but you want to
in the future, you

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.060
can add it to the Watch
Next row directly.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.760
So I did get excited
about "Fantastic Beasts."

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.780
I think it was
the preview video.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.110
So let's go back
to Play Movies row,

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.290
let's add it to Watch Next, and
let's go back up to the top.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.290
You can see now how the
Watch Next row over time

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.940
is going to reflect the
things that I like to watch.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.280
So an app is not just
restricted from offering

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.940
only a single channel.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.640
In fact, it's just
the first channel

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.400
from every app that
appears automatically.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.220
Apps can actually offer
multiple channels for a user

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.900
to Home screen,
which basically gives

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.060
the app more real
estate for them

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.880
to draw the user in
with their content.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.660
You know, I wonder if YouTube
actually has an extra channel--

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.340
YouTube has lots of
content available,

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.839
so let's go take a
look, we're going

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.510
to get Customized Channels and
we're going to go to YouTube.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:16.376
We'll do questions
in a little bit.

00:17:16.376 --> 00:17:18.000
So we're seeing
multiple channels here.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.890
You know, today
at the keynote, I

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:24.780
think Sara mentioned that the
YouTube is launching 360 videos

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.419
on the TV and Android TV--

00:17:26.419 --> 00:17:28.710
we're going to be one of the
first devices to get that.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.470
Well, for a demo,
surprise, surprise,

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.730
what a complete coincidence, we
have a channel with 360 video,

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.640
so let's enable that.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.040
As you can see, the channel
was added to the Home screen.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.081
So actually, let's check
out one of these videos.

00:17:43.081 --> 00:17:46.120
I think we're on a Coachella
video, so let's open that.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.000
Launch the YouTube app.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.640
Now Isaac's going to use
the remote to look around,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.830
and I think this
video is pretty cool.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.230
It's got actually
multiple 360 cameras

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.300
all throughout the
audience and on stage.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.100
I think we're going
to do transitions

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.780
between these different
cameras, so you can kind of

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.155
look around and
see what it would

00:18:02.155 --> 00:18:05.250
be like to be on stage, in
the audience, backstage,

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.890
a whole bunch of things.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.080
So this video is pretty great.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.040
Let's hop back out, but make
sure to go and check this out

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.790
on your Android TV, I
think it's launching

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.200
in the next few weeks.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.680
So the ability to have multiple
channels from the same app

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.960
and channels from
different apps allows

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.510
you to have content for
everyone in your family's case

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.630
available from the same UI.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.970
So we've seen how as a user
you can go and proactively

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.440
look for channels
available to you

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.290
through apps that are already
installed on the device.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.880
Also, though, when
you're in an app,

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.090
that app can suggest channels
to add to the home screen.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.610
So a dialog would appear
and you would say yes or no.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.580
And if you said yes, that
new channel would appear.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.340
So in this way, as a
developer, if a user

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.180
is interacting with some
specific part, some theme part,

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.550
or something relevant for
you to create a channel,

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.699
you can actually
proactively suggest, hey,

00:18:55.699 --> 00:18:57.740
there's something you can
add to your Home screen

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.672
from my app, which
you like to do that?

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:02.130
The last thing we
wanted to mention

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:04.650
is that there's still a
way to access all the apps

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.614
on a device, whether
that's because you're

00:19:06.614 --> 00:19:08.280
launching an app that
doesn't fit really

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.130
well into the MediaFirst
model or because you're just

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.230
more comfortable clicking
on icons and brands

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.450
and that sort of thing
resonates with you.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:16.980
So from here, you
can also set which

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.410
apps appear in the favorites
row we talked earlier.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.970
So let's go ahead and add
YouTube Kids to the Favorites

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.540
row because we have friends
come and stay with us

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.670
and it would really
help to have an app that

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.290
is very easy for
them to launch, is

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:31.530
very visible for content
available for them.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.207
So it was added up there.

00:19:33.207 --> 00:19:35.040
So could we change back
to the slides place?

00:19:39.264 --> 00:19:40.680
So in addition to
the Home screen,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.265
we've made changes all around
the Android TV platform,

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:44.640
and we really
don't have the time

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.710
to discuss them in this
session, but I just

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.810
wanted to pick out two examples.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.050
So as part of Android O, we've
built a completely new setup

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.970
experience for the TV
that's going to help you

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.540
transition media apps from
other Android TV devices

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.370
to your new TV.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.610
During setup, if you, for
example, have an Android phone

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.920
with TV relevant
apps on it and you're

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.650
signed into a Google account
when you're doing setup

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.720
on your TV, we're
going to suggest

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.157
installation of these apps.

00:20:12.157 --> 00:20:13.740
With a simple click
of a button, we're

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.531
going to install the
app in the background,

00:20:15.531 --> 00:20:17.190
and that app will
then proactively

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.130
put channels full of
content on your Home screen

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.546
so that by the time you're
done with setup, voila,

00:20:22.546 --> 00:20:24.170
you're going to land
on the Home screen

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.378
and it's going to be full
of channels full of content

00:20:26.378 --> 00:20:27.180
available to you.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.550
And even better, if
that app integrates

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.359
with Smart Lock, what
we're going to do

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:33.400
is we're going to remember
the login information.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.210
So when you click on this app
or click on a piece the content,

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.010
it's going to
automatically sign you in.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.032
So you'll get out
of the setup flow,

00:20:40.032 --> 00:20:42.490
your TV will have content, you
click on a piece of content,

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:45.420
you go right into watching it.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.300
Also, we've made updates to
components in the Leanback

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.044
library and we
call this one out.

00:20:50.044 --> 00:20:51.960
This is a great update
to the playback element

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.060
that adds detailed
seek thumbnails.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.430
It looks amazing and it's
actually extremely useful

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.930
when you're trying
to find something

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.200
specific in the scene.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.540
So we talked a little bit
about the three challenges

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.330
we saw on the living room when
it comes to entertainment,

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.910
and we also talked about the
changes coming to Android TV.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.360
Now with the Assistant,
we're augmenting the remote

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.990
to have natural voice
interactions with your TV,

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.050
and we're really excited about
the new content first home

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.330
experience on the Android TV.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.940
We think you're going to find
that it's easier to figure out

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.010
what to watch, it's
more fun to look

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.930
at your available
list of options,

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.730
and it's more engaging
when you actually

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.310
customize this experience
for what you're looking for.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.850
Now, the Assistant will be
available on Android TV devices

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.390
back to Marshmallow-- and
it'll be later this year--

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.360
and the new Home experience will
be launching on all Android TV

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.490
devices when they
upgrade to O, so

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.250
expect to see the first devices
with this new experience

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:48.727
late this summer.

00:21:48.727 --> 00:21:50.310
Now I'm going to
hand it over to Isaac

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.300
like I talked about before.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.610
He's going to talk about the
technical details for how

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.830
you as Android developers
can help us create

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.776
this experience with your apps.

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.234
ISAAC KATZENELSON:
Thank you, Cory.

00:22:00.234 --> 00:22:03.552
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:06.769 --> 00:22:08.560
ISAAC KATZENELSON: So
let's talk specifics.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.810
What can you, the
app developer, do

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.950
to showcase your content, your
app content on the Home screen?

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.130
We start with the basics.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.730
We're using two well-known
Android concepts.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.940
The first one is the
content provider.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.160
We use content
providers with new APIs

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.650
for storing channel
and programs data.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.350
Your app should insert
channel and program data

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.390
into the providers
and the system

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.290
will automatically show it.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.220
The other concept is
we're using intent

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.050
to tell your app when to
insert your first channel

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.730
and when your user is
interacting with your content.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.440
You will use a
broadcast receiver

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.620
to listen to this intent
and act upon them.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.790
And of course, to
make it easier,

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.410
we provide the support library
for easier implementation.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.820
But what exactly
do you need to do?

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.710
What should the app
do and exactly when?

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:04.060
So to better understand it, I'm
introducing Chez Isaac, a brand

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.160
new fictional Android TV app.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.620
The app allows users
to watch cooking videos

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.710
in different categories,
favorite them, rate them,

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.800
and create personal
content channels.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.810
And I will show you what I
did in my app to showcase

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.400
my content on the Home screen.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.775
So let's begin.

00:23:23.775 --> 00:23:25.150
The first thing
I added to my app

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.430
is a broadcast receiver
to listen to this intent,

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.145
the initialize_programs intent.

00:23:29.145 --> 00:23:32.360
The intent is sent to
your app, to my app

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.540
once the app is installed.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.070
So very basically,
broadcast receiver,

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.550
they listen to
initialize_program intent.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.190
Once the receiver is
called, I start a job.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:48.500
I use a job scheduler-- or you
can use Firebase Job Dispatcher

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.870
too, it doesn't really matter--

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.901
and I insert my channels.

00:23:51.901 --> 00:23:54.400
So I decided to insert three
channels, two or three channels

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.890
is about the right
number of channels,

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:02.870
I can finetune it later when
I know my users tastes better.

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.390
So as you can see,
I schedule using

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.340
a job scheduler and a task.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.240
If you notice the 0 on the
setMinimumLatency, when

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.590
you set it to 0, it means
that the system will actually

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.470
schedule this job
immediately, which

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.230
is a good thing because we
need the channel to be visible

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.500
immediately after
the app is installed.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.230
The job runs a simple task
that actually pulls data

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.350
off my channels from my
back end and insert them

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.932
into the provider.

00:24:29.932 --> 00:24:30.890
But how do you do that?

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.470
So how do you
insert the channel?

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.620
So we have, in the
support library,

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.280
is several builders
to help you build

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.770
channels and programs to
insert them into the provider.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.520
So I use the support
library channel builder

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.140
to create a channel,
and you can see,

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.360
I set up that type to preview.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.240
I set the display name
to the channel name.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.340
And I set a link back
to my app, so when

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.990
the user clicks on the channel
icon, it actually opens my app.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.440
And I use a ContentResolver
to call insert and just insert

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.350
the data into the provider.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.420
And the last thing to do
is actually add a logo

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.500
to my channel.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.140
So there's a call for that,
and actually, you can either

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.680
provide a bitmap,
or if it's too hard,

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.700
then you can provide
a URL to the bitmap

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.210
somewhere on the internet
and the support app.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:20.980
It will download it for you
and actually insert it for you.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.200
Same thing for programs.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.090
For each channel, I will use a
builder to insert the programs.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.370
So I set the channel
ID, the same one

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.730
that I created before, I
set the type from each clip,

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.250
I set the title,
the description,

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.590
there's way more
metadata to insert,

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.680
I'll talk about
this a bit later.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.284
And then I insert the URI that
will actually when clicking,

00:25:41.284 --> 00:25:42.200
will play the content.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.550
Will call my app to
play the content.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.590
And again, I use
the ContentResolver

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.980
to insert it into the provider.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.050
And the last thing I need
to do is ask the system

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.060
to make the channel visible.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.520
And to do that, I
do one simple call,

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.500
I request it to be visible,
browsable, and presto!

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.070
That's it.

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.980
I created my first channel.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.000
I want to take a moment to
talk about the first channel.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.540
When the app is
installed, it gets

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.640
what we called a golden ticket.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.080
The ticket, which
the app can use

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.630
to insert the channel
without the user approving.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:19.620
It will be visible by default.
The app gets a one golden

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.600
ticket, so once you
insert the first channel,

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.030
this ticket is gone and
cannot be used anymore.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.820
So if you want to add
additional channels,

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.200
it needs to be
approved by the user.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.810
So the first thing
you need to do

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:34.410
is do not remove your first
channel, your default channel.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.960
Use it, update it,
but don't remove it.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.030
Since my app shows
video clip, I will use

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.980
the program type called Clip.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.350
But there are many other
program types to use

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.300
and it depends on
the content that you

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.090
showing what types to use.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:52.510
And each type has a different
metadata associated with it.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:55.090
The API documentation's
All line show

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.430
very well what
exactly the metadata

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:01.880
you need for each clip
type, for each program type.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:06.890
So just to show, we have
seven type of video programs,

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:10.490
from movies to TV season
and life channels.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.950
And you can understand
that if I use a TV episode,

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.710
I may have that episode
number and the season number,

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.442
which will not be
relevant to a movie,

00:27:18.442 --> 00:27:20.650
so it will use different
metadata for different kinds

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:21.956
of programs.

00:27:21.956 --> 00:27:23.330
The same thing
for audio, we have

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.750
five types of audio programs.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:31.490
Talking about metadata,
each app has a title.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:34.290
It has a description.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.460
It has more metadata,
like the release date,

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.790
the length of the program, the
user rating, there's author,

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.840
there is price, there's
many more fields available.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.160
And of course, for
the visual part of it,

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.740
which is the most
important part,

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:53.720
you can insert two
different images.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.470
One is when the actually
image is focused,

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.750
your program is focused
on the Home UI and one,

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.980
when it's not focused.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.440
And of course, you can also
use the preview video, which

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.430
has the most visual effect.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.040
The more metadata
you add, the better.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.240
So my app is installed
on the device,

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.590
the user used it,
watched a few videos,

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:22.110
even added a second channel
using the customize channel

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.156
and it's great.

00:28:23.156 --> 00:28:24.780
But I want the user
to be engaged more,

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.750
I want the user to go back to
my app and watch more content.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.490
So how do I do that?

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.220
To do that, I need to
keep my content fresh,

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.690
to update my channels
all the time.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.870
So what I did, I
used Cloud Messaging

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.000
to have my back end
ping back to my app

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.100
when new content is available.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.150
When my app gets this ping, this
message, I run a job-- again,

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:48.240
I run a job in the background
to put this new content

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.240
from my back end server, and
also, to query the data that's

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.160
actually on the device in the
provider, so I know what's new

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.690
and what's already
on the device.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:03.120
And I'm going to sync, kind of
consolidate the two data sets.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.540
When I do that, I try to do
what I call a smart sync.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.800
So I will compare
the two data sets

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.550
and then I will remove all
programs that are not available

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.340
anymore, I will add
new ones that are new,

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.870
and the ones that are still
there, I can update them.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.650
Maybe the release date changed,
maybe the number of views

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.020
changed, I can do that,
update the programs

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.660
and also maybe change the
order, because some of them

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.830
are more popular than
others and that's OK.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:33.630
We try to avoid the
remove all/add all concept

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.790
or paradigm, because
what happens,

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:40.600
if you do the smart sync,
the visual will be better.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.080
There'll be less visual
glitches, little glitches,

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:48.670
movements on your channel, and
that's what we're aiming for.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.080
So I have more channels, I
have them with fresh new data--

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.390
what's next?

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.240
So I added a feature into
my app to actually allow

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.330
the user to add channels
from the app itself.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:03.120
So when the user is interested
in a topic or a category,

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.840
I pop up a view
which has a button

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.250
to suggest the user to add the
channel to the Home screen.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.980
When the user clicks on
it, what I need to do

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.070
is a few simple things.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:17.444
First of all, again, I need
to build a channel to insert,

00:30:17.444 --> 00:30:19.200
so I use the Program
Builder to insert

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.120
the channels and the
programs into the provider,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.910
and then I do one more
thing is ask the system

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:28.500
to make it visible.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.080
And the way it works
is that I create

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.270
an intent, which is
called channel_browsable,

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:37.180
request channel_browsable, then
I do startActivity for example.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:40.350
This tells the system to
actually show a confirmation

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:41.400
screen.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.980
And remember, the
golden ticket is gone,

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.830
you need the user approval,
the user can approve or not.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.820
And when they user
approves it or not,

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.570
what it actually know
what the user replied

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.352
by checking on
activity result. And I

00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:55.060
know if the user
actually approved or not

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.331
and do with it what I want.

00:30:58.331 --> 00:30:58.830
Woohoo!

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.700
Three channels now
on the Home screen.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.720
Good job!

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.260
So lets move on.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.320
So another opportunity
to engage the user

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.960
is actually the
Watch Next channel.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.820
Remember that was the channel
that was on top of the screen,

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.280
and it's a system channel, so
you don't have to create it,

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.480
but you do need to follow some
guidelines in order to use it.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.330
So the first thing I
did, I added support

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:22.850
in my app to actually monitor
what's added to the Watch Next

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:23.350
channels.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.080
Every time a program is added
to the Watch Next channels that

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.970
is my program, I
want to know about it

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.440
and I want to track this.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.180
So it's a very simple API.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:35.380
You can add, remove, and
check if the program is

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.940
in the Watch Next channel.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.590
And you can implement it with
a database or shared prefs--

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.330
pretty easy thing to do.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.640
So let's look at some use cases.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.560
So let's talk about
the Continue Playing.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.670
So the user watch
one of my videos,

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.600
but didn't finish watching it.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.430
So what do I do?

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.550
What I need to do is actually
add a program, like before,

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:58.840
the same concept.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.140
I set that type,
the clip, I edit

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.680
another type, which
is what kind of type

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.074
is on the Watch Next channel?

00:32:05.074 --> 00:32:06.490
This time, it's
Continue Watching,

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.650
what we call Continue Here.

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:10.580
And then I add three
more data to it.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.450
One is, when did it happen?

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.500
And the other two to
help us with the UI

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.500
is, two, the length
of the program

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.140
and the current play position.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.170
And again, simply again just
insert it into the provider

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:23.965
and you're done.

00:32:23.965 --> 00:32:25.840
And if there's a Keep
on Playing the Content,

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.620
I can just update the current
play position to update the UI.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.120
Great.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.940
I have another card in
the Watch Next channel.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.610
One more thing I can do is
that if I have some clips that

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.190
are part of a
season or a series,

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.890
when the user, say,
is watching episode 2,

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:45.280
I can insert episode 3 and say,
that's the next one to watch.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.550
Or maybe if at the
end of the season

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:52.070
and into the next season, I can
add a card for the next season.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:57.610
So what I did is actually edit,
again, a program by same type,

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:58.890
clip--

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.550
Watch Next is next.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.160
At the top is next,
like next item.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.340
And just adding when
I inserted it in so

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.440
it will be in the system.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.440
And again, I have another card
on the Watch Next channel.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.910
The last thing my
app does is actually

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:21.550
listen to the Added
to Watch Next.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.820
As you remember in the demo,
we long press on the program,

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.630
click the Add to Watch Next, and
it was added to the Watch Next.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:32.170
What happened is that the system
actually takes the program

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:34.810
from the apps channel
and copied it over

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.250
to the Watch Next channel.

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:40.090
We do that so that the visual
effects will be immediate.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:43.960
But what we also do is we send
an intent to my app to tell it,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.450
this program was copied and
added to the Watch Next,

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.850
and what I did in
my app is, again,

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.310
putting a receiver to
listen to these intents.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.680
And thee next thing
I do is start a job

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.360
and I save this information
inside my own database.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.410
So when the firmware's updated,
maybe the number views change,

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.392
I get a refresh of the
image, I can actually also

00:34:02.392 --> 00:34:03.850
update it in the
Watch Next channel

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.099
so that content will be fresh.

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:11.530
OK, so let's recap.

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.650
What should I add under
the TV [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:20.280
So first of all, it needs to add
channel right after install--

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.250
at least one.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:25.230
Keep the channels up to date,
refreshed, engage the user.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:33.770
Then I can suggest more
channels inside the app.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.679
Use the Watch Next
channel to engage the user

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:38.590
to continue watching
the content.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:42.010
And listen and react
user interactions.

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:46.422
And of course, do not
remove your first channel.

00:34:46.422 --> 00:34:47.880
Thank you for coming
and listening.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.900
If you'd like to learn
more, we have sandbox area,

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.550
we're going to see
the demo again.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.469
We have code labs,
you can actually go in

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:58.350
and build your own TV app.

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.570
And you can come to the
office hours, I'll be there

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.270
and you can ask questions
or you can go online

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:04.552
and see the documentations.

00:35:04.552 --> 00:35:05.760
Thank you so much for coming.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.444
