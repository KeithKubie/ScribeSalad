00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:03.403
After news broke that Ziploc bag
full of corn chowder

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:06.340
-Donald Trump... is...
-(laughter)

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:09.409
...skipping this year's White
House Correspondence Dinner,

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:12.246
'cause he doesn't have
to be there. Ugh!

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.114
So we decided on our show

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.116
to push for our old pal,
Anthony Atamanuik,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.784
who's been doing
his amazing Trump impression

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:19.720
on our show for,

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.456
-like, a year now.
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.491
You can see the Trump-Bernie
debates on YouTube.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.728
It was, like, one of the biggest
things we ever did on the show.

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.830
So we said, "Hey, maybe
Anthony could do this."

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.665
You know, to fill in
for the president

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.568
by promoting the hashtag
#MakeAnthonyTrumpAgain.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.504
We even got the support
of Luke Skywalker himself!

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:42.609
-Mark Hamill jumped in to the
fray. -(applause and cheering)

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:44.645
This, of course,
trended on Twitter.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.680
Seemed like everyone was
on board, you know.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:50.717
Everyone, everyone except
for another Trump impersonator,

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.686
famous actor
and longtime resident

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.721
of your mom's mash cache,
Alec Baldwin.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.790
(laughter)

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.259
Now for some reason, Baldwin,

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:01.595
who's doing an incredible Trump
on <i>SNL,</i>

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:04.264
and has been doing
an amazing job since last fall,

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:07.367
went on Jimmy Kimmel
and was kind of dismissive

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.536
of Anthony
and called him, quote,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.873
"A guy who's on the Internet,"
which makes Anthony sound

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.875
like he's currently stuck
in <i>Tron</i> or something.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.643
-(laughter)
-He's a real guy.

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:18.312
He's done a lot of stuff.

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.113
Anthony's an accomplished
performer.

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:22.182
He's been honing
his Trump impression since 2015,

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.518
a little bit longer than
Alec Baldwin, but it's fine.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:26.520
-(laughter)
-I'm not trying to...

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:28.255
I don't want to battle anything.
I don't... you know?

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.190
Also, not to mention,
the two of them were

00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:32.559
-on <i>30 Ro</i> together for years.
Here's Anthony. -(cheering)

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:36.830
Now, this whole thing
spilled over onto Twitter,

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:38.832
where Alec was pretty dismissive
of Anthony.

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:41.635
And then, when a random fan,
and our friend James Adomian,

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:44.571
who played Sanders
in the Trump thing, jumped in--

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.573
admittedly,
Adomian was a little hot,

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.542
he was a little hot--

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.645
but Alec Baldwin responded
by threatening to sue them.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.747
-(laughter)
-Wow.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.217
The coups de grace
of this whole thing is

00:01:57.251 --> 00:02:00.587
Alec Baldwin's twitter account
blocked <i>@midnight,</i>

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:03.257
a TV show,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.925
and then (bleep) me!
He blocked me for some reason!

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.927
-(laughter)
-I didn't do anything!

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.529
-What did I do?
-(applause)

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:09.863
I didn't do anything!

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:12.199
I'm not a...

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:13.767
I didn't mean
to be part of this.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.671
I... We were just supporting
our buddy, you know.

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.806
All right, first of all,
I wasn't following him,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.509
-and he blocked me.
-(laughter)

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:24.945
But now I'm upset that I'm...
now that I can't follow him

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.914
if I wanted to.
I'm blocked.

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:28.582
Alec, I thought we were friends.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:32.653
Look, this is your hand
on my shoulder.

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:35.622
-(applause and cheering)
-Look at this.

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:37.891
I didn't know.
I didn't even know

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:39.593
Alec Baldwin wanted to do
the correspondence dinner,

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:42.863
and we're certainly not (bleep)
on his impression in any way.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.698
(bleep) both do it.
One of 'em

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.301
get up, and then roast the other
Trump, and then swap places.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:48.302
-Who gives a (bleep)?
-(applause and cheering)

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:52.873
You know, we were just
rooting for our friend.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.541
Tony...

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:56.543
Alec could just (bleep) do
the correspondence dinner.

00:02:56.577 --> 00:02:58.812
If he wanted, he could just go,
"Hey, I want to do this."

00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:00.480
And they go, "(bleep) do it.
Let's do it now.

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:01.849
Who gives a (bleep)? You're
Alec Baldwin. That's great."

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:03.350
Tony is the underdog here.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.619
He is the Bernie Sanders
of Donald Trumps.

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:08.322
-Do you understand?
-(laughter)

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.490
-This is taking things
way too personally. -Wow.

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:13.927
Threatening people with lawsuits
and then blocking me,

00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:17.731
-aka, you built a wall!
-(laughter)

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:22.402
-(cheers and applause)
-So, comedians...

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:24.972
I don't want there
to be any bad blood here.

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:29.710
What can I say to get
Alec Baldwin to unblock me?

00:03:29.743 --> 00:03:32.913
-Steve. -Hi, Alec.
It's Lorne Michaels.

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:35.516
Could you do me a favor
and unblock Mr. Hardwick?

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.817
And while you're at it,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.019
maybe make an appearance
on the <i>Talking Dead?</i>

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.021
Okay, bye. See you Saturday.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.523
HARDWICK: All right, great.
Yeah, points. That'd be great.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.725
-(applause)
-Thank you.

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:46.994
Arielle.

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:50.297
You don't need this.
You've got Alec Baldwin money.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.899
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Yes, yes, points.

00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:53.667
-(applause and cheering)
-He does.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.968
-Flula Borg.
-Listen.

00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:56.970
Of all of the Baldwin bothers,

00:03:57.004 --> 00:03:58.939
you are absolutely
in my top three.

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:01.441
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: See?!

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:01.542
-(applause and cheering)
-Alec, let's be friends again.
