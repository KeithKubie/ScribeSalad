00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:01.769
 Here are two numbers, 

00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:02.966
 which I want to collect. 

00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.983
 The first number is 327, 

00:00:05.983 --> 00:00:08.667
 which means 3 hundreds, 

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.589
 I have 3 in the order of hundreds. 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.180
 You see them right here. 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.629
 You see these 3 hundreds, 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.283
 each of these large squares contains 

00:00:20.283 --> 00:00:22.720
 100 small squares, so 3 large ones 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.930
 the square will be 3 hundred. 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.704
 And then I have 2 tens. 

00:00:26.704 --> 00:00:28.780
 2 tenths, 2 is in the order of the dozen, 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.521
 so it's two decades right here. 

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:33.390
 And then I have 7 units. 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.385
 7 is in the order of the units. 

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:39.890
 7 is in the order of the units 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.644
 and you see these 7 units. 

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:43.745
 7 units, right here. 

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:45.650
 These are 3 hundred, 2 tenths 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.506
 and 7 units, or 327. 

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:52.455
 Now I want to add 251, 

00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:53.940
 or if you think otherwise, 

00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:56.692
 I want to add 2 hundreds because 2 

00:00:56.692 --> 00:01:00.462
 is in the order of hundreds, two hundred. 

00:01:00.872 --> 00:01:02.185
 2 hundred, 

00:01:02.185 --> 00:01:04.528
 1 hundred, 2 hundred. 

00:01:04.947 --> 00:01:07.309
 50 is the same as 5 tens, 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.549
 we see 5 in the order of the decimal. 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.904
 5, let me write it in the same color. 

00:01:12.904 --> 00:01:16.354
 Five tenths, right here. 

00:01:16.354 --> 00:01:17.950
 1 tenth, 2 decades, 3 decades, 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.672
 Four tenths, five tenths. 

00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:22.164
 Finally, I have 1 in the order of units, 

00:01:22.164 --> 00:01:24.182
 which simply means 1 unit. 

00:01:24.182 --> 00:01:26.433
 You see it right here. 

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:29.257
 This is a unit. 

00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:30.777
 1 unit. 

00:01:30.777 --> 00:01:32.733
 Stop the video now 

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:36.185
 and check if you can collect these two numbers. 

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:37.962
 Now let's get together. 

00:01:37.962 --> 00:01:41.666
 We have 7 units to them 

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:46.176
 we will add 1 unit. How many units will we get? 

00:01:46.177 --> 00:01:48.929
 Okay, 7 units plus 1 unit 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:50.765
 will be 8 units. 

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:53.270
 You see here 7 and then you have an eighth unit. 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.762
 So 8 units, 7 plus 1 is 8. 

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:58.435
 Now let's look at the dozens. 

00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:00.753
 I had 2 tens and I will add 

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.849
 another 5 decades, we collect them together 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.252
 and we will have seven tenths. 

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:09.132
 2 tenths plus 5 tenths, 

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:12.910
 we will have seven tenths. 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.669
 And finally, 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.642
 if you have 3 hundreds and add 2 more, 

00:02:16.642 --> 00:02:18.709
 how many hundreds will you have? 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.671
 Well, you'll have five hundred. 

00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:23.989
 You see these 5 groups of 100 right here. 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.882
 Let's record 5 in the hundreds. 

00:02:26.882 --> 00:02:30.132
 Therefore, 327 plus 251 

00:02:30.132 --> 00:02:32.502
 is 578. 

00:02:32.502 --> 00:02:35.720
 5 hundred, 7 tens 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.522
 and 8 units.
