00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.904
Who doesn't like birthday cakes?

00:00:02.104 --> 00:00:04.831
And what I'm going to show you today is that

00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:07.164
there are good ways and there are bad ways

00:00:07.364 --> 00:00:08.557
of cutting a cake.

00:00:08.757 --> 00:00:12.484
And the classic way,
the bad way,

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:15.614
is like this,
which would be normal.

00:00:15.814 --> 00:00:17.440
You put the knife in the center.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.917
One bit of a slice,

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:22.623
Other bit of a slice...
[laughter]

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:24.633
&lt;i&gt;Brady Haran: It's like the classic.
Alex Bellos: It is the classic. Isn't it?&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.866
It's almost like a pie chart.

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.648
You know, one thing about
the word pie chart.

00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:32.629
In France they call them Camembert,
which is like a cheese.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.162
It's actually like a cheese chart in France.

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:38.522
Interesting cultural differences
in math speak.

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:42.672
So this is what you would do.
You take this, you would put this over here,

00:00:42.872 --> 00:00:47.656
you eat it, and then you leave
this in the fridge overnight.

00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:50.586
And the reason why
this is a really bad way of cutting a cake

00:00:50.786 --> 00:00:54.966
is that these bits here
are just going to get dry.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:58.370
So when you come the following day
to have your cake,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.281
you know, you do another one,

00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:02.259
another slice like this

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:05.396
This side here, hmm, lovely and soft

00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:07.521
This will be dry and horrible.

00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:13.025
You know, maximizing the amount
of gastronomic pleasure

00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:14.635
that you can make out of this cake.

00:01:14.835 --> 00:01:19.210
There is a better way,
a way that is more than a hundred years old

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.771
and was discovered or invented

00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:28.158
by one of Britain's most famous and
brilliant mathematical scientists.

00:01:28.358 --> 00:01:33.916
This is a copy of Nature,
the famous science magazine,

00:01:34.116 --> 00:01:35.988
from December the 20th 1906.

00:01:36.188 --> 00:01:40.255
And in the Letters To The Editor here
it says:

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:45.083
The headline: Cutting a round cake
on scientific principles.

00:01:45.283 --> 00:01:51.110
"The ordinary method of cutting out
a wedge", he writes, "is very faulty".

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.945
What he suggests is,
and he gives an illustration for it,

00:01:56.145 --> 00:01:58.385
The proper way,
the scientific way,

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:01.518
the mathematically perfect way of
cutting a round cake

00:02:01.718 --> 00:02:03.425
and it is as follows.

00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:07.230
So we have another cake

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.297
The first slice will be like this.

00:02:14.122 --> 00:02:18.619
Breaking all the rules
of a cake etiquette.

00:02:19.634 --> 00:02:22.722
Perfect. OK?
So this is the first one,

00:02:22.922 --> 00:02:26.281
and then I need to find a way of...

00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:30.804
taking it out...

00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:32.905
OK. We can stick that there.

00:02:33.105 --> 00:02:38.681
And that is got to be the prime steak
of that cake. Isn't it?

00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:40.790
It's the T-bone cut.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.003
Here's what we need to do...

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:47.313
We need to close the cake together,
like this.

00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:51.644
And it's going to come apart,
so look what I've got here...

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:56.610
I have got some rubber bands
to make sure it stays together.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.485
The following day...

00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:03.635
All the flesh, the sponge
is going to be nice and soft.

00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:05.777
So, how do we do the second slice?

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:08.827
The second slice...
I guess it's not your birthday anymore,

00:03:09.027 --> 00:03:11.458
so you're not going to have one
quite as big...

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.915
It will be interesting to work out
the actual proportions.

00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:16.536
This is...

00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:21.486
You get a lovely break in the elastic
bands too, which is exciting.

00:03:21.686 --> 00:03:25.171
This is slice two.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:33.670
Or, it actually is slice two
which has two slices, two parts.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.672
So you put this back together.
And we can keep on going.

00:03:37.872 --> 00:03:44.504
Obviously, I'm going to want to use
the elastic band to put the cake...

00:03:44.704 --> 00:03:48.791
Yeah, That is perfect. That is going to stay
so fresh for day three.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.642
Day three.
Brady Haran: Actually do day three, Gab.

00:03:51.842 --> 00:03:53.325
Alex Bellos: Let's turn it around.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:56.174
I think this is going to be the slice
for day three.

00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:02.849
Again, the satisfying snap of
the elastic bands...

00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:09.729
And... I don't know if you thought
about if before,

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:14.711
but these triangular slices are really
annoying anyway, because...

00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:20.125
It's not very satisfying. Having a nice
uniform slice like that is a lot better.

00:04:20.325 --> 00:04:22.542
So, here we go again...

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:26.871
At the end of day three... This is for...
And this is going to be perfect.

00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:30.913
And gradually we are slicing it,
keep on going.

00:04:31.113 --> 00:04:35.722
I think for the mathematical loners

00:04:35.922 --> 00:04:39.837
who don't want to share their cakes
it could be useful.

00:04:40.037 --> 00:04:41.290
Brady Haran:
For a bit more of this interview

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.680
including more about the guy
that came up with this cake cutting method

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.885
have a look at the extra footage
over Numberphile 2.

00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:49.917
And if you just like to hear more
great stories from Alex,

00:04:50.117 --> 00:04:52.858
he's got a new book out
just recently:

00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:54.459
"Alex through the Looking Glass -

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.487
How Life Reflects Numbers
and Numbers Reflect Life".

00:04:57.687 --> 00:05:00.536
It's really good.
It's also just out in the US,

00:05:00.736 --> 00:05:01.878
but it has a different name in the US.

00:05:02.078 --> 00:05:04.300
It's called "The Grapes of Math".

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.951
I'll put links to it
in the video description.
