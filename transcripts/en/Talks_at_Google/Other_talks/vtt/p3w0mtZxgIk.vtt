SACHIT EGAN: Well, hello,
everyone, and welcome to Talks

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.870
at Google.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.809
My name is Sach Egan.

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.350
And today I have the pleasure
of introducing Tom Vanderbilt--

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.760
reintroducing Tom.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.010
He was here at Google
[? around ?] eight years ago.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.830
Tom is an author and
journalist, and he's

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.630
a contributing editor of "Wired
UK," "Outside," and "Artforum."

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.130
His work encompasses a
broad range of subjects,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.900
such as design, technology,
science, and culture.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.840
And his work has been
featured in publications

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.110
such as "Slate," "Wired," the
"Financial Times," "Rolling

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.665
Stone," "New York
Times Magazine,"

00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:35.740
and "Popular Science."

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.000
Tom is the author of
"Survival City, Adventures

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.360
Among the Ruins of
Atomic America,"

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.054
and the bestseller "Traffic,
Why We Drive the Way We Do

00:00:43.054 --> 00:00:44.470
and What It Says
about Ourselves,"

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.320
and he was here at Google a few
years ago to chat about that.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.015
His latest book is "You
May Also Like, Taste

00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:52.640
in an Age of Endless
Choice," and we're

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.931
going to chat about that today.

00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:54.840
So welcome, Tom.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.621
TOM VANDERBILT:
Great to be here.

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:57.079
SACHIT EGAN: Thanks
for being here.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.195
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:00.570
TOM VANDERBILT:
I'm just curious,

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.510
was anyone-- anyone remember
seeing me for "Traffic" here

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.131
or-- hands.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:05.630
OK.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.910
SACHIT EGAN: High turnover.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.743
TOM VANDERBILT: So it
is like "Logan's Run."

00:01:08.743 --> 00:01:09.960
Everyone gets kicked out.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.460
SACHIT EGAN: Pretty much.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.150
You got it.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.399
TOM VANDERBILT: Just checking.

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:13.682
SACHIT EGAN: Yeah, very good.

00:01:13.682 --> 00:01:15.140
Well, let's begin
with the obvious.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.510
So traffic to now
this subject about

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.700
taste, about what we like,
why we like these things.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.480
Where'd you come
across this topic?

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.879
Why did you choose to pursue it?

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:24.420
TOM VANDERBILT: I've
tried to come up

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.910
with an elegant narrative that
links traffic and this book.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.451
I haven't really found one.

00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:32.150
One thing that
interests me about some

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.230
of these algorithmic
recommendation systems,

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.270
for example, is that
they do often-- I

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.380
found that they were often
pointing me to things

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.150
that I may not have
discovered for myself, for all

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.310
their flaws.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.250
And just for a rough
traffic analogy,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.530
I would say, if you talk
to transportation planners,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.875
a lot of people do not
optimize their daily commute.

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:53.250
Even though that they've been
doing it 10 years in a row,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.700
they have not found
the most efficient way

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.060
to do that, hence ways
and other services

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.527
could sort of use math
and things to point people

00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:04.610
into new information that
they didn't have before.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.370
So that's sort of some
of the rough analogy.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.745
There's different ways to
think about traffic as a system

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:10.690
and some of the big
data aspect of taste.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.660
But the simpler story is one
day I was walking to school

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.240
and my daughter asked me
what my favorite color was.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.440
And I said blue.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.590
And I gave this answer so
quickly and so without thought

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.000
that it almost disturbed me.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.596
Or I thought, well, you
know, is it actually blue?

00:02:25.596 --> 00:02:26.720
Do I have a favorite color?

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.445
What does it mean to
have a favorite color?

00:02:29.445 --> 00:02:33.030
If it really is blue, where
did that preference come from?

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.350
And that question, where
do preferences come from,

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.690
is sort of what animated me
throughout this whole thing.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.430
But there's a lot of
complicated stories,

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.740
but I try to tell that
one as the immediate way

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.664
in, that sort of animating
logic behind everything.

00:02:46.664 --> 00:02:47.330
SACHIT EGAN: OK.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.830
Great.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.540
So is the intent of the
book then to broadly

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.940
kind of dive into why we
like things that we do?

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.504
Where these likes come from?

00:02:55.504 --> 00:02:57.420
What was the intent, I
guess, when you set out

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.219
to craft it into a book?

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.760
TOM VANDERBILT: Yeah, the intent
was-- going back to college,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.810
I had read some of the
sociology on this stuff.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.520
Pierre Bourdieu, he
had a whole other take.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.380
But what Pierre Bourdieu
didn't have-- he

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.700
did interviews with
people in France.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.120
He had about 1,200
survey responses.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.100
Questions like, who's
your favorite composer?

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.160
How do you cut your hair?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.868
Things like this.

00:03:17.868 --> 00:03:21.010
But since then, we're
obviously now dealing

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.870
with a lot bigger
data sets here,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.300
and that part
really interests me.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.730
Being immersed in this
world where we now

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.770
have access to many more things
that I ever thought possible.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.030
As sort of a teenager, I would
have died to have Spotify.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.000
It can't even be
imagined how difficult--

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.510
how narrow that bandwidth
of my acquiring music was.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.337
SACHIT EGAN: Sure.

00:03:41.337 --> 00:03:43.420
TOM VANDERBILT: So once
that huge door was opened,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.670
and then you're faced with
this terrifying chasm of,

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.724
oh, what do I do with all this
stuff now that it's there?

00:03:48.724 --> 00:03:50.390
Another thing that
started to dawn on me

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.610
was how much I was being exposed
to what other people thought

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.670
of things, other people's
opinion, Yelp, TripAdvisor,

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.597
Amazon, all these sites.

00:04:00.597 --> 00:04:02.430
And if you started to
read between the lines

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.197
of these long
strings of reviews,

00:04:05.197 --> 00:04:07.030
there were some pretty
interesting dynamics,

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.580
I thought, going
on there as well.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.120
So it all kind of
just fused together.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.880
And just longstanding--
as a former college

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.912
radio DJ, just remembering these
endless debates about music,

00:04:18.912 --> 00:04:20.370
and what was good
and what was bad.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.510
So it's all--

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.010
SACHIT EGAN: It's all in there.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.775
TOM VANDERBILT: It's a big stew.

00:04:22.775 --> 00:04:23.300
SACHIT EGAN: Yeah, OK.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.258
Well, let's try to dive
into that a little bit.

00:04:25.258 --> 00:04:27.780
You have a quote in there
that, all tastes, in essence,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.804
are acquired tastes, instead
of, I guess, implicit tastes.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.970
And we should really be
calling them acquired liking

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.380
or acquired likes.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.925
Why is that?

00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:37.300
TOM VANDERBILT:
Yeah, that's what

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.410
a researcher at Monell,
the nutrition institute,

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.910
said to me.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.482
And the funny thing
about taste is that you

00:04:44.482 --> 00:04:45.690
can never quite nail it down.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.650
It's not fully a learned thing.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.450
It's not fully
inherent or biological.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.600
It's not fully subjective.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.690
It's not fully objective.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.510
But I felt like people use
that phrase acquired taste

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.730
to describe these
sort of rarefied

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.880
or somewhat hard to like things,
like whiskey or something.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.980
But really, that process
is pretty much the same

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.720
for most things we
go through in life.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.840
There are very few things
that you just instantly

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.660
like the very first time
with no foregrounding,

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.030
and those would be the
simplest tastes, sugar.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.907
But everything else is
this acquired taste.

00:05:18.907 --> 00:05:20.490
And even that phrase
is sort of funny,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.871
because it hints-- so
you come to like whiskey,

00:05:23.871 --> 00:05:24.870
you come to like coffee.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.629
These things were immensely
unpleasant the first time.

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.420
You're acquiring this
taste, but you're not

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.270
going back to this original
taste you had of that.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.660
The signal coming in from
your tongue is the same,

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.380
but somewhere your
brain has sort of

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.160
reshaped this whole consumption
experience into something else.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.370
And whiskey or coffee hasn't
changed, you've changed.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.370
And that's what fascinates me.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.150
And you see that with art and
with all sorts of other things.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.460
And it just, again, spoke to
this sort of-- the picture

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.180
was less fixed than
I had imagined.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.790
But yeah, I really do think
all tastes are, to some extent,

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.420
acquired.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.390
Liking is learning.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.910
It's sort of a
cliche, but it applies

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.990
more broadly than I think we
sometimes give it credit to.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.884
SACHIT EGAN: The way
you speak of taste now,

00:06:10.884 --> 00:06:12.550
when you have whiskey
for the first time

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.110
and you recall it later, you're
recalling this experience.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.280
It's been processed
by your brain.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.440
Something you do
in the book a lot

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.310
is you talk about
evolutionary biology.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.560
You talk about how
tastes may have

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.600
a root in evolutionary bio.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.210
How is that?

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.355
Why is that?

00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:27.730
TOM VANDERBILT:
Paul Rozin, who's

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.560
a food researcher-- he's been
called the Father of Disgust,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.490
which is kind of a funny title
to have-- he says that disgust

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.000
linked to food is sort of this
primal-- the primal dislike,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.670
and that it comes with its
own set of facial reactions.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.290
The aversive gape, where if you
drink sour milk or something

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.916
that you're not expecting, your
body is preparing to vomit.

00:06:50.916 --> 00:06:52.290
You sort of shrivel
up your nose.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.350
Your mouth has a gape.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.349
They've seen it in rats.

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:56.150
They've seen it in
all sorts of things.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.620
So it kind of speaks to
another aspect of liking,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.830
which it really is pre-verbal.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.910
Before we ever had ways to
talk about why we liked what

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.050
we like, or rate things
with stars obviously,

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.180
we had these nonverbal
ways of communicating

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.720
to our neighbor what might be
a dangerous thing to consume.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.600
Consume, in that regard,
being food really.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.990
But I think some of
the basic impulses

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.080
almost carry over to
other forms of art.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.074
So if you saw sort of a
disgusting photograph--

00:07:23.074 --> 00:07:24.990
a photograph that you
thought was disgusting--

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.664
you might have triggered some
of that same aversiveness

00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:29.580
and aversive reaction.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.371
SACHIT EGAN: I see.

00:07:30.371 --> 00:07:32.240
And you also say that
we're predisposed

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.050
to be more acutely aware of
our dislikes versus our likes.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.630
So that sounded very curious.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.415
Is there a basis for that?

00:07:38.415 --> 00:07:39.290
TOM VANDERBILT: Yeah.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.830
Again-- and you can make
an evolutionary bio jargon.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.010
The food you dislike.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.387
What you like is what
didn't kill you yesterday.

00:07:48.387 --> 00:07:50.970
The food that's familiar to me
is the food you're still eating

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:51.980
and you haven't suffered from.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.270
So it sort of makes sense.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.320
You go with what's right in
front of you, what's familiar.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.160
But dislike is sort of forming
an instinctive early warning

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.025
system.

00:08:01.025 --> 00:08:03.610
It's more important to be
aware of your dislikes,

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.950
from that point of
view, than your likes,

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.900
because that's the hazard.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:13.260
Obviously, a dislike for a
song isn't going to kill you.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.647
And likes and dislikes are funny
in another way in that likes

00:08:17.647 --> 00:08:18.730
are really a social thing.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.360
We bond over likes and
we advertise our likes.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.790
We tend to broadcast our likes.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.060
Unless you're Johnny Rotten
from the Sex Pistols scrawling

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.870
"I hate Pink Floyd"
on your T-shirt,

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.724
people generally don't go
around saying, oh, I hate this.

00:08:32.724 --> 00:08:33.224
I hate that.

00:08:33.224 --> 00:08:34.820
I mean, we all know
someone like that.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.340
But dislikes tend
to be more private.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.750
Interestingly, from a brain
point of view, the evidence,

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.670
it's a little weird about
where liking sits in relation

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.280
to disliking, and it might
just be on the same spectrum,

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.740
and sometimes blurred, and
sometimes hard to figure out.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.260
And done interesting
fMRI studies

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.364
where-- of course, fMRI studies
are always incredibly blurry.

00:08:55.364 --> 00:08:56.780
You can't draw too
much from them.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.550
But areas involved-- and
you show people photographs

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.370
of people they do not like,
and some of the same brain

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.460
activation happens as in
expressions of romantic love.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.280
So the old cliche,
"There's a thin line

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.610
between love and hate" may
actually not be that far off.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.230
And as long as we're
getting this powerful signal

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.130
in the beginning, I think,
we may tilt either way.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.610
But what might be more
important is that you have--

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.330
something moved you, and maybe
you need to figure out how that

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.220
was and--

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.100
SACHIT EGAN: I see.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.750
So sort of related to this,
you talk about assimilation

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.590
and contrast.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.622
When we're told by a
friend or by a Yelp review

00:09:31.622 --> 00:09:33.830
that we're going to like
something, one of two things

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.350
can happen, either
assimilation or contrast.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.000
I guess assimilation means you
might also adopt that like.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.674
Contrast is you kind of
push back against that like.

00:09:41.674 --> 00:09:43.590
And you say with food
it's more common to have

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.460
this assimilation.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.920
Somebody likes it, you
kind of like it as well.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.430
But with media,
such as films, it's

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.740
more that you might push back
against somebody else's like.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.722
Why is that?

00:09:53.722 --> 00:09:55.680
TOM VANDERBILT: Yeah,
although I think on Yelp,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.430
you could see a lot of
contrasts as they call it also.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.230
I think it has to
be one of the most--

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.840
if you did a word cloud
of Yelp, expectation

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.620
must loom pretty large.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.820
This place did not live
up to my expectation.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.320
This place exceeded
my expectations.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.880
I've come to the-- just from
a personal point of navigating

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.790
the world, I've come
to the point of view

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.181
that it's better to suffer from
permanent low expectations.

00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:22.180
And this might be just
speaking as a New Yorker.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.200
And this is an interesting
way we categorize the world.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.650
And you can-- I forget what--
I think the phrase was,

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.770
protection for the good.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.700
But categorizing the
world is incredibly

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.009
useful in this regard.

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:35.800
And we all do this.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.619
If you go to an
airport, don't think

00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:39.410
you're going to have
the meal of your life,

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.180
but if you categorize it as--
if you lower your expectation

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.650
set to airport
food, you suddenly

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.230
can have a much more
positive experience.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.120
With film, film just
gets so much more

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.430
into kind of personal taste,
which is a much harder thing

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:55.030
to nail down.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.630
And we've all had the experience
of recommending something

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.410
to someone, like this movie
is going to change your life.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.990
Turns out not to
change their life.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.520
What went wrong there?

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.450
It's just a far messier
process, I think.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.116
SACHIT EGAN: OK.

00:11:06.116 --> 00:11:08.460
So you think it has
roots in expectation?

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.240
TOM VANDERBILT:
Expectation is huge.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.280
I can't put a percentage on
it, but a huge amount of-- we

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.645
go into something either
being framed and conditioned

00:11:17.645 --> 00:11:19.270
on how we think we're
going to like it.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.040
And there's a lot of great
experiments about-- Heston

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.380
Blumenthal and some
psychologists did a study

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.330
about, give people
frozen savory mousse,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.610
they find it disgusting,
they can't stand it.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.320
Excuse me, give them
salmon-flavored ice cream.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.160
They find this disgusting.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.960
A little disgust was evoked
during this experiment.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.390
Give them frozen savory mousse.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.400
Don't know what to
expect, but it sounds

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.670
like a better proposition.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.450
Doesn't violate some notion
of what's good ice cream.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.400
People love the
frozen savory mousse.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.240
So same exact dish.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.810
And we've seen this
kind of blind taste test

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.910
with the same exact product done
in all kinds of different ways.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.290
And it's just all about
how you're framing it,

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.860
what you're expecting
out of that.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.740
SACHIT EGAN: Got it.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.240
Can you talk a little bit about
variety amnesia, what is it,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.200
and how it affects us?

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.600
TOM VANDERBILT:
One of these kind

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.200
of phenomena studied
by psychologists--

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.040
there's a another thing called
diversification bias, which

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.010
I mentioned in the book that I
suffered from and still suffer

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.130
from.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.190
Does anybody remember the
Kellogg's variety pack cereal

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.110
in the grocery store?

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.610
OK.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.800
So they come in these
24 packs of all this,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.750
Frosted Flakes, Sugar Pops.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.980
So I would beg my parents
to get these things.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.925
And a week would go by, I'd
blitz through the Frosted

00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:37.550
Flakes, and you get
down to the bottom,

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:42.771
it's like your Totals
and your All Brans.

00:12:42.771 --> 00:12:44.520
So the question was,
why didn't I just buy

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.960
a big box of Frosted Flakes?

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.440
Because I was--
people often think

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.260
they want more
variety in the moment

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.790
than they actually want in
some consumption interval

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:54.120
down the road.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.934
And the variety
amnesia is when--

00:12:55.934 --> 00:12:57.850
it's kind of almost the
reverse of that, where

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.200
you forget how much variety
you've had in your diet,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.290
for example.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.112
[INAUDIBLE] oh, we just
ate there last week

00:13:05.112 --> 00:13:06.070
or something like that.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.620
But the point is is that
we're often unaware of how

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.740
much our tastes are changing,
either retrospectively

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.240
or prospectively, where they've
been, where they're going.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.330
We're sort of not
as-- I don't know

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.360
how to describe it-- not
as aware of that status

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.809
as we think we are, I think.

00:13:24.809 --> 00:13:25.600
SACHIT EGAN: I see.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.299
Let's dive in a little deeper
with diversification bias.

00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:30.340
Two examples in the book.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.770
One, you spoke with the
folks who make MREs.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:37.397
These are Meals Ready to Eat,
which soldiers are given.

00:13:37.397 --> 00:13:39.230
And something that I
found really surprising

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:42.460
is, you might expect that
these soldiers will tire less

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.190
quickly of the flavorful food.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.480
They'll enjoy variety.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.730
They'll enjoy flavors.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:51.105
But they actually tire far
less quickly of the bland food.

00:13:51.105 --> 00:13:54.020
It makes more sense for them
to have blander food, I guess.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:54.521
Why is that?

00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:56.186
TOM VANDERBILT: The
argument I was given

00:13:56.186 --> 00:13:58.636
was that flavorful food sticks
out in your imagination.

00:13:58.636 --> 00:14:00.010
And the more you
can remember it,

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.884
the more you can remember
actually having it,

00:14:01.884 --> 00:14:03.740
and it's sort of
availability bias.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.600
It looms larger.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.230
Bland food, you
sort of immediately

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.240
forget the experience.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.580
So then the next time the
consumption experience

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.900
rolls around, you're ready to
roll again, and less fatigue.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.450
And this ties into
something else.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.190
One of my favorite sort of
phenomena we experience,

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.710
which is called
sensory-specific satiety.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.710
And this idea that so much
of our liking, I think,

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.170
is based on
anticipation or memory.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.270
And so you go into a meal.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.820
You're very excited to eat it.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.620
You start to eat.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.820
And the moment you start to eat
a certain entree, your reported

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.440
liking for that food
begins to go down,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.990
and it kind of falls
off the hedonic cliff.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.940
And the way you can boost
your hedonic appetite back up

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.930
is to switch foods.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.070
So the theory is the body
has an internal thermostat,

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.870
regulating, and giving
you signals of when

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.120
it's time to switch something.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.880
But they've done
great experiments

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.660
with even Smarties candy.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.270
And if you eat only
green Smarties,

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:00.540
you begin to get tired
of the green Smarties.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.630
Give people blue Smarties,
suddenly their liking

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.330
goes back up.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.430
So just this kind of
new-- it's a reset

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.240
of your palate and
almost your brain,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.239
I think, and you're primed
to want more all of a sudden.

00:15:10.239 --> 00:15:11.280
SACHIT EGAN: Interesting.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.490
So related to that, one way we
marketed this talk internally

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.560
is we posed questions
that kind of come up

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.674
in the book to Googlers
and kind of whet

00:15:19.674 --> 00:15:20.840
their appetite to come here.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.640
And one of those
questions was, why

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.690
do we crave monotony
at breakfast--

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:25.780
or maybe not crave it.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.250
We sort of expect to eat
similar things for breakfast.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.660
But at dinner, we want variety.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.170
I can't have Chinese, I
had Chinese last night.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.850
So why is that?

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.308
TOM VANDERBILT: I'm actually
not sure that's been answered.

00:15:36.308 --> 00:15:39.340
But it's a question that was
asked to me by EP Koester,

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.890
a Dutch food researcher.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.730
I guess there's certain
situational factors, right?

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:44.230
You wake up.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.080
You need convenience.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.300
You're not going to go
looking for adventurous foods,

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.017
preparing adventurous foods.

00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:52.600
Maybe there's something
about the body

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.760
just not being primed for
novelty upon waking up.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.260
There's a lot of things we don't
do in the morning, I guess,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.770
that we do do at night.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.429
But there's simple just
structural factors.

00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:04.220
Whether there are other
things beyond that,

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.322
I'm not sure that we know.

00:16:05.322 --> 00:16:06.530
SACHIT EGAN: OK, fair enough.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.821
TOM VANDERBILT: But I feel
like it is a real phenomena,

00:16:08.821 --> 00:16:11.730
that I've stayed at--
we've probably all stayed

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.480
at a hotel in a place like
China and they have the five

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.869
different breakfasts
out of different foods

00:16:16.869 --> 00:16:17.910
from different countries.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.030
I always just go for,
like, the pancakes.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.739
I'm never getting the
congee or whatever.

00:16:21.739 --> 00:16:24.279
SACHIT EGAN: I need my Cream of
Wheat here at the Google cafe

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:26.050
every morning, and
that's just how I roll.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.970
But something you
just mentioned.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.030
We begin to like something
less-- some things

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.920
less the more that we're
exposed to them, OK.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.670
But you quote, "some things
we like less the more we're

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.340
having them, but
there's an implication

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.920
that sometimes we like
things more the more we're

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.628
exposed to them."

00:16:41.628 --> 00:16:44.480
And so you were talking
about complexity, I think.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.870
Something like a
Coca-Cola or a Dr Pepper

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.824
is complex, keeps
us coming back,

00:16:48.824 --> 00:16:50.240
versus an orange
soda, which might

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.830
be pretty nice the
first time you have it,

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.494
but your brain sort of, I
guess, gets tired of it quicker,

00:16:57.494 --> 00:16:58.660
because it's not as complex.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.285
TOM VANDERBILT: Yeah,
this was a theory

00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:02.930
that Howard Moskowitz, a food
researcher, kind of gave to me.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.990
And Coca-Cola, you can't figure
out what that flavor blend is.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.220
It's a more complex thing.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.060
Your memory tires
of it less quickly.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:14.099
Orange soda's pleasurable,
but you know it's orange.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.880
There's not much mystery
upon the fourth drink.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.339
The first drink is about
the same as the fourth.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.130
And I sort of may be
taking liberties here.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.435
I've sort of stretched
that metaphor

00:17:23.435 --> 00:17:25.560
in the book to talk about
something like pop music.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.510
I think psychologists
talk about this U-shape

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.300
of liking between
complexity and simplicity.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.460
And we all kind of have a
slightly different point

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.501
based on the personality,
but humans, in general,

00:17:35.501 --> 00:17:37.236
kind of want to be in
the middle of that.

00:17:37.236 --> 00:17:38.610
And you can look--
you can almost

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:43.380
read pop music as this
simple sugary orange soda

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.220
rush that tastes
great going down,

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.920
but maybe hear it
10 times in a row.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.990
Something like jazz,
or a more atonal,

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.700
or some sort of
more complex music

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.294
might be sort of a Coca-Cola.

00:17:57.294 --> 00:17:59.710
If you want to read it, it's
a little harder to figure out

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:00.380
what's going on.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.350
Takes longer to
appreciate it, perhaps.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.290
SACHIT EGAN: Sure.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.712
If you don't mind
me asking a question

00:18:05.712 --> 00:18:06.670
related to my own life.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.420
After reading this
book, a friend

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.420
recommended some music
to me recently that I was

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.900
listening to this past week.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.600
And really loved a couple of
the songs, and binged them,

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.720
listening to them maybe five
or six times on one car ride.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.182
What I've noticed the past week
is whenever I'm walking out

00:18:21.182 --> 00:18:22.890
of a building, going
to another building,

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.250
I have these songs just
going on in my head.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.812
I'm walking kind
of to that pace.

00:18:26.812 --> 00:18:29.020
It's almost as if my brain--
I wake up in the morning

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.280
and I have the song
going in my head.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.050
My brain's almost
figuring them out.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.883
And I noticed the next
time I play the song,

00:18:33.883 --> 00:18:35.860
it doesn't have that
same, oh my god,

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.830
this song is amazing feeling.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.170
Is that sort of what you were
describing with pop songs

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.815
getting older quicker to us?

00:18:43.815 --> 00:18:45.940
TOM VANDERBILT: Yeah, and
it's an interesting thing

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.050
about hearing music
multiple times.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.110
Psychologists talk about
processing fluency.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.060
And I think the easier
something is to read,

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.750
the more we enjoy
it, the theory goes.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.560
And what we like is not
so much the thing itself,

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.484
is our ability to
process and understand

00:19:02.484 --> 00:19:03.400
that thing right away.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.479
So I think it's what happens
when you learn a language.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.270
Some languages sound
a little bit dissonant

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.340
to the ear when you
first hear them.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.780
People say, oh, that's
an ugly language.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.474
And I think it's not
ugly, it's just--

00:19:14.474 --> 00:19:16.390
the people who speak it
don't think it's ugly.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.934
It's just that you've
not-- you don't speak it.

00:19:18.934 --> 00:19:20.350
You don't know
what to listen for.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.370
You're not fluent
in that language.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.470
So as you begin to learn
it, you begin to like it.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.442
And I think language works
like music in this way.

00:19:28.442 --> 00:19:30.229
Rick Rubin even
used the word-- I

00:19:30.229 --> 00:19:32.770
think he used the word fluency
talking about Nine Inch Nails.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.110
Like, the first time he heard
this Nine Inch Nails record,

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.760
he didn't like it.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.060
He felt like he was
hearing a new language.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.976
He didn't know what the
reference points were.

00:19:38.976 --> 00:19:42.140
And this is a sort
of appreciation 101,

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.630
but I think it's
often forgotten, some

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:45.794
of these dynamics.

00:19:45.794 --> 00:19:46.460
SACHIT EGAN: OK.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.610
It's fascinating stuff.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.700
Can you talk briefly about taste
as a tool for class mobility?

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.000
This is something that I've
been reading about lately.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.708
I think a lot of folks
are covering this.

00:19:54.708 --> 00:19:56.520
This idea that taste
implies, not just

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.550
who we are, but in
terms of what we like,

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.950
but where we stand in society.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.120
TOM VANDERBILT: Yeah,
I think the high era

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.260
of that taste as social signal
is we've passed it, I think.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.590
It's sort of like
1950s, perhaps,

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:16.665
in terms of culture with
all these sociologists

00:20:16.665 --> 00:20:18.790
with theories of highbrow,
lowbrow, and middlebrow.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.331
And what happened in the past
few decades, people talk about,

00:20:21.331 --> 00:20:23.230
is a cultural
omnivorousness came out

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:28.285
in which it wasn't so much
important the thing you liked--

00:20:28.285 --> 00:20:30.570
you couldn't discount
entire genres all at once,

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:34.027
like country music is
not equivalent to opera.

00:20:34.027 --> 00:20:36.360
You had to sort of figure
out, within those genres, what

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.750
was happening.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.610
What's interesting to me,
someone living in Brooklyn,

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:46.940
New York, circa 2016,
is that as incomes go up

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.010
among a certain class and people
are more similar, you have

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.200
to fight harder to achieve
that distinction that was once

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.760
possible when societies
were more-- let's say,

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.589
going back to feudal
aristocracy times,

00:21:00.589 --> 00:21:02.380
you knew what the elite
taste was, you knew

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.300
what the peasant taste was.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:03.450
But--

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:04.020
SACHIT EGAN: Sure.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.603
TOM VANDERBILT:
--everyone in Brooklyn

00:21:05.603 --> 00:21:08.290
is within a certain
bandwidth, let's say.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.940
So hence, you see this
kind of extreme signaling

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.110
and distinction at places
like coffee shops, where

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.110
each week there seems to
be some new form of coffee

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.430
preparation being rolled
out that I haven't yet

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:25.040
learned about, so I feel
slightly not up to snuff.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.290
And the things that were
once luxury goods have become

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.230
democratized, and things
that were once everyday goods

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.780
have become increasingly
subject to these almost a

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.540
connoisseurial sort of energy.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.660
So I've spent time with a
denim maker in South Carolina,

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.110
and he talks about he
paid $30,000 for a sewing

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.530
machine that is obsolete.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.320
It was obsolete
from the 1930s on.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.946
He tracked it down
in Thailand on eBay.

00:21:47.946 --> 00:21:50.111
The reason he bought this
is so he could make what's

00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:51.059
called a chain stitch.

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:52.600
There's a little
thing on the bottom.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.433
These pants actually
don't have it, I think.

00:21:54.433 --> 00:21:57.942
But denim connoisseurs,
of which they are now,

00:21:57.942 --> 00:21:59.900
will be able to spot this
from across the room.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.760
So he paid all this money
to create this little thing

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.100
that only a few people will see.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.990
A huge social value
for those people.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.740
And there was a very
happy guy in Thailand

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.640
who thought he was stuck with
this kind of surplus that

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.686
was able to resell it
back to the United States

00:22:14.686 --> 00:22:15.435
at quite a profit.

00:22:15.435 --> 00:22:16.800
SACHIT EGAN: Oh, that's great.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.730
Let's dive a little deeper.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:19.160
This actually-- it
really fascinated me.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.610
So what I want to do
is I want to reference

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:21.985
an article published
in "New York

00:22:21.985 --> 00:22:24.920
Magazine," the Science of Us
section, just this past week.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.490
The article was
called "Why You Swipe

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.730
Left When Someone Says
They Love Nickelback,"

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.890
and it's by Cari Romm.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.570
So she kind of parallels a lot
of the stuff you just talked

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:37.410
about, that late 1800s,
we have people moving

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.720
into more metropolis
areas, into bigger

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.120
cities, whereas previously,
courtship was old-fashioned.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.500
And a gentleman would go
meet a woman's family,

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.314
spend time, and talk about
shared values, et cetera.

00:22:49.314 --> 00:22:51.230
Now you have young people
in these big cities,

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.813
and the question is,
how are you going

00:22:52.813 --> 00:22:55.670
to ever know who this person
hitting on you at the bar,

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:56.890
how do you know who they are?

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.710
How do you know what they're
about, what their values are,

00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:59.210
et cetera?

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:02.972
And likes become this way
of connecting with people.

00:23:02.972 --> 00:23:05.430
If you both like Nickelback or
if you both hate Nickelback,

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.110
you might bond
over these things.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:12.929
But you mentioned that--
you cite the low success

00:23:12.929 --> 00:23:14.470
rate of online
dating, which is often

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.195
based on just shared likes.

00:23:17.195 --> 00:23:20.385
Do you think that-- I don't
know if-- you didn't research

00:23:20.385 --> 00:23:23.010
heavily into online dating, but
do you think likes matter maybe

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:28.390
as much as we-- we put a lot of
emphasis on likes these days.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.840
TOM VANDERBILT: Yeah, I was
going to do some dating stuff,

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.440
and then I had lunch with
Christian Rudder who's

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.960
the OkCupid guy, and he was
working on his own book.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.280
So I figured, well, I don't
want to poach onto that.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.660
But there is very
interesting data there.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.630
Yeah, I know there was a
dating service started up that

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.690
was specifically using
musical taste as a way to kind

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.040
of connect people.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:52.770
But how important--
musical taste matters

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.420
more at a certain
time of life, right?

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.541
It's a more affiliative,
associative thing

00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:57.290
at a certain time.

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:02.980
So in online dating, you're even
using broader things than that,

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.930
and that's still pretty
poor predictively.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.630
So just something
like music is--

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.247
my wife actually wrote for
"Rolling Stone" for many years,

00:24:11.247 --> 00:24:13.080
and we have pretty
different musical tastes,

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.600
and we've been
married for 15 years.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.670
So I think it's kind of
interesting and perhaps

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.560
important in some initial
just conversational way.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.890
But as far as-- it's not one
of these sort of underlying

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.280
themes, I would think.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.920
It can be associated with
other lifestyle factors.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.430
I mention the Insane
Clown Posse in the book.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.790
There are two Juggalos that
meet and decide to get married,

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.580
they may have a broader set of
interests than just that music

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.461
or they may not.

00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:38.460
SACHIT EGAN: Sure thing.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.210
So one thing I appreciate
about your books

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.100
is-- a friend and I joke that
the last half of the book

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.710
is footnotes.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.700
And I know that you like to
have your points grounded

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.520
in research, right?

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.270
So I know that maybe you
haven't researched online dating

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.430
to the effect that you
can be the expert on it.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.492
I guess I'm curious,
you talk so much

00:24:55.492 --> 00:24:57.200
about how likes come
from-- we don't even

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.520
analyze how we get our likes,
why we like things we do.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.840
There's fluidity to our likes.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.506
One day we hate
something, tomorrow it's

00:25:03.506 --> 00:25:05.320
our favorite thing.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.404
Does it make you
skeptical of likes?

00:25:07.404 --> 00:25:09.070
Or does it make you
kind of encourage us

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.949
to want to think
more about our likes?

00:25:11.949 --> 00:25:13.740
TOM VANDERBILT: Well,
it's a good question.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.430
And what are likes?

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:20.810
Is an Instagram like the
same as a YouTube thumbs up,

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:25.830
the same as a five-star--
these are very kind of inexact

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:27.378
currency here that--

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:30.940
SACHIT EGAN: You liked
that YouTube video.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.967
So did I. We should hang
out sometime, right?

00:25:32.967 --> 00:25:35.550
TOM VANDERBILT: Yeah, there's
so much noise in all that stuff,

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:36.050
right?

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.190
If you thumb up the best
kitten video you've ever seen,

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.980
is that the same as you kind
of mildly like something?

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.517
There's only one signal.

00:25:48.517 --> 00:25:49.975
It reminds me of
something, though,

00:25:49.975 --> 00:25:52.804
that there's a difficulty
to trying to drill too far

00:25:52.804 --> 00:25:53.970
down into some of the stuff.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.680
I was talking to the people at
Pandora and they, for a while,

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.040
were going to do sort
of a little A/B test

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.570
with a feature where instead
of just simply thumbing down,

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.170
you could actually describe
why you didn't like

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.585
or why you liked a song.

00:26:04.585 --> 00:26:06.210
And when they-- the
minute they started

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.860
that up, it was
just like, this was

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.790
the favorite song at
my daughter's wedding,

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.571
this was this, this
was-- they had no way

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:14.820
to basically do anything
with any of that information.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.195
So they just--
they got rid of it

00:26:16.195 --> 00:26:19.080
and went back to-- so sometimes
a thumb up or thumb down

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.180
is really all you want.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.509
SACHIT EGAN: I see.

00:26:21.509 --> 00:26:23.050
Speaking of which,
one other question

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.790
we threw out in
the marketing was,

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.410
YouTube used to have a five-star
rating system for videos,

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:28.786
but why'd they go
away from that?

00:26:28.786 --> 00:26:30.993
TOM VANDERBILT: I think they
felt that people-- a lot

00:26:30.993 --> 00:26:33.612
of people were just using five
stars as an implicit thumbs up,

00:26:33.612 --> 00:26:35.320
and there was just
not enough-- there was

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.730
a heavy skew toward five-star.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:39.550
And that's something
you see, of course,

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.010
in a lot of these data sets.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.860
And I've come to be very
suspicious of-- almost discount

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.020
entirely, except when
it's my book on Amazon,

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.120
five-star reviews
and one-star reviews,

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.780
because they each come
with their own set of--

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.560
and we all know this,
but one-star review

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.910
is someone's grinding
a very heavy axe there

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.280
about the bad night they
had at a restaurant.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:04.370
And five stars is probably a
friend or a plant, a fraud.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:05.240
SACHIT EGAN: I see.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.364
TOM VANDERBILT: So 3 and
1/2 is sort of the happy--

00:27:07.364 --> 00:27:09.350
where you find the
interesting stuff, I think.

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:10.380
SACHIT EGAN: That's
good to know.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.713
I want to ask you one or two
more we go to the audience.

00:27:12.713 --> 00:27:16.360
One of these things is
conformity versus distinction.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.660
And you cite conformity
versus distinction

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.680
as one of the tensions that goes
a great way towards explaining

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.539
our liking, towards
accounting for our taste.

00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:26.080
The example I thought
of right away--

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.307
conformity and
distinction-- is men's ties.

00:27:28.307 --> 00:27:29.640
Neither of us are wearing a tie.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.720
I remember, I don't know,
it was in high school,

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.960
and it was about the
time when I said hey,

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.626
I should probably
care about how I look.

00:27:34.626 --> 00:27:38.810
And at the time, these sort of
thickish ties were in style,

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:40.310
so I bought a bunch
of thicker ties.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.790
And by the time
I got to college,

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.380
the skinny tie was back,
thanks to "Mad Men,"

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.540
and I was a schmuck
all of a sudden.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.350
What about these trends
of-- you talk so much

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:53.190
in the book about how likes
just change with trends.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.790
Can you talk about that?

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.290
TOM VANDERBILT:
Yeah, for that part,

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:57.910
I talked a lot to
anthropologists,

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.520
because I think there's a huge
social learning component here

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.690
that probably has an
evolutionary story, if you

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.312
want to go there.

00:28:05.312 --> 00:28:07.520
I always thought the word
ape was sort of ill-chosen,

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.250
because humans mimic much
more strongly than apes.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.930
There's some great research
by Michael Tomasello that

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.240
take a glass box, and there's
something trapped inside,

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:22.547
and if you show-- a chimp will
show-- have the human do it,

00:28:22.547 --> 00:28:24.380
the chimp follows it,
the chimp will sort of

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.850
figure out what
the best way to do

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:28.780
it is pretty quickly regardless
of what the human is doing.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.260
The human will
continue to follow

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.630
the-- the human watching
the box will continue

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.622
to follow the demonstrator,
even when they're doing it

00:28:36.622 --> 00:28:38.580
in an inefficient way,
because they're not sure

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.300
that there's some
sort of social norm

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.550
that they should be following.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.750
We just implicitly
trust what other people

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:47.540
are doing as a signal, perhaps
going back to this time

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.220
when we lived in small
bands, and conformity was

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.920
survival in a way.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.620
And that raises the question
of why anyone does anything

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.750
different, and that
perhaps has a larger basis

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:02.620
in just contemporary society of
trying to achieve distinction

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.850
through-- so it's a
very complicated thing.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.810
But so yeah, I think a
lot of these processes

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.670
are just literally-- there's
a great story in the "New York

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:15.730
Times" about-- you may have
seen with the sprouts trend that

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.820
took off in China in
the last few years,

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.360
where people were putting
these sort of plastic sprouts

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.062
of vegetables or fruit
replicas in their hair.

00:29:23.062 --> 00:29:24.520
And this article
was spending a lot

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.147
of time trying to explain why.

00:29:26.147 --> 00:29:28.230
And the only reason they
could really come up with

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.880
is that people had seen other
people doing it, specifically

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.250
on social media, and people
on Instagram with selfie

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.900
sticks photographing them.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.009
So someone saw it and
they decided to mimic it.

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:39.300
They said, that's sort of cool.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:43.219
I don't see a function for
it, but I'll try it out.

00:29:43.219 --> 00:29:44.010
SACHIT EGAN: I see.

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:45.676
You mentioned the
hipster effect as one.

00:29:45.676 --> 00:29:48.590
I was very glad to hear there's
an effect that's called that.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.450
And I could be
butchering it here,

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:52.554
but the obvious question,
when enough people

00:29:52.554 --> 00:29:54.720
are putting sprouts in their
hair because it's cool,

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.360
you're part of this cool club,
what happens when everybody's

00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.610
now got sprouts in their hair?

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:00.945
Does it change?

00:30:00.945 --> 00:30:02.570
TOM VANDERBILT: Yeah,
it almost reminds

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:04.170
me of sensory-specific
satiety, where

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:08.070
there's no reason we should
fatigue of seeing-- or even

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.140
hearing the same song.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.056
There's not quite the
same thing as nutrition.

00:30:11.056 --> 00:30:12.510
But if suddenly
everyone's wearing

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:16.040
the same shirt in this
room, biologically it

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.484
doesn't fatigue our eyes.

00:30:17.484 --> 00:30:18.900
So there's some
other social thing

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:24.180
where some people need a
certain amount of distinction.

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.560
Survival of the fittest
is the one argument,

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.094
but that doesn't necessarily
explain why new things arise.

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:31.760
And so this is kind
of an open question,

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.010
where do innovators come from?

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.650
Where do artistic
innovators come from?

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.310
They should really be doing--
for greater social success,

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.190
you should conform to
the existing group.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:43.000
And that's a much harder thing
to explain, the disconformity

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.970
than conformity.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.150
SACHIT EGAN: I see.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.250
TOM VANDERBILT: Yeah,
but Jonathan Touboul,

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:50.100
this mathematician,
did a great analysis

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.170
where he sort of
said there's once

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.404
in a while, a
statistical oscillation,

00:30:54.404 --> 00:30:56.570
where because the conformists
and the nonconformists

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.740
aren't necessarily
planning ahead

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.230
of time what
they're going to do,

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.700
they can be sort
of discoordinated,

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.730
and that the squares might start
doing what the hipsters are

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.730
doing almost by
accident or because--

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:09.230
and so the hipsters get annoyed.

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.105
They feel like their
thing has been co-opted.

00:31:11.105 --> 00:31:12.090
They move on.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.890
I use the example of shell art
from the show "Portlandia,"

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.560
where Spike the hipster,
he sees this guy doing

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.660
all the things he does--
shell art, fixed gear bikes--

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.670
and then he declares
those things to be over.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:23.670
Like, why are they over?

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.819
So he can eke out another
form of distinction.

00:31:26.819 --> 00:31:27.610
SACHIT EGAN: I see.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.810
So it might be a
similarly U-shaped curve

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:32.550
that you mention that
some people have a need

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.840
to kind of be a little
removed from the norm,

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.550
and so everybody has a
particular taste for being

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.540
away from the norm.

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.580
TOM VANDERBILT: Yeah.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.340
Again, the
anthropologists will say,

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.790
this is what they call a weird
thing, Western, educated,

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.870
industrialized,
rich democracies.

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:49.760
There are other societies
that the conformist norms

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.800
are stronger.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.280
But I think living in a consumer
society with endless choice,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.765
we have a lot more
options to pick from

00:31:57.765 --> 00:32:01.020
and different ways to
distinguish ourselves.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.200
SACHIT EGAN: Sure thing.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.796
One more question from me.

00:32:03.796 --> 00:32:06.170
You can tell that I'm into
the social psych part of this.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.210
You mentioned Freud's
famous narcissism

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:11.940
of small differences, the
minor variances in people

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.320
who are otherwise alike that
form the basis of feelings

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.440
of hostility between people.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.120
And it got me
thinking, you might

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.520
have a family member or a friend
or a partner who you think

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.450
about all the major
values are in line,

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:28.400
background is in line,
future goals in line,

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.240
but they like some band
that you just can't stand.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.170
And if it was a stranger
who liked that band,

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:35.211
you wouldn't think twice.

00:32:35.211 --> 00:32:36.874
That difference in
like doesn't matter.

00:32:36.874 --> 00:32:38.540
But when it's somebody
that you care for

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.920
or that you feel very akin
to, how can you like that?

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.977
That question just kind
of is a dagger at times.

00:32:44.977 --> 00:32:46.810
Did anything in your
research or anybody you

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:49.240
speak to have any
suggestion as to why

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.410
those things kind of stick out?

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.022
Or is that just--

00:32:54.022 --> 00:32:55.980
TOM VANDERBILT: Not in
kind of that social way.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.840
I definitely remember
making mix tapes for people

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.280
and then feeling a
bit betrayed when

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:06.200
they reported that not 100%
of the songs were a success.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.830
How did you misread me?

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.020
But I do think-- one
thing I thought more about

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:15.041
was just when you do have a
strong subculture or really

00:33:15.041 --> 00:33:16.790
any culture-- the thing
that's fascinating

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.040
to me is there's a whole
psychology of categorization.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.830
And the more we like something,
the more we want to categorize.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.990
And then the more we
categorize, the more

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:26.990
we like the things we put
into those categories.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:31.106
So if you pick any kind of--
I'm a avid cyclist, so we-- talk

00:33:31.106 --> 00:33:32.730
about narcissism of
small differences--

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:35.063
we have debates about things
that, in the outside world,

00:33:35.063 --> 00:33:36.190
would seem ridiculous.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.506
But you go in the
cycling world, there's

00:33:38.506 --> 00:33:41.890
sock height, what kind
of handlebar tape, carbon

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:44.655
or steel, or there's any
number of these distinctions

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:45.780
that you could argue about.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.570
And so you could probably
take any-- punk rock

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:53.080
or any-- people will be
having stronger arguments

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:58.090
within those fields
than intra fields.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:59.956
It's just because
no one else cares.

00:33:59.956 --> 00:34:01.830
Those are the only people
that actually care.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:02.790
SACHIT EGAN: I see.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:03.740
Very good.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.240
AUDIENCE: I was curious
how the internet has

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.090
played a role in our
likings and dislikings.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.100
Has it become more
of a normalizer,

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.440
where we tend to like the
same things as everybody does?

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.080
Or has it pushed
in our extremes,

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.210
like we see in the political
systems and things like that?

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.126
TOM VANDERBILT: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.159
I think back to
when I was younger

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:29.410
and I kind of discovered
this punk rock music,

00:34:29.410 --> 00:34:30.410
let's say, in the 1980s.

00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:33.380
And I thought I had to track
this down on a small station.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.529
No one knew about it.

00:34:34.529 --> 00:34:36.570
I didn't really know how
many people in the world

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.199
were actually fans of this.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:42.230
So come now with
Spotify and everything,

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:46.389
I thought, well, if everyone
had access to everything,

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:49.489
then surely these kind
of hierarchical forms

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:52.040
of popularity would wither away.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.930
Why would we have the pop
charts if you can get anything?

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:56.929
You don't only have to
listen to what the top 40

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:57.887
station is playing you.

00:34:57.887 --> 00:34:59.880
But some research
that I was given

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.650
by someone who analyzes this
shows, in fact, the opposite

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:06.470
has happened, where hits
now sort of persevere longer

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.660
than they did before.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.960
Songs are played
on radio longer.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.100
In 2013, Robin Thicke's
"Blurred Lines"

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:17.850
was played twice as much as the
most popular song from 2003.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:20.320
So I think the tail
has gotten longer,

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.170
but I wouldn't say
it's gotten fatter,

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:23.860
and then the spikes
have gotten higher.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:29.160
So I think otherwise,
though, the internet really

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:34.860
amplifies existing dynamics
rather than creating entirely

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.700
new dynamics unto itself.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.420
Yeah.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.539
I'll stop there.

00:35:40.539 --> 00:35:41.080
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.910
So I work on YouTube
recommendations.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.260
So I would love to hear
your opinion on what's

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.670
a good set of recommendations.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.905
Like, if you've got to
show somebody 12 videos,

00:35:49.905 --> 00:35:52.530
should you show them, like-- if
you think they like cat videos,

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.571
should you show them a
whole bunch of cat videos?

00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:57.760
Or should you try to
diversify them somehow?

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.210
Or maybe there's
some-- you should

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.585
show them some Total cereal
every now and then, something

00:36:01.585 --> 00:36:02.970
that they really
don't like, just

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.303
so they can not watch it and
feel good about themselves.

00:36:05.303 --> 00:36:07.750
So what is the optimal
video recommendation?

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.640
If you have an opinion.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.881
TOM VANDERBILT: It's so hard.

00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:13.255
Talking to people
here at Google,

00:36:13.255 --> 00:36:16.220
like Amit Singhal
about Knowledge Graph,

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.140
and just how hard
search is as a problem,

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.230
trying to figure out people's
intention with their search.

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:25.052
I mean, taste is
just-- blows that out

00:36:25.052 --> 00:36:26.260
of the water, the complexity.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.790
I've talked to
people at Pandora.

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.649
If you like the band
Fun, "We Are Young,"

00:36:30.649 --> 00:36:33.190
are you coming to that because
you were a fan of them before?

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.810
Or are you coming to that
because you're a "Glee" fan?

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:37.850
So the thing about
recommendations-- I always

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:39.265
wish there was a
little bit more,

00:36:39.265 --> 00:36:40.640
and maybe some
services even have

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.640
this that I'm not aware of
this, but some dials or sliders,

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:47.310
where you can sort of tweak
your own appetite for discovery

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:50.170
or adventure-- hey, I'm
feeling more adventurous today.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:53.330
Is there anything like that
currently on YouTube or--

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:54.420
AUDIENCE: No.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.410
Currently, it's
completely passive.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.240
It just says here's a bunch--
if you go to YouTube home page,

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.749
you just get a bunch of videos.

00:37:00.749 --> 00:37:03.040
There's no way that you can
interact with that process.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.125
Except for if you really
care about something,

00:37:05.125 --> 00:37:06.730
you can click on
a video and say,

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:08.430
I don't like this
recommendation.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.710
But very few people do that.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.140
TOM VANDERBILT: And a cat
video is a much slipperier

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.710
format than music.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.980
I mean, cat-- I guess it
is a genre, cat videos,

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.070
but you don't have genres.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.180
Well, I may be speaking
out of turn here.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.290
I don't know if there might
be genres within cat videos.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.740
The cat scared by the
cucumber or something.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.960
So hey, I want more.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.940
Yeah, it's just-- stuff like
that seems so slippery to me.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.380
I don't really know,
except maybe some

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:42.530
of these personalization, I'm
feeling more adventurous, but--

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.880
AUDIENCE: So I feel like
in the last few decades

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.000
with massive industrial
production of things,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.350
I've heard this term come up,
institutionalized good taste,

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.692
where you get things like,
you buy clothes at Gap,

00:37:55.692 --> 00:37:57.150
you're not going
to look too weird.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.950
You drive a Volkswagen, you're
not going to look too weird.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:03.490
Everybody has a Apple computer,
and they all look really good.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.220
What sort of effect
has that had,

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.897
do you think, on
taste in general?

00:38:06.897 --> 00:38:08.480
TOM VANDERBILT: It's
a great question.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.084
I've often, like,
at Christmastime,

00:38:10.084 --> 00:38:12.500
going to Pottery Barn or some
of these stores at the mall,

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.960
and they all seem to be playing
the same kind of tasteful retro

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.790
Christmas music.

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.880
And at some point, what would
have been rare a while ago,

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:24.700
suddenly just became this
almost inescapable norm.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.640
I feel like the internet,
with Instagram in particular,

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:32.060
has radiated fashion
trends much more quickly.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.390
There used to be this process
of the Parisian shows,

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.848
the stuff trickling over here,
the stuff trickling from New

00:38:36.848 --> 00:38:38.510
York to the hinterlands.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.740
Burberry is now selling
some of the stuff

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.370
directly from their runway show,
because there's no lagging,

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.960
where people can take an
Instagram of the runway show,

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.450
and that trend is
immediately blasted out.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:53.030
So in some ways,
whatever the distinction

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:56.000
or the rarity of that fashion
trend has now been lost.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:56.784
So I don't know.

00:38:56.784 --> 00:38:57.700
It's a slippery thing.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.990
There's always a reaction when
there's too much of one thing.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:05.220
And I've seen some arguments
in favor of ugly fonts

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.810
or-- because there
is something where--

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.570
there's some research
with font fluency.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:11.404
The more fluent the
font is, the less likely

00:39:11.404 --> 00:39:13.736
you are to remember what
you're reading, because it just

00:39:13.736 --> 00:39:14.630
goes down so easily.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.620
So to really stand out in a
world of uniform good taste,

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.990
you just have to take a left.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:23.320
And I'm trying to
think of-- something

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.350
like brutalism in architecture
has ridden various waves

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:29.155
of liking and disliking.

00:39:29.155 --> 00:39:29.780
Reappreciation.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.145
A building like the Sydney
Opera House in Australia.

00:39:35.145 --> 00:39:37.270
What is the most loved
building in Australia today?

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.228
The Sydney Opera House.

00:39:38.228 --> 00:39:41.310
What was the most hated
building in Australia in 1973?

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.380
The Sydney Opera House.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.850
And everything changed around
the Sydney Opera House.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:50.981
Sydney Opera House
changed things itself.

00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:51.480
See?

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:56.500
That's where it's just this
fascinating, very fluid,

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.290
dynamic, I think, if that
answers your question,

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:01.029
which I don't think it does.

00:40:01.029 --> 00:40:02.820
AUDIENCE: Movie critic
A. O. Scott was here

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:10.750
about a month ago, and he talked
about the role of the critic,

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:12.680
now that everybody
can essentially voice

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.740
their opinion on the media.

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.270
So I was curious
where you think--

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:21.140
what the role of other
people's opinions are

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:26.600
and where can
authority come from?

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.230
And what's the role of a
sort of authoritative voice

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:34.032
on a particular piece of media?

00:40:34.032 --> 00:40:36.240
TOM VANDERBILT: Yes, but I,
myself, don't necessarily

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.910
subscribe to the kind of full
democratization of everything,

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.030
that we can do away
with-- because if you look

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.800
at all these
services, they've all

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.700
tried to reinstill authority
under some other guise.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.320
And so we say the restaurant
critic is dead, but then

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.890
on Yelp, you have
the expert reviewer.

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:55.440
All these services now
have some delineation

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.460
between the average schmuck
and an Amazon top 500

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.950
reviewer, who may be reviewing
everything from hammers to

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:04.450
[INAUDIBLE].

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:05.530
It's a very slippery thing.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:07.446
They're not necessarily
a critic in one thing.

00:41:07.446 --> 00:41:12.900
So I feel like we may have had
this initial reaction of sort

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.090
of tearing things down
and just opening ourselves

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:16.589
to all the information
in the world,

00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:19.750
but there now may be a secondary
thing happening where it's just

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.640
too much, and we need
some kind of authority

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.380
just to wade through the morass.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.190
And you've seen some
kind of flip-flopping

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:30.290
between pure algorithmic
recommendation

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.940
and human curation
in this regard.

00:41:35.989 --> 00:41:36.780
It's funny, though.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.444
Taste is a very controversial
thing, really, I mean,

00:41:39.444 --> 00:41:40.360
just the notion of it.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.744
And when I was talking to
Pandora about visiting Pandora,

00:41:42.744 --> 00:41:44.660
they said-- I'm working
on a book about taste.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.860
They said, well, we don't
really like to use that word.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:51.160
We're not trying to prescribe
anyone's taste here.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.010
We're about discovery and
you can like what you like.

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.020
We'll point you to that.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.040
And there is still the
uncomfortable truth

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.090
that they don't have
every song in the world.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:01.350
They've made a decision
about what they're

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:03.090
going to play for
you within this--

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:06.270
we'll give you a sandbox,
but they've outlined

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.560
the edges of that sandbox.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.980
So I think the authority
thing is still there.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:15.220
But whether it's individual
critics at newspapers,

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:15.960
I'm not sure.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.180
I'm less optimistic
about that perhaps.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:24.980
AUDIENCE: So Veblen wrote "The
Theory of the Leisure Class,"

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.595
which is a 19th century book
where he does discuss taste

00:42:28.595 --> 00:42:34.250
as well being a product
of social stratification.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.750
Is there anything left
over from that theories

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:43.825
today or is it all consumerism
and pure consumerism?

00:42:43.825 --> 00:42:45.200
TOM VANDERBILT:
I think there is.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.090
I just think the stratification
is a bit less purely

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:51.880
hierarchical the way it
might have been before.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.290
The 1% out there
probably has a taste.

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.180
I don't know that
it really becomes--

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.490
that we aspire to it anymore.

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:01.740
And I think there's
been a lot of research

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.190
into-- I use the example
of the quotative like.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:08.399
This is the thing where
we say "like" a lot.

00:43:08.399 --> 00:43:09.940
That didn't come
from wealthy people.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:14.290
That came from high schoolers
in San Fernando Valley,

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:15.780
as the research has shown.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.930
That's not necessarily a status
group for society as a whole,

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.967
yet that has filtered
throughout society.

00:43:21.967 --> 00:43:24.050
So just the transmission
of those things, I think,

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:28.460
is not quite as top
down as it used to be.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.960
I'm sure it's still there,
just in many different ways.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.060
But just looking
at this room, you'd

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.110
be hard-pressed
to kind of analyze

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:41.654
who made more money
than other people.

00:43:41.654 --> 00:43:43.820
I may have the most expensive
jacket on in the room.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.195
I may make the less money.

00:43:45.195 --> 00:43:48.430
It's a very--

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:50.760
AUDIENCE: I guess this
room is the 1% room.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.532
So--

00:43:52.532 --> 00:43:53.490
SACHIT EGAN: Thank you.

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:54.560
One final question, Tom.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.660
It's a classic end of
interview question, OK?

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.460
TOM VANDERBILT: OK.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:01.219
SACHIT EGAN: What surprised you
the most in preparing this book

00:44:01.219 --> 00:44:03.260
and researching it, writing
it, talking about it?

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.218
TOM VANDERBILT: Oh god.

00:44:04.218 --> 00:44:07.949
And I still haven't gotten
good at answering that.

00:44:07.949 --> 00:44:08.490
I don't know.

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:10.880
I think just the fluidity
of a lot of the things,

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.340
and the extent to which
subconscious influences might

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.350
be acting on what we thought
were long-held or sort

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:20.620
of internal likes.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.502
And just how
flexible my own likes

00:44:23.502 --> 00:44:25.710
were when I really sort of
examined them and put them

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:27.085
under the microscope,
and started

00:44:27.085 --> 00:44:29.610
to think about who I
was 10 years ago, who

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:30.744
I'll be 10 years from now.

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:36.190
But yet how strongly we
cling to those things.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:40.062
They really seem like
a polestar to us.

00:44:40.062 --> 00:44:41.770
I don't know if that's
really surprising.

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:44.080
I think I'll need to work
on that one some more.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:44.580
I'm sorry.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.621
SACHIT EGAN: Tom Vanderbilt's
"You May Also Like,

00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:49.749
Taste in an Age of Endless
Choice" is now available.

00:44:49.749 --> 00:44:51.040
Thank you, Tom, for being here.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.123
TOM VANDERBILT: Thank you.

00:44:52.123 --> 00:44:55.090
[APPLAUSE]
