00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.000
what I want to do in this video is to

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010
what I want to do in this video is to
 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.550
what I want to do in this video is to
make two parametrizations of essentially

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560
make two parametrizations of essentially
 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.559
make two parametrizations of essentially
the same curve but we're going to go

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569
the same curve but we're going to go
 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.690
the same curve but we're going to go
along the curve at different rates and

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700
along the curve at different rates and
 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.310
along the curve at different rates and
hopefully we'll be able to use that to

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320
hopefully we'll be able to use that to
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.470
hopefully we'll be able to use that to
understand or get a better intuition

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480
understand or get a better intuition
 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.509
understand or get a better intuition
behind what exactly it means to take a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519
behind what exactly it means to take a
 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.790
behind what exactly it means to take a
derivative of a position vector-valued

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800
derivative of a position vector-valued
 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.519
derivative of a position vector-valued
function so let's say my first parameter

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
function so let's say my first parameter
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.470
function so let's say my first parameter
is a ssin I have X of T is equal to T

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
is a ssin I have X of T is equal to T
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.970
is a ssin I have X of T is equal to T
and let's say that Y of T is equal to T

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
and let's say that Y of T is equal to T
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.410
and let's say that Y of T is equal to T
squared and this is true for T is

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
squared and this is true for T is
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.100
squared and this is true for T is
greater than or equal to zero and less

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
greater than or equal to zero and less
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.840
greater than or equal to zero and less
than or equal to two and if I want to

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
than or equal to two and if I want to
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.000
than or equal to two and if I want to
write this as a position vector valued

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010
write this as a position vector valued
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.459
write this as a position vector valued
function let me write this X 1 let me

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
function let me write this X 1 let me
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.860
function let me write this X 1 let me
call that y 1 and let me write my

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
call that y 1 and let me write my
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.740
call that y 1 and let me write my
position vector valued function I could

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
position vector valued function I could
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.319
position vector valued function I could
say R 1 because I'm numbering them

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
say R 1 because I'm numbering them
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.549
say R 1 because I'm numbering them
because I'm going to a different version

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
because I'm going to a different version
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.200
because I'm going to a different version
of this exact same curve with a slightly

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210
of this exact same curve with a slightly
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.200
of this exact same curve with a slightly
different parametrizations so R 1 of T

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
different parametrizations so R 1 of T
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.590
different parametrizations so R 1 of T
we could say is X 1 of T times I the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600
we could say is X 1 of T times I the
 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.390
we could say is X 1 of T times I the
position the unit vector I so we'll just

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
position the unit vector I so we'll just
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.980
position the unit vector I so we'll just
say T times I plus write this is just X

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
say T times I plus write this is just X
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.380
say T times I plus write this is just X
of T right here or X 1 of T that's the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390
of T right here or X 1 of T that's the
 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.330
of T right here or X 1 of T that's the
numbering because I later have an X 2 of

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
numbering because I later have an X 2 of
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.510
numbering because I later have an X 2 of
T plus T squared plus T squared times J

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
T plus T squared plus T squared times J
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.390
T plus T squared plus T squared times J
and if I wanted to if I wanted to graph

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
and if I wanted to if I wanted to graph
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.950
and if I wanted to if I wanted to graph
this I'm going to be very careful

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
this I'm going to be very careful
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.060
this I'm going to be very careful
graphing it because I really want to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
graphing it because I really want to
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.560
graphing it because I really want to
understand what the derivative means

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
understand what the derivative means
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.240
understand what the derivative means
here let me get my draw try to draw it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
here let me get my draw try to draw it
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.499
here let me get my draw try to draw it
too roughly to scale so let's say that

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
too roughly to scale so let's say that
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.520
too roughly to scale so let's say that
this is so we get 1 2 3 4 and then let

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
this is so we get 1 2 3 4 and then let
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.240
this is so we get 1 2 3 4 and then let
me draw my x-axis that's good enough and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
me draw my x-axis that's good enough and
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.219
me draw my x-axis that's good enough and
my x-axis I want it to be roughly to

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
my x-axis I want it to be roughly to
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.770
my x-axis I want it to be roughly to
scale 1 and 2 and so at T equals 0 both

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
scale 1 and 2 and so at T equals 0 both
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.620
scale 1 and 2 and so at T equals 0 both
my x and y coordinates are at 0 or this

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
my x and y coordinates are at 0 or this
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.420
my x and y coordinates are at 0 or this
is just going to be the 0 vector so this

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
is just going to be the 0 vector so this
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.819
is just going to be the 0 vector so this
is where we are at T equals 0 at T

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
is where we are at T equals 0 at T
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.760
is where we are at T equals 0 at T
equals 1 this is going to be 1 times I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
equals 1 this is going to be 1 times I
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.800
equals 1 this is going to be 1 times I
so we're going to be just like that plus

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
so we're going to be just like that plus
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.740
so we're going to be just like that plus
1 times J right 1 squared is J so we're

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
1 times J right 1 squared is J so we're
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.309
1 times J right 1 squared is J so we're
going to be right there and then at T is

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
going to be right there and then at T is
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.520
going to be right there and then at T is
e

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
e
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.800
e
equal to two we're going to be at two I

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
equal to two we're going to be at two I
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.460
equal to two we're going to be at two I
so - I you can imagine two times I would

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470
so - I you can imagine two times I would
 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.910
so - I you can imagine two times I would
be this vector right there right two

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920
be this vector right there right two
 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.120
be this vector right there right two
times I plus 4 right 2 squared is 4 4

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130
times I plus 4 right 2 squared is 4 4
 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.490
times I plus 4 right 2 squared is 4 4
times J so plus plus this plus 4 times J

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500
times J so plus plus this plus 4 times J
 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.410
times J so plus plus this plus 4 times J
right that's 4 times J if you add these

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420
right that's 4 times J if you add these
 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.600
right that's 4 times J if you add these
two vectors heads to tails you're going

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610
two vectors heads to tails you're going
 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.660
two vectors heads to tails you're going
to get a vector that goes that endpoint

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
to get a vector that goes that endpoint
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.070
to get a vector that goes that endpoint
is right there the vector is going to

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
is right there the vector is going to
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.430
is right there the vector is going to
look something like this I don't want to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440
look something like this I don't want to
 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.490
look something like this I don't want to
so this is what just to make it clear

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500
so this is what just to make it clear
 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.180
so this is what just to make it clear
what we're doing that's our 1 of 2 right

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190
what we're doing that's our 1 of 2 right
 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.790
what we're doing that's our 1 of 2 right
this is our 1 of 0 this is our 1 of 1

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800
this is our 1 of 0 this is our 1 of 1
 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.770
this is our 1 of 0 this is our 1 of 1
but the bottom line is the path looks

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780
but the bottom line is the path looks
 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.660
but the bottom line is the path looks
like this it's a bit it's a parabola so

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670
like this it's a bit it's a parabola so
 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.850
like this it's a bit it's a parabola so
the path will look like that just like

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860
the path will look like that just like
 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.280
the path will look like that just like
that now that's in my first

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290
that now that's in my first
 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.259
that now that's in my first
parametrizations of it actually let me

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269
parametrizations of it actually let me
 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.550
parametrizations of it actually let me
draw a little bit more carefully I want

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560
draw a little bit more carefully I want
 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.020
draw a little bit more carefully I want
to get rid of this arrows just because I

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030
to get rid of this arrows just because I
 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.870
to get rid of this arrows just because I
want to be a nice clean drawing so my is

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880
want to be a nice clean drawing so my is
 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.309
want to be a nice clean drawing so my is
going to be a parabola that's that is so

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319
going to be a parabola that's that is so
 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.780
going to be a parabola that's that is so
let me get rid of that other point -

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790
let me get rid of that other point -
 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.460
let me get rid of that other point -
just because I didn't draw it exactly

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470
just because I didn't draw it exactly
 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.780
just because I didn't draw it exactly
where it needs to be it needs to be

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790
where it needs to be it needs to be
 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.810
where it needs to be it needs to be
right there and my parabola or my part

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820
right there and my parabola or my part
 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.009
right there and my parabola or my part
of my parabola is going to look

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019
of my parabola is going to look
 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.810
of my parabola is going to look
something like that

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820
something like that
 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.300
something like that
all right good enough so this is the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310
all right good enough so this is the
 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.949
all right good enough so this is the
path the first parametrizations I'm

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959
path the first parametrizations I'm
 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.150
path the first parametrizations I'm
going to do this exact same curve but

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160
going to do this exact same curve but
 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.560
going to do this exact same curve but
I'm gonna do it slightly differently so

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570
I'm gonna do it slightly differently so
 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.930
I'm gonna do it slightly differently so
let's say I'll do it in different colors

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940
let's say I'll do it in different colors
 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:43.130
let's say I'll do it in different colors
so x2 of T let's say it equals 2t + y2

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140
so x2 of T let's say it equals 2t + y2
 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.660
so x2 of T let's say it equals 2t + y2
of T let's say it's equal to 2t squared

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670
of T let's say it's equal to 2t squared
 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.720
of T let's say it's equal to 2t squared
or we could alternatively write that

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730
or we could alternatively write that
 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.080
or we could alternatively write that
that's the same thing as 4t squared just

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090
that's the same thing as 4t squared just
 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.430
that's the same thing as 4t squared just
phrasing both of these guys to the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440
phrasing both of these guys to the
 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.920
phrasing both of these guys to the
second power it's equal to 4t squared I

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930
second power it's equal to 4t squared I
 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.110
second power it's equal to 4t squared I
could write it either way and then let's

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120
could write it either way and then let's
 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.390
could write it either way and then let's
say my second parameter is age and let's

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400
say my second parameter is age and let's
 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.800
say my second parameter is age and let's
say instead of going from T equals 0 to

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810
say instead of going from T equals 0 to
 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.560
say instead of going from T equals 0 to
2 we're going to go from T goes from 0

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570
2 we're going to go from T goes from 0
 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.400
2 we're going to go from T goes from 0
to 1 T goes from 0 to 1 we're going to

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410
to 1 T goes from 0 to 1 we're going to
 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.360
to 1 T goes from 0 to 1 we're going to
see it's kind of we're going to cover

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370
see it's kind of we're going to cover
 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.449
see it's kind of we're going to cover
the exact same path and our second

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459
the exact same path and our second
 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.150
the exact same path and our second
vector of our position vector valued

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.360
vector of our position vector valued
function are 2 of T is going to be equal

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370
function are 2 of T is going to be equal
 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.350
function are 2 of T is going to be equal
to 2t times I

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360
to 2t times I
 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.719
to 2t times I
plus I can say 2t squared or 4t squared

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729
plus I can say 2t squared or 4t squared
 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.899
plus I can say 2t squared or 4t squared
times J and if I were to graph this guy

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909
times J and if I were to graph this guy
 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:36.920
times J and if I were to graph this guy
right here

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930
right here
 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.950
right here
it will look like let me draw my axes

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960
it will look like let me draw my axes
 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.429
it will look like let me draw my axes
again it's going to look the same but

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:43.439
again it's going to look the same but
 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.740
again it's going to look the same but
it's I think useful to draw it because

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750
it's I think useful to draw it because
 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.390
it's I think useful to draw it because
I'm going to draw these the derivatives

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400
I'm going to draw these the derivatives
 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.219
I'm going to draw these the derivatives
and all of that on it later so let's see

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229
and all of that on it later so let's see
 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:56.119
and all of that on it later so let's see
one two three four one two and then

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129
one two three four one two and then
 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.399
one two three four one two and then
let's see what happens when T is equal

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409
let's see what happens when T is equal
 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:04.339
let's see what happens when T is equal
to zero when T is equal to 0 or R of 0

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349
to zero when T is equal to 0 or R of 0
 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:05.719
to zero when T is equal to 0 or R of 0
this all of these are going to be 0

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729
this all of these are going to be 0
 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.490
this all of these are going to be 0
we're just got the zero vector x and y

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500
we're just got the zero vector x and y
 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.800
we're just got the zero vector x and y
are both equal to 0 when T is equal to

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810
are both equal to 0 when T is equal to
 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.350
are both equal to 0 when T is equal to
1/2 so when T is equal to 1/2 what we're

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360
1/2 so when T is equal to 1/2 what we're
 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.050
1/2 so when T is equal to 1/2 what we're
going to get here 1/2 times 2 is 1 and

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060
going to get here 1/2 times 2 is 1 and
 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.649
going to get here 1/2 times 2 is 1 and
then we're going to get the point 1/2

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659
then we're going to get the point 1/2
 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.920
then we're going to get the point 1/2
squared is 1/4 times 4 is 1 so when T is

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930
squared is 1/4 times 4 is 1 so when T is
 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.029
squared is 1/4 times 4 is 1 so when T is
equal to 1/2 we're going to be at the

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039
equal to 1/2 we're going to be at the
 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.330
equal to 1/2 we're going to be at the
point 1 1 and when then T is equal to 1

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340
point 1 1 and when then T is equal to 1
 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.339
point 1 1 and when then T is equal to 1
we're going to be the point 2 4 right 2

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349
we're going to be the point 2 4 right 2
 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.850
we're going to be the point 2 4 right 2
4 so notice the curve is exactly the

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860
4 so notice the curve is exactly the
 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.459
4 so notice the curve is exactly the
path we go is exactly the same but

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469
path we go is exactly the same but
 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:42.619
path we go is exactly the same but
before we even do the derivatives these

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:42.629
before we even do the derivatives these
 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:44.959
before we even do the derivatives these
two paths are identical I want to think

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969
two paths are identical I want to think
 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.760
two paths are identical I want to think
about something let's pretend that our

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770
about something let's pretend that our
 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.269
about something let's pretend that our
parameter T really is time that T is

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279
parameter T really is time that T is
 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:51.950
parameter T really is time that T is
equal to time and that tends to be the

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960
equal to time and that tends to be the
 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.279
equal to time and that tends to be the
most common that's why they call it T it

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289
most common that's why they call it T it
 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:56.959
most common that's why they call it T it
doesn't have to be time but let's say it

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:56.969
doesn't have to be time but let's say it
 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.749
doesn't have to be time but let's say it
is time so what's happening here in this

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759
is time so what's happening here in this
 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.329
is time so what's happening here in this
first parametrizations when we go from 0

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:02.339
first parametrizations when we go from 0
 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:05.659
first parametrizations when we go from 0
to 2 seconds we cover this path right

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669
to 2 seconds we cover this path right
 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.369
to 2 seconds we cover this path right
you can imagine after 1 second the dot

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379
you can imagine after 1 second the dot
 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:08.689
you can imagine after 1 second the dot
moves here then it moves there you can

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699
moves here then it moves there you can
 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.129
moves here then it moves there you can
imagine a dot moving along this curve

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139
imagine a dot moving along this curve
 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.379
imagine a dot moving along this curve
and it takes 2 seconds to do so in this

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389
and it takes 2 seconds to do so in this
 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.629
and it takes 2 seconds to do so in this
situation we have a dot moving along the

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639
situation we have a dot moving along the
 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.760
situation we have a dot moving along the
same curve but it's able to cover the

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770
same curve but it's able to cover the
 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.430
same curve but it's able to cover the
same curve and only one second and half

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440
same curve and only one second and half
 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.379
same curve and only one second and half
a second it gets here it took this guy 1

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389
a second it gets here it took this guy 1
 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.420
a second it gets here it took this guy 1
second to get here in 1 second this

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430
second to get here in 1 second this
 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.769
second to get here in 1 second this
guy's all the way over here this guy

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:24.779
guy's all the way over here this guy
 

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:26.930
guy's all the way over here this guy
takes 2 seconds to go over here so in

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940
takes 2 seconds to go over here so in
 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.850
takes 2 seconds to go over here so in
this second parametrizations even though

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860
this second parametrizations even though
 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.159
this second parametrizations even though
the path is the same the curves are the

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169
the path is the same the curves are the
 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.649
the path is the same the curves are the
same the dot is faster dot is faster and

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659
same the dot is faster dot is faster and
 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.019
same the dot is faster dot is faster and
i want you to keep that in mind when we

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:39.029
i want you to keep that in mind when we
 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:40.220
i want you to keep that in mind when we
think about the

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230
think about the
 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.500
think about the
Rivet of both of these position

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510
Rivet of both of these position
 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.140
Rivet of both of these position
vector-valued functions so just remember

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150
vector-valued functions so just remember
 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.480
vector-valued functions so just remember
the dot is moving faster for every

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490
the dot is moving faster for every
 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.220
the dot is moving faster for every
second it's getting it's getting further

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230
second it's getting it's getting further
 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.540
second it's getting it's getting further
along the curve than here that's what

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550
along the curve than here that's what
 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.190
along the curve than here that's what
I'm I took them one second now let's

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200
I'm I took them one second now let's
 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.660
I'm I took them one second now let's
look at the derivatives of both of these

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670
look at the derivatives of both of these
 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.100
look at the derivatives of both of these
guys so the derivative here so if I were

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110
guys so the derivative here so if I were
 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.650
guys so the derivative here so if I were
to write R prime R prime R one prime of

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660
to write R prime R prime R one prime of
 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.850
to write R prime R prime R one prime of
T let me do it in a different color

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860
T let me do it in a different color
 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.060
T let me do it in a different color
actually or you use the orange so let me

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070
actually or you use the orange so let me
 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:14.210
actually or you use the orange so let me
do it in a blue R 1 prime of T so this

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220
do it in a blue R 1 prime of T so this
 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.250
do it in a blue R 1 prime of T so this
is the derivative now is going to be

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.260
is the derivative now is going to be
 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.210
is the derivative now is going to be
remember it's just the derivative of

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220
remember it's just the derivative of
 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.160
remember it's just the derivative of
each of these times the unit vectors so

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.170
each of these times the unit vectors so
 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.740
each of these times the unit vectors so
the derivative of of T with respect to T

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750
the derivative of of T with respect to T
 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.080
the derivative of of T with respect to T
that's just 1 so it's 1 times I so I'll

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090
that's just 1 so it's 1 times I so I'll
 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.470
that's just 1 so it's 1 times I so I'll
just write one I plus I didn't have to

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:27.480
just write one I plus I didn't have to
 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.050
just write one I plus I didn't have to
write the 1 there plus the derivative of

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060
write the 1 there plus the derivative of
 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.790
write the 1 there plus the derivative of
T squared with respect to T is 2t plus

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800
T squared with respect to T is 2t plus
 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.790
T squared with respect to T is 2t plus
2t J and let me take the derivative over

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800
2t J and let me take the derivative over
 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.460
2t J and let me take the derivative over
here R 2 prime of T the derivative of 2t

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:43.470
here R 2 prime of T the derivative of 2t
 

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.120
here R 2 prime of T the derivative of 2t
with respect to T is 2 so 2i plus the

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.130
with respect to T is 2 so 2i plus the
 

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.110
with respect to T is 2 so 2i plus the
derivative of 4t squared is 8 T right 2

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120
derivative of 4t squared is 8 T right 2
 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:59.930
derivative of 4t squared is 8 T right 2
times 4 it is it is 8 t 8 t just like

00:07:59.930 --> 00:07:59.940
times 4 it is it is 8 t 8 t just like
 

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.990
times 4 it is it is 8 t 8 t just like
that just like that now the question is

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000
that just like that now the question is
 

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.150
that just like that now the question is
what do their what do their respective

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160
what do their what do their respective
 

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.480
what do their what do their respective
of derivative vectors look like at

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:11.490
of derivative vectors look like at
 

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.770
of derivative vectors look like at
different points so let's look at I

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.780
different points so let's look at I
 

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.390
different points so let's look at I
don't know let's see let's see how fast

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400
don't know let's see let's see how fast
 

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.970
don't know let's see let's see how fast
they're moving when time is equal to 1

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:16.980
they're moving when time is equal to 1
 

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.580
they're moving when time is equal to 1
so let's take let's take it a specific

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:19.590
so let's take let's take it a specific
 

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.440
so let's take let's take it a specific
point this is just the general formula

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:21.450
point this is just the general formula
 

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.240
point this is just the general formula
but let's take it let's figure out what

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:23.250
but let's take it let's figure out what
 

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.250
but let's take it let's figure out what
the derivative is at a specific point so

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:25.260
the derivative is at a specific point so
 

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.260
the derivative is at a specific point so
let's take our 1 when time is equal to

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:29.270
let's take our 1 when time is equal to
 

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.610
let's take our 1 when time is equal to
when time is equal to 1 and I want to

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620
when time is equal to 1 and I want to
 

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.280
when time is equal to 1 and I want to
take the specific point on the curve not

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:34.290
take the specific point on the curve not
 

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:37.219
take the specific point on the curve not
the specific point in time so this point

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:37.229
the specific point in time so this point
 

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:38.630
the specific point in time so this point
on the curve here is when time is equal

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640
on the curve here is when time is equal
 

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.510
on the curve here is when time is equal
to 1 you could say second this point

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.520
to 1 you could say second this point
 

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.560
to 1 you could say second this point
over here which is the exact

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:42.570
over here which is the exact
 

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.030
over here which is the exact
corresponding point is when time is

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.040
corresponding point is when time is
 

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:49.070
corresponding point is when time is
equal to 1/2 second so R 1 of 1 is equal

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080
equal to 1/2 second so R 1 of 1 is equal
 

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.140
equal to 1/2 second so R 1 of 1 is equal
to I'm taking the derivative there is

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.150
to I'm taking the derivative there is
 

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.500
to I'm taking the derivative there is
equal to 1 i right it's not

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:53.510
equal to 1 i right it's not
 

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:59.170
equal to 1 i right it's not
t at all so it's 1 I plus 2 times 1 J so

00:08:59.170 --> 00:08:59.180
t at all so it's 1 I plus 2 times 1 J so
 

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:04.330
t at all so it's 1 I plus 2 times 1 J so
plus 2 J so at this point the derivative

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:04.340
plus 2 J so at this point the derivative
 

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.330
plus 2 J so at this point the derivative
of or the derivative of our position

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:07.340
of or the derivative of our position
 

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.510
of or the derivative of our position
vector function is going to be 1 I plus

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:10.520
vector function is going to be 1 I plus
 

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.730
vector function is going to be 1 I plus
2 J so we can draw it like this so if we

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:12.740
2 J so we can draw it like this so if we
 

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.270
2 J so we can draw it like this so if we
do 1 I is like this one eye and then 2 J

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:16.280
do 1 I is like this one eye and then 2 J
 

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.140
do 1 I is like this one eye and then 2 J
just 2 J is like that so our derivative

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:20.150
just 2 J is like that so our derivative
 

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.330
just 2 J is like that so our derivative
right there I'll do it in the same color

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:22.340
right there I'll do it in the same color
 

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.770
right there I'll do it in the same color
that I wrote it in is in this green

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:23.780
that I wrote it in is in this green
 

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.200
that I wrote it in is in this green
color it's going to look like this it's

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.210
color it's going to look like this it's
 

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.900
color it's going to look like this it's
going to look like that and notice it

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:28.910
going to look like that and notice it
 

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.180
going to look like that and notice it
looks like at least its direction is let

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:31.190
looks like at least its direction is let
 

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.920
looks like at least its direction is let
me do it a little bit straighter its

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:32.930
me do it a little bit straighter its
 

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.580
me do it a little bit straighter its
direction that's not it

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:36.590
direction that's not it
 

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.240
direction that's not it
its direction looks tangent to the curve

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:40.250
its direction looks tangent to the curve
 

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.890
its direction looks tangent to the curve
it's going in the direction that my

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:41.900
it's going in the direction that my
 

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.360
it's going in the direction that my
particle is moving where my particle is

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:43.370
particle is moving where my particle is
 

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.440
particle is moving where my particle is
going from here to there so it's going

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:44.450
going from here to there so it's going
 

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.970
going from here to there so it's going
in the direction and I'm going to think

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:45.980
in the direction and I'm going to think
 

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.590
in the direction and I'm going to think
about in a second what this length of

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600
about in a second what this length of
 

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.020
about in a second what this length of
this derivative vector is this right

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.030
this derivative vector is this right
 

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.890
this derivative vector is this right
here just to be clear is our one prime

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:53.900
here just to be clear is our one prime
 

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.530
here just to be clear is our one prime
it's a vector so it's the it's it's

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:56.540
it's a vector so it's the it's it's
 

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.990
it's a vector so it's the it's it's
telling us the instantaneous change in

00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.000
telling us the instantaneous change in
 

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.050
telling us the instantaneous change in
our position vector with respect to T or

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:02.060
our position vector with respect to T or
 

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.990
our position vector with respect to T or
time when time is equal to one second

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.000
time when time is equal to one second
 

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.790
time when time is equal to one second
that's this thing right here now let's

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800
that's this thing right here now let's
 

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.070
that's this thing right here now let's
take the exact same position here on our

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:09.080
take the exact same position here on our
 

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.420
take the exact same position here on our
curve but that's going to create a

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:10.430
curve but that's going to create a
 

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:11.710
curve but that's going to create a
different time for this guy we already

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720
different time for this guy we already
 

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.990
different time for this guy we already
said it only takes him he's here at time

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000
said it only takes him he's here at time
 

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.900
said it only takes him he's here at time
is equal to 1/2 second so let's take

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:15.910
is equal to 1/2 second so let's take
 

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.270
is equal to 1/2 second so let's take
let's take let me do it in a locket in

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:19.280
let's take let me do it in a locket in
 

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.320
let's take let me do it in a locket in
the same color so here we have r2 r2

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:23.330
the same color so here we have r2 r2
 

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.660
the same color so here we have r2 r2
we're going to evaluate at 1/2 because

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:25.670
we're going to evaluate at 1/2 because
 

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.580
we're going to evaluate at 1/2 because
it is that time is equal to 1/2 seconds

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:27.590
it is that time is equal to 1/2 seconds
 

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.950
it is that time is equal to 1/2 seconds
and this is going to be equal to 2i this

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:29.960
and this is going to be equal to 2i this
 

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.720
and this is going to be equal to 2i this
isn't dependent at all on time so 2i

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:33.730
isn't dependent at all on time so 2i
 

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.030
isn't dependent at all on time so 2i
plus 8 times the time so we're eight

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040
plus 8 times the time so we're eight
 

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.610
plus 8 times the time so we're eight
time right here is 1/2 so 8 times 1/2 is

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:39.620
time right here is 1/2 so 8 times 1/2 is
 

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.710
time right here is 1/2 so 8 times 1/2 is
4 so plus 4j so what does this look like

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720
4 so plus 4j so what does this look like
 

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.390
4 so plus 4j so what does this look like
the instantaneous derivative here oh and

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:46.400
the instantaneous derivative here oh and
 

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.830
the instantaneous derivative here oh and
this is the derivative you have to be

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:47.840
this is the derivative you have to be
 

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.140
this is the derivative you have to be
very clear so 2i that's let me draw some

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:50.150
very clear so 2i that's let me draw some
 

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.860
very clear so 2i that's let me draw some
more so to I maybe gets it's about that

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:53.870
more so to I maybe gets it's about that
 

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.210
more so to I maybe gets it's about that
far plus 4j will get us up to right

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:58.220
far plus 4j will get us up to right
 

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.960
far plus 4j will get us up to right
around there plus 4j is that vector so

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:01.970
around there plus 4j is that vector so
 

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.660
around there plus 4j is that vector so
you add those two heads to tails you get

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:04.670
you add those two heads to tails you get
 

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.310
you add those two heads to tails you get
this thing you get something

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320
this thing you get something
 

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.189
this thing you get something
let me let me do it like you get

00:11:10.189 --> 00:11:10.199
let me let me do it like you get
 

00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:14.240
let me let me do it like you get
something that looks like that something

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:14.250
something that looks like that something
 

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.340
something that looks like that something
that looks like that I didn't draw it as

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:16.350
that looks like that I didn't draw it as
 

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.499
that looks like that I didn't draw it as
neatly as I would like to but let's

00:11:18.499 --> 00:11:18.509
neatly as I would like to but let's
 

00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:21.410
neatly as I would like to but let's
notice something both of these vectors

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420
notice something both of these vectors
 

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.569
notice something both of these vectors
are going in the exact same direction

00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579
are going in the exact same direction
 

00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:27.259
are going in the exact same direction
they're both tangential to the path to

00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:27.269
they're both tangential to the path to
 

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:30.800
they're both tangential to the path to
our curve but this vector is going is

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:30.810
our curve but this vector is going is
 

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.189
our curve but this vector is going is
its length its magnitude is much larger

00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:34.199
its length its magnitude is much larger
 

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:35.990
its length its magnitude is much larger
than this little vectors magnitude and

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000
than this little vectors magnitude and
 

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.030
than this little vectors magnitude and
that makes sense because I hinted at it

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040
that makes sense because I hinted at it
 

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.680
that makes sense because I hinted at it
when we first talked about these vector

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:39.690
when we first talked about these vector
 

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:41.059
when we first talked about these vector
valued position functions and their

00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:41.069
valued position functions and their
 

00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:43.939
valued position functions and their
derivatives is that the length the

00:11:43.939 --> 00:11:43.949
derivatives is that the length the
 

00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:47.150
derivatives is that the length the
length you can kind of view it as the

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160
length you can kind of view it as the
 

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.910
length you can kind of view it as the
speed the length is equal to the speed

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920
speed the length is equal to the speed
 

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.059
speed the length is equal to the speed
if you imagine time T being time and

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:53.069
if you imagine time T being time and
 

00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:55.490
if you imagine time T being time and
this parametrizations are representing a

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.500
this parametrizations are representing a
 

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.800
this parametrizations are representing a
dot moving along these curves so in this

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:57.810
dot moving along these curves so in this
 

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.840
dot moving along these curves so in this
case the particle only takes a second to

00:11:59.840 --> 00:11:59.850
case the particle only takes a second to
 

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.400
case the particle only takes a second to
go there so at this point in its path

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:01.410
go there so at this point in its path
 

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.800
go there so at this point in its path
it's moving much faster then this

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:03.810
it's moving much faster then this
 

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.930
it's moving much faster then this
particle is so if you think about it

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:05.940
particle is so if you think about it
 

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.720
particle is so if you think about it
this vector right here if you imagine

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:08.730
this vector right here if you imagine
 

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.269
this vector right here if you imagine
this is a position vector this is

00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279
this is a position vector this is
 

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:12.009
this is a position vector this is
velocity

00:12:12.009 --> 00:12:12.019
velocity
 

00:12:12.019 --> 00:12:14.900
velocity
this right here is velocity right

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:14.910
this right here is velocity right
 

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.620
this right here is velocity right
velocity is a speed plus direction speed

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:18.630
velocity is a speed plus direction speed
 

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.300
velocity is a speed plus direction speed
is just you know how fast are you going

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:20.310
is just you know how fast are you going
 

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.009
is just you know how fast are you going
velocity is how fast you're going in

00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019
velocity is how fast you're going in
 

00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:24.740
velocity is how fast you're going in
what direction I'm going this fast in

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:24.750
what direction I'm going this fast in
 

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.329
what direction I'm going this fast in
and you could calculate it using

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339
and you could calculate it using
 

00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:27.620
and you could calculate it using
Pythagorean theorem but I just want to

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:27.630
Pythagorean theorem but I just want to
 

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.879
Pythagorean theorem but I just want to
give you the intuition right here I'm

00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:28.889
give you the intuition right here I'm
 

00:12:28.889 --> 00:12:31.639
give you the intuition right here I'm
going that fast in this direction here

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:31.649
going that fast in this direction here
 

00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:33.350
going that fast in this direction here
I'm going this fast I'm going even

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360
I'm going this fast I'm going even
 

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.750
I'm going this fast I'm going even
faster that's my magnitude but I'm still

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760
faster that's my magnitude but I'm still
 

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.150
faster that's my magnitude but I'm still
going in the same direction so hopefully

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160
going in the same direction so hopefully
 

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.040
going in the same direction so hopefully
you have a gut feeling now of what the

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.050
you have a gut feeling now of what the
 

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.350
you have a gut feeling now of what the
derivative of these position vectors

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360
derivative of these position vectors
 

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.290
derivative of these position vectors
really are
