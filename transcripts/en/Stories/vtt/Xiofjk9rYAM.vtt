JONATAN SHAYA: My mom actually
told me about this new project

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.770
that she heard from
a friend of hers.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.787
So I went to my computer, and I
started writing an application.

00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:14.370
EMIL BOSTROM: It's
almost like a dorm,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.650
but the people aren't young.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.900
They're old.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.260
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.890
MIKI MIELONEN: In
Finnish culture,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.530
young people all pretty much
move out when they are 18.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.820
But now, they are not going
to get their independence,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.050
because they don't have money
to move out in Helsinki if they

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.180
want to live here.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.630
The prices are very, very high.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.960
Our project is called
A Home That Fits.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.740
This is one solution, for youth
homeless problem in Helsinki.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.120
EMIL BOSTROM: The application
process was quite long,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.860
because there was, I think, a
little bit over 300 applicants.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.980
I was really ecstatic, because
basically, I was homeless.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.684
Not on the street, but homeless.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.310

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:26.350
JONATAN SHAYA: In
a normal apartment,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.320
it's like the neighbors
don't exactly talk to you.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.580
Because Finnish people are--
I don't know-- kind of shy.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.800
Here, they were very welcoming.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.030
I had this really
heartwarming feeling

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.510
that it's good to be here.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.470
I went to my neighbor.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.160
I was actually baking
some sweet buns.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.840
So I baked for her.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.220
And she was like, oh, welcome.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.820
Come in.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.060
And we talked, and
we drank coffee.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.330

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.980
EMIL BOSTROM: The gap between
young people and the old

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.060
isn't that big that
we can't be friends

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.340
and can't interact
and get along.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.720
So I guess in the
bigger picture,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.530
we can show the
rest of the world,

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.340
and especially Finland,
that this is a good thing,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.180
and it's worth investing in,
and that both young people

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.700
and old people can benefit
from something like this.

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:46.130
NARRATOR: Please check
out this next video.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.714
MAN: We were sort of like, well,
we pulled off this weird trick.

00:02:49.714 --> 00:02:51.130
How many other
places could we get

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.720
into if we started doing this?

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.149
It's very enjoyable to
appreciate the world around you

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:56.690
and to have the
opportunity to do so.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.750
