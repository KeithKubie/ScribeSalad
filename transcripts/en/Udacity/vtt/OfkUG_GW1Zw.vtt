00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.380
Congratulations, you just finished your first lesson. Following the lesson is

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.620
going to be a problem set, where you answer questions based on what you've

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.325
learned so far. Now, this is going to be the format for every lesson to come.

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:15.200
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So if you're ready, go back to the problem set for lesson one and answer each

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.160
question. If you get stuck, go back to the lesson. Or, to the forum, where you

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.780
can then interact with your peers or with us.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.930
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; After you finish a problem set for lesson one, you're ready to move on to

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.430
lesson two. Where we're going to look at how psychologists conduct experiments

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.880
to learn more about human thought and behavior. Now it's important for the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.560
remainder of the course that you notes while you're watching the lessons. In

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.840
addition, be sure to check the instructor's note section, which is here, to get

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.680
other valuable information that's contained in each lesson. And we'll see you

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.236
in lesson 2.
