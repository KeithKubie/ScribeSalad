00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.930
- What we're gonna do
in this video is talk

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.300
about the terms judicial
activism and judicial restraint.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.600
In many videos, we have talked

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.420
about how the judicial branch,
one of its main powers,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.490
is to be a check on the
executive and legislative branch,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.230
that it can exercise
judicial review over them.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.800
It can say that a legislative
action, that a law,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.920
that a statute is unconstitutional.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.340
It can say that an executive action,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.680
say a rule or regulation
or an executive order,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.760
is unconstitutional,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.270
but as it's doing that,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.890
as it's exercising its judicial review,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.710
how does it go about doing that?

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.330
And this term judicial
activism was first introduced

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.490
by Arthur Schlesinger,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.140
who we've talked about in other videos,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.810
and it's meant to imply a judiciary

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.950
that is not strictly just ruling based

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.470
on maybe what the Constitution says

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.440
but also their own personal ideas.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.760
So personal views.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.820
It sometimes has an implication

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.710
that the judges are
overreaching in some way.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.970
Some people might say, and
this would be a little bit

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.780
of a negative, "legislating
from the bench."

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.780
Legislating from the bench,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.190
and you'll often hear is that,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.930
"Hey, that judge or that
court is legislating

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.270
"from the bench," from the people

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.630
who don't like their ruling.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.030
They're saying, "Hey,
they're not strictly looking

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.863
"at the law.

00:01:23.863 --> 00:01:25.710
"They're trying to make their own laws

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710
"through their rulings."

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.810
Now some would say that it's necessary

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.900
for the judicial to do this

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.950
because they are
interpreting the Constitution

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.730
in the world as it is,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.620
and the world that we
are in changes over time.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.310
So it is really a form
of positive activism,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.760
that they are defending liberties,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.910
that they are defending rights,

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.970
especially in the social
context that we're in.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.450
I'll leave you to decide

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.770
whether you think this
is a good idea or not.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.000
Now judicial restraint
is the opposite of it.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.720
This is a situation where the judges

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.565
or the courts limit their power,

00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:06.160
so limit their own power,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.700
their own power,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.533
where they say,

00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:12.730
"Hey, look, our job is to just
be the umpire or the referee.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.750
"Our job is not to make new rules,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.470
"and so we are just
going to strictly think

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.810
"about whether something is constitutional

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.420
"or whether it is not,"

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.160
and one of the most seminal cases

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.230
on judicial activism versus
judicial restraint happened

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.060
in the early 1960s,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.040
and that is the case of Baker versus Carr,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.650
and so what happens is is
that Baker is a resident

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.580
of Shelby County, Tennessee.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.620
He was actually of the former
mayor of a town outside

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.170
of Memphis, which is in
this area right over here,

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.250
and he says that,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.260
"Look, the state is not reapportioning

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.640
"its legislative districts
the way it should be,"

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.550
that in general every 10
years there is a census,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.700
and based on that, we
have been understanding

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.250
of where the population sits,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.950
and then the state should be
reapportioning districts based

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.130
on population,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.270
but what Baker argued is is that the state

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.100
of Tennessee actually did
not redistrict since 1901,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.450
after the census of 1900,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.330
and it was now the early 1960s,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.970
and he says because of that,

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.090
and he invoked the 14th amendment,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.680
you weren't getting equal protection,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.500
that people in his county

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.540
that had gotten increasingly urban

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.490
and had gotten increasingly
dense over the course

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.820
of those 60 years,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.670
that they were getting
the same representation

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.900
despite having a larger
population than some

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.100
of the rural areas where
they have a lower population

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.140
and had the same number
of representatives,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.690
and so he takes this case
against the Secretary of State

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.730
of Tennessee at the time, who was Carr,

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.140
and it eventually gets
to the Supreme Court,

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.950
and the essential question
in Baker versus Carr is

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.970
whether the courts even have jurisdiction

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.200
over legislative districting

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.480
because the districting was a power

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.920
of the state legislature in
Tennessee, and in this case,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.480
the United States Supreme
Court actually did vote

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.700
in favor of Baker.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.930
So not only did they say that
Baker was right in asking

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.230
for this redistricting,

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.200
it had huge implications in saying that,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.170
yes, courts, like the
United States Supreme Court,

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.700
do have jurisdiction over something

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.120
that was officially a legislative duty,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.820
telling the legislative that,

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.680
"Look, you've got to do this 'cause

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.220
"by not doing this action,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.470
"by exercising your discretion there,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.160
"you might not be
allowing everyone to have

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.250
"equal protection."

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.290
Many have argued, including
the two dissenters

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.270
to the opinion that this was
a form of judicial activism.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.050
It increased the power of the judiciary,

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.380
and to appreciate the view

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.610
of the United States Supreme Court

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.420
that they do have jurisdiction

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.530
over legislative districting, here is part

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.530
of Associate Justice
Douglas's concurring opinion.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.670
"Where the performance of a
duty is left to the discretion

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.400
"and good judgment of
an executive officer,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.350
"the judiciary will
not compel the exercise

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.090
"of his discretion one way or the other...

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.110
"for to do so would be to
take over the office...."

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.820
So he's saying, look,
when it is someone's job

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.270
where there's an executive
officer to do this duty,

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.930
then the courts should not
have jurisdiction there,

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.900
but then he goes on to write,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.010
"There is no doubt that the
federal courts have jurisdiction

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.700
"of controversies
concerning voting rights.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.730
"The Civil Rights Act gives them authority

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.180
"to redress the deprivation
under color of any state law

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.260
"of any right, privilege
or immunity secured

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.580
"by the Constitution of the United States

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.720
"or by any Act of Congress providing

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.590
"for equal rights of citizens...."

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.940
Really saying that, look,
if the court can see

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.730
that some right is being violated,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.120
some right is described in
any under the state law,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.150
under the United States Constitution,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.870
then the courts do have jurisdiction.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.850
"The right to vote in both federal

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.800
"and state elections was protected

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.010
"by the judiciary long
before that right received

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.230
"the explicit protection
it is now accorded."

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.160
So he's saying, look, even
before the Civil Rights Act,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.770
even before the 14th amendment,
that this was something

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.270
that was part of the
charter of the judiciary,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.860
part of the federal court
system, and so it does lean

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.070
in favor of judicial activism

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.650
because you can imagine courts,

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.150
and they have cited Baker versus Carr

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.830
since the 1960s repeatedly
as reason, saying, hey look,

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.230
we're trying to protect people's rights,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.900
and people have a right to do X, Y, or Z,

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.450
even if it hasn't been
explicitly legislated.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.430
Now there were two dissenters,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.690
and this is what the dissenters wrote.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.130
"The courts authority--possessed
of neither of the purse

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.300
"nor the sword..."

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.920
So here, the purse, that's
the legislative branch

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.410
that can think about budgets

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.480
or the sword, that's the executive branch.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.460
The president's the commander in chief.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.000
"Ultimately rests on
sustained public confidence

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.060
"in its moral sanction."

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.893
Let me underline that.

00:06:57.893 --> 00:07:02.460
"On sustained public confidence
in its moral sanction.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.880
"Such feeling must be nourished

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.880
"by the Court's complete detachment,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.170
"in fact and in appearance,

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.120
"from political entanglement
and by abstention

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.690
"from injecting itself into the clash

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.110
"of political forces in
political settlements."

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.060
So here, Associate Justice Frankfurter,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.990
in his dissenting opinion, is saying,

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.440
look, we should stay out of this,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.840
that not only is it not our
part to rule here, to say that,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.610
hey look, the legislative needs to do

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.230
this redistricting again.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.930
He's saying that it actually
undermines the credibility

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.330
of the court, that the credibility

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.490
"ultimately rests on
sustained public confidence

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.790
"in its moral sanction,"

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.370
and that by ruling in favor of Baker

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.750
the court was overstepping
of these bounds,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.583
that people would say,

00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:51.660
hey, you're starting to
legislate from the bench.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.410
You're trying to get
involved in the political,

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.200
even though the court is supposed to stay

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.360
above the fray of the political,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.790
or another way to think about this is

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.200
that Associate Justice
Frankfurter subscribed to the idea

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.940
of judicial restraint and felt
that the other six justices

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.930
that were voting in favor
of Baker were practicing

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.350
to some degree judicial activism.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.800
They were getting into the territory

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.040
of the other branches of government.
