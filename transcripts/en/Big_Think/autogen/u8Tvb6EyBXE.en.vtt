in dating and 19th century and for a
 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.300
in dating and 19th century and for a
while so there were quite a few studies

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310
while so there were quite a few studies
 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.519
while so there were quite a few studies
in the beginning of the 20th century we

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529
in the beginning of the 20th century we
 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.680
in the beginning of the 20th century we
are talking about twenties in the

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690
are talking about twenties in the
 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.019
are talking about twenties in the
thirties by psychologists finding very

very little evidence for the accuracy of

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910
very little evidence for the accuracy of
 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.960
very little evidence for the accuracy of
genomic inferences and recently there

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970
genomic inferences and recently there
 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.410
genomic inferences and recently there
was for example a computer science paper

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420
was for example a computer science paper
 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.840
was for example a computer science paper
claiming that presumably you can guess

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850
claiming that presumably you can guess
 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.880
claiming that presumably you can guess
whether a person is a criminal or not

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890
whether a person is a criminal or not
 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.580
whether a person is a criminal or not
based on their facial image and actually

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590
based on their facial image and actually
 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.190
based on their facial image and actually
the history of identifying the criminal

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200
the history of identifying the criminal
 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.910
the history of identifying the criminal
has a very very long history in

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920
has a very very long history in
 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.459
has a very very long history in
physiology there's lots of lots of

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469
physiology there's lots of lots of
 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.410
physiology there's lots of lots of
studies showing effects of appearance

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420
studies showing effects of appearance
 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.179
studies showing effects of appearance
across different domains in my own lab

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:03.189
across different domains in my own lab
 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:06.430
across different domains in my own lab
more than 10 years ago we show that you

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440
more than 10 years ago we show that you
 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.710
more than 10 years ago we show that you
can predict electoral success based on

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720
can predict electoral success based on
 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.090
can predict electoral success based on
judgment from the appearance of

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100
judgment from the appearance of
 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.039
judgment from the appearance of
politicians then there have been many

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049
politicians then there have been many
 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.039
politicians then there have been many
other studies in the legal domain so for

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049
other studies in the legal domain so for
 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.760
other studies in the legal domain so for
example a recent studies show that

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770
example a recent studies show that
 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.320
example a recent studies show that
prisoners who are sentenced to death for

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330
prisoners who are sentenced to death for
 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.060
prisoners who are sentenced to death for
the same crime as those who were

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070
the same crime as those who were
 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.260
the same crime as those who were
sentenced to a life sentence without

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270
sentenced to a life sentence without
 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.950
sentenced to a life sentence without
parole

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960
parole
 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.020
parole
the main difference was the prisoners

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030
the main difference was the prisoners
 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.580
the main difference was the prisoners
were sentenced to death look less

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590
were sentenced to death look less
 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.890
were sentenced to death look less
trustworthy there's been a lot of

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900
trustworthy there's been a lot of
 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.649
trustworthy there's been a lot of
evidence in economic game so for example

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659
evidence in economic game so for example
 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.289
evidence in economic game so for example
economists love this sort of economic

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299
economists love this sort of economic
 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.539
economists love this sort of economic
games where we have any interactions and

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549
games where we have any interactions and
 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.670
games where we have any interactions and
if I don't know anything about you I

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680
if I don't know anything about you I
 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.310
if I don't know anything about you I
have a risky choice whether to invest in

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320
have a risky choice whether to invest in
 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.230
have a risky choice whether to invest in
you or not if I invest in you're

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240
you or not if I invest in you're
 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.010
you or not if I invest in you're
trustworthy then we are both better off

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020
trustworthy then we are both better off
 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.630
trustworthy then we are both better off
but if you entrust work you can take

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640
but if you entrust work you can take
 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.270
but if you entrust work you can take
away my money and run away so it's it

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280
away my money and run away so it's it
 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.179
away my money and run away so it's it
creates this risky situation and in many

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189
creates this risky situation and in many
 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.810
creates this risky situation and in many
studies suggests that in fact if we

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820
studies suggests that in fact if we
 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.880
studies suggests that in fact if we
think if the appearance of the other

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890
think if the appearance of the other
 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.659
think if the appearance of the other
person is untrustworthy we tend not to

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:10.669
person is untrustworthy we tend not to
 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.959
person is untrustworthy we tend not to
invest in these people interestingly

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969
invest in these people interestingly
 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.780
invest in these people interestingly
there was a star

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790
there was a star
 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.729
there was a star
that was done in in Germany in

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739
that was done in in Germany in
 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.589
that was done in in Germany in
Switzerland when in fact people plate

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599
Switzerland when in fact people plate
 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.250
Switzerland when in fact people plate
anonymously and they also did different

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260
anonymously and they also did different
 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.920
anonymously and they also did different
measurements of the faces turns out the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
measurements of the faces turns out the
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.630
measurements of the faces turns out the
dis measurements that are supposed to

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640
dis measurements that are supposed to
 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.670
dis measurements that are supposed to
predict untrustworthiness or

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
predict untrustworthiness or
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.490
predict untrustworthiness or
aggressiveness didn't predict at all how

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500
aggressiveness didn't predict at all how
 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.720
aggressiveness didn't predict at all how
how people will behave in this kind of a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730
how people will behave in this kind of a
 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.479
how people will behave in this kind of a
anonymous economic game and the

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489
anonymous economic game and the
 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.770
anonymous economic game and the
interesting part is that these

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780
interesting part is that these
 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.660
interesting part is that these
participants they when some device for

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670
participants they when some device for
 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.780
participants they when some device for
accurate responses and so for every

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790
accurate responses and so for every
 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.190
accurate responses and so for every
accurate response they were supposed

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200
accurate response they were supposed
 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.349
accurate response they were supposed
essentially trying to predict what the

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359
essentially trying to predict what the
 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.770
essentially trying to predict what the
person did in the situation they ended

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
person did in the situation they ended
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.229
person did in the situation they ended
up losing money because they were

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239
up losing money because they were
 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.229
up losing money because they were
relying on this kind of appearance but

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239
relying on this kind of appearance but
 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.409
relying on this kind of appearance but
you can see how in a real-life situation

00:02:59.409 --> 00:02:59.419
you can see how in a real-life situation
 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.339
you can see how in a real-life situation
you can have all kinds of

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349
you can have all kinds of
 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.610
you can have all kinds of
self-fulfilling prophecies so we come

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620
self-fulfilling prophecies so we come
 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.909
self-fulfilling prophecies so we come
and play with you in a game I decided

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919
and play with you in a game I decided
 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.140
and play with you in a game I decided
for some reason that you are

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150
for some reason that you are
 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.309
for some reason that you are
untrustworthy

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319
untrustworthy
 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.000
untrustworthy
so my first move is not cooperative move

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010
so my first move is not cooperative move
 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.440
so my first move is not cooperative move
well you reciprocate in a similar way I

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450
well you reciprocate in a similar way I
 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.750
well you reciprocate in a similar way I
don't trust you so why would you trust

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760
don't trust you so why would you trust
 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.149
don't trust you so why would you trust
me and that kind of leads to a

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159
me and that kind of leads to a
 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.670
me and that kind of leads to a
self-fulfilling prophecy so you can

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680
self-fulfilling prophecy so you can
 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.140
self-fulfilling prophecy so you can
create these kinds of dynamic dynamic

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150
create these kinds of dynamic dynamic
 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.210
create these kinds of dynamic dynamic
inconsistency in the situation where in

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220
inconsistency in the situation where in
 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.979
inconsistency in the situation where in
fact the people could be perfectly trust

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989
fact the people could be perfectly trust
 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.990
fact the people could be perfectly trust
working might cooperate but the

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000
working might cooperate but the
 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.539
working might cooperate but the
appearance cues can get into the way now

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549
appearance cues can get into the way now
 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.069
appearance cues can get into the way now
to the extent that you agree in these

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079
to the extent that you agree in these
 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.409
to the extent that you agree in these
impressions an important empirical

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419
impressions an important empirical
 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.899
impressions an important empirical
question is well what is the way

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909
question is well what is the way
 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.869
question is well what is the way
disagreement coming from and so in the

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879
disagreement coming from and so in the
 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.539
disagreement coming from and so in the
past decades we have built mathematical

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549
past decades we have built mathematical
 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.369
past decades we have built mathematical
models and other groups have built their

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379
models and other groups have built their
 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.800
models and other groups have built their
own models that essentially are trying

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810
own models that essentially are trying
 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.140
own models that essentially are trying
to discover the queues the people are

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150
to discover the queues the people are
 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.349
to discover the queues the people are
using when they form these impressions

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359
using when they form these impressions
 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.000
using when they form these impressions
so what kinds of queues you can observe

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010
so what kinds of queues you can observe
 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.740
so what kinds of queues you can observe
well when you're designing whether

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750
well when you're designing whether
 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.439
well when you're designing whether
somebody's trust work you're not one of

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449
somebody's trust work you're not one of
 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.469
somebody's trust work you're not one of
the most important input is emotional

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479
the most important input is emotional
 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.399
the most important input is emotional
expressions so often in psychology we

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409
expressions so often in psychology we
 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:14.839
expressions so often in psychology we
talk about that there's emotional

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849
talk about that there's emotional
 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.969
talk about that there's emotional
neutral faces and there's faces

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979
neutral faces and there's faces
 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.089
neutral faces and there's faces
expressing different emotions but the

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099
expressing different emotions but the
 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.129
expressing different emotions but the
fact of the matter is that an emotional

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139
fact of the matter is that an emotional
 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.320
fact of the matter is that an emotional
neutral face is a fiction it's a

neutral face is a fiction it's a
 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.450
neutral face is a fiction it's a
psychological fiction you could be

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460
psychological fiction you could be
 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.310
psychological fiction you could be
emotionally neutral by

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320
emotionally neutral by

so although the expressions might not be

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290
so although the expressions might not be
 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.770
so although the expressions might not be
explicit or exaggerated the way they

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780
explicit or exaggerated the way they
 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.960
explicit or exaggerated the way they
typically studied in studies and

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970
typically studied in studies and
 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.820

expressions on our faces
 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.780
expressions on our faces
so this expression is a very important

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790
so this expression is a very important
 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.090
so this expression is a very important
input to impressions notice they might
