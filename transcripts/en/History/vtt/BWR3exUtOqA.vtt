00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.294
This is the kill test.

00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:05.338
To see what kind of lethal
damage your blade will do,

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:06.631
we're going to
deliver some slashes

00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:08.466
on this wild boar carcass.

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.801
Joe, Casey, you're up first.
You ready?

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:10.969
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.304
[heavy metal music playing]

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.903
All right, Joe, Casey,
off the bat, it is light.

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:30.864
You got the weight perfect.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.949
On the draw cut
right here, you can

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.702
see that it lacerated easily.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:40.540
The cut here in the spine, you
can see all the nice pieces

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.875
of bacon that we're
going to make later

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.960
on with this particular carcass.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.921
You blade, it will kill.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:47.630
Good job, gentlemen.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.590
Thank you.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.924
Thank you.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:51.718
- Mark, Jessica, you ready?
- Definitely

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.762
Absolutely.

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:56.097
[heavy metal music playing]

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:10.904
All right, Mark, Jessica,
now, your blade is wider,

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.072
but the balance it's light.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:16.284
In this particular slice,
almost cut in half,

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.704
but definitely, on the
final cut, blighted easily.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:23.833
Your blade, it's curvaceous
and sexy, and it will kill.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.502
Thank you.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:28.004
Bladesmiths, I'm going
to take each of your swords

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.382
and deliver one Herculean strike
on this piece of sheet metal

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:33.843
to see how it
affects your blade.

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:34.886
Joe, Casey, you're up.
You ready?

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:36.179
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.680
We love to test blades.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.891
It's killing us right now
to not run over to Ben

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.393
and grab the sword
from his hand.

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:44.187
[music playing]

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.282
This is a beautifully
light sword.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.034
It's very well-balanced.

00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:00.745
I like the string wrap / it's
easy to keep a good grip on it.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:03.206
The edge took a
little bit of dulling.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:05.542
There's a piece
of the sheet metal

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:08.002
almost welded onto your
blade from the impact.

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:09.128
But it's still very well done.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:10.088
Thank you.

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:11.172
Thank you.

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:12.131
Mark, Jessica,
you guys are up?

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:12.966
You ready?

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.467
Indeed.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:17.804
JESSICA: Ben is about to
do something to this blade

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.639
that should never be done.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.517
Slamming into a steel plate.

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:24.811
Good Lord, why
would you do that?

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.063
[music playing]

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:33.987
BEN: Mark, Jessica, this is
a beautiful sword to wield.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.489
It's so comfortable,
it's so well-balanced.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.741
The steel did a little
number on your sword, though,

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:40.660
and there's a chip right there.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.913
But for such a light and
fast weapon, as both of these

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:47.667
are actually, it's amazing that
they got away this unscathed.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.043
Very well done.
- Thank you.

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:51.504
Thank you.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.131
To test the edge
of your blade and see

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.841
if it's retained that
edge, I'll be cutting

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.634
through these water tubes.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.887
Joe, Casey, are you guys ready?
JOE: Oh, yeah.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.805
CASEY: Let's go to work.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:03.099
[dramatic music playing]

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.445
Joe, Casey, your sword
has a great feel to it.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.113
I like the shape of the grip.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:20.116
There's that section
where that edge is rolled,

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.243
and that's where
the cut started.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:24.704
And you can see that first
tube kind of crushed.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.457
Then it starts to cut as
I get up into the sharper

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:28.833
section up in here.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.251
By then, everything had
pushed over and kind

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.669
of crushed that last tube.

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.087
It's a beautiful piece.
Well done.

00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:34.631
- Thanks
- Thanks.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:35.882
All right, Mark,
Jessica, you ready?

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:36.758
- Indeed.
- Yeah.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:37.926
OK.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.261
[dramatic music playing]

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.317
So, Mark, Jessica,
you maintained

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:55.693
a bit more of an edge here.

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:57.570
You can see that cut
travels through there.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.656
They're clean across
the tops, didn't

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.241
blow out any of the tubes,
didn't crush any of them.

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:04.786
Anyway, a beautifully
made piece.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.162
It's definitely a cutter.
Nicely done.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:06.996
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.252
Bladesmiths, your Chinese
dao's have been tested,

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:16.255
and the judges have evaluated
the finer details of your work,

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:18.675
and they've made
their final decision.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.051
The "Forge in Fire"
champions are--

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.597
Mark and Jessica.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:27.475
Congratulations, you are the
"Forged in Fire" champions.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:30.687
Joe and Casey, your weapon
did not make the cut.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.647
David Baker's going
to tell you why.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:35.566
Joe, Casey, you brought
us back a Chinese dao that I

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:37.402
personally would
be proud to own,

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.028
and it was a real
pleasure using it.

00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:41.239
But in our kill test,
on the boar carcass

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.616
and on the sharpness
test on the water tubes,

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.286
your weapon just didn't perform
as well as your competitor.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.286
And for that simple reason,
we got to let you go.
