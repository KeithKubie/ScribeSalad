00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.490
We are preoccupied with ourselves in unhelpful
ways. The clouds, however, know nothing of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.490
us, they float by utterly unaware of our concerns.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.840
These vast, quiet things are always to hand.
There is a constant drama above our heads:

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.760
collisions, fractures, swirls, separations…

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.480
Human life is no less active, but it can be
a moment of relief from our particular involvements

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.870
to look up and be returned to a broader perspective,
from where the agitations of the here and

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.240
now seem less significant.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:59.280
It will all pass, even the current nastiness
and anxiety, like the clouds that seemed so

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.210
fixed and heavy but an hour ago – and yet
have now moved on, leaving behind only two

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.360
or three of their numbers, apologetic and
timid before the victorious sun, like the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.160
cowed remnants of a scattered army.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.480
They are an image of patience, and resolution.
Their gnarled, worn barks speak of the hundreds

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.690
of seasons they have endured. They have bent
and lost branches in winter winds, they have

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.830
been gnawed at by worms and beetles across
the airless days of summer, they have been

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.459
knocked and hacked at by farmers and children.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:51.659
But they endure – as we might better learn
to do through their examples.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:59.080
All those leaves, resplendent in the summer
sun, will soon be gone.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:07.300
Human life is as terminal, but it is the example
of trees that best and most gracefully introduce

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.540
us to the inevitable facts of the life cycle.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:25.320
Nothing will be forever, say the trees. Enjoy
these precious days, whisper their leaves.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.380
They are always communicating: whispering,
exclaiming, arguing (with a rock or twig),

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.290
confiding (in a quiet vortex), dozing (in
midsummer) or shouting in rage (after a heavy

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.330
shower).
Like fires, they provide an ideal object of

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.760
contemplation. Their constant activity enlivens
the imagination. They don’t stare blankly

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.480
back at us, like pieces of paper on a desk.
They distract our minds just enough that the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.750
good ideas, the ones that we hate to ask ourselves
directly, can feel relieved of pressure and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.750
slip out - and we can make progress with ourselves.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.370
We need nature not just for physical health,
but - as importantly - for sanity. No week

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.760
should be counted complete if it does not
include one or two minutes given over to the

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:41.100
clouds, the trees and the streams: emissaries
of perspective, patience and introspection.
