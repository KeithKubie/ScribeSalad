00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:11.012
Express 0.0000000003457
in scientific notation.

00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:12.470
So let's just remind
ourselves what

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.250
it means to be in
scientific notation.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.850
Scientific notation will be some
number times some power of 10

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.330
where this number right here--
let me write it this way.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.340
It's going to be greater
than or equal to 1,

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.790
and it's going to
be less than 10.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.689
So over here, what
we want to put here

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.920
is what that leading
number is going to be.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.420
And in general,
you're going to look

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.994
for the first non-zero digit.

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:39.410
And this is the
number that you're

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.743
going to want to start off with.

00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:43.790
This is the only number you're
going to want to put ahead of

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.490
or I guess to the left
of the decimal point.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.200
So we could write
3.457, and it's

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.397
going to be multiplied
by 10 to something.

00:00:56.397 --> 00:00:57.980
Now let's think about
what we're going

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.380
to have to multiply it by.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.110
To go from 3.457 to this
very, very small number,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.230
from 3.457, to get
to this, you have

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.300
to move the decimal
to the left a bunch.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.960
You have to add a bunch of
zeroes to the left of the 3.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.720
You have to keep moving the
decimal over to the left.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.540
To do that, we're
essentially making

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.236
the number much
much, much smaller.

00:01:22.236 --> 00:01:23.610
So we're not going
to multiply it

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.790
by a positive exponent of 10.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.360
We're going to multiply it
times a negative exponent of 10.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.370
The equivalent is
you're dividing

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.827
by a positive exponent of 10.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:35.410
And so the best way
to think about it,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.130
when you move an
exponent one to the left,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.240
you're dividing by 10, which
is equivalent to multiplying

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.310
by 10 to the negative 1 power.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.530
Let me give you example here.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.140
So if I have 1 times 10 is
clearly just equal to 10.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.750
1 times 10 to the
negative 1, that's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.140
equal to 1 times 1/10,
which is equal to 1/10.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.710
1 times-- and let me actually
write a decimal, which is equal

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.930
to 0-- let me actually-- I
skipped a step right there.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.760
Let me add 1 times 10 to the 0,
so we have something natural.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.600
So this is one times
10 to the first.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.600
One times 10 to the 0
is equal to 1 times 1,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.290
which is equal to 1.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.140
1 times 10 to the negative
1 is equal to 1/10,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.160
which is equal to 0.1.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.715
If I do 1 times 10
to the negative 2,

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:36.820
10 to the negative 2 is 1
over 10 squared or 1/100.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.900
So this is going to be
1/100, which is 0.01.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.820
What's happening here?

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.640
When I raise it to
a negative 1 power,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.240
I've essentially
moved the decimal

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.334
from to the right of the
1 to the left of the 1.

00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:52.750
I've moved it from
there to there.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.390
When I raise it
to the negative 2,

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.680
I moved it two over to the left.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.390
So how many times are we
going to have to move it over

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.730
to the left to get this
number right over here?

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.940
So let's think about
how many zeroes we have.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.010
So we have to move it one time
just to get in front of the 3.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.040
And then we have to
move it that many more

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.310
times to get all of the zeroes
in there so that we have

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.604
to move it one
time to get the 3.

00:03:17.604 --> 00:03:19.020
So if we started
here, we're going

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:28.130
to move 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10 times.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.931
So this is going to be 3.457
times 10 to the negative 10

00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:33.430
power.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.388
Let me just rewrite it.

00:03:34.388 --> 00:03:39.764
So 3.457 times 10 to
the negative 10 power.

00:03:39.764 --> 00:03:41.180
So in general,
what you want to do

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.450
is you want to find the
first non-zero number here.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.060
Remember, you want a number
here that's between 1 and 10.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.910
And it can be equal to 1, but
it has to be less than 10.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.320
3.457 definitely fits that bill.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.760
It's between 1 and 10.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.840
And then you just want
to count the leading

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.636
zeroes between the
decimal and that number

00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:01.510
and include the number
because that tells you

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.470
how many times you have
to shift the decimal over

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.166
to actually get
this number up here.

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:08.040
And so we have to shift
this decimal 10 times

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.840
to the left to get
this thing up here.
