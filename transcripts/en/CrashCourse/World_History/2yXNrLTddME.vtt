Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History and today we're going to talk about

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.019
the life and astonishing death of Captain
James Hook. Who's death by a crocodile ch-

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.560
what? James Cook? There's no crocodiles? HGGG!
Stupid history, always disappointing me. Well,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.000
Captain Cook is pretty interesting too and
his death is a nice entree into one of the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.020
great historian feuds of recent times. God,
I love historian feuds.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:33.100
[theme music]

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.360
So Captain Cook was born in 1728. He was a
sailor and eventually a British Naval Officer,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.960
who saw action in the Seven Years War (which
you will no doubt remember from last week)

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.310
But he's best know for his three voyages of
exploration and scientific discovery that

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.870
took place in the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.940
The first was between 1768 and 1771, the second
between 1772 and 1775, and the third between

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.739
1776 and 1780. Although on the last one, Cook's
journey ended in 1779 because he died. And

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.920
as you can see from the map, Cook pretty much
OWNED the Pacific.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.670
He mapped the coast of Australia, paving the
way for British colonization and also paving

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.939
the way for the near destruction of aboriginal
peoples and their culture. As with the Columbian

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.759
Exchange, Cook's voyages to Australia remade
the biological landscape. He introduced sheep,

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.829
which paved the way for Australia's huge wool
industry. Right, there was a penal colony

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.499
established in Australia; but the real story
of Australia is its success as a colony. Within

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:30.350
80 years, Australia went from a 1,000 Anglo-Australians
to 1.2 million.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.770
Equally important, Cook explored and mapped
out New Zealand. Again paving the way for

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.249
colonization and paving the way for Crash
Course World History to make an announcement!

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.459
We did it! We finally talked about Australia
and New Zealand! We're a real world history

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:49.319
class! Huzzah! (party horn) Now all you Australians
have to shut up about how we've never mentioned you!

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.649
Right, so in his voyage Cook also determined
the was no such thing as the mythical continent

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.179
of "Terra Australis" said to have exsited
here. And he helped to dispel the idea of

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.569
a North-West Passage, which Europeans had
been obsessed with for centuries. He was the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.509
first European to describe Hawaii and also
the first to keep his ships' crews free of scurvy!

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.250
Cook and his successors were part of the middle
wave of European colonization. The one that

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.220
took place after Europeans settled in the
Americas, but before they set their sights

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.689
on Africa. One more thing to mention about
the context of these voyages, or rather their

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.439
impact. Besides huge territorial gains and
increased wealth, exploration of the Pacific

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.000
contributed to Europe's romantic fascination
with science. In the 18th and 19th centuries,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.090
Europeans became obsessed with mapping and
charting and classifying the world. Which

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.269
maybe isn't like candle-light dinner romantic,
but if you think about visiting never before

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.180
seen lands and bringing back odd life-forms.
Well, I mean think about how we feel about

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.180
space. And then of course as they colonized
people, Europeans portrayed themselves as

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.510
a civilizing force; bringing both science
and religion.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:52.360
Oh, it's time for the Open Letter? An Open
Letter to "The White Man's Burden." But first,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.760
let's see what's in the secret compartment
today. Ah! It's a moustache, so I can look like Kipling!

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.489
Dear White Man's Burden,

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.140
I'mma go ahead and take this off Stan. I think
Tumblr has had enough to get their GIFs.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.349
So White Man's Burden, you're a poem. And
more that a century after Kipling wrote you,

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.239
scholars still disagree over whether he was
kidding. And this speaks to how weird and

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.049
insane Imperialism really was. Europeans seemed
to genuinely believe that it was their unfortunate

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.530
duty to extract massive wealth from the rest
of the world. Seriously, were you kidding

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.719
when you called natives "Half Devil and Half
Child?" Because in retrospect, that seems

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.199
to describe... ya know... you.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.860
Best Wishes,
John Green

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.310
Right, so now having discussed the life of
Captain Cook, we shall turn to the most controversial

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.549
thing he ever did. Die. Let's go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.090
So Cook landed in Hawaii at Kealakekua Bay
in early 1779 and explored the island. While

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.549
he was ashore he was greeted by an important
person, either a Chief or a God. And then

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.650
in early February, he left. But the ship had
trouble and was forced to return to the bay

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.540
for repairs. During this second visit, he
had difficulty with the Hawaiians, who'd previously

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.459
had been pretty hospitable. And there was
a fracas, in which Captain Cook was killed

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.269
by at least one Hawaiian. We know this from
journals kept by various crewman, but the

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:16.160
historical controversy arises from the details and
interpretation of his death. Why, in short, was Cook

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.500
killed? The traditional view is that Cook was killed
for some religious reason, although what isn't

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.500
always clear. One of the most fleshed out
versions of this story comes from the anthropologist

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.820
Marshall Sahlins, in his book "Islands of
History." So in the Hawaiian religious system

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.340
Ku, the God of War and Human Sacrifice, rules
for eight or nine months out of the year.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.100
The other months are reserved for the Fertility
God, Lono. The season long festival for Lono

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.020
is call "Makahiki" and during this the Hawaiian
King, who is associated with Ku, is ritually

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.680
defeated. During the Makahiki, an image of
Lono tours the island, gets worshipped, and collects

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.000
taxes. And at the end of the Makahiki period, Lono
is ritually defeated and returned to his native Tahiti.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.310
The thinking goes that because Cook arrived
in the middle of the Makahiki, the Hawaiians

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.890
perceived him as Lono. So Cook took part in
the rituals and sacrifices that were made

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.000
as part of the Makahiki and in Sahlins' view,
Cook was killed as a ritual murder to mark

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.340
the end of Makahiki. For Ku to return, the
fesitval to end, and the normal political

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.590
order to be restored, ***** Lono had to be
defeated and presumably killed! For Sahlins,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.900
Cook's death fits perfectly with the ritual
structure of Hawaiian culture.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.220
Thanks Thought Bubble. So the big problem
with this interpretation, which admittedly

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.180
sounds pretty cool, is that we don't have much evidence
that Hawaiians would have actually seen Cook this way.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.110
We find a really interesting opposing view
from Gananath Obeyesekere and I will remind

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.330
you that mispronunciation is my thing! Sorry
Gananath. Anyway, he criticized Sahlins' interpretation

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.940
of Cook's death for looking a lot more like
European myth than like a Hawaiian ritual.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.580
First off, Obeyesekere argues that Cook himself
would not easily be confused with Lono. In

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.280
fact if he were taken for a God, it would
probably be Ku, the War God, what with all

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.520
the cannons and muskets. Also there's the
fact that the name Cook sounds more like Ku

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.010
than Lono. Also, arguing that native Hawaiians
would see a European and think him a God has

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.190
all kinds of troubling implications. One of
them being that native Hawaiians aren't terribly

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.760
smart. When in fact we know that they are
very smart because unlike the rest of us,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.480
they live in Hawaii. And last but definitely
not least, Lono is associated with fertility

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.100
and the Hawaiians would have associated the
Europeans with the exact opposite of fertility

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.600
because they introduced gonorrhea to Hawaii.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.330
And there's a further problem with the "Cook
equals Lono" equation, which is that nothing

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.970
in Hawaiian religion has any of their gods
being ritually killed. Part of their mythology

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.160
can be seen as sanctioning a ritual killing
of the King, but not of a god and also it's

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.360
a long way from ritual killing to actual killing!

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.540
The truth is probably a lot less spectacular,
which is that Cook was probably killed during

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.330
a melee in which a bunch of Hawaiians were
also killed. Before his death, Cook had attempted

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.270
to take a Hawaiian King hostage in response
to Hawaiians taking a bunch of stuff from

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.600
Cook's boats. This was common practice for
Cook. He had done the same thing in Tahiti

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.570
and other Polynesian Islands after Islanders
had taken European goods. Which by the way

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.660
happened everywhere Cook went in the Pacific,
so maybe he should have figured out that it

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.040
was like a thing! That you were allowed to
take stuff off boats in exchange for the right

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.580
to hang out there! Great sailor, terrible anthropologist.
Although to be fair, anthropology hadn't be invented.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.270
Additionally, right before Cook was killed
there were rising tensions between the Hawaiians

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.720
and the Europeans. Even though at first their
relationship had been quite cordial as evidenced

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.260
by all that gonorrhea. So why the tension?
Probably because the Europeans dismantled

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.410
a Hawaiian ritual space, some sources call
it a temple, and used it for firewood. Cook

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.650
attempted to pay for it, but his low-ball offer of two
hatchets, I'm not making that up, was refused!

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.490
I'm sorry we destroyed your temple, but I'll
give you two hatchets! One for each hand!

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.270
I mean, what would you even do with a third
hatchet?!?

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.140
So unfortunately, the earliest Hawaiian account
offering this explanation for why Cook was

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.430
killed comes well after the accounts. But
at least it's a Hawaiian explanation. Of course

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.020
it's also possible that the Hawaiians were
just upset that Cook had attempted to kidnap

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.830
their King! Most accounts from the time portray
a chaotic scene in which Cook himself fired

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.740
at least two shots, probably killing at least
one Islander. And one thing that seem pretty

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.580
clear, even as described by European chroniclers,
is that Cook's death does not look premeditated

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.560
and it sure doesn't look like a ritual.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.560
But even so, the idea that Hawaiians saw Cook
as a God has ended up in a good many accounts

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.320
of his demise. Why? Well one explanation is
that it fits in with other stories of explorers.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.620
You've all probably heard that Taínos thought
Columbus was a god and that the Aztecs supposedly

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.110
thought Cortés was a god. And this just makes
Captain Cook one in a long line of Europeans

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.710
who were thought to be gods by people who
Europeans felt were savages. And making Cook

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:30.640
a god also sets up a stark contrast between
the enlightened West and primitive Polynesia,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.240
because Captain Cook often appears in history
books as a model man of the Enlightenment.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.380
Sure he never had much formal schooling, but
his voyages were all about about increasing

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.200
knowledge and scientific exploration. And
having him die at the hands of a people who

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.000
were so obviously mistaken in thinking him
a god makes an argument for the superiority

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.100
over the intellectualism of the Enlightenment
versus the so called "Primitive Religion"

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.160
of the colonies. But whenever a story seems
to fit really well into such a framework,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.980
we need to ask ourselves, "Who's telling that
story?"

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.380
One of the reasons we know so much about Captain
Cook and the reason he shows up in so many

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.960
history textbooks is because we have tons
of records about him, but they're almost all

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.990
European records. Even the Hawaiian records
we have about Cook have been heavily influenced

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.340
by later contact with Europeans. So if we
cast Cook's death as part of a native ritual,

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.790
we're implying that Hawaiians were just performing
a ritual script. Which takes away all their

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.980
agency as human beings. Are we making them
recognizable, having them respond as we think

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.870
Europeans would by flying off the handle?
I don't have an answer, but the debate between

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.620
these two historical anthropologists brings
up something that we need to keep in mind.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.330
Very often in history, we make statements
about people who haven't written their own

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.730
story. Whether it's Hawaiians or Native Americans
or working class people. And we try to imagine

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.150
that we're seeing the world as they have seen
it. But the best we can really do is offer

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.650
an approximation. So is it really possible
to present a Hawaiian version of Captain Cook's

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:52.050
death? Or is the exercise inherently condescending
and paternalistic? And most importantly, is

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.990
our inability to escape our biases a good
excuse for not even trying? As usual, those

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.670
aren't rhetorical questions. Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next week.
