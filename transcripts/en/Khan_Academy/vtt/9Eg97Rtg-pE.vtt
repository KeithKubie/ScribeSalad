00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:04.171
- [Voiceover] Let G and
H be inverse functions.

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:05.880
So let's just remind
ourselves what it means

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.631
for them to be inverse functions.

00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:13.035
That means that if I
have two sets of numbers,

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:15.305
let's say one set right over there,

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:17.949
that's another set right over there,

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.607
and if we view that first
set as the domain of G,

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:25.078
so if you start with
some X right over here,

00:00:25.078 --> 00:00:28.706
G is going to map from
that X to another value,

00:00:28.706 --> 00:00:30.956
which we would call G of X.

00:00:32.778 --> 00:00:34.953
That's what the function G does.

00:00:34.953 --> 00:00:39.279
Now if H is the inverse of
G and frankly vice versa,

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:43.898
then H could go from that
point G of X back to X.

00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:45.794
So H would do this.

00:00:45.794 --> 00:00:49.746
H would get us back to our original value.

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:52.657
So that's what the function H would do

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:55.354
and so we could view this
point right over here,

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:58.852
we could view it as X, so that is X,

00:00:58.852 --> 00:01:02.964
but we could also view it as H of G of X.

00:01:02.964 --> 00:01:06.381
So we could also view this as H of G of X

00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:10.654
and I did all of that so we can

00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:13.281
really feel good about this idea.

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:16.659
If someone tells you that G
and H are inverse functions,

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.409
that means that H of G of X is X.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.266
H of G of X.

00:01:25.524 --> 00:01:27.691
H of G of X is equal to X.

00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:31.212
Or you could have gone
the other way around.

00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:34.176
You could have started with,

00:01:34.176 --> 00:01:36.018
well you could have done
it multiple different ways,

00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:37.807
but also G of H of X.

00:01:37.807 --> 00:01:39.223
I could have just swapped
these letters here.

00:01:39.223 --> 00:01:41.840
The letters H and G
are somewhat arbitrary.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.032
So you could have also
said that G of H of X

00:01:46.032 --> 00:01:47.199
is equal to X.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.986
So G of H of X is equal to X.

00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:53.909
And then they give us some information.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.076
The following table lists a few
values of G, H, and G prime.

00:01:59.277 --> 00:02:03.202
Alright, so they want us to
evaluate H prime of three.

00:02:03.202 --> 00:02:05.231
They don't even give us H prime of three.

00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:06.064
How do we figure it out?

00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:09.046
They gave us G prime and H and G.

00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:10.889
How do we figure this out?

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.425
Well here we're going to
actually derive something

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:15.722
based on the chain rule and
this isn't the type of problem

00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:18.855
that you'll see a lot
of, but it is interesting

00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:20.658
so we're going to work through
it and there's a chance

00:02:20.658 --> 00:02:23.382
that you might see it
in your calculus class.

00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:27.841
So let's start with either one
of these expressions up here.

00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:30.758
So let's start with the expression,

00:02:32.354 --> 00:02:35.879
well let's start with,
let's do this one over here.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.212
So if we have G of H of X is equal to X,

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:46.026
so we put that H of X back there,

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:50.193
which is by definition true
if G and H are inverses.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.583
Well now let's take the
derivative of both sides of this.

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:54.624
So let's take the derivative

00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:58.015
with respect to X of both sides,

00:02:58.015 --> 00:03:00.846
derivative with respect to X,

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:03.730
and on the left-hand side well
we just apply the chain rule.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.397
This would be G prime of H of X,

00:03:09.631 --> 00:03:11.131
G prime of H of X,

00:03:14.037 --> 00:03:15.620
times H prime of X.

00:03:17.482 --> 00:03:19.565
That's just the chain
rule right over there

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.567
and then that would be equal to,

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:24.291
what's the derivative
with respect to X of X?

00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:27.068
Well that's just going to be equal to one.

00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:28.590
So now it's interesting.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.821
We need to figure out
what H prime of three is.

00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:33.931
We can figure out what H of three is

00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:35.846
and then we can use that to figure out

00:03:35.846 --> 00:03:40.453
what G prime of whatever
G prime of H of three is

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.669
and so we should be able
to figure out H prime of X

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.019
or we could just rewrite it this way.

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.936
We could rewrite that H
prime of X is equal to,

00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:54.667
is equal to one over G prime of H of X.

00:03:57.986 --> 00:04:00.817
Now in some circles,
they might encourage you

00:04:00.817 --> 00:04:02.472
to memorize this and maybe for the sake

00:04:02.472 --> 00:04:04.311
of doing this exercise on Khan Academy

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:05.566
you might want to memorize it,

00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:08.450
but I'll tell you 20 years after I took,

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.479
almost 25 years after I took calculus,

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.684
this is not something that I
retain in my long-term memory,

00:04:13.684 --> 00:04:16.087
but I did retain that
you can derive this from

00:04:16.087 --> 00:04:19.665
just what the definition of
inverse functions actually are.

00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:20.760
But we can use this now

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.724
if we want to figure out
what H prime of three is.

00:04:23.724 --> 00:04:27.756
H prime of three is going to be equal to

00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:30.339
one over G prime of H of three,

00:04:35.206 --> 00:04:37.770
which I'm guessing that
they have given us.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.241
So H of three, when X is three, H is four.

00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:43.484
So that is H of three there.

00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:44.980
So H of three is four.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.223
So now we just have to
figure out G prime of four.

00:04:47.223 --> 00:04:49.573
Well lucky for us, they have given us

00:04:49.573 --> 00:04:53.740
when X is equal to four,
G prime is equal to 1/2.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.465
So G prime of four is equal to 1/2.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:02.310
So H prime of three is
equal to one over 1/2.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.511
So one over 1/2,

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:06.369
one divided by 1/2 is the
same thing as one times two.

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:10.036
So this is all equal
to two and we are done.
