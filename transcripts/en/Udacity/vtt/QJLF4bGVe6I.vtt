00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The truth is that motion has two components--it has a horizontal and a vertical component--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and those two components are completely independent.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What do I mean by independent?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I mean that we can break a two dimensional motion problem

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
into two separate one dimensional motion problem and this is an amazing tool.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Then we go on and shown how in 1 dimension, if we're for example dropping a ball,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
at the instant when we dropped the ball, well it has no velocity not quite yet.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
One second later, it's picked up some velocity.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It picks up that much again in the 2nd second and again it picks up the same amount in the 3rd,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and we can represent that pictorially with pictures like these.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now what if instead of dropping the ball, we throw it to the side.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What kind of errors are we going to draw now?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The instance the ball was released, it only has horizontal velocity--that's from you throwing it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I said before that these components are completely independent so that means after 1 second

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
this horizontal component--well, it doesn't change.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It keeps going to the right and just like in the 1 dimensional problem before

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
it picks some speed going downwards.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
In fact, it picks up the same amount of vertical speed that it would have

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
had we just dropped the ball.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
After 2 seconds, horizontal component does not change but the vertical looks twice as long

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and after 3 seconds the vertical grows again and the horizontal stays the same.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now this is sort of a strange picture here.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Is this ball moving to the right or is it moving down or is it moving in some other direction?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Which of these errors best describes the direction of the balls' motion at this point in time?

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And it's a guess so don't worry if you're wrong.
