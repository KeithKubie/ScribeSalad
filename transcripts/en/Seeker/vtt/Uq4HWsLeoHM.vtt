00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.100
This is a picture of Triton, one of Neptune's moons.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.980
It was taken by a spacecraft nearly 30 years ago

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.360
and is part of a limited batch of photos we have of this icy world.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.220
Scientists think this moon might have an underground ocean that could be hospitable for life,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.900
among other intriguing science questions.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.020
So they want to go back for a closer look.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.620
But there's a race against time and orbital mechanics.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.280
They want to launch soon so they can take advantage of a gravity slingshot from Jupiter

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.980
Triton is a very large moon. It's the seventh largest moon in the solar system

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.360
Triton itself is larger than every other smaller moon combined.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.520
But it is a captured world around Neptune.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.020
Something happened, we don't necessarily know what, that caused it to be captured into orbit around Neptune.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.840
When we first encountered Triton when Voyager 2 passed by in 1989,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.240
we saw a world that was very unlike what we expected.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.619
We saw one of the youngest surfaces in the solar system.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.040
We think it's maybe fifteen million years,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.540
but perhaps as young as ten million years.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.680
And so that might sound a lot to us as mere humans who were here for blink of an eye,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.000
but in geological terms, it was essentially born yesterday.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.040
We date the ages of surfaces in the solar system based on the number of craters

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.500
they've experienced, and there were almost no craters on the surface of Triton.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.290
So that was the first clue something weird is going on.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.360
The second clue was when we started looking even closer at the surface.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.980
We realized there were all these weird features that we could interpret as being

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.100
the result of movement of materials through an ice shelf.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.440
And that was particularly exciting because that suggests there's an energy source

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.200
and an ocean provides a really nice energy source.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.220
We also found that Triton had plumes of active material

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.600
firing off from the surface in some way.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.480
These dark columns going up to about eight kilometers above the surface.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:16.060
I've been captivated by these plumes ever since I saw them first in The Guardian newspaper in 1989.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.180
They were the first time we ever saw plumes erupting from an icy world

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.980
Galactic plumes could be evidence of a subsurface ocean which might support alien life.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.220
We see them on other distant moons too, like Enceladus.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.160
There's been a lot more interest in some of these icy bodies, I think.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.560
They're very unusual and alien looking bizarre landscapes.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.380
But they're also now possibly places where life might have evolved or might evolve in the future.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.460
And all of these intriguing hints are what make Triton a prime target for a new flyby mission.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.040
Trident is a mission concept that we are proposing to NASA in the next Discovery round.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.880
We want to launch in October of 2025 and we would arrive at Triton in 2038.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.340
One of the kind of ingenious things about this is that 30 years after Voyager

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.820
our technology has come so far that we can do nearly global mapping of the surface just from a flyby.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.060
We're also flying much lower. Voyager flew by at about 40,000 kilometers.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.780
We are flying by at about 300 kilometers, so we're going very close to the surface.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.780
There are a lot of cases where you can do a huge amount of really

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.040
fundamentally important science just from the flyby.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.560
The New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto a few years ago

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.320
and showed what an incredible world Pluto is.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.680
I myself worked on the Messenger mission where we answered a lot of the science goals just from one flyby.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.940
If you carry the right tools and you plan everything correctly.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.060
Trident is carrying a fairly complex suite of instruments.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.140
The first one is a combined narrow-angle camera and infrared spectrometer.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.540
The next one is a magnetometer and that has one real purpose which is to

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.140
look for the magnetic signature of an ocean as we fly past Triton.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.220
Then we have a plasma spectrometer.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.440
This is an instrument that samples particles along the trajectory of a spacecraft.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.100
Then we're carrying a wide-angle camera.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:23.960
This is specifically intended to image the Neptune-facing hemisphere of Triton during the eclipse.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.220
Finally, we're using radio science.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.320
So that will give us a lot of understanding about the atmosphere and will also help us detect

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.280
more or less where the bottom of the water layer is.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.900
But to get to Triton under the Discovery budget,

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.380
they'll want to hitch a ride on a smaller rocket

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.900
and use radioisotope thermoelectric generators as a power source.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.080
They want to launch soon so they can take advantage of a uniquely suited flight path.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.780
In terms of propulsion our our trick is that we're using what they call a ballistic trajectory.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.020
Trident is being thrown into space,

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.640
it's going to do a few flybys of Venus and Earth,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.840
then it's going to shoot out to Jupiter and then get what they call a gravity assist,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.180
where Jupiter will both deflect the trajectory and accelerate it straight at Neptune.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.740
This is one of those wonderful examples of a very pure application of physics.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.140
We should be able to hit exactly the right point relative to Triton within 20 kilometers.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.120
We're at JPL. This is what we do. We do these crazy missions to far-out places

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.200
and we bullseye our target decades out at the extremes.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.160
We just a couple of hours ago submitted what's called a 'Notice of Intent' to NASA that says:

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.440
we are going to deliver to you in a few weeks a proposal to go and explore Triton.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.440
So at this point we're very close to the end of getting the proposal ready. We're not getting a lot of sleep.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.700
It's a very exciting and exhausting,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.720
but overall exhilarating time to be doing this kind of work.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.300
One thing about this mission is that it is unusually long.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.140
You know, if you're going to the moon it's three days away.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.440
If you're going to Mars, you can get there in 9 months.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.380
It takes us 13 years to get to Triton.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.700
It's very very rewarding,

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.740
and it's worth putting in all the extra time and sweat.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.520
You don't just want to look at the familiar. You learn a lot more about studying the unfamiliar,

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.940
the things at the extremes.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.840
Seeing the surface of the planet for the first time is,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.820
it's hard to describe what that feels like.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.120
It's almost spiritual, you're seeing something sometimes that no one else has ever seen.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.660
Or certainly no one other than the people in the room, you know,

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.287
that you're all standing around a screen usually going crazy.

00:06:42.287 --> 00:06:46.700
It's a pretty incredible moment and they don't happen very often in a career.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.660
But when they happen, they're pretty magical. It's worth the wait.
