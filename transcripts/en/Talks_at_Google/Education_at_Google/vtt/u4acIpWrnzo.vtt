00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello everyone.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.080
Thank you for coming
to talk at Google.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.140
It's my pleasure to introduce
Yu-kai Chou, a gamification

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.070
and pioneer.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.400
Yu-kai started his work in the
gamification industry in 2003.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.980
Since then, Yu-kai has been
helping businesses engage

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.170
customers and clients
using gamification,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.930
for companies like eBay,
HP, Cisco, and Wells

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.080
Fargo, et cetera.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.880
His work has been featured in
"Forbes Magazine," "The Wall

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.150
Street Journal," "PBS,"
and he has also lectured

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.450
at Stanford University.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.960
It's no wonder that Yu-kai
was awarded the Gamification

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.760
Guru of the Year award,
for both 2014 and 2015,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.910
by the World Gamification
Congress, based in Europe.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.740
Most recently, Yu-kai
rose to the top in 2015

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.110
with a number one rating among
Gamification Gurus Power 100

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.930
by Rise.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.530
Interestingly, Yu-kai
has the rare gift

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.300
of being able to write
different things with both hands

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.340
at the same time.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.370
So everything in life is a game.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:28.050
Today, Yu-kai will explain his
book, "Actionable Gamification,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.880
Beyond Points, Badges
and Leaderboards."

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.260
Please welcome, Yu-kai Chou.

00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:38.500
YU-KAI CHOU: Thank
you very much.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.270
It's a great
pleasure to be here.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.480
So today, we're going to talk
about a framework on actionable

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.260
gamification. .

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.105
So that's me, Yu-kai Chou.

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.740
C And we already talked a
little about my background,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.790
so I wanted to talk and say that
I started this journey in 2003.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.439
So at the beginning, it
was a lonely passion.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.730
People didn't understand it,
they didn't believe in it.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.040
They thought I was just creating
more excuses to play games.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.010
But I really believe in the
power of utilizing game design

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.870
to motivate desired behavior.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.809
So I stuck to it.

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:08.350
Over the years,
created a few startup

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.120
companies, all in this space.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.200
And I do a lot of
these keynote speeches

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.860
or lectures at
Stanford, at Accenture.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.580
And actually, three weeks ago I
was at Denmark doing a project

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.290
for LEGO, which was
a great experience.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.060
And just very blessed
to have all these

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.140
experiences on something
I'm so passionate about.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.345
And as you know,
this last year I

00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:31.220
published my book,
"Actionable Gamification."

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.430
I know a lot of people
are watching online,

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.180
so if you check out
the link, it's Amazon.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.620
But for the live
audience, if you want,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.220
we can have some books here,
I can sign it for you guys.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.720
Anyway.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.960
So to start, I want to
start with an exercise.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.910
I want you guys to
think about one game

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.640
that you enjoyed
doing in the past.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.700
And just think about one.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.630
So it could be a social mobile
game, like Farmville or Candy

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.830
Crush, or Angry Birds.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.329
It could be something
more hardcore,

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.150
like League of Legends, or
StarCraft, World of Warcraft.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.130
But even if you don't
play computer games,

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.540
you can choose games like
poker, or golf, Mahjong,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.730
crossword puzzles.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.280
I believe that everyone has a
game they enjoyed in the past.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.410
And just think about, what
made that game fun to you?

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.180
Out of all the
games out there, why

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.717
do you like this game,
not the other ones?

00:03:17.717 --> 00:03:19.800
And then in this talk,
we'll introduce a framework

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.570
about motivation and fun.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.110
And then we can come back
to understanding that game.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.500
So I believe at the
core of gamification

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.770
is what we call human focused
design, as opposed to function

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.830
focused design.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.200
So most systems are
function focused.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.370
They assume that
people in a system

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.455
will take the desired
behavior and it

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:43.580
optimizes for things like
usability, efficiency,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.590
orgonometry.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.359
And then it tries to
maximize the outcome on that.

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.900
So it's kind of like
a factory, where

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.150
you assume people will take the
desired behavior because you

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.960
pay them to do it.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.418
And then you kind
of figure out how

00:03:56.418 --> 00:03:59.240
to increase your production
and your efficiency.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.520
Now, human focused
design remembers

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.540
that people in the system have
feelings, have motivations,

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.200
have insecurities, have
reasons why they do

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.960
or do not want to do something
and optimize for that.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.710
So that's kind of like
a theme park, where

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.707
you design it to be
really, really fun,

00:04:13.707 --> 00:04:15.790
and then you can predict
that people automatically

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.450
want to line up for
hours and hours,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.200
just to enjoy the experience.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.084
Now, what's interesting here
is in the case of a factory,

00:04:22.084 --> 00:04:24.000
you're paying these
people to sit there and do

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.640
relatively mundane things.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.430
But in the case of a
theme park, they're

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.060
paying you to stand in
line for hours and hours

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.790
because they want to enjoy
that experience so much.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.630
Now the reason why we call
this field gamification

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.590
is because I believe the gaming
industry is the first to master

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.950
human focused design.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.520
Because there's no real purpose
to playing a game, right?

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.880
You never have to play a game.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.320
You have to go to
school, do your taxes,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.090
do you training even if you
don't like it kind of suck it

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.690
up and do it.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.310
I call it contaminated
motivation.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.610
But again, for a game, there's
no purpose to playing a game.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.230
You never have to play a game.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.482
The moment a game is no longer
fun, you leave the game.

00:05:01.482 --> 00:05:03.190
You play another game,
you go on YouTube,

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.040
you go check on YouTube, or
you go and check your email.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.470
And so because games
have spent decades--

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.170
or even centuries, depending
on how you qualify game--

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.270
to figure out how to get people
to come back for four, five,

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.236
six, seven, eight hours
a day, doing relatively

00:05:18.236 --> 00:05:20.110
repetitive things like
throwing out the bird,

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.450
throwing out the bird,
throwing out the bird,

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.340
or matching three gem, matching
three gem, matching three gem,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.880
again and again.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.690
Every day, right?

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.570
Where there's no
mandated purpose at all.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.350
We're now learning
from that discipline,

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.710
and that's why we
call it gamification.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.840
And this principle of
human focused design

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.010
is very important,
this especially

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.420
when you're launching new
products, because again,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.860
almost by definition,
your users do not

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.041
need to use your product.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:42.540
Right?

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.230
Because their life work
was relatively fine

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.610
before you existed.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.847
So I've had a lot of clients
or startups come to me

00:05:49.847 --> 00:05:51.430
and say, hey Yu-kai,
there's no reason

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.310
why a person wouldn't
use our product.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.500
We save them time,
we save them money,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.020
and we make their lives better.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.037
On lucky days, even the
user will say, oh yeah,

00:05:59.037 --> 00:06:01.120
there's no reason why I
wouldn't use your product.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.430
You save me time, you save me
money, you make my life better.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.900
So I'll definitely
download it when I go home.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.130
And then if you have
experience on launching

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.330
new products, a lot of times,
you'll see six months later,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.440
you meet the same person.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.950
You're like, Hey!

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.070
Did you Did you use the product?

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.236
What did you think about it?

00:06:14.236 --> 00:06:16.260
And they're like, oh yeah.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
It sounded really cool,
I still intend to do it.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.950
I just got busy, I'm sorry.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.830
And I'll definitely do
it when I go home today.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.820
And so, this person
is busy, but chances

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.140
are this person has been playing
games over the past six months.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.770
So this is the
conundrum, in terms

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.340
of there's all
these things we know

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.850
that are important in life--
health care, education, product

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.050
design, but we don't
want to spend time doing.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.200
And then there's these
games that have no purpose

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.574
and we spend all
that time doing.

00:06:40.574 --> 00:06:43.340
So just because you're useful,
you have good functionality,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.190
you have good
technology, does not

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.080
mean people will want
to use this product.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.480
It has to engage
with the human brain.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.177
And so, I was very lucky
because a few years back,

00:06:53.177 --> 00:06:54.510
gamification became an industry.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.730
A lot of companies
started to care

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.010
about what I've been doing.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.930
So sometimes politicians,
universities, hospitals,

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.910
they're asking me to do
this gamification work.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.743
And then more and more
people are coming out

00:07:03.743 --> 00:07:05.717
and they want to do
more gamification.

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:08.050
But I think there's a big
problem in the industry, which

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.200
is a lot of people are
obsessed with the fancy term

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.810
game mechanics, game
elements, whatnot.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.770
So it's things like points,
or badges, or leaderboards,

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.210
or quests, or narratives.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.590
So companies think, hey, if
I just take all these game

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.020
elements and put it into
my product, we have points,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.840
we have levels, then it's
going to be fun exciting.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.700
And I think that's
doing it backwards.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.220
So if you look at a bad
game designer's angle,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.960
a bad game designer
might start off

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.380
thinking about the
problem as, OK, well what

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.640
game elements do I need?

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.720
Well, we need swords,
where can they go?

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.780
OK, let's put them here.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.690
We need monsters, let's
put them somewhere.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.080
You know, cows are cool and
friends who could fertilize

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.620
their crops, that's popular.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.730
Well, how about some
birds with attitude?

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.550
How about some plants
that shoots peas?

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.810
Hey, puzzle games are
popular, let's do that too.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.960
And you can see here that a game
can have all the right quote

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.140
unquote elements in
them, but still be

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.200
incredibly stupid and boring.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.270
In fact, if you think about it,
every single game in the market

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.270
has game elements in them, but
most are still not engaging,

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.840
most are not successful.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.960
And so it's not
realistic to think that,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.280
hey, if I just take those
game elements that are even

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.940
found in boring games
and put into my product,

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.249
it automatically becomes
fun and successful.

00:08:21.249 --> 00:08:22.290
That just doesn't happen.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.900
Only a few well-designed
games achieve mass success. .

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.449
So if you look at it from a
good game designer standpoint,

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:31.490
instead of thinking about,
oh, what game elements

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.330
should I use, they can start off
thinking about it as how do I

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.730
want my users to feel?

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.750
Do I want them to feel proud?

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.630
Do I want them to feel inspired,
even scared for some horror

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.299
games?

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.940
And once they understand, OK,
how do I want my users to feel,

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.690
that's when they think, OK, what
are the game elements that I

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.130
can put in to implement, to
create those types of feelings.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.810
Maybe it's swords,
maybe it's monsters,

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.390
maybe it's cows or friends.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.140
The key here is that good
gamification design does not

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.890
start with those game
elements that people

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.790
love to talk about, but really
starts with our core drives,

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.580
our psychology.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.170
So this is where I introduce
my octalysis framework.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.310
So I spent many years
studying, again,

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.807
what makes a game actually fun?

00:09:11.807 --> 00:09:13.640
So what I did, I studied
a lot of games that

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.730
are very similar to each other.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.460
Sometimes one is just
a clone, they just

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.550
copied the other game.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.550
But somehow, one game
is incredibly successful

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.010
and the other's a failure.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.647
So I wanted to
understand why that is.

00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:25.230
Well, first of all,
of course it's not

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.021
because one has game
elements and the other

00:09:27.021 --> 00:09:29.320
doesn't because they both
have points, or levels,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.760
or achievements, whatnot.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.960
But still, one is
successful, one is a failure.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.380
I also noticed it's not
because of the graphics that

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.680
make a game successful.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.890
Sometimes the
visually stunning game

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.730
is a huge failure, and
the relatively ugly

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.670
pixelated game--
thinking about Minecraft,

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.410
or Runescape--
they're known to not

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.540
have the most pristine
graphics, but people are just

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.615
really addicted to those games.

00:09:50.615 --> 00:09:51.990
So after a few
years of research,

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.670
I realized that all the
successful games have now

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.400
what I call the eight core
drives of motivation in them.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.924
And so I published this on
my-- the octalysis framework,

00:10:00.924 --> 00:10:02.465
so it's called
octalysis because it's

00:10:02.465 --> 00:10:05.305
analysis based on an
octagon shape-- on my blog

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:06.680
and then it was
really picked up.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.890
So it was organically
translated into about I

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.762
think over 18 different
languages, which

00:10:11.762 --> 00:10:14.220
is how I got started getting
a lot of speaker opportunities

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.400
and workshops and whatnot.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.400
And so inside there's the
eight core drives, outside

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.990
there's a list of different
types of game design elements

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.420
that bring out
those core drives.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.322
But this is a busy chart,
so at the beginning

00:10:25.322 --> 00:10:27.530
we only want to focus on
the center, those eight core

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.260
drives.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.890
So I believe that every single
thing you do, inside or outside

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.756
of those games, are
based on one or more

00:10:34.756 --> 00:10:35.880
of these eight core drives.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.338
Which means that if there's
none of these eight core drives

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:40.110
there, there's zero motivation.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.520
No behavior happens.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.434
You guys are all here
because of at least one

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:44.850
of those eight
core drives, right?

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.560
Some of you are just curious,
so that's core drive seven,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.945
Unpredictability and Curiosity.

00:10:48.945 --> 00:10:50.570
Some of it is your
friend asked you to,

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.400
so Social Influence
and Relatedness.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.484
Some people really think
that maybe this knowledge

00:10:54.484 --> 00:10:55.983
can help me change
the world, that's

00:10:55.983 --> 00:10:57.140
epic meaning and calling.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.370
I don't think anyone here is
like that, but in some workshop

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.390
it's Loss and Avoidance--
Oh, I don't want to get fired

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.270
so I'm going to show
up to the workshop.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.187
And so, it's all
these core drives.

00:11:05.187 --> 00:11:07.020
I'm going to go through
them, one at a time,

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.710
and show some examples about how
these core drives are utilized

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.060
in products, in our lives, in
the workplace, and whatnot.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.770
So the first core drive is
Epic Meaning and Calling.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.450
So this is the drive
that says, we're

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.700
motivated because we feel
like we're part of something

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.014
bigger than ourselves.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.930
And I believe that this
is the core drive that

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.650
motivates people towards
contributing to Wikipedia.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.040
We all know that people
don't contribute to Wikipedia

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.570
because they make money from it.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.500
But they don't even use it to
update their resumes, right?

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.980
People contribute to
Wikipedia because they

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.850
feel like they're protecting
humanity's knowledge, something

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.140
bigger than themselves.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.970
So you see that
theme a lot in games.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.850
In games, a lot of
time it's about, oh,

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.400
the world's about to
end, but somehow you're

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.000
the only person qualified
to save the world.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.330
It's very engaging,
motivating, yeah, I do it.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.560
And there's a lot--
even Wikipedia, right.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.802
When I was writing my
book, I had a hunch

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:00.760
that I felt like maybe
these people aren't just

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.150
doing this work for
Wikipedia for free,

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.160
they're probably also
the biggest donors.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.840
So I looked it up,
and sure enough,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.860
the majority of
Wikipedia donations

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.500
come from those people
who spent a lot of time,

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.370
almost on a daily basis, to
contributing to these things.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.340
And if you think
of that workflow,

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.300
it's almost like grunt work you
give to entry level interns.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.424
It's basically, if you give an
intern a stack of 1,000 pages

00:12:23.424 --> 00:12:25.090
and say, oh, go through
all these pages.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.370
Inside, there's going
to be some inaccuracies.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.840
I want you to flag
them, I want you

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.042
to see what's not important.

00:12:30.042 --> 00:12:32.500
I want you to review what your
colleague, the other intern,

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.480
flagged and decide if you
want to remove it or not.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.860
We know that this is
not fun, exciting work.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:38.591
It's grunt work.

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.090
Someone has to pay their dues,
so you give it to the intern.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.744
But again, people finish
their work, they go home,

00:12:43.744 --> 00:12:45.660
and they can spend hours
doing this grunt work

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.880
for free because of the
epic meaning and calling.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.370
Now, I want to show a
quick video about how,

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.960
for instance, an app uses epic
meaning and calling to get kids

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.040
with cancer at Children's
Hospital to update their pain

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.685
journals, called Pain Squad.

00:12:59.685 --> 00:13:01.050
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.710
-This is the Hospital for
Sick Children in Toronto.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.410
Within these walls, every single
year, thousands of children

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.840
are battling cancer
and are having

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.350
to undergo terribly
painful treatments.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.450
Children like Olivia,
who eight months ago was

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.355
diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma.

00:13:14.355 --> 00:13:17.340
The hospital's continually
trying to minimize this pain,

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.469
but to do it, they must
first understand it better.

00:13:19.469 --> 00:13:21.385
And most importantly,
discover the medications

00:13:21.385 --> 00:13:22.950
that are working best.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.700
To do this, they need
these young patients

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.050
to record exactly how they're
feeling in a pain journal.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.330
The challenge is that
after multiple chemotherapy

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:31.990
and radiation
treatments, many kids

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.760
are too tired or discouraged
to even hold a pen,

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.040
much less keep a
detailed journal.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.040
And the sad reality is
that if this data is not

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.690
collected daily, it's useless.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.240
We needed to find a creative
solution to collect data

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.350
every single day.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.790
And with the Pain Squad mobile
app, that's just what we did.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.575
To begin, our
patients were enlisted

00:13:51.575 --> 00:13:54.870
as recruits in Pain Squad, a
special police force dedicated

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.070
to hunting down pain.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.130
We gave each recruit
an Apple iPhone, loaded

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.990
with the Pain Squad mobile app.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.134
Then twice a day, an
alert from headquarters

00:14:02.134 --> 00:14:04.550
told patients it was time to
complete their pain reporting

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.146
mission.

00:14:05.146 --> 00:14:07.020
Because the reports
worked with iPhone's user

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.664
friendly touchscreen, kids
could easily fill them out.

00:14:09.664 --> 00:14:11.080
With a simple flick
of the finger,

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.690
they could identify exactly
where and how much it hurt,

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.130
as well as which medications
were working best.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.920
But making it easy was,
well, the easy part.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.670
We knew to be truly
successful, we

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.080
needed to find a
way to encourage

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.600
our young target daily.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.400
So we called in some
police reinforcements.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.390
-Hey, rookie.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.072
Welcome to Pain Squad.

00:14:29.072 --> 00:14:30.380
It's really great you're here.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.550
We need all the help we can get
to help put pain in it's place.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.500
-We brought together the cast
of Canada's top police dramas,

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.430
"Flashpoint" and "Rookie
Blue," and filmed

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.480
a series of inspiring
videos, then

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.100
deployed them
throughout the app.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.350
To encourage the kids to
fill in their reports,

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.300
we built in a
graduation structure.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.630
When a recruit completed
three reports in a row,

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.020
they received a message
from HQ, informing them

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.540
that they were
moving up the ranks.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.620
-You are now officially
a full-fledged detective

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.300
in Pain Squad.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.100
-Well done.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.980
At this rate, you might
even be the next Chief.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.270
-They just don't make
them like you anymore.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.810
-You truly are one of Pain
Squad's best and brightest.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.281
Keep it up.

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.107
-Back inside the
precinct, recruits

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:10.190
could check to see when
to fill out their reports,

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.810
and how many badges
they had earned.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.610
And once their last
report was filed,

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.090
they were sent
one final message,

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.790
informing them that they were
being retired from the field.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.080
-But this case isn't closed yet.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.830
Your squad is still fighting.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:27.690
Couldn't have done it
without you, so way to go.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.400
-The Pain Squad app is now
set to roll out into four

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.919
other Canadian hospitals.

00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:33.460
And due to it's
success, it will soon

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.516
be made available everywhere.

00:15:36.516 --> 00:15:39.200
-The app is an excellent tool.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.914
That's her control
over the pain,

00:15:41.914 --> 00:15:44.210
because she's able to
document it herself,

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.410
but she's using an app.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.030
She just glides
right through it,

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.506
and it makes her feel
that she's a part of this.

00:15:50.506 --> 00:15:53.492
It's fantastic that you all
were able to come up with this.

00:15:53.492 --> 00:15:54.980
It really helps.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.480
-Just got the word from Chief.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.120
Turns out, you were
doing so great,

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.990
he feels like you're
ready to move up.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.830
You're well on your way to
putting Pain in it's place.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.030
Don't stop now,
you're almost there.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.760
-Congratulations!

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.720
-Cool.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.660
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.654
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:14.654 --> 00:16:15.320
YU-KAI CHOU: OK.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.640
So it's hard to empathize
with, but if you can,

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.486
imagine if you were
a child with cancer

00:16:21.486 --> 00:16:23.270
at a Children's Hospital.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.510
You feel like you're very
lonely, the world doesn't care.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.519
And when you go through an
extremely painful session,

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:32.810
the last thing you want to
do is take out a little book

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.650
and write, oh, where does it
hurt, how much does that hurt?

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.280
So the Pain Squad
brings the experience

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.740
into like an epic theme, where
you have a whole team of people

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.840
out there, serious looking
people, they depend on you,

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.120
they depend on your effort.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.420
And it's really tying it into
something bigger than yourself.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.460
And you can see
early on that there's

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.410
one key term they
said, "well, making

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.870
it easy was the easy part."

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.070
A lot of technology,
when we look at them,

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.720
it's about making it easy,
simple, straightforward.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.380
But where's the motivation?

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.335
Because if people have
no motivation, then

00:17:05.335 --> 00:17:08.630
it doesn't matter how easy it
is, people just won't do it.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.380
So what I really respect
about Pain Squad,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.754
they didn't just
say, oh, we want

00:17:11.754 --> 00:17:14.170
this epic meaning and calling,
they doubled down on it.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.060
So they hired a lot of
these-- not real police,

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.910
but famous actors-- actors
from famous police shows.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.369
And they start
filming this video.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.910
So now the user--
the child-- can see,

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.550
oh I'm getting courage, I'm
feeling, I'm levelling up.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.350
And that feeling
is a strong kind

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.420
of epic meaning and
calling in that experience.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:36.560
So again, I was really impressed
by how they, not only saw

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.380
that vision, but was like, we
need to fully motivate them

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.160
with that type of core drive
one, epic meaning and calling.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.697
Now, some people come to me
and say Hey, Yu-kai, you know,

00:17:44.697 --> 00:17:47.030
that's cool, it's changing
the world and all this stuff.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.870
But we're just a tool.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.120
We're just useful, functional.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.670
Like, how do you bring
epic meaning and calling

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.240
to your tool?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.940
There's no fun purpose to it
or world changing thing to it.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.150
And so I like to
bring up the GPS app

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.830
Waze, which Google purchased.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.989
So when you think about
a GPS or navigation tool,

00:18:04.989 --> 00:18:07.030
you don't think about it
as something fun, right?

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:07.905
It's very functional.

00:18:07.905 --> 00:18:10.930
You turn left, turn right,
get to your destination.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.410
Just very functional.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.780
And so when Waze came out,
I think seven years ago,

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.330
from Israel as a
startup, they were

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.170
in a market with a
lot of heavy players,

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.824
a lot of companies with a lot
of market share, a lot of money.

00:18:22.824 --> 00:18:23.990
And so they had to innovate.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.550
So they add a lot
of gamification

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.510
to their experience.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.650
Some are fluffy,
some were great.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.550
But of course, they
had to try new things.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.570
The one thing that I really
respected what they were doing

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.630
was they also added the
epic meaning and calling

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.260
into their onboarding process.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:41.190
So in the early days, when
you first sign up to Waze,

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:42.154
they show you an image.

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:43.570
And on the left
side of the image,

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.010
they show you this
big snake monster.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.360
And the snake monster
is made out of a road

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.644
with cars stuck on it.

00:18:49.644 --> 00:18:51.810
And the name of the snake
monster is called traffic.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.060
Well, they didn't name
it, but it's implicit

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.240
that it's called Traffic.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.300
On the right side, you
see cute little Wazers,

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.110
with nice helmets, and swords,
and shows them working together

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.900
to fight this big snake monster.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.850
And below, it has one tagline.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.230
"Beat traffic together."

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.906
So when you are
driving with Waze on,

00:19:07.906 --> 00:19:10.030
you're no longer just again
turning left and right,

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.480
getting to your
workplace, you're

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.700
helping a huge community
of brave Waze knights

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.790
battle this huge
monster called traffic.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.470
And of course, no
one likes traffic.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.950
Everyone hates traffic.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.220
And the way to take down traffic
is to drive with Waze on.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.190
Because Waze is a
user-generated GPS,

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.320
as you drive with Waze
on, you're absorbing

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.360
the information, the data about
where's the traffic, where's

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.420
the car stuck on the road,
where's the policeman?

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.425
And so now, even if you know
how to drive to your workplace,

00:19:37.425 --> 00:19:38.800
you still want to
drive with Waze

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.170
on because you feel like
you're contributing to a higher

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:41.934
vision.

00:19:41.934 --> 00:19:44.350
And the powerful thing about
this epic meaning and calling

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.270
is that sometimes
it makes people

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.440
do things that are against
their self-interest.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.860
So in the early days,
because it's user generated,

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.110
sometimes Waze
wasn't very accurate,

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.670
so it took me to the wrong
location about two to three

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.370
times, and I was 15 to 20
minutes late to my meeting.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.622
And you think most cases, when
you fail at the only thing

00:20:01.622 --> 00:20:04.080
you're promising-- because the
only thing that a navigation

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.621
app is supposed to do is take
you to the right place-- and so

00:20:06.621 --> 00:20:09.320
most times, if you fail at
the only thing you're supposed

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.970
to be good at, people will say,
well, this is a piece of crap,

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.180
I'm going to delete it.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.060
But in the case of
Waze, a lot of times

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.220
when it takes people to
the wrong place, not only

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.600
do they not get angry,
they panic and say,

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.530
oh no, the map is broken,
I need to go fix it.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.670
And how powerful is that?

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.680
When you fail at that one thing
you're supposed to be good at,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.920
people aren't mad at
you, they want to fix it.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.170
And again, it's because this
epic meaning and calling,

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.400
core drive one, is
not about what I want,

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.480
what I get out of it,
my benefits of it.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.700
It's really about how I can
give up myself for that higher

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.404
vision, for that vision.

00:20:42.404 --> 00:20:44.070
And when you see a
crack in that vision,

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.700
you actually want to work
hard to cover that vision,

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.640
so other people don't see that.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.750
Sometimes a company can build
that epic meaning and calling

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.260
into their own brand.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.270
So throughout the years, I've
had friends walk up to me

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.780
and say, hey, Yu-kai, I'm saving
up to buy the next iPhone.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.890
Hopefully no one's on the
Android team over here.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:07.130
I'm like, well you don't even
know what's in the next iPhone,

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.060
it could suck.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.643
And they're like, I
don't care Yu-kai,

00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:11.420
I'm buying the next iPhone.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.880
And so what you see here is this
person first self-identifies

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.824
as an Apple person,
and then they

00:21:16.824 --> 00:21:18.740
need to do everything
Apple people need to do,

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.610
which is by iPhones, iPads
MacBooks, walk around and say,

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.260
well, I don't have that
problem because I use a Mac.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.750
I'm personally guilty of
that, especially when I'm

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:31.290
watching my wife use her
PCs, very frustrated.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.450
But that's why this image
could be kind of funny.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.283
It says, well, you think
your Mac's so cool,

00:21:35.283 --> 00:21:38.170
can you do this
super Windows trick?

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.550
But this is an accidental.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.850
Apple very intently built
that epic meaning and calling

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:43.640
into their brand.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.580
If you think about the two most
successful commercials Apple's

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.630
ever done in history, the
first one was called 1984,

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.300
and the other one was
called Think Different.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.210
And so the 1984, for
those who don't know,

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.780
was launched in 1984
in the Super Bowl ad.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.510
And they were basically
saying that because of Apple

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:07.470
computers, 1984 won't be like
George Orwell's dystopian

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:12.942
society novel, "1984," and
IBM won't be the big brother

00:22:12.942 --> 00:22:13.900
controlling everything.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.460
So Apple liberates human beings.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.080
And Think Different
is the campaign

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.800
that's about 15 years ago.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.070
And it's about, oh,
here's to the crazy ones,

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.960
because those crazy enough to
think they can change the world

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.630
are the ones who do.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:28.750
So those were the
two big campaigns.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.570
And what's interesting
about those two commercials

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.000
is that none of them
talk about products.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.166
They don't talk about, oh,
we have color screen now.

00:22:36.166 --> 00:22:37.025
We have more RAM.

00:22:37.025 --> 00:22:38.150
We have more storage space.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.020
That's what all their
competitors are doing.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.880
Apple just says, well, we
believe in this vision.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.880
If you're part of this vision,
then you're an Apple person.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.884
So in 1984, people are
like, oh, that's amazing.

00:22:47.884 --> 00:22:49.800
I want to be part of
this liberation movement.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.920
An And of course, the way to
do that is to own a Macintosh.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.990
And then later on, it's
like, oh, Think Different.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.220
Oh, that's amazing, I want
to be the crazy ones who

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.310
change the world.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.700
And of course,
the way to do that

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.370
is to have 1,000
songs in your pocket.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.467
And so, it's all about
that vision, that belief.

00:23:07.467 --> 00:23:10.050
You don't even need to know what
they sell, but it's about, oh

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.900
I believe in this vision.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.720
And so then people become
irrational about it.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.170
It's like, oh, well
Androids have better specs,

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.840
it's a better deal
and all that stuff,

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.110
so you should look at it.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.610
No!

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.659
I'm Apple person,
I need to go Apple.

00:23:22.659 --> 00:23:24.450
And I believe that epic
meaning and calling

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.052
will stay until Apple
does something stupid

00:23:27.052 --> 00:23:29.010
and it's no longer a
vision worth believing in.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.260
They mess up with the privacy.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.510
It's like, oh, now they're
like an evil empire,

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.010
they're the big
brother, or whatnot.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:35.390
And that's when people
will say, maybe I

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.723
should look at the specs
again, it's kind of overpriced.

00:23:37.723 --> 00:23:38.472
Things like that.

00:23:38.472 --> 00:23:39.930
So that epic meaning
and calling is

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.059
very important in a lot
of different aspects, when

00:23:42.059 --> 00:23:42.850
you think about it.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:44.801
I think Google has a
very strong type of epic

00:23:44.801 --> 00:23:46.300
meaning and calling
in it's culture,

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.508
especially in the early days.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.400
In the early days,
the Google founders--

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.025
when I was reading all the books
about Google-- they're saying,

00:23:55.025 --> 00:23:56.740
well, we want to
create an environment

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.190
where we would like to work at.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.860
So they assume that
every employee at Google

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.316
either is an entrepreneur or
wants to be an entrepreneur.

00:24:03.316 --> 00:24:04.690
So no one's going
to be at Google

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.230
just because they have to be
there, they get paid for it.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.557
It's kind of like what we
call-- talk about games ride.

00:24:09.557 --> 00:24:12.140
The moment a game is no longer
enjoyable, they leave the game.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:12.910
They play another game.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:14.743
So Google was thinking
about the same thing.

00:24:14.743 --> 00:24:16.170
How do we get
people to stay here?

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.670
And so they're thinking about,
OK, epic meaning and calling.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.170
They have a few
different core drives,

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.336
but one of the things about
epic meaning and calling

00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:25.080
is about one, we organize the
world's information, and two,

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.220
we do no evil.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.810
So now some
developer's say, well I

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.840
could get a paycheck
anywhere, but at Google, I

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.380
feel like I'm changing
the world and I'm

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.800
being part of the good guys,
and that's important to me.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.960
And so that's part
of the motivations,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.095
the early design of a human
focused design for culture.

00:24:41.095 --> 00:24:44.680
Core drive two is development
and accomplishment.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.010
So this a drive that says
we feel motivated because we

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.870
are leveling up, we're
achieving mastery,

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.310
we're improving ourselves.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.240
And that's a very
engaging process.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.410
So this is where
most of the points,

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.660
and badges, and
leaderboards fall into.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.420
So points are just
counters, right?

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.187
They show you a
sense of development.

00:25:01.187 --> 00:25:02.770
So it's like, oh
well, even though I'm

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.386
doing the exact same things,
every day, over and over again,

00:25:05.386 --> 00:25:06.760
at least I see
this number go up,

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.176
or this progress
bar more forward,

00:25:08.176 --> 00:25:10.830
so I feel a sense of
progress and development.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.620
Badges are basically
achievement symbols,

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.351
so they symbolize
accomplishment.

00:25:16.351 --> 00:25:18.600
And achievement symbols could
be many different forms.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.800
It could be badges, or it
could be uniforms, helmets,

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.660
black belt, white belt, your
avatar changes, better frames

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.890
around your profile.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.540
But the key is that it must
symbolize accomplishment.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.200
If you give people a badge
for every silly thing they do,

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.510
there's no core drive two.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.840
It's just insulting.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.110
And one of the key examples
that use a lot of gamification

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.280
in eCommerce, eBay.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.780
Some people over
the years are like,

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.800
I don't believe in gamification.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.180
I don't believe it'll ever work.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:50.080
Well, did you know eBay
was one of the biggest

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.310
gamified eCommerce sites.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.750
They're like, oh, I
never thought about that.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.780
If you think about a
generic eCommerce website,

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.930
it's not necessarily
intuitive to have

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:03.820
this competitive bidding system,
to have this mutual feedback

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.160
system, this little path to
level up from a yellow star

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.250
seller, to a blue star,
to a power-rated seller.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.980
And I remember when I was eBay
seller, maybe 12 years ago,

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.940
I'd had 10 positive
feedback, and they send me

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.350
this certificate, signed
by the CEO, saying yay,

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.586
you're a yellow star seller.

00:26:21.586 --> 00:26:22.960
And I was so
excited at the time,

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.410
I printed it out and
put it on my wall.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.300
And it's probably still
with my parents somewhere.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.620
But again, that's from
the seller's side.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.430
But on the buyer's
side, there's also

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.870
that sense of accomplishment.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.999
Because when you
bought things on eBay,

00:26:35.999 --> 00:26:37.540
you didn't just buy
something, right?

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.770
No, because anyone with
money can buy things.

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:40.680
That's boring.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.320
No, when you bought something
on eBay, you feel like you won.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.860
Sure, maybe you overpaid
by 10, 20% than what

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.680
you would otherwise
pay, but at least you

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.666
beat those 10 other bastards
that we're bidding against you.

00:26:51.666 --> 00:26:54.290
And so that's why people, every
day, every hour they come back,

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.440
did someone outbid me,
did someone outbid me?

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.450
Ugh, the outbid me, I've
got to bid them back.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:01.010
So that becomes a very engaging
process, where some people say,

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.950
oh, it's addictive experience
from both the buyers

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.510
and sellers.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:08.770
Now, another company that use
this core drive development

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.170
accomplishment is Twitter.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.910
So most people remember
Twitter's innovation

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:16.330
being limiting your characters,
your messages to 140

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.430
characters.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.120
But very few people remember
that oh, Twitter also pioneered

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.520
the one-way follow.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.230
At Twitter's time,
back in the day,

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.610
social network was two-way.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.387
You invite me to
be a friend, and I

00:27:28.387 --> 00:27:30.220
don't want to make you
feel bad, so I accept

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.850
and we're both friends now.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.280
But Twitter comes
out and Twitter

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.770
says, no, you can
follow me, but I

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.020
don't have to follow you back.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.269
Which means if a million
people follow me and I follow

00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:42.730
zero back, I'm super awesome.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.310
I'm a rock star, man.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:48.350
And so, this is when A-list
celebrities like Ashton Kutcher

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.440
decided to raise a
challenge against CNN

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.210
to see who can reach
a million followers.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.530
And you know, Ashton Kutcher
is an A-list celebrity.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.540
He has hundreds of
millions of fans,

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.340
so why does he really
care about that million?

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.230
But it's hard.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.660
It's hard to get followers.

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:07.350
And this is very important
because at the time,

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.510
a lot of these technologies were
just stuck in Silicon Valley,

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.220
with people who read
"TechCrunch" and whatnot.

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.930
But it never got
into the mainstream.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.450
But because an A-list
celebrity like Ashton Kutcher

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.720
wanted to do this
challenge, suddenly you

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.510
have all these little girls,
they're doing the videos.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:25.260
Hey, vote for Ashton on
this thing called Twitter.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.510
We love you, Ashton.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.417
And then CNN wants
to do that too,

00:28:28.417 --> 00:28:30.000
but they need to be
more professional.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.877
So on every news they're
like, follow us on CNN.

00:28:33.877 --> 00:28:35.960
Being professional just
means having a lower tone.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:42.060
So you can see here that, at
the end, Ashton Kutcher won.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.690
So he's like, "Victory is ours!"

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:44.830
10 exclamation marks.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.915
He's so excited, so
pumped, so happy.

00:28:46.915 --> 00:28:49.040
And again, why does he care
about that one million?

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.220
It's because it gives them
a sense of accomplishment.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.915
And CNN, as you can see,
they were good sports.

00:28:55.915 --> 00:28:58.040
So they said, "Ashton
Kutcher is the first to reach

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.390
a million followers contest.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.420
Congratulations."

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.800
And you can see there that
CNN had 999,652 followers.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.550
So they were only 350
followers away from winning.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.110
But again, he won.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.960
So that's why, when I work with
clients or I tell companies,

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.770
you don't ask, do
you have badges?

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:17.480
You ask them, do you make
your users feel accomplished?

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.730
Because having badges can
insult them, could make them

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:20.520
feel accomplished.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.520
You could go either way.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.990
So the core drive is more
important than the game design

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.370
elements.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.390
Core drive three is empowerment
of creativity and feedback.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.820
So that's kind of like LEGO.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.762
You give users the
basic building blocks,

00:29:31.762 --> 00:29:33.720
and there's an infinite
amount of ways for them

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.830
to use it creatively, try a
different strategy combos,

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.360
see feedback, and then
go back and adjust.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.770
And that a very
engaging process.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.550
And you'll see
later that this is

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.040
what we call a white
hat intrinsic motivation

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.890
core drive, it's
on the right top,

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.520
which means that it's an
evergreen type of mechanic.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.870
It allows people to
stay on for the launch

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.140
of 10 years, 50 years.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.320
All the timeless games
like chess, like poker

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.290
has this core drive.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.440
If you think about
chess, very simple game.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.580
64 squares, 32 pieces.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.110
But people have been
playing it for centuries.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.750
And today, it's still fun.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.980
They don't have to be like,
every week, hey, here's

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.400
a new board, here's a new piece.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.049
A new hero enters the
scene, here's a new quest.

00:30:13.049 --> 00:30:15.090
They don't have to do that
because our brains are

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.000
entertaining itself.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.770
It's just like all this
creativity and feedback

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:21.770
allows us to make you
feel very interested.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.670
And so some people come to
me and say, hey, Yu-kai,

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:28.620
most people play games for two
to six months and they quit.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.650
So if we gamify
our product, are we

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.110
shooting ourselves in the foot?

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.240
And the answer is
no, for two reasons.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.070
The first reason is because
earlier, remember I said,

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.840
you never have to play a game.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.820
The moment a game is no longer
fun, you leave the game.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.140
Well, hopefully your product,
your training program,

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.470
whatever it is, has
a purpose to it.

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:51.970
So even if it's not fun,
people probably should do it,

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.345
and chances are, right
now it's not that fun

00:30:54.345 --> 00:30:55.470
and they're still doing it.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:58.430
So just attempting to make
it more engaging probably

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:01.310
wouldn't result in people
just leaving because of that.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.900
But the second reason is
because a lot of these games

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.290
don't design for the
end game very well.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.790
And so when you
reach the end game--

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.873
and we'll talk about the
a little bit later-- when

00:31:10.873 --> 00:31:14.700
you reach the end game, most
people lose that excitement.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.130
So it's like what motivation
do I have to stay here?

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:19.910
But games that
design their end game

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:21.360
well, especially
core drive three,

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.985
empowerment of
creativity and feedback,

00:31:22.985 --> 00:31:24.720
people play it for decades.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.450
So this is StarCraft II.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.350
So when StarCraft I came
out in 1998, a lot of people

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:30.090
played it.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.250
And when StarCraft II
came out, I think 2011,

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:35.530
almost 15 years
later, a lot of people

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.800
were still playing
StarCraft I and they

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.862
didn't want it to switch.

00:31:38.862 --> 00:31:41.195
And it became so popular that
it became a national sport

00:31:41.195 --> 00:31:42.640
in South Korea.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.470
They had three TV
channels dedicated

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.800
to StarCraft competitions.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.240
You not only have full time
professional StarCraft players

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.880
that make over $300,000
a year, you also

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.930
have full-time
professional commentators

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:57.430
that also-- just
basically, all they

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:59.250
do is talk about what's
going in the match.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.390
So they were really
pioneers in eSports arena

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.040
that we see a lot these
days, on Twitch and whatnot.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.490
So this is like an arena,
where a lot of people

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:10.950
pay a ticket price to go up.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:12.500
And it's like a
rock star concert,

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.740
but onstage you just see
some gamers playing games.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.980
And there's millions of
dollars of prize money there.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.440
So again, when your game is
well designed for the end game,

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.780
especially when you have
empowerment of creativity

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.690
and feedback, you have an
evergreen type of mechanic

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.520
and people can play for a
very, very, very long time.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.340
This also matters
a lot in education.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.660
So if you look at kids who
played card games like Magic

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.100
The Gathering, or
Pokemon, or Yu-Gi-Oh!,

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.930
they have to remember
a ton of information.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.740
There's usually
over 1,000 cards.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:44.460
Every card has a lot of
different stats, their health,

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.840
defense, whatnot.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.920
And the kids who
play this not only

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.810
memorize every single
card, they remember things

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.750
like oh, your card counters
my card, counters his card.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.050
If you think about it, that's
actually more information

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.980
than in the periodic table.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.710
So it's like these kids not only
memorize every single element

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:04.260
on the periodic table, they
memorize the exact placement,

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.090
the exact weight,
and exactly how

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:08.529
every single element interacts
with every other element.

00:33:08.529 --> 00:33:11.070
So they'll know things like this
plus this plus this together

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.930
is the granite combo, but if
you switch the order round,

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.350
it becomes the diamond
combo, it's more powerful.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.670
It's mind blowing.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:20.430
But if you ask the same kid, oh,
so what is the fourth element?

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.710
I don't know, oxygen nitrogen?

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.010
Helium?

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.280
And it's not like this kid
suddenly went from a genius

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.290
to an idiot, it's because
of a motivation difference.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:34.470
For the periodic table, they
study this to pass their test,

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.130
not get in trouble
with their parents.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.505
And they study hard enough to
get their acceptable score.

00:33:38.505 --> 00:33:40.546
Doesn't matter whether
it's A student, B student.

00:33:40.546 --> 00:33:43.000
They get it to their
acceptable score and they stop.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.050
And they probably go
on and play games.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.480
But when they
study, when they're

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.980
looking at the card
games-- every single card

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.800
allows them to
become more powerful,

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.230
utilize more strategies,
beat their friends--

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.790
and so as a means
to an end, if they

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:00.220
have to memorize a lot of
information, that's not only

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.060
tolerable, that's enjoyable.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.980
So a lot of times,
education should really

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.540
be about how do you empower
them to use their creativity

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.870
to learn more things.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.520
Core drive four is
ownership and possession.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.497
So this is the drive
that says because we

00:34:15.497 --> 00:34:17.580
feel like we own something,
we want to improve it,

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.489
we want to protect it, and
we want to get more of it.

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:24.560
So this obviously deals with
things like virtual currencies

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.010
and virtual goods,
but it's also so

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:29.889
the drive that makes us want
to accumulate wealth or collect

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:31.511
stamps, things like that.

00:34:31.511 --> 00:34:33.219
It also has things
that are a little more

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:35.150
abstract, like if we
spend a lot of time

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:38.870
customizing our profile,
or Dropbox folders,

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.010
or our avatars.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.409
We feel more attachment
and ownership over it.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:45.727
There's also another thing I
call The Alfred Effect, which

00:34:45.727 --> 00:34:47.310
is if the system's
constantly learning

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:49.810
about your preferences, what
you like, what you enjoy,

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:53.179
and serving that to you
before you even ask for it,

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:56.190
then even if the new technology
comes out that's supposedly

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.400
better and smarter, you
don't want to switch, right?

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.316
Because that technology
doesn't understand me.

00:35:00.316 --> 00:35:02.270
This one does,
this is my system.

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:05.200
So I call it The Alfred Effect,
like Batman with Alfred.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.640
If a random person knocks
on Batman's door and said,

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.640
hey, you know I could
replace Alfred because I'm

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.380
younger and more efficient.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.200
Hire me.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.866
Batman's not going
to do it because he's

00:35:13.866 --> 00:35:15.720
like, well, you didn't
grow up with me,

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.845
you don't know what I want.

00:35:16.845 --> 00:35:17.790
You're not Alfred.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:20.390
And so sometimes a
lot of understanding

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.950
what the user wants and
serving that early on now

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:25.790
creates a stickiness to
that product excitement

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.880
and engagement.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.379
So I was a advisor to a gaming
company called to Loki studios.

00:35:31.379 --> 00:35:33.420
They had this game called
Geomon back in the day,

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.690
probably five years ago.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.071
And Geomon is like a game
kind of like a Pokemon,

00:35:37.071 --> 00:35:39.570
where you go around and capture
monsters and you train them.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.750
The difference is that
the monsters you capture

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:44.230
is based on your
physical location,

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.886
depending on your cell phone.

00:35:45.886 --> 00:35:47.261
So if you're next
to a river, you

00:35:47.261 --> 00:35:48.520
can capture a river monster.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.660
If you're on the mountain,
capture a mountain monster.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:57.360
And in Geomon, they have this
theme of the four season deer.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:03.250
So there's the summer fire deer,
the winter ice deer, et cetera.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.590
The things is, once you have
two or three of the four season

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:08.400
deer, we automatically
want them all.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.390
It's kind of just awkward having
two or three of the four season

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.940
deer.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.200
Now the problem is that you
can only capture this deer

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.129
at the right season.

00:36:17.129 --> 00:36:18.920
So for the gamers, that
means they probably

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.545
have to wait three to six months
before they can get all of it.

00:36:21.545 --> 00:36:25.230
And to the gamer, this is like
a huge amount of wait time.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:28.600
So in the game, a lot of people
were obsessed about trading

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.660
for these four season deer.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.070
Some people really
paid real money for it,

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.550
just so they can
collect all of them.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.800
And these four season deers
aren't even that powerful.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.030
You almost never
use them in battle.

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:44.380
It's just nice to
have that collection.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.940
And so this company,
this game was actually

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.480
bought by Yahoo years back
and Yahoo shut it down.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.356
And the gamers-- the
gamers didn't know that.

00:36:52.356 --> 00:36:54.688
The gamers thought the startup
was running out of money.

00:36:54.688 --> 00:36:57.080
So all these gamers, a lot of
them were high school kids,

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.090
they banded together
and they raised

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:01.980
a commitment of
$700,000, to see if they

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.270
could keep the game alive.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:04.860
Because they're like,
oh I spent so much time

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.359
collecting all these monsters,
and that ownership possession

00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:09.060
drive really motivated
them forward.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.062
We'll come back to this game
later in another core drive.

00:37:12.062 --> 00:37:14.020
So that's a collection
set type of game design,

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.228
but a collection set has
been used in other ways too.

00:37:16.228 --> 00:37:19.640
So one example is the
McDonald's Monopoly game,

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.070
where McDonald's wants people
to buy more soft drinks

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.516
and fries because they
get more margins on that.

00:37:25.516 --> 00:37:27.890
So they did something where
whenever you do these desired

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:29.750
behavior, you buy
over there, they

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.210
gave you a little piece of
property on the Monopoly board.

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:36.600
And if we collect all of them,
then you unlock a big reward.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.360
And so even though these
parts by themselves

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.804
are not worth anything,
unless you have all of it,

00:37:43.804 --> 00:37:45.720
people were so obsessed
about collecting them,

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.950
sometimes they don't
care about the food,

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:49.230
they don't even like the food,
but they're at McDonald's just

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:50.372
to collect these parts.

00:37:50.372 --> 00:37:51.830
And sometimes they
spend real money

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:56.010
to also by the collectible
properties from other people,

00:37:56.010 --> 00:38:00.430
just so they can get
closer to their completion.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.857
Core drive five is social
influence and relatedness.

00:38:02.857 --> 00:38:04.690
So this the drive that
says everything we do

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:07.270
is based on what other
people do, think, or say.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:10.290
So this goes into things like
collaboration, competition

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:14.230
envy, group quiesce, gifting
which is social treasuring,

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.240
but it also has this
relatedness piece.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.780
So if you see a product that
reminds you of your childhood,

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.540
you automatically have a higher
chance of buying the product.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.450
If you meet someone
from the same hometown,

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:26.220
you have a higher
chance of striking up

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.240
a deal with that person.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.520
So one theme in the social
influence core drive

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.400
is the group quests.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.270
So a group quest has been in
games for a very long time.

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:40.820
It's like if you
can beat the boss,

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.480
you can reach a win-state
and a lot of amazing rewards.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.655
However, the only
way to beat the boss

00:38:45.655 --> 00:38:47.030
and reach the
win-state is if you

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.820
have a lot of players
participating together,

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.540
to fight the boss.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.510
So this has been in
games for a long time.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.350
And more relatively
recently, businesses

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.710
saw that, hey, we could apply
this kind of group quest

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:01.242
mechanism into business.

00:39:01.242 --> 00:39:03.200
So then you have Groupon
coming out and saying,

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.220
hey, look, if you
reach the win-state,

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.550
you have a major
reward, a 50% discount.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.980
However, the only way
to reach the win-state

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.324
is if you have a lot of
people participating together.

00:39:12.324 --> 00:39:14.240
And so now people are
recruiting their friends

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.590
to be part of this quest.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:19.910
And so Groupon was allegedly
the fastest company

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:22.240
to reach a billion
dollars in valuation.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.530
And unfortunately, because
of some operational issues,

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.330
it didn't reach the potential
everyone wanted it to.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.280
I think it still made a
few billion last year.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.710
But we also know
Kickstarter, Indiegogo

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:36.540
very successfully utilizes
this group quest theme.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.082
So that's why a lot of time,
it's so intriguing and useful

00:39:40.082 --> 00:39:40.790
to look at games.

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:43.552
Because sometimes there's
these other brilliant ideas

00:39:43.552 --> 00:39:45.510
that are already in games
for a very long time.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.110
And if you just identify
what they were and bring it

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:53.230
into business, then maybe that's
the next billion dollar idea.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.240
Also there's a very important
theme on social norming,

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.110
in terms of how we like to
behave the way other people do.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.460
So OPower is SaaS
utility company

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.612
that tries to get people
to use less energy.

00:40:04.612 --> 00:40:06.320
And they tried a lot
of different things.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.150
They tried little
messages that say, hey,

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:10.956
this is how much money you would
save if you use less energy.

00:40:10.956 --> 00:40:12.080
And it doesn't really work.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.030
And they said, oh well,
you should be responsible,

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:18.412
should make the world a better
place, a very weak epic meaning

00:40:18.412 --> 00:40:19.120
and calling push.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.470
And people said, yeah,
maybe I should do something.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.570
But then they don't
change their behavior.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.450
So what they saw
work really, really

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.940
well was when they showed people
a chart that says, hey, look.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.140
This is where you're at.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.860
This is where your
average neighbor's at,

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.720
and this is where your
best neighbors at.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.678
And when people are like,
whoa wait a second, I

00:40:34.678 --> 00:40:36.600
know I'm not some
world saving hero,

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.960
but how can I be losing
to Bob down the street?

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.752
That makes no sense?

00:40:40.752 --> 00:40:42.710
And so suddenly, people
changed their behavior.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.700
So you want to show
them the social norm,

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.430
and then they change
their behavior.

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:49.985
A lot of people say Amazon--
well, eBay uses gamification,

00:40:49.985 --> 00:40:51.000
but Amazon does not.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.580
Actually, Amazon has a lot
of very subtle gamification

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.080
elements.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.390
There's a leaderboard
on the top reviewers,

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.140
there's this three
star, five star system.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:01.120
But one of the most successful
features Amazon reports

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.530
is their recommendation engine.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.190
Amazon says that 60%
of all their sales

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.890
came from people
clicking on this link

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.170
and then buying something.

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:13.100
And what does it say there?
"Customer who bought this also

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.290
bought."

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:15.930
It's basically telling
them, hey look,

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:18.330
a lot of people who are
just like you are spending

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:21.050
their money here, so maybe
you should spend your money

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:22.500
here too.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.430
So it's a lot of that social
influence and relatedness.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:28.740
We also now, as you scroll down,
we love the reviews, right?

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.470
And what's interesting
is that a lot of study

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:35.120
shows that we usually don't
trust the reviews from critics,

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.970
we trust the average
people that are

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.570
like us, which doesn't make any
sense, kind of, because it's

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:42.370
like, well, these
critics have dedicated

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.562
their lives to figuring out
what's good, what's bad,

00:41:44.562 --> 00:41:45.520
what's worth your time.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.404
They spend all this energy
writing a thoughtful piece,

00:41:48.404 --> 00:41:49.570
but people don't trust that.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.979
They're like, well, I believe
Bob has the right answer.

00:41:52.979 --> 00:41:54.270
Bob says, this book is awesome.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.809
Yeah!

00:41:54.809 --> 00:41:56.100
It must be awesome then, right?

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.300
I'd say it's kind of
like some guy says,

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.440
well my friend Michael,
he says the doctor's wrong

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.406
and Michael reads a lot
of health magazines.

00:42:03.406 --> 00:42:04.780
And it's like,
well why would you

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.119
think someone who reads
health magazines is better

00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:09.160
than someone would dedicates
his life to medicine

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.610
and went through Med school?

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:13.150
But again, we trust people
that are similar to us,

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:14.550
a social norming thing.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.070
So you have the reviews.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:16.810
We look at it.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.317
Like I said, there's
a top 1,000 reviewers.

00:42:19.317 --> 00:42:21.900
There's a lot of little subtle
gamification elements in Amazon

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.250
too.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:27.110
But you want to be very careful
because social norming works

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:27.950
both ways.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:30.740
If you tell people that
it's the social norm

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:35.270
to not-- everyone is
destroying the environment

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:37.930
and you should be better, then
that oftentimes does not work.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:41.290
So in Arizona, there was the
issue with a petrified wood

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:41.790
theft.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.136
So people were stealing
petrified wood,

00:42:44.136 --> 00:42:45.260
destroying the environment.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.343
So they did an experiment.

00:42:46.343 --> 00:42:48.090
They put on three
different signs.

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.985
The first sign says, oh,
for the past few years,

00:42:50.985 --> 00:42:53.360
thousands of people has been
stealing our petrified wood.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.026
It's terrible, destroys
the environment.

00:42:55.026 --> 00:42:56.560
Basically, don't do it.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.930
The second sign
just says, please

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:01.200
don't remove the petrified
wood from the park.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.580
And the third sign
is the control group,

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.850
it has no sign at all.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.630
So it's just like
see what people do.

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.200
And then they put some
easy to steal petrified

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.010
wood around the forest, to
see what people would do.

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.040
And so the results were
surprising for many people.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:19.150
So when there's no sign at
all, about 3% of the people

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.614
were stealing the
petrified wood.

00:43:20.614 --> 00:43:22.280
But when they just
put a sign that says,

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:26.490
please don't steal the wood,
it reduces by almost half.

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:28.390
1.67% people steal.

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:30.396
However, when you
show the sign that

00:43:30.396 --> 00:43:31.770
says many passengers
have removed

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.440
the petrified from
the park, blah, blah,

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.750
blah, suddenly 7.9% of
the people were stealing.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:40.880
So that sign at the top, it
not only does not deter crime,

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.500
it promotes crime.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.340
And the reason is
because people are like,

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:47.300
well it seems to be the crushing
norm that everyone is stealing.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.370
Maybe I should do it to.

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:52.410
So you want to be careful about
what you're telling people

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:53.600
as a social norm.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.620
It's true, sometimes
we put ourselves--

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.960
we want to be unique and
different in some environments,

00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.130
right?

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:00.460
But usually we
pick a few things,

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.870
like two or three
things, that we just

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.180
really want to be different on.

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.250
But then for everything else,
then we're on auto pilot.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:06.420
What toothpaste are you using?

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.128
Blah, blah, blah.

00:44:07.128 --> 00:44:09.800
It's based on the social norm,
what people like you are doing,

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.990
and also what we've always
been doing in the past.

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:15.430
Core drive six is
scarcity and impatience.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:18.990
So this is the drive that
says we want something

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.464
just because we can't have it.

00:44:20.464 --> 00:44:22.380
So if grapes are on the
table, we don't really

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.580
care about those grapes.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:27.620
Maybe we'll eat a few
because of convenience,

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.050
but we don't value them.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:32.800
But if these grapes were
locked behind the glass shelf,

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.904
just beyond your reach, then
we're always thinking about it.

00:44:35.904 --> 00:44:36.570
Can I have them?

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:37.445
When can I have them?

00:44:37.445 --> 00:44:38.770
Are they even sweet?

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:45.025
And so the exclusivity is
enough to drive the behavior.

00:44:45.025 --> 00:44:46.650
So that's kind of
how Facebook started.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.660
At the beginning,
Facebook said, oh we're

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:49.920
only for Harvard students.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.760
If you don't have a
Harvard.edu account, too bad.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.940
Can't use Facebook.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.720
And then Facebook
said, well we're

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.244
open to Harvard, a few Ivy
League schools and some schools

00:44:58.244 --> 00:44:59.910
your high school
buddies got in, but you

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:01.201
weren't smart enough to get in.

00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:02.262
Too bad for you.

00:45:02.262 --> 00:45:03.720
And then opened up
to more schools.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.290
So I remember in 2004
Facebook opened up

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.460
to UCLA, like everyone
rushed in to Facebook.

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:13.400
And not because they already
knew how amazing Facebook was--

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.810
because no one used it ever--
but that exclusivity itself,

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:19.140
because they couldn't go
in and suddenly they can,

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.590
that's when they rushed
into using Facebook.

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:25.032
Core drive six is
also a core drive

00:45:25.032 --> 00:45:27.490
where a lot of social mobile
games are used to monetize on.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:30.200
So some people go into
a game like Farmville

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.410
and say, this game
is kind of fun,

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:35.369
but I'll never spend real money
on a stupid game like this.

00:45:35.369 --> 00:45:36.910
And then eventually,
Farmville starts

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.076
to dangle this little mansion
in front of your face.

00:45:39.076 --> 00:45:39.951
And you're like, hmm.

00:45:39.951 --> 00:45:41.867
This mansion is pretty
interesting, let me see

00:45:41.867 --> 00:45:43.290
what I need to do to get it.

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.200
Oh man, I need to
do about 40 more

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.980
hours of farming to be able
to afford this mansion.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.400
That's a lot of farming, right?

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.340
Oh, but wait!

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:53.000
I just have to spend $5
and I could get the mansion

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:53.830
immediately.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.890
$5 to save 40 hours of my time?

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:59.180
That's a no brainer.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.670
And so now you're no
longer spending $5

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:03.960
to buy some useless
pixels on your screen,

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.260
you're spending $5 to
save a lot of your time.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.530
And now that's something
that's a worthy transaction.

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:10.320
So it just kind of messes
with our value systems.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.800
And what's funny here is
that, technically, these games

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.270
are all free to play.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:17.450
So you play the game for
free, and then you pay money

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:19.550
to play less of the game.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:21.540
So it's like, so is
the game fun or not?

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.165
If it's fun, why are
you spending money

00:46:23.165 --> 00:46:24.140
to skip gameplay?

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.700
And this we'll see later, is
the difference between extrinsic

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.866
versus intrinsic motivation.

00:46:31.052 --> 00:46:32.760
You'll see later that
this is a black hat

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.730
and extrinsic
motivation core drive.

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:38.560
But last year I interviewed
this guy who's an engineer,

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.589
and he spent like $40,000 on
one mobile game, in a year.

00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:44.130
And it's not like
he's a millionaire.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.870
He says his other
interest was motorcycles.

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:49.640
So because he played this
mobile game called We Heroes,

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.780
he's going to be buying one
less motorcycle in his life.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.942
But you know, it's
a lot of that what

00:46:54.942 --> 00:46:57.525
we call a black hat drive that
drives this obsessive behavior.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.500
So remember Geomon,
the little game.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.910
So in Geomon, there's a
monster called the Mozzy.

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:07.400
The Mozzy is a firefox.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.470
And the only way to capture a
Mozzy is you have to be next

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:12.450
to a Mozilla Firefox
headquarters,

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.210
which meant that in
the entire world,

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.070
only a few people got
to capture Mozzy's.

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.190
I lived in Mountain
View here at the time,

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:19.250
I got a lot of Mozzy's.

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.800
They thought I was a hacker,
all the other players.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.280
But everyone wanted one
because it was so rare.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.560
And so I just took
a random screenshot

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.120
of a public chat board.

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.720
Over here, Vincent7512 says,
"I wish I had a single Mozzy.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.260
Then, at this point in my
life, I could die happy."

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.344
And you think that hey,
look, when you're publicly

00:47:38.344 --> 00:47:40.634
saying that, most people are
like, come on, get a life.

00:47:40.634 --> 00:47:41.780
It's just a game, right?

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:42.280
But no.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.240
On line number three, you'll
see that ValerieFox18 says, "Me

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:46.240
too, Vincent.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.640
Me too."

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.610
And so it's all just these very
sad gamers that are like oh,

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:51.370
I want a Mozzy.

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:53.140
Please, I want a Mozzy.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.750
But that does nothing
compare to the burning

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:58.580
phoenix, the Laurelix.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.160
The only way to
capture a Laurelix

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.910
is you have to be at a place
that's extremely, extremely

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:06.421
hot, like 110 degrees
Fahrenheit, or 45 degrees

00:48:06.421 --> 00:48:06.920
Celsius.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.460
I mean that's just
extremely hot.

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:11.020
Which meant that, at one
point in the game's history,

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.250
there's only three players
who owned a Laurelix.

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:15.940
And needless to say,
everyone wanted one.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.290
So the gaming company
got called by a mom once.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:22.210
And she was saying, oh,
you know, my son is sick.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:23.510
He's been sick for two weeks.

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:24.800
Can't get out of bed.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.800
And he said the only thing
that can cheer him up

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.147
is if he had a Laurelix.

00:48:29.147 --> 00:48:30.730
And she says, I don't
know what it is,

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.440
but he says you guys have it.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.290
I'm willing to pay $20 if
you can give him a Laurelix.

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:38.930
So again, that scarcity--
and Laurelix, again, it's

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:39.900
not even that powerful.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.180
Some people play it, but it's
not like the most powerful

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:42.720
ever.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.730
A lot of people don't use
it, or they wouldn't use it.

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.540
So the scarcity also has
this very sticky factor.

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.860
So I was an advisor for awhile.

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.260
Helped them balance their
ability trees, yada yada.

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.220
So I played it a bit.

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.720
And then I stopped playing
it, and I finished my product.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.350
So for an entire year, I did
not think about the game,

00:48:59.350 --> 00:48:59.950
I did not play the game.

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.741
The only thing I did
was I met with the CEO

00:49:01.741 --> 00:49:03.970
to discuss monetization
strategies and business

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:05.250
development, stuff like that.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:08.460
But then one day, I
was traveling overseas

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:09.360
with a client.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.740
And I was at a place that
was extremely, extremely hot.

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:14.550
And I just like, I
just felt like the sun

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:16.454
was burning my skin.

00:49:16.454 --> 00:49:18.120
And the first thing
that came to my mind

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.570
was, I wonder if I could
capture a Laurelix here?

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:23.070
It is funny because I wasn't
even playing that game anymore,

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:24.890
I don't even care
about the game.

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.790
But because the
Laurelix is so rare,

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:30.710
my brain just thinks, well
maybe, I could get one,

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:32.410
I should get one.

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:34.880
So that scarcity
triggered my mind.

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.930
I didn't download the
app because of that

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:39.670
because I knew it was
silly, but it still

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:42.410
has that stickiness factor.

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:45.320
Core drive seven is
unpredictability and curiosity.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.029
So this is the drive
that says because we

00:49:47.029 --> 00:49:48.653
don't know what's
going to happen next,

00:49:48.653 --> 00:49:50.000
we're always thinking about it.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.520
So this is a drive that's
obviously heavily utilized

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.710
in the gambling
industry, but whenever

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:57.800
you have a sweepstakes, a
lottery, a raffle ticket

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.455
system, you utilize
this core drive.

00:50:00.455 --> 00:50:01.830
It's also the
drive that makes us

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:07.090
want to finish a book or movie,
which is why we hate spoilers.

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:08.860
And there's a lot of
scientific research

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.120
behind this core drive.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.320
The most famous one is
called the Skinner box.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.660
So scientist B.F Skinner
put animals in a box,

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.660
and inside the box
there's a lever.

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:20.420
So the first experiment is that
whenever that animal presses

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.097
the lever, food comes out.

00:50:22.097 --> 00:50:23.930
And what you'll see
there is that the animal

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:26.587
will press the lever until it's
no longer hungry, because it

00:50:26.587 --> 00:50:27.670
doesn't need food anymore.

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:28.550
Make senses.

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:30.440
But when you change
the mechanics,

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.160
to the point where whenever
the animal presses the lever,

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:36.430
food may or may not come out,
and sometimes two come out,

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:38.622
what you'll see is that
the animal will constantly

00:50:38.622 --> 00:50:40.830
press the lever, regardless
of if it's hungry or not.

00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:42.035
Because it's just
messing with it's brain.

00:50:42.035 --> 00:50:43.710
Will it come out, will it
come out, will it come out?

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:45.960
So there you have like
gambling addiction, right there

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.870
in the little Skinner box.

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:50.950
So there's a lot of
ways to utilize it.

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:53.240
One popular theme
is the Easter egg,

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:56.735
which is a reward
that you don't expect.

00:50:56.735 --> 00:50:58.860
So there's different things
in gamification design.

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.300
There's the fixed action reward,
you know what you need to do

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.370
and you know what the reward
is, it's to earn lunch.

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:04.820
There's the mystery
box, which is

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.010
you know what you
need to do, but you

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:08.426
don't know what the reward is,
like opening a treasure box

00:51:08.426 --> 00:51:09.976
or taking down an
enemy in a game.

00:51:09.976 --> 00:51:12.100
Something will come out,
you don't know what it is.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.190
Then there's the Easter
box, the Easter egg,

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:16.180
which is not only
do not know what

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.880
the reward is, you
don't even know

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.580
what you need to do to get it.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:24.840
When you get it, you're so
surprised, it delights you.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.720
It makes you want to go back
and do the desired action again,

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.240
just to see if you
can replicate it.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.800
And it makes you want to
tell your friends about it.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.740
So a quick example is
FourSquare in the old days.

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.850
So 2011, when Steve
Jobs passed away,

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:40.640
I had a friend named
Mario [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.671
So he went to the
Cupertino Apple store,

00:51:43.671 --> 00:51:45.420
where a lot of people
were there mourning,

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:46.970
giving flowers and whatnot.

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:49.530
And Mario was a very
casual FourSquare user,

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:51.570
but he decided to just
check in on FourSquare.

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:55.170
And unexpectedly, he unlocked
this badge called "Jobs."

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:57.430
And it says, "Here's
to the crazy ones.

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:59.020
Thank you, Steve."

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:01.780
So as far as he
knows, this is a badge

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:06.280
that can only be earned at
that place, at that time.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.620
And it was so unexpected
that it delighted him,

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:11.060
besides the mourning and
the sadness of Steve Jobs.

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.752
And it made him want
go to more places

00:52:12.752 --> 00:52:14.460
to check in on
FourSquare, to see if he'd

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:16.300
get more of these Easter eggs.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.470
It made him want to
tell his friends.

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:22.120
And made me talk about
this to you as an example

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.220
So that you Easter
egg was very useful.

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:27.540
These days-- I actually got
an Easter egg from them too.

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.460
So they split up to Swarm.

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:31.320
I don't use Swarm
or FourSquare a lot,

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.190
but I since I travel
a lot, I decided

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:35.540
to check in on Swarm
when I'm in airports,

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:39.186
just to have a footprint
of all the airports I've

00:52:39.186 --> 00:52:40.430
been to in the world.

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:43.570
So I remember when I got off
the plane-- this is in Germany,

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:45.530
I think, or Denmark,
I forgot, Norway,

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:49.540
I forgot-- I got off the
plane-- maybe it was Portugal--

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:52.195
and I had 2% battery left.

00:52:52.195 --> 00:52:53.570
And I'm like, oh
crap, if I don't

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:55.440
check in now, we're going
to leave the airport

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.180
and I won't be able to check
in to the airport anymore.

00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:58.600
So I quickly checked in.

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:01.445
And then it suddenly
said hey, I got

00:53:01.445 --> 00:53:03.570
a badge called Juice Box
or something, and it says,

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:06.530
oh, you're almost out of juice
and you checked in on Swarm.

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:08.210
Thank you for loving us so much.

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.925
Here's a badge.

00:53:08.925 --> 00:53:10.300
I'm like, oh,
didn't expect that.

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:10.841
Kind of cool.

00:53:10.841 --> 00:53:12.860
Very thoughtful type of design.

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:16.380
Little engaging experiences.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.654
Chase also has a
program like that.

00:53:18.654 --> 00:53:20.320
So chase has a system
called Chase Picks

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.110
up the Tab, which is every time
you swipe with a Chase debit

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:25.520
card, there's a small
chance that they'll

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.780
send you a text message
that says, "Hey, Chase just

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:28.854
picked up the tab.

00:53:28.854 --> 00:53:30.770
Your $5 will be credited
back to your account.

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:31.800
Have a nice day."

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:33.450
So even though it's
not a lot of money

00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:35.370
and the chances
are pretty small,

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:37.260
because it's so
unexpected, it makes

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.760
people want to go back and swipe
more with their Chase cards

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.490
and makes them want to tell
their friends about it.

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:43.990
And sometimes their friends
want to sign up to a Chase card,

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:46.780
just to see if they can
play the game and win.

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.190
One really brilliant
and creative idea

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:52.960
that utilizes this
core drive and scarcity

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.510
is done by something
called eMart.

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:58.060
eMart is the largest
retailer in South Korea.

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:00.030
Their mother company
Shinsegae, actually

00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:02.930
bought Walmart in South Korea.

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.270
And so eMart saw one thing.

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:08.030
They saw that during the day,
their traffic and revenue

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:09.340
has been pretty strong.

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:12.090
But at noontime,
traffic drops off.

00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:14.590
And it's because most
people go out to lunch.

00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:17.160
And eMart offers lunch
too, but most people

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.360
don't think of eMart
as the place to eat.

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.194
So to solve this
problem what they did

00:54:21.194 --> 00:54:23.110
is they started to build
a lot of these little

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:24.970
abstract-looking statues,
and they put them

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:26.220
in front of every eMart.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:28.636
And so when you look at it,
it doesn't look like anything.

00:54:28.636 --> 00:54:31.260
It's abstract, like what
is it, abstract art?

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:35.910
However, during noontime,
the position of the sun

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:39.930
will cause the shadow
of this little statue

00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:43.400
to form a perfect QR code
that people can scan.

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.790
And so again you
have that scarcity.

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:47.592
Oh, you have to be
here at noontime.

00:54:47.592 --> 00:54:49.800
And it's not based on some
arbitrary company creating

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.510
the rules, it's based
on the laws of physics.

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:55.140
It's only at noontime
and on good weather.

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:58.230
And also there's that
unpredictability and curiosity.

00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:59.580
I want to see it form.

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:01.952
So just by that itself,
people want to show up.

00:55:01.952 --> 00:55:04.160
They don't even know what
happens after they scan it.

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.159
I think this can be a
little bit of improvement,

00:55:06.159 --> 00:55:08.080
but when they scan
it, then it has, oh,

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.870
if you shop within
the next hour,

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:11.810
you get a 20% off, yada yada.

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:16.480
But that design increased their
noontime revenue and traffic

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.400
by around 30%, which is huge
considering they're already

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.640
the biggest in their industry.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.870
Core drive eight is
loss and avoidance.

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:26.097
So this is the drive that's
very straightforward.

00:55:26.097 --> 00:55:27.680
We're doing something
to avoid a loss,

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.650
we don't want something
bad to happen.

00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:32.260
Or we don't want to change
our behavior, per se.

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:35.400
And so again Farmville was very
good at this loss and avoidance

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:35.900
design.

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.726
Very early on,
Farmville says, hey,

00:55:37.726 --> 00:55:40.100
if you don't come back eight
hours later at our appointed

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:43.140
time, we're going to show
you very uninspiring images

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.545
of your crops all
dying, it's all yellow.

00:55:45.545 --> 00:55:48.059
You have to click on them
one at a time to clean it up.

00:55:48.059 --> 00:55:49.850
And your brain just
thinks, oh never again,

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:50.810
I don't want this to
ever happen again.

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:53.380
I'm going to come back every
day, every eight hours now.

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:57.360
And so, back in the day when my
mom was addicted to Farmville--

00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.910
which that itself
was crazy for me

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:01.820
because she always said
all technology is evil,

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:04.160
gaming is evil, all that
stuff-- and then suddenly,

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.000
she was sucked into Farmville.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.280
But sometimes she had to wake
up 5 AM in the morning just

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.100
to go on Farmville to
harvest those crops.

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:14.930
And when she had to leave
town, she had to call my cousin

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:16.620
and say, oh, you know,
I'm leaving town.

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:17.620
Can you take on my farm.

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:21.100
Here's my Facebook email
and login, password.

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:22.840
And to me it was
confusing at the time

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.430
because I'm like, wait a second,
I thought people played games

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:27.000
because they had too many
responsibilities in the world,

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.170
they have too much stress.

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:29.830
So they want to be a world
where they can be free,

00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:32.710
they can do whatever they want,
they've been empowered, right?

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:33.350
But no.

00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:34.640
Here you have a new set
of responsibilities,

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.430
a new set of chores,
a new set of things

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:38.310
that stresses you out.

00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:40.050
That didn't make sense
to me at the time,

00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:42.820
but now it's like, oh, it's
this very heavy black hat design

00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:45.710
with loss and avoidance.

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:47.300
So those are the
eight core drives.

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.845
And it's worth saying
that everything we do

00:56:50.845 --> 00:56:53.220
is based on one or more of
these eight core drives, which

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:55.510
means that if there's none of
those eight core drives there,

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:56.650
there's zero motivation.

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:58.060
No behavior happens.

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:01.110
And then, once you understand
how users are feeling

00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:02.814
and how you want
them to feel, that's

00:57:02.814 --> 00:57:04.480
when you finally go
out and think about,

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.440
what are the gamification
design elements that

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.690
can fulfill those core drives?

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:10.380
Maybe it's points
or badges, maybe

00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.510
it's a magnetic cap,
or a group quest,

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:15.580
or a glowing choice
design oracle effect.

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:18.030
So the key is that, again,
it's not about the outside game

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:21.720
elements, it's about whether
the core drives are triggered.

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:26.751
Now this is also on an
octagon shape for a reason.

00:57:26.751 --> 00:57:28.125
The left side core
drives, I call

00:57:28.125 --> 00:57:30.360
them the left brain core
drives, which the disclaimer is

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.818
that it's not geographically
on the left side of our brain,

00:57:32.818 --> 00:57:35.300
is just symbolically the
logical side of our brain.

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.966
And so these are the
left core drives.

00:57:36.966 --> 00:57:38.840
And interestingly enough,
the left brain core

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.560
drives coincide with what we
call extrinsic motivation.

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.730
These are things you do for a
reward, or purpose, or o goal.

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:47.520
But we don't necessarily
enjoy the activity itself.

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.430
So once we obtain the
reward, we hit our goals,

00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:54.210
or we get use to the reward,
we stop doing that activity.

00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:56.250
And then there's the
right brain core drives

00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:59.360
that are basically things that
we just enjoy doing, intrinsic

00:57:59.360 --> 00:57:59.930
motivation.

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:03.280
These are things that we
would even pay money in order

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.520
to experience.

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.660
So we don't need a reward to
enjoy using our creativity,

00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:10.442
we don't need a reward to enjoy
hanging out with our friends.

00:58:10.442 --> 00:58:12.400
And in the case of
unpredictably and curiosity,

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.910
we don't need a
reward necessarily

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:16.620
to be in that suspense
of unpredictability.

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:18.400
So in fact, if you
sit there and you

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.066
press a button for
four hours straight

00:58:20.066 --> 00:58:21.440
and you're guaranteed
a paycheck,

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.648
that's kind of boring, right?

00:58:22.648 --> 00:58:25.149
That's like a job at a factory,
most people don't like that.

00:58:25.149 --> 00:58:27.564
But if you sit there and you
press a button for four hours

00:58:27.564 --> 00:58:30.030
straight, and maybe you'll get
a paycheck, maybe you won't.

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:31.140
Maybe you'll lose money.

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.997
Suddenly that's Casino gambling,
and a lot of people like that,

00:58:33.997 --> 00:58:35.830
even though the payout
of that is way worse.

00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:38.590
Guaranteed payment versus
potentially losing money,

00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:41.930
but our brains crave
that intrinsic motivation

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:44.990
of maybe I would, maybe I
wouldn't, that sense of hope so

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:47.130
much, that we are willing
to pay the Casino--

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:49.380
and we know that's how they
make so much money-- to go

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:50.420
through that feeling.

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:52.150
And so that's why.

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:53.390
It's intrinsic.

00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:55.650
Now most companies like to
design for left brain core

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:56.150
drives.

00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:58.310
And it's because it's
just so much easier

00:58:58.310 --> 00:59:01.840
to put a reward and a goal,
or a badge on the desired

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.510
behavior you want to see, as
opposed to making it actually

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:05.200
fun.

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.700
Now, the problem
is that science has

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:11.290
shown that extrinsic motivation
can kill intrinsic motivation.

00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:12.640
What does that mean?

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.960
Let's say I love drawing
and I always draw for free.

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:15.804
it's my passion.

00:59:15.804 --> 00:59:18.220
Science has shown that one of
the best ways for you get me

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.480
stop drawing is to
first pay me to do it--

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.021
at the beginning I'm excited,
yay, I get paid for my passion,

00:59:23.021 --> 00:59:25.695
right-- and then pay me less
and less and less. $50, $10, $1,

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:27.140
$0.20, $0.01.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.567
At one point, I
will refuse to draw.

00:59:29.567 --> 00:59:30.900
I would be like, I'm not stupid.

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.750
I'm not going to draw
for $0.20, that's stupid.

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:36.450
Even though before I met
you, I drew for free.

00:59:36.450 --> 00:59:38.890
So you have transitioned
my intrinsic joy

00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:41.882
of drawing into that extrinsic
motivation of making money.

00:59:41.882 --> 00:59:43.340
And so when the
money's not enough,

00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:45.880
I stopped doing it all together.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:48.460
Now, you also might notice
that the top core drives are

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:51.890
more positive feeling, so
I call them the white hat

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:53.264
gamification core drives.

00:59:53.264 --> 00:59:54.680
So if we're always
doing something

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.780
because it's bringing us
closer to something bigger

00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:01.210
than ourselves, pursuing our
faith, we're achieving mastery,

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:04.530
we're using our creativity,
it feels very, very good.

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:05.472
That's white hat.

01:00:05.472 --> 01:00:06.930
But if we're always
doing something

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:08.489
just because we want
to avoid a loss,

01:00:08.489 --> 01:00:10.030
just because we
can't have something,

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:12.321
just because we don't know
what's going to happen next,

01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:14.670
it's still extremely powerful
in driving our behavior,

01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:16.760
but in the long run it leaves
a bad taste in our mouths

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.301
because we feel like we're not
in control of our own actions.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.440
White hat makes users
feel powerful, in control,

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.290
they feel good.

01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:27.590
But there is no
sense of urgency.

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.820
The black hat makes
people feel urgent,

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:32.347
obsessed, and even addicted,
but in the long run

01:00:32.347 --> 01:00:33.930
they could burn out
because they don't

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:36.940
feel like they're in control.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.535
I believe that the
problem with Zynga

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:41.151
is that they figured out how
to do all these black hat game

01:00:41.151 --> 01:00:41.900
design techniques.

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.100
And they don't think
about it as black hat

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:44.683
because they don't
have the framework.

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:46.900
They call it data driven design.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.330
But we know because
black hat drives urgency,

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:51.100
whenever you are
too data driven,

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:52.830
you always go more
black hat because it

01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:53.720
creates immediate results.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.120
Oh, once we put a
torture break on,

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.320
people come back
three times a day.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:56.920
It's amazing.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.930
And they're spending money.

01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:00.680
But then they get more
and more black hat.

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.471
So all their short term
metrics look great.

01:01:02.471 --> 01:01:05.040
Their monetization,
retention, even virality.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.030
However, because
people don't feel good

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:10.700
when they play Zynga games,
when they can quit the game

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:11.630
they will will.

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.671
And usually that's the
happiest day of your life.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:17.200
I've finally escaped the demon
grasp of Zynga, Farmville.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.700
And If you're a
great game, people

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.480
shouldn't be the happiest when
they quit playing you, right?

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.896
They should be sad
when they stop.

01:01:21.896 --> 01:01:24.470
So that's the thing about
the black hat motivation.

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:27.050
And recent years,
they proved my theory

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:30.210
correct by double-downing on
all these slot machine games,

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:31.430
and that's core drive seven.

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:34.750
It's more intrinsic, but
it's black hat still.

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:38.120
And the only two games that
they've always been successful

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.830
on are games where they,
I think they accidentally

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:42.300
took core drive
three, empowerment

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.383
of creativity design
timeless from timeless games.

01:01:44.383 --> 01:01:47.320
So Zynga Poker and
Words With Friends.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.010
Those are games that have always
been pretty high performing

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:52.270
and it's because it has a lot
of those white hat core drives

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:53.770
already embedded
in the game design.

01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:56.040
Those games don't have to
add new quests and missions

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.670
every week.

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:59.940
But just because it's called
black cat gamification

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.170
doesn't mean it's
necessarily bad.

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:04.610
A lot of people put themselves,
voluntarily put themselves

01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:07.400
in black hat gamification in
order to go to the gym more,

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.337
eat healthily, and
just behave better,

01:02:10.337 --> 01:02:11.420
in a better way they want.

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.570
So this is a funny
example, where

01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:16.400
this is an alarm clock,
where every time you

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.500
press the snooze button,
it destroys your money.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.540
So you are waking up because
of core drive eight, loss

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:23.610
and avoidance.

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:25.610
You don't want to lose
money, so you wake up.

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:27.540
However, you're OK
with that because it's

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:28.850
a goal you want to accomplish.

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:30.010
You want to wake up.

01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:33.180
What people don't like is
when companies, governments,

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.930
marketers, parents,
teachers, use

01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:38.260
a lot of black hat
gamification of core drives

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.650
to get people to buy
stuff they don't need,

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:43.830
work overtime without
fair pay, get manipulated.

01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:45.620
And they're probably
still going to do it

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:49.510
because this stuff is obsessive,
but again, the moment they

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:52.640
can escape from this
system, they will want to.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.620
So once we understand
the framework,

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:57.150
now we can analyze why
different things are engaging.

01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:58.610
We can like things
like Facebook.

01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:00.034
Oh, it has a lot of core drives.

01:03:00.034 --> 01:03:01.950
There's not a lot of
epic meaning and calling.

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:04.680
There's not a lot of scarcity,
in terms of these things

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.170
I really want but I can't get.

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:08.059
Early days they
were, not anymore.

01:03:08.059 --> 01:03:09.600
Epic meaning and
calling is important

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.766
because a lot of people are
deleting their Facebook,

01:03:11.766 --> 01:03:14.380
or at least blocking it, not
because they don't like it,

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.560
but they like it too much.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.000
But there's no higher meaning.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.360
They feel like they're
wasting their time.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.070
So like, no, no, no, I
need to stay away from it.

01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:22.190
So if Facebook increased their
epic meaning and calling--

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:23.920
if people feel like every
time I'm on Facebook,

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.878
the world becomes better,
I'm helping children,

01:03:25.878 --> 01:03:28.240
and all this stuff, then
there's a higher drive

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.080
to stay on Facebook
and be happy about time

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.570
they spend on Facebook.

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:34.090
We can look at games
like Farmville,

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:35.910
also doesn't have epic
meaning and calling,

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:37.569
doesn't have unpredictability.

01:03:37.569 --> 01:03:39.110
We know what we're
just going harvest

01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:41.880
the crops we planted
and plant new crops.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.132
A friend of mine in Israel
built the octalysis tool.

01:03:46.132 --> 01:03:47.590
I'll give you the
link if you care.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.260
So it's basically, there's
a little toggle on the left.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:53.730
You can change the numbers
and the shape grows.

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:55.620
You can add notes and
little insights about,

01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:58.370
oh your experience is too white
hat, or there's no urgency,

01:03:58.370 --> 01:04:00.520
or it's too left-brain
focused, there's

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.530
no intrinsic motivation.

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:04.120
So there's a little templating
stuff, some people like it.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:09.440
So yukaichou.com/octalysis-tool.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.890
You look at Twitter,
more right-brain focused.

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:14.400
LinkedIn is something really
interesting to look at.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.870
So LinkedIn, you can see it's a
lot of left-brain core drives.

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:20.092
And it's because LinkedIn
is about your life,

01:04:20.092 --> 01:04:21.050
it's about your career.

01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:22.299
A lot of extrinsic motivation.

01:04:22.299 --> 01:04:25.230
Lots of people feel like, I
need to have a LinkedIn account.

01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:27.840
However, there's not a lot
right-brain core drives,

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.230
so they create account and
then it just sits there.

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:33.420
There's nothing
to do on LinkedIn,

01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.670
unless you need to recruit
someone or find a job.

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:37.555
So we get very
extrinsic focused.

01:04:37.555 --> 01:04:38.930
So for years,
they've been trying

01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:41.388
to push on the social influence
and relatedness core drive.

01:04:41.388 --> 01:04:45.199
So they introduced things
like the social prod,

01:04:45.199 --> 01:04:46.240
which is the endorsement.

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.510
So before there's
a recommendation,

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.890
which is a social
treasure, which

01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:53.810
is something valuable that
only someone else can give you.

01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:56.400
But then you still take time
to write a recommendation.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.316
This person is great
because blah, blah, blah,

01:04:58.316 --> 01:04:59.460
I'll do it later.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.830
So they did the endorsement.

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:02.580
Endorsement is a
social prod, which

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.220
means the smallest
amount of energy

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.570
to create a social interaction.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.450
It's kind of like
a poke on Facebook.

01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:09.995
It's like, I got a
poke on Facebook.

01:05:09.995 --> 01:05:12.120
I don't know what it means,
but I'll poke you back.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:12.954
Ha!

01:05:12.954 --> 01:05:15.120
And it's like, oh, now we
have a social interaction.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.244
You don't have to think
about being witty or saying

01:05:17.244 --> 01:05:19.150
things that are
embarrassing, you just poke.

01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:23.780
And so, on LinkedIn, a poke
is obviously not appropriate,

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.390
so they called endorsement.

01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:28.920
But you can see that, by design,
the LinkedIn endorsements are

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.800
not designed to be
meaningful, they're

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.860
designed to be abundant,
so at the beginning,

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:34.710
you're endorsing four people
at once, four people at once,

01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:35.790
four people at once.

01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:38.139
You're endorsing 12 different
skills of one person,

01:05:38.139 --> 01:05:40.513
even though you have no idea
if this guy's good at all 12

01:05:40.513 --> 01:05:41.500
of these things.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.342
But if you want to
make it meaningful,

01:05:43.342 --> 01:05:44.800
if you want to just
endorse the one

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.100
thing you know he's
good at, you can't just

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:47.130
select that one thing.

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:49.977
You have to be like, x x
x, cancel, cancel, cancel,

01:05:49.977 --> 01:05:51.810
cancel, cancel, until
that one thing's left,

01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:53.290
and then click endorse.

01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:56.610
So again, by design, you can
see that LinkedIn endorsements

01:05:56.610 --> 01:05:57.850
are not meant be meaningful.

01:05:57.850 --> 01:05:59.190
They're meant to be abundant.

01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:03.200
And as a result, for a
long time two years ago,

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.920
when they launched,
when they did that,

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.040
I started getting
a lot of emails.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.560
Oh, so and so endorsed
me, so and so endorsed me.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:07.910
OK.

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:09.743
I'm going to back and
endorse them back, ha!

01:06:09.743 --> 01:06:11.410
So yay, now there's
something to do

01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:13.701
on LinkedIn, which is basically
people going and poking

01:06:13.701 --> 01:06:16.970
each other and feeling
socially connected.

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:18.550
But we can see that
through framework

01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:20.760
that they could probably benefit
a lot if they thought more

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.080
about how to improve empowerment
of creating the feedback,

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.210
giving users more meaningful
choice and creativity,

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:27.250
as well as unpredictably
and curiosity.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:29.090
In fact, they do try
to monetize on that.

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:30.750
They'll tell you
things like, hey,

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:33.615
you know last week 47 people
looked at your profile.

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:35.740
But you've got to upgrade
to find out who they are.

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:38.710
That unpredictability
core drive is there.

01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:39.920
So, yeah.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:42.670
This is the core-- again,
about eight core drives.

01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:44.390
And so I really
understand not only

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.669
how to create behavior,
but also the nature of it.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:49.210
Sometimes your data looks great,
everything's off the charts,

01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:50.751
but you have to
recognize, well wait,

01:06:50.751 --> 01:06:53.974
we're doing all black hat, so
we probably should transition

01:06:53.974 --> 01:06:55.140
to the white hat eventually.

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.650
If you're all white
hat, you'll have

01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:58.980
a nice passionate community
who loves your product,

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:02.150
but there's never that viral
growth, that obsession into it.

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:05.250
So a lot of time it's the
balance between the two.

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:06.700
So that's level one octalysis.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.040
There's actually
five levels in total.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.169
We're going to talk
about all of them.

01:07:11.169 --> 01:07:13.710
I don't talk about level three,
beyond level three in public.

01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:16.096
But a quick view of level
two and level three.

01:07:16.096 --> 01:07:18.220
So level two is really
breaking the experience down

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.540
into four experience phases.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.610
A lot of product designers
see their product

01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:23.900
as one experience, which
kind of makes sense.

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:25.560
One product, one experience.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.450
But from the viewpoint
of motivation,

01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:31.830
I think that's a big mistake
because your users on day one,

01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:33.849
their motivation is very
different from day 100.

01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:35.640
The reason why they're
there are different,

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.370
even the features they
see are different.

01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:39.456
So I break down
the user experience

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:40.330
into the four phases.

01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:42.442
Discovery, why would
they even want to start?

01:07:42.442 --> 01:07:44.650
Onboarding, how do you teach
them the rules and tools

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:45.570
to play the game?

01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:47.760
Scaffolding, which is the
regular journey, where

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.920
you come back every day,
do the same actively loop

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.200
over and over again.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.257
And endgame, how do you
retain your veterans?

01:07:53.257 --> 01:07:55.840
A lot of companies don't design
for the endgame, which I think

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.006
is a big mistake because
your veterans are your best

01:07:58.006 --> 01:08:00.920
monetization vehicles, best
evangelists, best community

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:01.750
moderators.

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.537
But in their world,
in their perception,

01:08:03.537 --> 01:08:06.120
done everything there is to do,
they've been there, done that.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.330
So have you designed anything
to keep them in the system,

01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:11.244
so they can contribute
value back into it?

01:08:11.244 --> 01:08:13.910
So every single phase, you think
about what core drives motivate

01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:14.786
people forward.

01:08:14.786 --> 01:08:16.910
And remember, if there's
none of those core drives,

01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:18.509
no blue area, no motivation.

01:08:18.509 --> 01:08:19.300
They just drop out.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.880
They don't even go
to the next phase.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:21.435
So discovery.

01:08:21.435 --> 01:08:22.810
Why would people
want to sign up?

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:24.790
Well, sometimes
people sign up because

01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:26.950
of a weak sense of
unpredictability and curiosity.

01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:29.010
I heard about it somewhere,
let me try it out.

01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:31.605
But once they satisfy their
curiosity, they're done.

01:08:31.605 --> 01:08:33.979
Then there's some companies
optimize-- a lot of companies

01:08:33.979 --> 01:08:35.470
optimize-- with
social influence.

01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:37.720
Try to get your friends, hey
it's the best thing ever,

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:38.950
sign up for it.

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:41.520
Some companies do epic
meaning and calling.

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:45.370
Oh, I heard kiva.org makes
the world a better place.

01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:47.569
I want to make a difference,
let me try kiva.org.

01:08:47.569 --> 01:08:49.827
Loss and avoidance, a lot
of times enterprise products

01:08:49.827 --> 01:08:50.410
are like that.

01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:52.909
Oh, you know my boss said that
we have to use this software,

01:08:52.909 --> 01:08:54.840
and I don't want to
lose my job, so I'm

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.149
going to use the software.

01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.990
It's amazing.

01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:59.960
It's black hat, it's amazing
I'm bottom-lining that activity,

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.880
but is it the best type of
excitement and engagement

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.830
going to the product?

01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:04.475
Probably not.

01:09:04.475 --> 01:09:06.850
So you think about all these
core drives in the discovery

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:09.075
phase and onboarding, how
do you teach them the rules

01:09:09.075 --> 01:09:10.200
and tools to play the game?

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.770
That's when you bring the
epic meaning and calling

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:12.960
about why they should play.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.655
But more importantly, you want
to think about development

01:09:14.655 --> 01:09:16.020
and accomplishment.

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.142
People don't want to
interact with smart products.

01:09:18.142 --> 01:09:19.600
They want to interact
with products

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.490
that make them feel smart.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:24.399
There's some products that are
just amazing, well-designed,

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:26.745
you respect it, but when you
touch it, you feel stupid.

01:09:26.745 --> 01:09:27.870
So you don't want to do it.

01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:29.450
For some people
it's like Photoshop,

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:31.485
or like this DJ panel.

01:09:31.485 --> 01:09:33.109
You respect that,
you think it's smart,

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:34.140
but you don't want to touch it.

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.319
And so, the example I give--
hopefully not offending

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:38.080
anyone-- is Google+.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.670
We know that Google spent a lot
of engineering and resources

01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:43.387
into Google+, a lot
of money went into it.

01:09:43.387 --> 01:09:44.720
Everything takes you to Google+.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.847
Your Gmail, your YouTube,
all takes you to Google+,

01:09:46.847 --> 01:09:48.930
but most people when they
get there, they're like,

01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:50.346
oh I don't get it,
it's confusing.

01:09:50.346 --> 01:09:51.149
And they're gone.

01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:55.490
So I think this is an example
of function focused design.

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.340
Great technology,
great functionality,

01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:58.960
but no human focused design.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.010
So that's something
you want to think

01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:01.384
about in the
onboarding, in terms

01:10:01.384 --> 01:10:03.832
of how to get engaged
people, what core drives are

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:04.861
you triggering.

01:10:04.861 --> 01:10:06.360
So once you understand
that, you can

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.901
bring another level, into
level three octalysis

01:10:08.901 --> 01:10:10.400
and apply to different
player types.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.790
So here we have [INAUDIBLE]
four player types, achievers,

01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:15.520
explorers, socializers,
and killers.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.936
You don't have to
do this, you can

01:10:16.936 --> 01:10:20.070
be your own personas like
marketers versus engineers,

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:22.810
or domestic market
versus foreign market.

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:25.130
The key here is that
different types of people

01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:26.420
are motivated differently.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:28.926
So have you considered how
different types of people

01:10:28.926 --> 01:10:30.550
are motivated by
different core drives?

01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:32.180
And it's hard to
please everyone,

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.680
but at least with this framework
you can kind of understand,

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.730
oh well maybe there's something
for everyone at every stage.

01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:40.734
You can look at things like,
well for the achievers,

01:10:40.734 --> 01:10:42.900
discovery feels good,
onboarding, they're motivated,

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:45.275
scaffolding, they drop out
because there's no motivation.

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:48.640
Explorers, discovery is great,
but onboarding is confusing

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.407
so they're gone.

01:10:49.407 --> 01:10:50.990
Socializers, let's
say they don't even

01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:53.310
want to start because there's
no socializing features

01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:54.180
advertised.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.174
And the killers, as
a random example,

01:10:56.174 --> 01:10:58.340
could be the people who are
going through discovery,

01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.660
onboarding,
scaffolding, endgame,

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.660
and they're in the endgame,
showing up the noobs

01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:02.724
or pwning them, whatnot.

01:11:02.724 --> 01:11:04.140
So it's about just
really thinking

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:06.175
about different types
of people dropping out

01:11:06.175 --> 01:11:08.180
and what type of motivation.

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:10.699
So now that we talked
about the framework,

01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:12.740
let's go back to that game
that you thought about

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:13.780
at the very beginning.

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:15.470
That game that you
thought about, what

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:17.210
core drives were in that game?

01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:21.050
Was there a sense
of unpredictability?

01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:23.290
Is there a dice roll, is
there a flip of a card?

01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:25.430
Is it a social game, social
influence relatedness?

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:27.445
Is there strategy,
creativity involved?

01:11:27.445 --> 01:11:30.070
Is there an element where you're
accumulating things, ownership

01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.860
and possession?

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:32.276
Is there epic
meaning and calling?

01:11:32.276 --> 01:11:34.940
Is there a storyline,
a narrative to that?

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.435
And so the useful
thing about that

01:11:36.435 --> 01:11:38.810
is that allows you to understand
what motivates you more.

01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:40.180
What core drives motivate you?

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:42.810
And people think, I realize
every game I play has

01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:44.640
core drive one, four, and five.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.040
And also, the jobs
I pick usually

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.790
are more focused on
those core drives too.

01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:50.770
So it allows you to
understand yourself.

01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:53.239
So this is useful when
people are thinking about it.

01:11:53.239 --> 01:11:54.780
I think we're a
little short on time.

01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:57.130
Want to reserve some
time for questions.

01:11:57.130 --> 01:12:00.140
We have a quick video, and
then we'll have the questions.

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:03.196
So a quick example of these
core drives come into place

01:12:03.196 --> 01:12:04.820
is an example of the
speed cam lottery.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.540
So quick video, and
then I want to hopefully

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.630
have some time for questions.

01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:07.830
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:09.070
-I'm Kevin Richardson.

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:12.300
I'm the winner of
Volkswagen's Fun Theory award.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.510
My idea was the
Speed Camera Lottery.

01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:18.965
Could we get people to obey
the speed limit through fun?

01:12:18.965 --> 01:12:24.090
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.450
I really believe that fun
can change human behavior

01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:28.600
for the better, and
I was really thrilled

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.540
to see that my idea, which
started as a scribble submitted

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:36.435
into this competition,
might even become reality.

01:12:36.435 --> 01:12:39.405
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:13:04.186 --> 01:13:06.060
The Speed Camera Lottery
would do two things.

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:10.970
One, it would photograph
speeders, give them a citation.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.180
And that money goes in a pot.

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:14.300
But if you're obeying
the law, your picture

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.020
will also get
snapped, and you'll

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:18.397
be entered into a lottery
and win some of that money

01:13:18.397 --> 01:13:19.858
from those speeders.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:14:07.787 --> 01:14:08.370
[END PLAYBACK]

01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:09.036
YU-KAI CHOU: OK.

01:14:09.036 --> 01:14:11.770
So a lot of you will
look at that that's

01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:13.030
a very creative solution.

01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:16.422
I wonder how I can create
something creative like that.

01:14:16.422 --> 01:14:18.130
And so, through that
octalysis framework,

01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:19.350
we'll see that we
are able to come up

01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:21.190
with things that are
creative, such as that

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.500
or hopefully better.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.220
So you always start
off as a problem set.

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.678
Let's say the
problem is how to get

01:14:25.678 --> 01:14:27.270
people to obey the speed limit.

01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:30.070
Well, without any
human intervention,

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:33.940
the motivation is core drive
one, epic meaning and calling.

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:36.340
I don't want to be a dangerous
driver and harm society,

01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:38.180
so I don't want
to drive too fast.

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:40.886
So that puts some kind of limit
to how fast people are driving.

01:14:40.886 --> 01:14:42.260
The problem is,
most people don't

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:44.860
equate being a fast driver
to a dangerous driver,

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:46.290
so a lot of people are speeding.

01:14:46.290 --> 01:14:48.860
So the government comes in and
adds loss and avoidance core

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.610
driver eight into it.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:51.550
It's like, oh well, if you
speed and we catch you,

01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:53.250
we're going to give
you a very heavy fine.

01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:55.375
So again, that bottom-lines
a lot of that activity,

01:14:55.375 --> 01:14:56.920
a lot less people are speeding.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.390
However, as we know,
people are still speeding.

01:14:59.390 --> 01:15:01.940
So then there's some innovative
solutions, like empowerment

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:03.510
of creativity and feedback,
where you're drive

01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:05.060
and you see that little
feedback mechanic,

01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:06.395
this is how fast you're driving.

01:15:06.395 --> 01:15:07.770
But is doesn't
give you a ticket.

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:09.430
So it's like
empowerment creating--

01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:12.180
oh I see there's a score, if
I speed up my score weakens,

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.430
if I slow down my
score increases.

01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:15.170
That's cool.

01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:18.110
So it does some type
of behavioral change.

01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:19.419
However, there's two things.

01:15:19.419 --> 01:15:20.960
One, the win-state
is not very clear.

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.740
So it's like, oh wait, what
is the speed limit again?

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:23.406
Like, did I win?

01:15:23.406 --> 01:15:24.290
I'm not sure.

01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:26.384
The second is
sometimes people try

01:15:26.384 --> 01:15:27.800
to get the highest
number they can

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.860
and they speed up even more,
which is the opposite result.

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:35.750
So then the speed cam lottery
comes in and introduces

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:37.610
a few other core drives to it.

01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:40.170
They add the ownership
and possession.

01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:42.940
We know we can make money
when we're driving legally.

01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:44.990
So that old guy that
says, oh, making money,

01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:46.780
that's amazing, right?

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:48.246
So that's motivating him.

01:15:48.246 --> 01:15:50.620
But we also know that whenever
there's a lottery program,

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:52.720
there's a sense of
unpredictability and curiosity.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:55.970
So that younger guy, he says,
oh I doubt I'll ever win,

01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:57.570
but this is kind of fun.

01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:59.362
So that unpredictability
is motivating him.

01:15:59.362 --> 01:16:01.445
We also know there's a
strong sense of development

01:16:01.445 --> 01:16:02.400
and accomplishment.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.450
When you drive by, it
gives you're either

01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:05.310
a green thumbs up.

01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:07.860
Yay, you reached the
win-state, you obeyed the law.

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:08.850
Or a red thumbs down.

01:16:08.850 --> 01:16:11.000
Boo, you disobeyed
the law, you failed.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.500
And most people,
when they drive,

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.541
they want to see themselves
as a green thumbs up,

01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:16.110
instead of a red thumbs down.

01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:20.717
There's also a sense of social
influence and relatedness.

01:16:20.717 --> 01:16:21.800
And most people miss that.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:22.780
There's two senses.

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:26.340
One is that you can
see that the speed cam

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:28.781
lottery is implemented
on a very busy street.

01:16:28.781 --> 01:16:30.280
So everyone else
can see your score.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.910
And no one wants
people to say, boo,

01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:33.570
he's the loser that
disobeyed the law.

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:35.250
Most people want
others to say, hey,

01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:36.490
he's the guy who
reached the win-state.

01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:37.240
He obeyed the law.

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:37.810
That's great.

01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:39.370
So that changes behavior.

01:16:39.370 --> 01:16:42.850
The other one is a really subtle
competitive dynamic thing.

01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:45.200
When I show this video
to a big crowd, including

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:49.710
you guys I guess, when it
says, oh the speeders--

01:16:49.710 --> 01:16:52.200
or if you obey the law,
you get to win some money.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.250
And everyone's quiet.

01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:55.100
And then he says,
from the losers.

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.610
And everyone starts laughing.

01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:58.160
And it's like, why
does it matter?

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.076
Why does it matter where
the money comes from?

01:17:00.076 --> 01:17:02.170
Why can't we just be
happy with getting money?

01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:04.440
No, because our brain has
this competitive dynamic.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.630
It's like, oh, haha!

01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:06.280
Suckers!

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.738
The losers have to
pay the winners.

01:17:07.738 --> 01:17:09.100
Hahaha.

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:10.940
That gets people excited.

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:13.275
So that's where that
motivates behavior.

01:17:13.275 --> 01:17:15.400
If you take a step back,
if you look at the video--

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.180
I think I'm going
to quickly summarize

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:22.910
that-- the video designers also
have goals about their video.

01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:26.030
They want everyone to watch
the video, like the product,

01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.960
and share.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.669
But have you wondered
why they waste time

01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:31.043
at the beginning doing this,
hello, I'm Kevin Richardson.

01:17:31.043 --> 01:17:33.570
I'm just a nobody and I can't
believe this became grade.

01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:36.130
And why do they show you all
this time just of drilling?

01:17:36.130 --> 01:17:38.350
The conventional
wisdom is that we

01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:40.370
want to make videos short,
short, short, right?

01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:43.220
That's better because we don't
have long attention spans.

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:45.400
It's better that the
video's less than a minute.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.990
However, that whole thing, that
[DRILL SOUND] all that stuff

01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.830
took a minute.

01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:49.332
So why?

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:51.790
Well, the first thing is that
social influence relatedness.

01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:54.030
If it just says, hey look,
Bill Gates did something cool.

01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:56.110
We're think, oh that's
great, but I can't relate.

01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:58.284
But when you see that
guy, it's like, that guy's

01:17:58.284 --> 01:17:59.200
kind of like a nobody.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.119
I could be that guy.

01:18:00.119 --> 01:18:02.160
Suddenly we have this
relatedness attached to it.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.660
When they're doing
the [DRILL SOUND]

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:04.960
that's the unpredictability.

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.740
There seems to be
analog solution,

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:07.560
they're building
something in the street.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:08.500
What is that?

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.560
Raise curiosity.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.100
And have you ever wondered why,
in all of these viral videos,

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:16.350
they always show random
bypassers on the streets?

01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:17.650
Oh, that's amazing solution.

01:18:17.650 --> 01:18:19.170
Oh, that's so cool.

01:18:19.170 --> 01:18:21.680
It's getting some relatedness
because our brain, when

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:23.690
we see something new, we don't
know what to think about it.

01:18:23.690 --> 01:18:25.960
But when we see other people
think, oh that's amazing,

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.940
then it must be amazing.

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:29.847
So it doesn't matter
if you're trying

01:18:29.847 --> 01:18:31.430
to get people to
obey the speed limit,

01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:34.310
or trying to create a video
that everyone's sharing virally,

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:36.925
or getting your employees
to work more collaboratively

01:18:36.925 --> 01:18:40.170
and build a product your
users can't live by I thinking

01:18:40.170 --> 01:18:42.300
through the eight core
drives, instead of just

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:43.840
technology and
functionalities, I

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.250
believe you'll have a better
product, better experience,

01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:47.780
and longer term engagement.

01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:52.592
So basically, there's-- if
you look at, read my book,

01:18:52.592 --> 01:18:53.300
all these things.

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.140
There's things later on.

01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:56.070
You can look and learn about
things like octalysis strategy

01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:57.960
dashboard, how
things come together.

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.500
Like I said, I have
my book on Amazon.

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.870
This link takes you to Amazon.

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:02.950
The book is $26.

01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:07.074
For people here, I can
sign it and sell at $20.

01:19:07.074 --> 01:19:08.740
I have my three day
workshops coming up,

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:10.830
if you're still interested
in learning more.

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:14.630
So the latest link is always
yukaichou.com/workshops.

01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:18.080
And this year, I'm launching
a Kickstarter campaign called

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.689
Octalysis Prime, which is
a journey about learning

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:21.480
about these things.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.887
But anyway, thank you very much,
and look for to some questions

01:19:24.887 --> 01:19:25.470
from you guys.

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:26.576
Thank you.

01:19:26.576 --> 01:19:41.240
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.990
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much for this.

01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:45.195
When you are designing
for a fixed audience--

01:19:45.195 --> 01:19:46.570
so in the workplace
we might have

01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:48.720
a team or a large
group of people

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.850
that we need to try and design
and engage with-- how do you

01:19:51.850 --> 01:19:54.555
find out which of these
elements, or these factors

01:19:54.555 --> 01:19:55.930
are going to be
the most powerful

01:19:55.930 --> 01:19:57.420
for that particular audience?

01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:58.086
YU-KAI CHOU: OK.

01:19:58.086 --> 01:20:00.632
So there's two elements
to think about.

01:20:00.632 --> 01:20:04.460
You think about the nature
of the core drive itself.

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:07.240
So again, we know black
hat drives urgency.

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.302
So if it's a one time
sales conversion,

01:20:09.302 --> 01:20:10.260
the event is black hat.

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:13.230
So usually in the
discovery phase,

01:20:13.230 --> 01:20:14.690
you do a lot of
white hat marketing

01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:16.720
because you want people to
feel good about your brand.

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.178
But then the black hat-- the
conversion event is black hat.

01:20:19.178 --> 01:20:22.612
It's about there's exclusive
offer, scarcity, five, four,

01:20:22.612 --> 01:20:24.070
three, two, one,
time's running out

01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.880
and you get people signed up.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.780
But once they join
onboarding, oftentimes you

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:28.080
want to think about white hat.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.530
We talk about development
and accomplishment,

01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:30.610
making them feel smart.

01:20:30.610 --> 01:20:32.829
The epic meaning and calling.

01:20:32.829 --> 01:20:33.870
And then the scaffolding.

01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:36.194
So you want to think about
the goal of the phase.

01:20:36.194 --> 01:20:38.110
Because each core drive--
the whole thing here

01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:39.110
is that none of
these core drives

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:40.510
are more powerful
than the other,

01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:41.320
they just do different things.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:42.910
They have different
consequences also.

01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:44.590
It's to understand what they do.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:46.090
So that's one aspect
to think about.

01:20:46.090 --> 01:20:49.719
The second one is how do
you pick the player type?

01:20:49.719 --> 01:20:52.010
So different types of people
are motivated differently,

01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:55.480
and you want to think about what
core drives motivate them more.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:59.060
So sometimes, when we designed
for international customers,

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:01.594
when we design for
Scandinavia, their culture

01:21:01.594 --> 01:21:03.760
is all about empowerment
of creativity and feedback.

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:06.510
It's about freedom,
happiness, fun.

01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:09.060
But for the Germany clients,
they're are all about ownership

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:11.309
and possession, in terms of
we need to stay organized,

01:21:11.309 --> 01:21:13.280
focused, fun is bad.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.030
Japan is high on epic
meaning and calling,

01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:19.420
giving yourself up to a
higher vision and [INAUDIBLE]

01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:21.390
or your organization.

01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:25.590
So sometimes, you just have
to see what they've already

01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:26.090
been doing.

01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:27.506
So they'll tell
you at times, well

01:21:27.506 --> 01:21:29.130
it looks like they
respond really well

01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:30.338
for unpredictive [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:30.338 --> 01:21:32.120
It's always a testing process.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.490
What I like to do is I like
to see what games they like

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:36.310
to play with the user base.

01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:39.320
Because the games are a
pure voluntary environment.

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.320
It's like a petri dish
with hundreds of millions

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.790
of test subjects in that.

01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:45.950
And so if you learn about what
games they play, it's like, oh,

01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:47.480
this person plays
games that always

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.460
involve unpredictability
or social influence.

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:51.190
This person's a social
influence person.

01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:52.480
Or this was always
play games that

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.688
has epic meaning and calling.

01:21:53.688 --> 01:21:56.792
OK, well let's implement some
of that into the experience.

01:21:56.792 --> 01:21:58.500
So there's multiple
ways to look at that,

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.030
and each case is a
little different,

01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:02.620
but I think, again, it's
about what phase you're at

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:05.680
and what kind of nature of the
core drive you're trying to do.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.470
And also, what already
appeals to them.

01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:10.570
Other questions?

01:22:10.570 --> 01:22:11.545
Yes.

01:22:11.545 --> 01:22:14.070
AUDIENCE: I feel a
little manipulated

01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:15.900
after learning all of this.

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:17.480
Just a little bit.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:22.200
But how much does this go back
to the primordial lizard brain

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.000
functions that are
almost automatic, as

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.180
opposed to more a
cognitive, that we actually

01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:27.260
think about it.

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:30.110
And secondly, do you think
that, in the future, as people

01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:32.519
get smarter and realize
they are being manipulated,

01:22:32.519 --> 01:22:35.060
that there's more sophisticated
techniques that will come in?

01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:35.726
YU-KAI CHOU: OK.

01:22:35.726 --> 01:22:36.990
So there's two things.

01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:40.110
One is the question, the
other is more about probably

01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:43.060
the ethics of this knowledge.

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:46.790
So first of all, your neo-cortex
is the crocodile brain.

01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:49.960
So the black hat core drives
relate to the crocodile brain.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.840
So it's about the
instinctual stuff.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.910
It's about loss and
avoidance, fight or flight,

01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:56.720
unpredictably exploring
new grounds, or scarcity.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:59.490
Which is why it
drives obsession.

01:22:59.490 --> 01:23:02.190
It drives short term, but
we don't feel good about it.

01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:03.890
The white hat core
drives are more

01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:06.089
about the neo-cortex,
things that we want to do,

01:23:06.089 --> 01:23:06.630
we intend to.

01:23:06.630 --> 01:23:08.250
If we spend time doing
the white hat things,

01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:09.220
it will make us happy.

01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:11.560
But however pursuing
our faith, or making

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.660
the world better,
learning new skills,

01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:16.090
makes us happy, well we end
up spending all our time doing

01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:16.750
is the black hat stuff.

01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:17.900
Oh, the deadline's coming up.

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:18.940
Oh, this exclusive offer.

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:19.630
What on Pinterest?

01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:20.421
What's on Facebook?

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.430
So if you say, oh, well we
want to engage our employees

01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:27.380
by giving them a
higher sense of meaning

01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:30.590
and purpose for their
work, a path to mastery,

01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:32.369
giving them more
time and creativity,

01:23:32.369 --> 01:23:33.910
a compensation pack
that makes sense,

01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:35.249
a collaborative environment.

01:23:35.249 --> 01:23:37.790
Most people won't be like, oh
you're trying to manipulate me.

01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:38.831
People think, sign me up.

01:23:38.831 --> 01:23:40.242
I want to be in
that environment.

01:23:40.242 --> 01:23:41.700
But it's the black
hat stuff that's

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:42.880
the sales, the fundraisers.

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.379
Like oh well, if you don't do
it, you're going to get fired.

01:23:45.379 --> 01:23:48.770
That's when people are like,
oh I don't feel great about it.

01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:51.120
You also can match that
core drives to-- you guys

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:54.220
know Maslow's hierarchy, where
it's like the bottom is also

01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:56.280
black hat, it's about
survival, and the white hat

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:59.210
is about actualization,
things like that.

01:23:59.210 --> 01:24:03.489
In terms of ethics, I get
asked quite a bit about that.

01:24:03.489 --> 01:24:05.780
So first of all, this is not
mind control, in the sense

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:08.140
that it's a sense of motivation.

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:12.600
Because when it says, oh this
increased behavior by 100%,

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:15.330
it pretty much meant, before
it was 9% conversion rate

01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:16.570
and now it's 18%.

01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:19.980
So still, 82% of the
people still can say no.

01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:21.720
But it's about
people on the fence,

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.514
it just nudges them
towards a direction.

01:24:23.514 --> 01:24:24.930
And so some people
are like, well,

01:24:24.930 --> 01:24:27.860
is this a benign
form of manipulation?

01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:29.210
And my answer is actually yes.

01:24:29.210 --> 01:24:30.900
It is a form of manipulation.

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.690
But everything in life
is a manipulation.

01:24:32.690 --> 01:24:35.692
Saying please is a
form of manipulation.

01:24:35.692 --> 01:24:37.400
You weren't going to
do something for me,

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.530
I said please, and then
you did something for me.

01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:41.460
And nothing about
the transaction

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:44.780
changed, basically I
used social influence.

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:46.890
And saying thank you is
like emotional reward.

01:24:46.890 --> 01:24:49.880
But we're not only are against
people saying please and thank

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.780
you, we actually expect it.

01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:54.300
And so my key principle about
it is, there's two things.

01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:56.710
One, there needs to be
opt-in to be influenced.

01:24:56.710 --> 01:24:58.410
You need to agree
to be-- you don't

01:24:58.410 --> 01:25:00.737
have to agree to the
proposal, but you

01:25:00.737 --> 01:25:01.820
agree that they can pitch.

01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:03.860
So let's say you have a
charismatic friend, who

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:05.460
tries to get you to a party.

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.260
And you don't want
to go to the party,

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:09.820
but you implicitly
listen to his pitch.

01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:12.190
And you know he's charismatic.

01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:14.420
So you opt-in to being pitched.

01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:17.452
The second thing
is transparency.

01:25:17.452 --> 01:25:18.910
Your users need to
know what you're

01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:20.210
trying to get them to do.

01:25:20.210 --> 01:25:22.460
If you tell them you're
trying to get them to a party,

01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:24.120
but you're actually trying
to get them to do drugs,

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.612
there's no transparency there.

01:25:25.612 --> 01:25:27.820
So if they know what you're
trying to get them to do,

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:30.060
and they agree that
you can pitch them,

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:34.342
you can try to persuade
them, then I think it's OK,

01:25:34.342 --> 01:25:35.300
at least from my world.

01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:36.966
If you think about
things like hypnosis,

01:25:36.966 --> 01:25:40.430
the ultimate manipulation,
full compliance.

01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:43.740
People are OK with hypnotism
because one, there's opt-in,

01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:45.140
I agree to be hypnotized.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.740
And then two,
there's transparency.

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:48.760
Hopefully I know what
you're trying to do.

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.770
And so I live by
these two principles.

01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:53.800
And there's also
another nothing.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.300
There's what the core drives
are trying to get people to do.

01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:57.964
So that's the good or bad.

01:25:57.964 --> 01:25:59.380
And then there's
the nature of it,

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:01.046
which is the white
hat versus black hat.

01:26:01.046 --> 01:26:03.690
So again, you can motivate
people towards genocide

01:26:03.690 --> 01:26:05.402
with epic meaning and calling.

01:26:05.402 --> 01:26:07.860
You can also motivate people
to exercise and help the world

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:09.330
with loss and avoidance.

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:12.640
So there's the purpose of what
the motivation's for, and that

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.320
could be good or
bad, but then there's

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:15.778
the white hat versus
the black hat.

01:26:15.778 --> 01:26:18.020
That's how you feel about
the type of motivation.

01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:22.010
So we've turned down lots
of inquiries and engagements

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:28.650
from big tobacco companies, and
gambling, and whatnot, alcohol.

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:30.630
We don't judge
people's lifestyles

01:26:30.630 --> 01:26:32.404
and we respect their
success, but we just

01:26:32.404 --> 01:26:34.570
thought, if we were really
successful at what we did

01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:36.600
and suddenly more
people became addicted

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:39.609
to smoking and drinking
and gambling, that's

01:26:39.609 --> 01:26:41.650
just not the impact we
want to make on the world.

01:26:41.650 --> 01:26:45.060
So that's a lot of times
where we draw a line.

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.390
Hopefully that answers a good
amount of your questions.

01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:48.690
Thank you.

01:26:48.690 --> 01:26:49.690
Any other questions?

01:26:55.190 --> 01:26:55.950
No?

01:26:55.950 --> 01:26:56.450
OK.

01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:58.284
Well again, thank you
so much for being here

01:26:58.284 --> 01:27:00.658
and especially being live,
because I know a lot of people

01:27:00.658 --> 01:27:02.140
like to just watch
the online one.

01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:04.270
And I'll be around, if
you want to talk more,

01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:05.520
or you want me to sign a book.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.978
I'm just happy to
be here and help.

01:27:06.978 --> 01:27:08.650
Thank you.
