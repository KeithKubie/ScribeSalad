00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.583
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We looked at solving linear equations graphically. We looked at the

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:07.660
intersection of two lines. And we know that the values of the coordinates, of

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.881
those points of intersection, would satisfy, either equation passing through

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:16.225
that point. So we're considering, the x intercepts, of our lovely parabola, that

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:20.371
we now have two equivelent equations for. What lines do we need to think about

00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:24.574
intersecting, at either one of these points? I'll give you a hint, that it's the

00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:28.436
same two equations at each point. And if you decide that this parabola is one of

00:00:28.436 --> 00:00:32.206
the lines that you should use, then it doesn't matter if you write the equation

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:35.833
in this form, or in this form. Fill in the rest of these two equations right

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:37.414
here, that we are interested in.
