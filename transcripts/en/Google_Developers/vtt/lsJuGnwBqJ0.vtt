CATHY PEARL: Even though I
think the world has woken up

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.410
a bit more to the fact
that women really are here

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.650
and we are ready to be more
involved and ready to have

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.980
a bigger part, it hasn't
all changed overnight.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.480
And so it's wonderful to see
an event like this where you're

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.880
surrounded by all these
inspiring and powerful women

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.130
who are not afraid to
say yes, I am doing

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.470
great interesting
things, and to remind us

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.660
that, even though sometimes
maybe at work or out

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.792
in the world, you feel like
you're in the minority,

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:29.250
it's so nice to be surrounded
by these women who are facing

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.970
similar things and realize that
more and more people are really

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.520
waking up to this and trying
to do something about it.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.070
Voice technology is
accessible in the sense

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.415
that you can build on a
platform like Google Assistant,

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:41.790
anyone is allowed
to build on it,

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.920
and publish an action that
the whole world can use.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.390
And so, if you can learn how
to do the necessary coding

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.610
and design, you can
create these things

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.953
and put them out in the world
and anybody can use them.

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:54.870
And it's, to me, a very
kind of equalizing way

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.550
to get this
technology out there.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.223
Part of my job is
to let people know

00:00:58.223 --> 00:01:00.390
that there is this thing
called conversation design.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.150
It's a design discipline that
should be applied anytime

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.250
you're building a voice
or conversational thing,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.680
whether it's on the Google
Assistant or anywhere.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.462
And the point of
it is to say that,

00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:10.920
no matter what
you're building, you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.350
have to think about who
is the person using it.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.270
And you have to apply these
principles of conversation.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.990
Just like humans have
rules about how we talk,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.600
we have to take those rules and
apply them to the technology

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.740
that we have today.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.410
I think that first moment
when you have that first back

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.920
and forth where it's speaking
and you're talking back

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.710
is a super pivotal exciting
moment where your brain kind

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.070
of goes, wait a minute.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.070
And it starts opening up
all these possibilities

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.270
and ideas of things you can do.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.520
SHARMISHTHA GUPTA: Plugging
all my gadgets in my house

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.685
with that in there, and just
to come out and not even worry

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:45.940
about I have to get up from
couch and press that button.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.210
Maybe I shouldn't even
without the Google Assistant.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.850
Good learning, I think
I can do that now.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.690
DOLIMER RODRIGUEZ: So I'm
here to brainstorm, get ideas,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.440
be inspired for my work,
but also for myself as well.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.210
Working with Actions
on Google, I'm

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.680
really looking forward to
keeping my mother actually

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.860
in mind.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.289
So Google Assistant obviously
is creating access to folks

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.720
to just streamline
work in a lot of ways.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.600
And my mother who is an
immigrant from the Dominican

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.360
Republic into the United
States, just thinking of her

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.880
and how I can make something
more accessible to her.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.200
She has access to a phone.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.650
However, she doesn't
really have much access

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.280
to the applications and the
ease the applications can bring

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.212
due to the language barrier.

00:02:31.212 --> 00:02:32.670
And also the
knowledge barrier when

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.860
it comes to working
with technology

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.380
and how fast it's
becoming so innovative.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.600
So, yeah, I'm looking
forward to creating

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.020
something that will benefit
her and many women who

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.200
also are experiencing some pull
back from technology like she

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.700
is.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.150
HANNAH LUXENBERG: So I
went to the tech workshop

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.060
where we programmed
the Google Assistant.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.490
And I have been
learning to program.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.070
I decided to dive into
the technical workshop,

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.740
even though I'm
really not that great.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.450
I thought that they
were all going to be

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.660
pro coders walking in there.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.355
And it turns out that we were
kind of all in the same boat

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.480
and helping each other out.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.313
SHARMISHTHA GUPTA: So
I read the description

00:03:11.313 --> 00:03:13.180
before I came to
the workshop that

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.720
described that it is
a little bit related

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.500
to NLP on how you would
understand the language itself.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.190
I have never worked with the
application myself previously,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.680
but it's definitely
an interesting space

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.910
where it's growing.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.970
The workshop was well
documented online.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.730
I had fun doing it.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.570
And I think I'll
definitely continue on.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.220
