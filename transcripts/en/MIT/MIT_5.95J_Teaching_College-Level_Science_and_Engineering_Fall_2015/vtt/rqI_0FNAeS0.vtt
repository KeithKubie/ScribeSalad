00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.570
PROFESSOR: And before we
get into the topic, which

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.272
is educational teaching
with educational technology,

00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:33.730
I just want to go back to some
of the previous assignments,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.660
a little bit of
logistics, et cetera.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.910
So you should have feedback
on all the assignments

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.650
that you can be
given feedback on.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.354
The assignment where you gave
a presentation to a friend, I

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:50.770
can't really give
you feedback on.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.790
I looked over it.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.270
You all made nice observations,
good pointed observations,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.535
and I hope that
you can see how--

00:00:57.535 --> 00:00:59.410
and I think I made this
comment on the wiki--

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.220
that you can see how
just your presence,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.240
and the choice of words that
you make, can have a big effect.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.290
And that was the whole
point of that assignment.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.640
So that's my feedback
on that assignment.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.571
The previous one,
the last one that I

00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:16.570
feel like I can give you
substantive feedback on

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.510
is the active learning, how to
incorporate active learning.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.060
As I mentioned
last time, you guys

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.120
did such a great job of
incorporating active learning

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.250
in the first time you'd
submitted that, where

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.979
it was just creating
a course outline,

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.520
that there wasn't
a lot extra to add.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.400
But I added comments
whenever possible.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.270
One thing that I commented on
at least two people's homework,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.980
the one about active
learning, was the idea--

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.370
you mentioned you doing demos.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.590
So there's a very
interesting piece

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.290
of work out of Eric
Mazur's group at Harvard

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.060
about the use of demos.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.640
And that paper is called
"The Crouch and Mazur Paper."

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.610
And it's a optional
reading in, I believe,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.050
it's the active
learning session.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:40.344
So this is the active learning
class, which is class 5, right?

00:02:40.344 --> 00:02:41.260
Am I right about that?

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.509
Or it was 6?

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:44.300
AUDIENCE: It was 6.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.220
PROFESSOR: 6?

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.970
AUDIENCE: Yes, 6.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.511
PROFESSOR: 6.

00:02:50.673 --> 00:02:53.068
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:53.068 --> 00:02:54.150
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.120
So it's 5.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.300
Yeah, so that's a really
interesting paper.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.100
Because I think
sometimes we say,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.290
oh, I'm going to do a demo.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.310
Apriori, a demo isn't active.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.650
I mean, it's active for you.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.470
You're doing the demo.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.510
But it's not necessarily
active for students.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.290
And if we enter into the
enterprise of doing a demo

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.450
thinking we're being--

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.860
well, thinking
they're being active--

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.390
they might not be.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.130
And Croutch and Mazur did
an interesting study where

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.430
they looked at-- they were doing
a freshmen mechanics class.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.310
And they had amasses
on an air track, when

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.890
you have like a massive
2M, and you slam into it

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.650
with a mass of M. What
happens to the mass of 2M?

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.800
What happens to this mass
of M that was coming in,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.850
that kind of stuff.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.324
And so that it would show
the students these demos.

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:45.240
Oh, look what happens.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.390
Here comes a mass of M at
a velocity, da, da, da.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.820
And then when they
asked students

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.460
in the same class at the
end of the same class period

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.140
to say what happens
when a mass of M

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.600
collides with a mass of 2M, a
mass of M going x miles an hour

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.710
collides with the mass 2M, what
happens, students got it wrong.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.280
They had just seen the demo.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.044
They had just seen the demo.

00:04:09.044 --> 00:04:10.210
And they still got it wrong.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.240
And I think that's a
really profound finding.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.246
Because as experts,
we think, of course,

00:04:20.246 --> 00:04:21.329
they're going to see this.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.180
It's going to be emblazoned
into their brain.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.310
They'll never forget it.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.880
But they never
learn it, basically.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.560
So it's more evidence for
active learning for sure.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.460
But what they found out
was they forced students

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.270
to make a prediction, to discuss
that prediction with somebody

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.960
else before they saw the demo.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.450
And when they did
that, the scores

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.280
on these sort of post-demo
quizzes, if you will,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.050
went way up.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.380
So it's a small tweak,
but it's a profound one.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.750
Because you might really
just be wasting your time

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.190
if you show a lot
of demos and you

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.520
don't ask students to make
these predictions beforehand.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.620
This goes back to
the mathematician

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.730
George Polya, who wrote in
the '50s about asking people

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.790
to make predictions before
you gave them the answer.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.290
I'm not sure he had
any data for it.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.480
But this was his thing.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.270
This is pretty good data
suggesting that you really

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.090
should ask students
to make predictions

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.650
before showing the demo.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.372
So a couple people
brought that up.

00:05:26.372 --> 00:05:28.330
And I wanted to make sure
everybody heard that.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.960
OK?

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.374
If you can't find this
reference, let me know.

00:05:31.374 --> 00:05:32.790
It might be hiding
somewhere else.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.310
I'm pretty sure it's in this--

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.164
it is?

00:05:36.164 --> 00:05:37.620
OK.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.100
OK, so that was that.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.230
But overall, a great
job on that assignment.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.710
And then I briefly looked over
the assignment it was due today

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:53.130
or whenever creating prompts
at various levels of Bloom's

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.650
Taxonomy or a taxonomy
of your choosing.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.350
Again, I thought
you did a great job.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.242
I'd like to hear a little bit
of reactions to that assignment.

00:06:01.242 --> 00:06:01.950
Was it difficult?

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.940
Was it easy?

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.389
Do you see how it
could be useful?

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:05.805
Does it seem like
a waste of time?

00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:11.040
AUDIENCE: I think it
was very, very useful.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.673
Yeah, it lets you see what
the students will go to

00:06:17.673 --> 00:06:19.560
when you [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.910
Otherwise, because it's
like you are solving too.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.060
So you kind of feel and see
what level to take them to.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.842
It's very good.

00:06:27.842 --> 00:06:28.550
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.460
AUDIENCE: Otherwise,
you don't know.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.334
You just [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:30.334 --> 00:06:33.809
And then you don't
know how [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:34.600
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.300
And I mean, it's happened
to me when I first started

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.985
teaching intro materials.

00:06:38.985 --> 00:06:40.360
[INAUDIBLE] was
like, OK, they'll

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.762
calculate the stress on this
plane, and blah, blah, blah.

00:06:43.762 --> 00:06:45.720
And you're like, well,
why are they doing that?

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.500
What is that getting them?

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.330
And it's just this
reality check for you,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.630
so that you don't go off
into the weeds sort of.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.074
So, yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:53.074 --> 00:07:16.890
AUDIENCE: I think
[INAUDIBLE] most

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:27.012
of very good question
that [INAUDIBLE] They're

00:07:27.012 --> 00:07:28.431
[? setting ?] very
good questions

00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:41.052
and [INAUDIBLE] more than
just one, [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:41.052 --> 00:07:43.254
three at the same time.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.902
So I think it's
really very good.

00:07:44.902 --> 00:07:45.860
It's a good experience.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.568
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:07:46.568 --> 00:07:49.350
And also to make sure
you're aware of that,

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.500
and then also decide, well,
if they don't remember

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.340
the value of the universal
gas constant in these units,

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.010
but they do the apply
part fine, they just

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.009
use the-- so it's
important, we always

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:03.050
have to think about that
when we grade questions.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.630
But I think by parsing
it out like that,

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.880
it makes you more
cognizant of those issues

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.200
that might come up, in terms
of how the students respond

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.503
to the question.

00:08:14.503 --> 00:08:15.961
AUDIENCE: I thought
it was actually

00:08:15.961 --> 00:08:20.981
difficult to make a question
that only satisfied one of--

00:08:20.981 --> 00:08:24.585
like applied [INAUDIBLE]
Because everything I

00:08:24.585 --> 00:08:30.480
was asking [INAUDIBLE] to try
to apply, was also analyzed.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.172
Because I tried to--

00:08:32.172 --> 00:08:34.610
I guess i could have just
made one that did both.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.659
But I was sitting and I was
like, no, OK, not this one.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:42.157
But really, I almost left it
blank and said, I'm stuck.

00:08:42.157 --> 00:08:44.115
I finally come with
something that I think just

00:08:44.115 --> 00:08:45.506
answered the [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:45.506 --> 00:08:47.130
But it was interesting
to think about.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.480
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.400
And you know, in real life, you
don't have to just have one.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.430
You can embed them together,
but you know, recall and apply,

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:59.570
or whatever.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.240
And I think for some
topics, it might be easier

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.880
to add to silo-ize
it a little bit.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.870
Given the data,
construct a whatever,

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.410
so that's more of an apply.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.480
But there may be classes of
subjects where you can't really

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.470
do that quite the same way.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.220
Other reactions?

00:09:21.148 --> 00:09:23.910
AUDIENCE: I was also thinking
of it in terms of grading.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:29.344
Like if you have a
rubric or you have

00:09:29.344 --> 00:09:31.330
assigning the number
of points based

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.350
on which level you were asking.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.960
Like as opposed to say, OK,
five points for each question,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.140
to say, OK, you get one
point for the remembering

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.130
and then you get 10
points for the creative.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:45.940
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.270
Right.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.140
I would be careful--

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.250
I mean, I think
that's a fine idea.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.125
I would be careful to
make sure that students

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:53.260
know that, so they don't kill
themselves memorizing pi out

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.550
to 25 digits or
something, right?

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.670
So if you do have
these sort of, this

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:04.510
is what I think is important,
you'll need to specify that.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.809
I mean, and a rubric could
incorporate that for sure.

00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:08.350
But you do want to
make sure students

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.470
know what your logic is.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.860
AUDIENCE: I think also
there are some questions

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:21.874
you said that you give the
formulas to the equation.

00:10:21.874 --> 00:10:27.660
Just to make sure that
the student [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.750
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.250
Right.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:34.260
And in most classes,
that's totally reasonable.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.000
You know the joke I make
about it's rare to real life

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.690
that somebody comes in and says,
I need this answer right now!

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.520
Don't look up anything.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.950
I mean, it's kind
of a weird pretense.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.760
So it's usually
reasonable to just put

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.860
the equations at the
bottom, or write it

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.120
in the problem statement.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.750
Anything else on that?

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.280
OK, so today we're going
to talk about teaching

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.120
with educational technology.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.860
I had written on the website
to bring a web-enabled device.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.660
If you didn't, I
have an extra laptop.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.590
And we can share.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:15.360
It's shouldn't be a problem.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.940
As part of this,
I hope that you'll

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.080
be able to identify appropriate
educational technologies

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.600
to advance an intended
learning outcome.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.760
And I want to get back
to that in just a second.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.220
And maybe describe
best practices

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.560
and potential pitfalls
of particular educational

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.150
technology, so
somewhat modest goals.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.830
I think it's a really
interesting thing

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.160
to think about technology--

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.400
and I didn't make this up.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.650
I heard this at a conference.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.160
So they said, when you
walk into Home Depot or one

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.710
of these big home
improvement stores,

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.490
if you happen to be blessed
by having an employee come up

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.300
to you--

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.758
because sometimes
it's hard to find

00:11:55.758 --> 00:11:57.240
an employee in those stores--

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.350
what do they ask you?

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.052
AUDIENCE: Is everything OK?

00:12:03.052 --> 00:12:04.390
Is there anything I can
help you with today?

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.098
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:12:05.098 --> 00:12:07.230
OK, is there anything
I can help you with?

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.440
If and you say, yeah.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.550
Yeah, you can.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.300
And then they say?

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.050
Usually, it's, what
are you working on?

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.110
What are you trying to do?

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:26.019
They don't say, what
tool do you want?

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:26.810
I mean, they might.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.900
But if they're good, they don't.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.190
And I think that's a word
the wise when we think

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.230
about educational technology.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.420
It's not, what looks
really cool and fun,

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.320
and what tool do I want?

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.700
It's, what am I trying to build?

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.200
What do I want my
students to build?

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.283
What am I trying to build?

00:12:46.283 --> 00:12:48.110
What am I trying to accomplish?

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.010
And then I can
step back and say,

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.830
which of these technologies
is going to help me do it?

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.960
And it's easy to
get wrapped up--

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.340
I mean, we're all
kind of techie, geeky.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.050
I mean that is a compliment.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.780
But it's kind of fun.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.989
Like, oh, cool, look
what this can you.

00:13:06.989 --> 00:13:08.530
And then we go
walking around looking

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.250
for something to do with it.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.664
And that might be OK, but you
have to check your assumption.

00:13:15.664 --> 00:13:17.080
You have to check
your assumptions

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.470
about why you're doing it.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.016
Are you doing it
just to be cool?

00:13:20.016 --> 00:13:21.640
Or are you doing it
because it's really

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.265
going to help student
learning, or it's

00:13:23.265 --> 00:13:25.440
going to help advance
the learning outcome?

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.160
We can use
educational technology

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.950
as some kind of a scapegoat,
but that's true for anything.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.350
It's true for that
amazing exam question

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.220
that you thought
up in the shower.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.210
Like, I know what I'll do.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.920
They'll do this, and do
that, and blah, blah.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.490
Maybe it's cool, but maybe it's
not going to get you anywhere.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.830
Maybe it's not consistent
with your learning outcomes.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.330
So it doesn't have
to be technology.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.970
But often, technology
is kind of pretty shiny.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.240
And we tend to
gravitate toward it.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.100
But it's remembering
that we're using

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.750
it to advance some particular
learning outcome, OK?

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.750
So you guys did the readings.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.920
What are educational
technologies?

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.890
What does it mean?

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.833
Can we come up
with a definition?

00:14:11.833 --> 00:14:12.735
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:18.110
I think from what
I can understand,

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:27.590
educational technology is a
tool which, perhaps, the student

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.720
and also have the teacher.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.710
So that means something that
can enable inter-communication

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.152
between the teacher
and the student.

00:14:37.152 --> 00:14:39.000
And then the student
and the student.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.190
PROFESSOR: OK, so we have a
lot of ideas in that statement.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:43.900
So it's a tool.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.546
You said, it enables
communication.

00:14:55.546 --> 00:14:58.382
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
students connect.

00:14:58.382 --> 00:15:01.334
And then the
teacher [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.760
PROFESSOR: And I think you
had something else in there.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.260
Did you?

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:24.760
Or no?

00:15:33.139 --> 00:15:34.150
Somebody else?

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.154
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:36.154 --> 00:15:39.257
AUDIENCE: Education
technology is like a tool

00:15:39.257 --> 00:15:41.590
to enhance students' learning--
enhancement of student's

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:43.813
learning.

00:15:43.813 --> 00:15:48.992
And enhancement of
instructors' teaching as well.

00:15:57.805 --> 00:16:01.582
AUDIENCE: The technology part
is like a electronic device.

00:16:01.582 --> 00:16:03.290
PROFESSOR: So it has
to have electricity?

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.290
It has to involve electrons?

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.940
No, that's everything.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.790
Wait, let's let Michelle--
what should we say about that?

00:16:18.257 --> 00:16:20.245
AUDIENCE: I think that's
kind of correct to say

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:22.090
it has to be an
electronic device, right?

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.030
Like if it's a
clicker or if it's a--

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.510
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.550
PROFESSOR: It must
be electronic.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.080
That sounds so like 1950s.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.839
I think we had-- yeah, Gordon?

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:42.304
AUDIENCE: I would just
adjust it a little bit

00:16:42.304 --> 00:16:45.262
and add in front of
the two [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:04.462
AUDIENCE: A kind of tool
that's created [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:04.462 --> 00:17:06.824
by time or place.

00:17:06.824 --> 00:17:11.450
PROFESSOR: So it lends
itself to asynchronicity?

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.748
AUDIENCE: Yes,
something like that.

00:17:13.748 --> 00:17:31.952
PROFESSOR: Most-- Anything else?

00:17:31.952 --> 00:17:38.770
AUDIENCE: I think it's
also enhancer, easier

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.190
use of materials.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.286
PROFESSOR: Facilitates--

00:17:46.202 --> 00:17:49.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah, materials like.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.470
It has to [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:56.750
PROFESSOR: Right,
a distribution,

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.153
aids distribution?

00:17:59.153 --> 00:18:13.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.881
PROFESSOR: Did I
hear something else?

00:18:15.881 --> 00:18:19.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.421
PROFESSOR: Efficient,
that's a loaded word.

00:18:33.616 --> 00:18:34.740
Anybody have anything else?

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.220
Or does somebody want to make
a comment on this collection

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.332
of attributes?

00:18:39.332 --> 00:18:40.775
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:47.074 --> 00:18:49.240
PROFESSOR: I don't think I
have any cynics in this--

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.150
well, the cynics
haven't said anything.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.557
AUDIENCE: I think all the
comments are positive things.

00:18:54.557 --> 00:18:57.360
Like if you're doing it
well what should happen.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.610
But they aren't necessarily
what actually happens.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.620
Because most of the time,
it's probably not done well.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.786
Using technology is not optimal.

00:19:12.157 --> 00:19:13.740
PROFESSOR: OK, that's
one observation.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.020
It's sort of, you
know, that rhyme, there

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.310
was a little girl who
had a little curl right

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.060
in the middle her forehead.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.710
And when she was good,
she was very, very good.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.510
And when she was
bad, she was horrid.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:23.790
So it's a little bit
like this, right?

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.394
When it's good, it's
very, very good.

00:19:25.394 --> 00:19:27.060
And when it's bad,
maybe it's even worse

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.580
than if you hadn't bothered.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.050
But-- Alex, you had
something to say?

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:32.660
No?

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.410
AUDIENCE: Well, on the
side of the cynics,

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.750
I thought that students
are often disinterested

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.375
when they don't see
the point, or don't

00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:40.830
see them using it later.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.497
It's not necessarily
a definition of it.

00:19:42.497 --> 00:19:43.496
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

00:19:43.496 --> 00:19:45.060
No, but that's a
very good point.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.240
And somebody had quoted
this idea of an app,

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.870
that if an app doesn't load in
something like seven seconds,

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.114
people stop using it.

00:19:54.114 --> 00:19:56.280
Like if you try to get an
app to open on your phone,

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.900
and you're like,
what's going on here?

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.890
Come on, 1, 2, 3, 4--

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.390
OK, forget it.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.160
And that's a similar idea,
that if it doesn't look

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.050
like it's going to help you--

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.636
and whatever that means,
help, it's self-defined, help.

00:20:10.636 --> 00:20:12.760
But if it doesn't look like
it's going to help you,

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.720
you're not going to buy into it.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.365
Some other thoughts
about this list?

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.610
Personally, I don't
think that to be

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.830
an educational
technology it has meet

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.890
all these criteria at once.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.720
That's an important
thing to note,

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.730
that it might
improve productivity.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.400
The old school learning
management systems

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.780
that you put up problem
sets, and you put up--

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.360
the grade book was in one
place, and that kind of thing.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.950
That might help
your productivity.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:02.660
You're not looking
around for stuff.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.270
But it's not
necessarily promoting

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.770
learning at any level.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.050
It's a delivery system, a
materials delivery system.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.670
So it kind of does this.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.320
And it does this.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.400
But it might not really be part
of the learning enterprise.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.000
It's a store.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.290
It's a repository.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.370
And that's fine.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.870
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.630
But that's one type.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.590
If you're saying that it
enables communication,

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.180
well, that might
be part of this.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.610
But it might be something else.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.181
If I say, all
right, it's a wiki.

00:21:35.181 --> 00:21:37.430
And I want you guys to read
what everybody else wrote,

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.230
and to make a comment
on at least one other

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:43.280
persons' posting, well, I
have facilitated communication

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.130
between you in an
asynchronous way.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:52.100
I didn't tell everybody to do it
at noon on the 29th of October.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.858
But it does facilitate
communication.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.846
I think this one is a
loaded one, for sure.

00:22:00.846 --> 00:22:02.220
And it gets to
Michelle's comment

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:06.240
about if you did it
right, it would do that.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:11.200
But if you did it wrong, it's
likely to not do that at all.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.980
So these are attributes that
you could use to describe

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.366
some educational technologies.

00:22:21.366 --> 00:22:23.240
I do have a definition
from the reading book.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:28.370
But before I put that up, any
other thing you want to add?

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.320
It's interesting
to think about it,

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.340
like does it have
to be electronic?

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.731
So I have had
classes in the past

00:22:33.731 --> 00:22:35.480
where people argue,
OK, well, a blackboard

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.050
is an educational technology.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.050
I mean, you could do
that without some sort

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.230
of human-made product.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.540
And without it, I would
have to be walking

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.990
around speaking very slowly
and hoping you took notes,

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.060
or walking around with--

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.490
I don't know-- a piece
of paper that I wrote on,

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.200
and sharing it with
you or something.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.960
So a blackboard does fit a lot
of these categories, right?

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.840
It's an efficient
delivery system.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.900
At some level, it
enables communication.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:14.060
It's a distribution
of learning materials.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.690
So we want to think
about whether it

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.446
means it has to be electronic.

00:23:21.755 --> 00:23:23.630
And you may have guessed
by now, there is not

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.680
a single definition, so
that's the other issue.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.460
Comments?

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.129
Yes, go ahead.

00:23:29.129 --> 00:23:30.170
AUDIENCE: Just a comment.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:36.010
What about if it's not
well-moderated [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.660
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
the efficient one,

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.740
that we've all gotten
sucked into websites,

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.920
or sucked into, perhaps,
an online discussion,

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.930
or commenting on something.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.710
And it might be interesting.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:56.260
You might learn.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:00.200
But it may not be
efficient at all.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.510
Or you might just be on
the screed end of things,

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.540
where people are
just either ranting

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.130
or they're reinforcing
misconceptions or whatever.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:15.572
So yeah, you do
have to kind of make

00:24:15.572 --> 00:24:17.030
sure people are
using it carefully.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.150
But that's true for
virtually anything you do.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.774
Any other comments?

00:24:24.774 --> 00:24:32.000
AUDIENCE: And I think, as well,
that the fact that these tools

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.860
are valuable.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:40.366
A student can decide to
stay home in the bad weather

00:24:40.366 --> 00:24:43.210
since he knows
this is available.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.202
Then he can go [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:52.470
That could be good and bad.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:58.366
Because the student would
continue to learn on his own

00:24:58.366 --> 00:25:00.376
and become a good student.

00:25:00.376 --> 00:25:05.650
And then he could miss out on
some critical points as well.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.950
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:15.880
But that implies some sort
of like web-housed delivered

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:22.450
repository of content, or of
video lectures, or whatever.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.150
You could have a course that
used clickers, let's say,

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.860
that didn't even have a
website, but they used clickers.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:37.060
So that course might be using
educational technology, maybe

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.281
in a very, very good
way in the classroom,

00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:42.030
but they don't even
bother with a website.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.300
So in that case, the
student has to come to class

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.230
if they want to experience that
particular use of technology.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.600
I think you're right, that
if you do have a website,

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.080
or you do have lectures online,
or you do have rich content

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.610
online, then it does
sort of, perhaps,

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:03.990
make being in the classroom
a little bit less necessary.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.920
I will say, if you employ active
learning methods in class,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.210
group discussions, et cetera,
that being in the classroom

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.960
is, certainly, I would argue,
is value added for the student.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.200
So it's not a
replacement experience,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.610
but it might be better
than nothing, let's say.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.710
It might not.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.018
Yes, Gordon.

00:26:26.018 --> 00:26:28.358
AUDIENCE: I found something
written very interesting

00:26:28.358 --> 00:26:34.240
when it said that if
you use clickers--

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.316
I would love to do that.

00:26:36.316 --> 00:26:39.210
To take attendance
of the students,

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:43.790
that it might [INAUDIBLE] the
students from using technology.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.530
But it's only [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.590
It might actually be
good to have technology

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:54.626
they can use non-evasively
to find out if the student is

00:26:54.626 --> 00:26:56.000
actually coming to your class.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.416
AUDIENCE: What if they gave
their clicker to their friend?

00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:00.622
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's true.

00:27:00.622 --> 00:27:03.080
AUDIENCE: One person will come
with five friend's clickers,

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.600
the clicker won't--

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.214
AUDIENCE: If you have like
RFIB technology or something

00:27:08.214 --> 00:27:13.064
like that that can use to
[INAUDIBLE] come to the class

00:27:13.064 --> 00:27:19.240
to know that, OK, this person
is the one using [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.650
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:39.960
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.130
AUDIENCE: So in certain
courses you have to do that.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
you must do that.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.320
AUDIENCE: You have to show up?

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.825
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
you should show up.

00:27:45.825 --> 00:27:49.610
But if you decide it's
difficult to take attendance,

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:53.370
and if you have this wonderful
way of getting the students to

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.360
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:09.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:12.544
PROFESSOR: Well, I don't know
if there's an answer to that.

00:28:12.544 --> 00:28:14.210
For some students,
it's never a problem.

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:15.610
For some students, it's awesome.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:18.190
For some students, it's
just more information.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.510
And it's just another path.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:20.110
And they're learning.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.620
And they're learning.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:21.130
And they're learning.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.546
And it's supplementing what
they're learning in the class.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:26.982
It kind of depends on--

00:28:26.982 --> 00:28:30.885
AUDIENCE: Taking attendance
that Gordon is talking about,

00:28:30.885 --> 00:28:31.814
so is it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:31.814 --> 00:28:32.730
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:36.850
And actually that's
an important point

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.400
is that I think I showed
these slides about clicker use

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.860
in 511 1.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.470
I showed when we
did active learning.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.020
And the first year
they used them,

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.840
they used them more or
less to take attendance.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.350
And students figured
that out pretty quickly.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.470
They did all sorts of things,
sharing clickers, clicking

00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:00.820
and then leaving, or
coming in at the end

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.630
and clicking, but not
being there the whole time.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:06.760
And if you ask
students, well, what

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.210
did you think about the
clickers, they're like, fu.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:11.110
This is crappy.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.950
This didn't help me.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.000
This is terrible.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.130
And probably it didn't.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.350
There's an attitudinal thing
that says at some point,

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.320
if you think it's not
helping, it's not helping.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.580
So the next year, they made it
a point to really incorporate it

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:28.840
into the class, to ask good
questions, rich questions,

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:34.930
questions that had interesting
and informative distractors.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:38.020
So the wrong answers told the
instructors what the problems

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.940
and misconceptions were.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.860
And this was made
clear to the students.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.489
And in that way,
if you ask students

00:29:44.489 --> 00:29:46.030
what they thought
about the clickers,

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.360
they were not at all resentful
of the use of clickers.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.940
And they did not see them as a
way of just taking attendance.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.230
They didn't think they were
sort of baby or whatever.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.930
And they were therefore
more effective.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.263
[? Rachel, ?] you had a comment.

00:30:01.263 --> 00:30:06.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was just
going to say going to 802.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.370
PROFESSOR: That's the E and
M, Electricity and Magnetism

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.364
freshman year.

00:30:10.364 --> 00:30:17.265
AUDIENCE: The class I
took it in [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:17.265 --> 00:30:19.905
So we did all the online
[? courseware ?] and then

00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:21.390
the idea was that
you come to class

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:25.580
and you just learn for two
hours from the teacher using

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.020
group discussions, and
all these other things.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.600
And it was one of the worst
classes I've ever [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:37.260
Because the professor wasn't
prepared to do these two hour

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:41.580
discussions, like group
discussions, and group work,

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.710
and all these different
things that you could tell

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.310
he wasn't used to doing.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.640
And it was just a giant mess.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.020
So I think they're
really useful tools.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.240
But they also
require the professor

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.405
to really put something
into it for the students

00:30:56.405 --> 00:30:57.530
to get something out of it.

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:58.530
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:30:59.870
And that's a consideration.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.850
For some things,
you can adopt them.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.400
There's kind of a
low bar for adoption

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.820
and a low bar for
solid use, maybe

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.460
not innovative, maybe
not groundbreaking,

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.280
but a solid pedagogical use.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.620
For others, if you're going
to use them effectively

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.203
in the classroom,
you're going to have

00:31:17.203 --> 00:31:19.610
to spend some time engaging
with the technology,

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.070
making sure you understand
it, making sure you understand

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.530
what you can do with it.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.230
Otherwise, it's
not going to work.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:34.360
A couple stories,
one is the idea of--

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.840
well, maybe I'll hold that one.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.432
I'll hold that one.

00:31:37.432 --> 00:31:38.390
I'll bring it up later.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.520
Remind me.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.440
Any other comments about this?

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.417
So this is a
definition that I got,

00:31:45.417 --> 00:31:47.000
I think from one of
the [? reasons, ?]

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.240
so technological
processes and resources

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.910
that are used, created,
or managed for learning

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:56.030
and/or improving performance.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:58.910
So that's crazy broad.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:02.600
And then in that definition,
there's this technological,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.090
which gets around
the electronic,

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:06.520
but brings back
the idea of well,

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.260
a blackboard is probably a
technology at some level,

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.240
or at least it
was at some point.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:21.890
So it's admittedly an incredibly
difficult concept to pin down.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.335
And maybe at some point, you
don't necessarily have to.

00:32:24.335 --> 00:32:28.030
You have to decide which slice
of it you want to deal with.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:32.791
And so the other important
thing is that it's--

00:32:32.791 --> 00:32:35.290
and it doesn't have to be, but
it can be-- an integral part.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:41.690
Or it should be well-integrated
within the course,

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:46.330
and or it could be a
supplemental learning aid.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:47.890
So it could be a
way of delivering

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:53.620
content outside of class,
or the idea of an enrichment

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.940
of the material.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.190
And it could be
something like hardware,

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.618
really just like hardware.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:07.300
I'm going to come back to how we
chop this up in just a second.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.642
Remember that we
don't want to do

00:33:09.642 --> 00:33:12.100
any thing-- this is the idea
about walking into Home Depot.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.350
We don't want to do anything
without thinking first

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.360
about our intended
learning outcomes.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.880
What intended learning outcome
is the technology going

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:24.460
to advance, not, what am I going
to do with this technology?

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:28.350
And so in terms
of categorization,

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:30.570
this is something that
I came up with just

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:31.980
after grappling with things.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.779
So this is just my thing.

00:33:33.779 --> 00:33:35.820
And we're going to talk
more about different ways

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.640
to think about it.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.124
So this is just one slice of it.

00:33:38.124 --> 00:33:39.540
You could think
about technologies

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.520
that you use in the
classroom, so that

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.810
would be clickers, that would
be using some sort of projection

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:49.440
system, using a smart board,
using some sort of simulations

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.030
that you show students, et
cetera, like virtual demos.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:58.320
It could be a way for students
to engage with the content

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.470
and with other students
outside of the classroom.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:05.130
So it could be some sort of a
wiki, some other collaboration

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.639
tool, and/or it
could be something

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:11.470
that delivers the content to
the student outside of class.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:16.429
And there may be an overlap.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:17.989
You may show a
simulation in class,

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.449
and then decide students
should have access to it

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:21.730
outside of class.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:25.550
So they're not
mutually exclusive.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.260
And so the engagement
with the content

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.940
can include these collaboration
tools, extra materials,

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.010
content enrichment materials.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:37.969
And then the third one might
be student assignments.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:42.290
So the idea, maybe you're
going to say to students,

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.260
OK, I want you to create
a website for a company

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.870
that you're going to
create, and this parameters.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:50.420
And you want to make sure
you're explicit about what

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.010
the company sells, and how
you deal with customers,

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:53.780
or whatever.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.270
The assignment involves
the technology.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:35:00.830
Go out and make an audio
recording of people

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.050
using a particular technology.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:08.000
Or if you're going
to design something

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.500
for use in some
community, interview

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.350
the people in the community,
and submit this audio recording.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:15.380
So it could be that technology
could be used in the student

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.292
assignments.

00:35:16.292 --> 00:35:17.750
And you could back
that all the way

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:24.110
up to online problems
as they use in MITx.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:26.120
And then for assessment
and feedback,

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.140
the idea that you can either use
clicker questions, which would

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.670
be for the formative feedback.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:36.530
Or you can use it as some
sort of an online quiz,

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:39.860
or some other way of giving
feedback to the students.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.922
So that gets to the summative
and the formative idea.

00:35:43.922 --> 00:35:46.130
And then the idea of just
using a learning management

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:52.090
system, just to
administrate the course.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:52.845
That's one slice.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.990
There's another couple
other very interesting ways

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.890
to slice this up.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.590
And I have a handout here,
because these are woefully

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:08.240
tiny, these schematics.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.150
So if you just take
one and pass it along.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:13.220
One is called the
SECTIONS framework.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.700
And the other is called
the backward Ed Tech Tool

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.952
Flowchart.

00:36:18.952 --> 00:36:19.910
So these are different.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:20.930
These are not mine.

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:28.544
And these are different ways
of thinking about technology.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.270
So the first one is
this Ed Tech chart.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:36.830
And I know you can't
read that here.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.288
So that's why you
have the handout.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:48.090
And I like it, because it kind
of starts with the activity

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.670
that you want students to use.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.850
So it starts with this, what
do you want students to do?

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:57.980
And that's what the purple
box are, the student tasks.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:01.640
And then it kind of creates
these sort of guiding questions

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.670
that sort of reroute you.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.970
And then it gives you a
suggestion for a tech tool.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.190
So I'm going to give
you a few minutes

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:16.610
just to parse that, just to
engage with it a little bit.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:18.235
AUDIENCE: It's very beautiful.

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:19.360
PROFESSOR: I like this one.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.080
I like this one.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.390
I think it's very useful.

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:26.735
Any other comments
or thoughts about it?

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:30.436
Yeah, Gordon?

00:37:30.436 --> 00:37:31.894
AUDIENCE: I think
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:31.894 --> 00:37:33.550
PROFESSOR: OK, Gordon
doesn't get it.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:36.299
Somebody want to--
maybe nobody gets it.

00:37:36.299 --> 00:37:38.090
But do you want to
explain it a little bit?

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:39.350
Out loud, David, please.

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:41.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.027
PROFESSOR: But can you
explain to everybody?

00:37:44.027 --> 00:37:48.257
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:48.257 --> 00:37:49.090
PROFESSOR: Oh, sure.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:38:40.194
AUDIENCE: OK, [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:40.194 --> 00:38:41.860
PROFESSOR: It's
certainly not exclusive.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.370
I mean, it doesn't have
everything on here.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.920
But it kind of gives
you, I think, a way

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.170
of thinking about,
OK, I start with what

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.210
I want students to
do, which most of us

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:53.280
have a pretty good handle on.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.920
And then it helps you just think
backwards to the technology.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.830
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.090
AUDIENCE: Yes, I
just want to add

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.451
that it's only about what
you want to do, and how can

00:39:04.451 --> 00:39:04.950
you did it.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:05.575
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:39:05.575 --> 00:39:07.190
AUDIENCE: That's
what it's all about.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:26.970
And secondly, [INAUDIBLE]
but what you want them to do,

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:33.404
and how do you have them doing
it, that's what [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:34.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, Yeah.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.210
No, it is great.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:38.182
Other thoughts?

00:39:38.182 --> 00:39:40.640
And yeah, we'll get to get back
to the idea of the taxonomy

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.130
shortly.

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.944
Other thoughts?

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.650
Let's see, there's
a second one, which

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.622
is on the other side
of your handout.

00:39:55.622 --> 00:39:56.580
And so these are just--

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.663
I know you can't see this.

00:39:57.663 --> 00:39:59.370
That's why you have the handout.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.720
These are just ideas.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.640
Again, there's no rules really.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.460
But depending on what
you're trying to do,

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.050
it just may help
you start to think

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:10.750
about how to get the
right tool for the job.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:14.220
So it's called sections,
because each of those boxes with

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:18.425
the red outline,
S-E-C-T-I-O-N-S.

00:40:18.425 --> 00:40:19.800
The S is student
characteristics.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.200
The E is ease of use.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.690
C is cost, teaching
and learning,

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:28.170
interaction to promote active
learning, organization,

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.510
novelty, and speed.

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.711
And this chart, I think--

00:40:32.711 --> 00:40:34.960
I'm going to let you engage
with it for just a minute.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.070
But it brings up the idea
of the learning curve

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:42.840
for the instructor, which you
don't want to lose sight of,

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.240
that you want to factor
that into your choices

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.590
about what technologies to use.

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:49.550
So again, I'm going to
shut up for a minute or so,

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.550
so you can look at this.

00:41:02.334 --> 00:41:03.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:36.680
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.687
But what's the difference
between this one--

00:41:38.687 --> 00:41:40.520
I mean, there's many
differences, obviously.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:48.720
But what's kind of a
utility difference?

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.477
AUDIENCE: One's a flow chart
that points you to the answer.

00:41:51.477 --> 00:41:52.935
So it asks the yes
or no questions.

00:41:52.935 --> 00:41:55.080
The other just gives you the--

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.070
then you have to select from a--
it doesn't guide you directly.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:59.450
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.600
Exactly.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.180
It kind of helps
you think about it.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.630
Oh, my gosh, I have no money.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:08.000
So that's certainly
going to rule out

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.250
a whole set of options for you.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:18.791
But it doesn't say, oh, you have
no money, think about these.

00:42:18.791 --> 00:42:19.880
It's not a flowchart.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.460
It doesn't point you
to an end result.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.450
But if you went
through this exercise

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:28.430
and answered these
questions, I think

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.770
you'd be in a better place,
with respect to choosing

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:32.044
the particular technology.

00:42:32.044 --> 00:42:32.868
Gordon?

00:42:32.868 --> 00:42:35.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah, also I
think that second one is not

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:43.720
[INAUDIBLE] if you
want to use technology

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:49.960
and you have the
money, [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.207
the things you can think about.

00:42:52.207 --> 00:43:07.912
Because if you don't think
of everything [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:07.912 --> 00:43:08.620
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.330
It's some things to
just keep in your head

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:11.704
when you're making
these choices.

00:43:11.704 --> 00:43:14.450
It's not necessarily a
formalism for making a choice.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:26.580
So one other slice of all
this technology is kind

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.400
of a classic, I would
say classic, model,

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.369
which is called the
SAMR model, S-A-M-R.

00:43:33.369 --> 00:43:35.160
I know I'm throwing a
lot of models at you.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:40.230
But you have to kind of find
the slice that works for you.

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:43.980
The SAMR model, I think, is
very useful to keep in mind

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.310
when you're deciding
why you're gravitating

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.050
to a particular technology.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:56.040
And it's this idea of, is the
technology just a substitution?

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.110
So back in the day,
when everybody said,

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.630
oh, courses need web pages.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.262
You have to have
a course web page.

00:44:02.262 --> 00:44:03.720
Well, what was the
course web page?

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.990
It was an electronic version
of your syllabus, basically.

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:08.460
It had the name of the course.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.720
It had some picture.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.229
And then there was a link.

00:44:11.229 --> 00:44:13.770
And you could click on it, and
the students got the syllabus.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.880
They got a text version
of the syllabus,

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.500
a soft copy of the syllabus.

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.630
But then they printed it
out and brought to class.

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:24.960
So it was a one-to-one
substitution.

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.380
Instead of seeing the
syllabus in a piece of paper,

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.490
they see it online.

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:31.170
It was complete substitution.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.401
It didn't do anything
extra, except maybe

00:44:33.401 --> 00:44:34.900
made it a little
easier for students

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.310
not to lose the syllabus.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:40.230
But it didn't really have
any functional difference.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.680
Then the next level--
that's the S. The A

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.580
is that there's an augmentation.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:49.080
So there's a substitute,
but with a little bit

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.200
of an improvement.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:55.590
So maybe students could
hand the homework in online.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:57.180
They're still
handing homework in.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.263
They're still probably
writing their homework out,

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:00.960
scanning it, and handing it in.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.829
But it's a little easier.

00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:03.870
It's a little bit easier.

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:07.680
Maybe you don't lose their
homework, that kind of thing.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.640
So that's the augmentation.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.760
The next level will
be a modification, so

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.110
some sort of serious
redesign of a task

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:19.890
that you couldn't do
before that technology.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:23.730
And then the final would be
it just redefines the tasks

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:28.620
that you do, the tasks that
students do, in a way that's

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.280
completely different.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.090
So I'm going to ask you to think
about that for your own courses

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:36.260
in about two minutes.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:43.960
There's a little bit of a
schematic here that might help.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.210
These are sort a
little bit baby.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:50.740
But the idea of
substitution, so the idea

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.600
of using a word
processor instead

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:58.870
of a typewriter, that was a
substitutional technology.

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:01.594
So then augmentation,
you get spell check.

00:46:01.594 --> 00:46:03.010
Once you're in a
computer, you get

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:05.080
to have spell check,
and formatting,

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.520
and cutting and pasting.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.460
And that's different than what
you can do on a typewriter.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.970
And then so modification,
well, there was like an email,

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:17.400
or you could put graphs and
images right into the document.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:24.640
It changed sort of the way
we viewed a whole document.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.940
And then the idea
of having hypertext,

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.370
or some sort of a web
page that students

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:35.410
navigated in a nonlinear, or a
non-prescribed way, that would

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:37.605
the redefinition, let's say.

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:43.735
So that's some sort of
baby examples of that.

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.720
And then this next one,
which is pretty fun,

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.940
is there's this
woman, Kathy Schrock.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.420
And if you Google Kathy
Schrock, she comes up.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:58.080
She's got a ton of stuff.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.460
And this to get back to
Bloom's Taxonomy there,

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:03.200
is that she's taking Bloom's
Taxonomy, remember, understand,

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.350
apply, analyze, evaluate,
create, and then she said,

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:10.900
OK, well, here's some apps that
can facilitate those things,

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.630
facilitate the act
of remembering,

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:18.640
or facilitate the act of
evaluating, or creating.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.380
So it's not mutually exclusive.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:24.920
It's not exhaustive.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:28.480
But it is important to remember
that some of these tools

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.550
are supporting
remembering, or they're

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:33.280
supporting some other
level, understanding.

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.220
But they're not necessarily
at the highest level.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.890
Or they're not at
the lowest level.

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:39.140
It's good to be aware of that.

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:46.050
Before I charge you
with your assignment,

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:51.360
I did want to demo a
few other technologies,

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.886
just so you can
take a look at them.

00:47:52.886 --> 00:47:54.510
And there was that
list in the reading,

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:57.920
which I hope you checked out.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:03.070
I invited you to this--

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:06.838
well, I thought I invited
you to-- oh, wait a minute.

00:48:06.838 --> 00:48:09.250
Huh.

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.470
Hang on.

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:13.200
Well, let's just
start up a new one.

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:24.410
So I can create
this picture here.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.010
And I can share
this, then, with you.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.590
And I can invite the board.

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:39.987
And so this is the link.

00:48:39.987 --> 00:48:42.070
And if you have a device
and want to log in there,

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:45.370
you can check it out.

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:49.050
And then you can write on it.

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:50.170
Oh, somebody wrote on it.

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:51.385
Somebody erased my picture.

00:48:54.547 --> 00:48:55.630
I don't know who that was.

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:58.235
Oh.

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:01.520
AUDIENCE: Is that a [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:11.460
PROFESSOR: U-Q-P-L.

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.459
AUDIENCE: So that's
different from the link that

00:49:13.459 --> 00:49:15.130
was in the wiki.

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:15.880
PROFESSOR: I know.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.580
I just created a new one,
because I didn't want

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.040
to go look for the wiki link.

00:49:22.812 --> 00:49:24.200
AUDIENCE: But this is free?

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.300
PROFESSOR: This is free, yeah.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.529
So we're working a
little backwards here.

00:49:28.529 --> 00:49:29.570
I'm showing you the tool.

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:31.111
And now I'm asking
you what you might

00:49:31.111 --> 00:49:33.890
want to do with it, which is
not necessarily best practice.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:38.414
But I have a use that I--

00:49:38.414 --> 00:49:40.190
you can change the color.

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:42.800
This pen here changes the color.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.120
No, something changes the color.

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.620
Maybe not.

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:58.470
Oh, somebody got blue.

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:01.650
When I taught thermodynamics,
we would often do sketches.

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:06.005
I'd say, OK, sketch the Gibbs
free energy versus temperature,

00:50:06.005 --> 00:50:08.100
or Gibbs free energy
versus pressure.

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:15.660
Tell me what the first
derivative of g, with respect

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.580
to t, is, things like that.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:21.300
Sketch the slope, sketch
the curvature, et cetera.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.700
And so this kind
of application is

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.400
you could have students log
in, do that kind of a sketch.

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.220
And then people can evaluate it.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.350
It's anonymous, you can see.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:33.520
I can't tell who said
what it, except David,

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.820
who wrote his name.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:40.020
But I can't see who did
what, so that it could work

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.150
pretty well in a small class.

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:46.920
If you had a class of 400
people, I'd be afraid.

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.170
I'd be very afraid.

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:51.030
But in a small class,
you can come up

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:54.229
with some interesting
uses of it.

00:50:54.229 --> 00:50:56.520
The good thing about it is
that you don't have students

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.560
coming up to the board.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.260
It minimizes that motion,
the sort of getting everybody

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.720
unsettled and settled again.

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.860
It's not a cure.

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:08.100
I wouldn't say this
redefines anything.

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.600
In terms of the
SAMR model, I'd say

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:13.349
it's probably a modification,
maybe an augmentation, maybe.

00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.890
I don't know.

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:20.090
But it's certainly not and R.
So I wanted to just demo that,

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:22.710
because it's kind of fun.

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:24.440
The other thing I
wanted to do is,

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.150
I think you guys saw this list?

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:27.905
Did you see this list
from the readings?

00:51:30.597 --> 00:51:32.430
This is just some things
that I've compiled.

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:33.870
It's kind of a mishmash.

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:36.780
But there's some
interesting things on here

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:42.180
that you might want to explore,
depending on your learning

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.470
outcomes.

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:45.960
And we've used Backchannel.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:49.920
Today's meet is pretty
similar to Backchannel.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.350
Backchannel chat is pretty
similar Backchannel.

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:54.420
So those are some things
that are pretty similar.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.360
We just looked at the web app.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.900
We've used Plickers.

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:02.490
We've talked about
Socrative, which is just

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:06.090
a cell phone-based clicker.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:08.830
But there's a lot
of interesting uses.

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:13.380
And you might want to just
play around with them.

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.220
And I'll augment this list.

00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.970
So if you click it
again from the wiki,

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.520
you'll get a augmented list
of things, a few things

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.280
I want to add to it.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:29.810
So now, given your
experience in life,

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:32.750
and the readings, et
cetera, is that I'd

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:36.969
like for you to think
about a technology

00:52:36.969 --> 00:52:38.510
that you haven't
used for-- actually,

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:41.630
what you want to first is
think about a learning outcome.

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:45.200
But you want to think
about a learning outcome.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:48.440
You want to think about
a technology that might

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.810
advance that learning outcome.

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:55.670
And then just jot down why
you chose this technology,

00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:59.890
where does it fit
in the SAMR model,

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:01.780
how you would use
it in your class,

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:03.280
any kind of difficulties.

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.870
And then there's a Google doc.

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:07.900
I'm pretty sure
everybody can access it.

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.180
We can only hope.

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:13.800
And if you can type your
responses into that.

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.180
So we can give you about
five, seven minutes

00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:17.350
for that activity.

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:19.750
And then we're going to do a
lightning round based on it.

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:21.940
So use whatever.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.500
Use the handouts.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.587
Use your knowledge,
use, et cetera.

00:53:26.587 --> 00:53:28.420
And then somebody can
tell me really quickly

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.590
if they can get
into the Google doc.

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:33.132
Yeah, you guys are good.

00:53:33.132 --> 00:53:34.840
I was going to say,
write your name down.

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:39.340
But it doesn't really matter
whether your name is up or not.

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:42.850
So I want to make sure that you
take a look at everybody else's

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:44.230
some of the learning outcomes.

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:46.480
We're going to do this
lightning round where you're

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.938
going to be talking
to other people

00:53:47.938 --> 00:53:50.980
about the technology they
chose, their learning outcome,

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.450
they chose it, et cetera.

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:56.620
And you're going to be trying to
help your partner troubleshoot,

00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:00.250
or perhaps, implement the
technology in a better way,

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:02.800
solve some of their problems
with the implementation

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.380
process, or perhaps, think
about a different technology

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:08.320
altogether given their
desired learning outcomes.

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:11.320
So let's just take a
minute, and either read it

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:13.180
on your own device
or read it up here,

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:16.362
so that you kind of get
a sense for what you're

00:54:16.362 --> 00:54:17.445
going to be talking about.

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:26.290
And if you haven't read
over it, please do that now.

00:54:37.539 --> 00:54:39.580
So there's some really
interesting ideas up here,

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:50.230
I think, and a broad
spectrum of ambition.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:52.100
We had some pretty small--

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:55.720
like one assignment's worth
of technology, perhaps.

00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:00.610
And then we also have kind
of a whole course design.

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:03.220
So that's another thing we
didn't really talk about.

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:05.860
I didn't narrow the
scope in any way,

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:07.490
or define the scope in any way.

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:08.980
So it could be
for a whole class.

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:11.950
Or it could be for one
particular assignment, or one

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:14.050
particular class activity.

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:14.740
And that's fine.

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:15.372
That's OK.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.324
So did everybody get a chance
to look over the other posts?

00:55:22.324 --> 00:55:28.420
AUDIENCE: I'll say, I've
have had [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.245
AUDIENCE: So it gives a follow
up of all of these things

00:55:31.245 --> 00:55:38.440
is that when the AWW where
everyone was drawing,

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:39.250
I could draw here.

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:40.670
But it was never
showing up there.

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:41.440
PROFESSOR: Interesting.

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.690
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah, my thing
I drew never showed up.

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:45.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah And
then the other thing

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:51.794
with this now, with the Google
doc, I tried to edit it.

00:55:51.794 --> 00:55:53.210
And it doesn't let
me click on it.

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:54.710
It says, do you
want to use the app?

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:56.530
So then I had to
download the app.

00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:59.750
And now I say, yes, use the app.

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:02.410
And then it says
something about the server

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:03.820
not being recognized.

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:05.860
But then if I go back
and say, no, thanks,

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:10.066
and I try to use
it without the app,

00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:11.442
then I can't put anything in.

00:56:11.442 --> 00:56:12.400
PROFESSOR: Interesting.

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.900
OK, so who had trouble?

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:17.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I downloaded
the app and used it instead.

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.410
PROFESSOR: All
right, did anybody

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:23.922
that was using a smartphone
not have trouble?

00:56:23.922 --> 00:56:25.530
AUDIENCE: I didn't have trouble.

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:26.700
PROFESSOR: You
didn't have trouble?

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.283
AUDIENCE: No, I
downloaded and use it.

00:56:28.283 --> 00:56:29.310
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:33.420
And were you an
Android, or Android?

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:34.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:39.145
PROFESSOR: Android,
iPhone, iPhone.

00:56:39.145 --> 00:56:40.020
Who else had trouble?

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:46.430
It was more than just the
two of you with this one?

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:47.734
AUDIENCE: With this one.

00:56:47.734 --> 00:56:49.234
PROFESSOR: With
this particular one?

00:56:49.234 --> 00:56:51.317
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [? Rachel ?]
had problems with it.

00:56:51.317 --> 00:56:55.720
PROFESSOR: So for now, if
you wouldn't mind, just--

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.130
let's see.

00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:59.900
We don't have to
complete this right now.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:02.630
But maybe if there's a lull,
just come on over here.

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:04.740
And you can type
your app in, just

00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:06.650
so we have a complete record--

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:08.310
your technology in.

00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:11.060
But that's interesting.

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.680
It's a good thing
to keep in mind

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:14.630
that access might be an issue.

00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:16.280
I did try this out
on two computers.

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.780
But I tried it out
on two computers.

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.120
And I didn't try phone.

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:23.004
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Couldn't do.

00:57:23.004 --> 00:57:23.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah, after is fine.

00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:28.720
So if we could get up.

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:32.230
And anybody else that
wasn't able to input

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:36.170
their ideas, if you will
do it later, that's fine.

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:38.140
So we're going to do
the lightning round.

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:42.520
And if I could get you gentlemen
to come around and fill

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:43.490
in the back.

00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:46.332
Just fill in up to here.

00:57:46.332 --> 00:57:47.790
Great, so what
we're going to do is

00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:50.670
I'm going to ask the row
in the back, this row,

00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:55.620
to share their technology,
their intended learning

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:58.050
outcome, their concern.

00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:01.710
And then this row will
give their advice.

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:04.320
And it's two minutes
for the whole process.

00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:06.000
And then we'll switch.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:06.500
OK?

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:07.770
AUDIENCE: So what do I do?

00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:11.490
PROFESSOR: So you just have
to tell me more or less what

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:13.434
you wrote on the screen.

00:58:13.434 --> 00:58:14.100
OK, but hold on.

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.058
I got to set the timer.

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:19.410
OK, go.

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:20.880
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:58:33.283 --> 00:58:36.790
PROFESSOR: Is going
to share their ideas

00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:39.640
with the other side.

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.770
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:09.840
PROFESSOR: It's moment
you've been waiting for.

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.390
So we're going to do this two
more times, this time and one

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:14.190
more time, OK?

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:14.870
All right.

00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:16.550
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:59:20.464 --> 00:59:21.130
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:59:21.130 --> 00:59:23.040
AUDIENCE: For the
course which I want

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.680
to teach using
educational technology,

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.130
so it was a big challenge,
because the head of department

00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:30.930
wanted to say no.

00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:33.430
But then it continued
because many of the professor

00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:34.780
already preferred it.

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.490
PROFESSOR: Wow, so
does [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:38.721
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:59:38.721 --> 00:59:40.486
AUDIENCE: Anybody
can do anything.

00:59:40.486 --> 00:59:45.010
And you can reconfigure it.

00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:47.730
PROFESSOR: Alex,
if you come around.

00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:52.140
And then, [INAUDIBLE], if
you come around, please.

00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:54.492
Everybody slide down.

00:59:54.492 --> 00:59:55.950
AUDIENCE: We already
went that way.

00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:56.780
PROFESSOR: Oh,
you went that way.

00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:58.824
AUDIENCE: We already
saw those people.

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:05.565
PROFESSOR: So, [INAUDIBLE],
if you come on over.

01:00:05.565 --> 01:00:07.680
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.720
PROFESSOR: So I know
in my conversations,

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:44.550
I heard some really interesting
ideas, some fascinating uses,

01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:47.310
and some incredible obstacles.

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:50.290
I'll just point out David's
obstacle is on the spreadsheet.

01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:52.040
But he wants to use
his piece of software.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:57.240
And it costs $12,000 a year.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.890
So it sounds fabulous.

01:00:58.890 --> 01:01:00.870
It sounds really fabulous.

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:03.270
And your department
actually bought it for you?

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:05.850
Have it for all
faculty [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:07.710
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so that's great.

01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:10.240
But that's a huge hurdle.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.050
So that's an example
of trade-offs

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:15.720
that you might not
always be able to make.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.510
So that was my interesting--

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.500
but I did hear some
other wonderful ones too.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.280
So I hope that you
take a look at it.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:28.740
You'll note that I always give
you time after this lightning

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.430
round.

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:34.830
Because it's a very noisy
kind of little crazy exercise.

01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:37.410
And I always like to give
you a few minutes of silence

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:40.616
afterwards to sort of
process it a little bit.

01:01:40.616 --> 01:01:42.240
Because it can be a
bit of an overload.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.970
So that's sort of the
part of the design

01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:47.460
or the planning
for this exercise.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.670
Anything anybody want to share
about something they learned,

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:53.860
or some issue or problem that
was solved, or still unsolved?

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:03.560
All right, I see some
people are still typing.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.960
I'm going to go on.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.060
Feel free to keep
adding to this.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.630
And again, please
take a look at it.

01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:15.000
Because we only got
so many pairings.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.580
And you can see virtually
everything from the Google doc,

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.820
assuming everybody gets in.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.830
So what I wanted to do is
flash back a little bit

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:36.420
to what we talked about the
second class that we met.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.670
We talked about all these
different learning theories,

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:42.130
about behaviorism,
cognitivism, constructivism.

01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:44.709
I think we've done some other
exercise with these three

01:02:44.709 --> 01:02:45.750
learning theories before.

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:48.510
But it's a good chance
for you to reflect back,

01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:52.140
to do a little
backward transfer,

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.810
and to reinforce
some of the concepts

01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:55.320
from the beginning
of the semester,

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.072
and to also think about
how technologies might be--

01:02:59.072 --> 01:03:00.780
so we talked about
how technologies might

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.790
fit at different levels
of Bloom's, or supports

01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:05.400
different levels of
Bloom's, but also,

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.000
different technologies--
different anything

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
you do in the classroom.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.490
But use of different
technologies

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:14.530
can actually be more
behaviorist, cognitivist,

01:03:14.530 --> 01:03:17.040
or constructivist in nature.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.850
So I think it's useful for
you to think about that

01:03:20.850 --> 01:03:22.950
just as a way of just
getting a bit of a marker.

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:24.780
About again, it's
this idea about,

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:29.624
what are we trying
to do with this tool?

01:03:29.624 --> 01:03:31.040
And so I'm going
to divide you up.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.720
And we have nine people left,
so three groups of three,

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.840
which works
absolutely perfectly.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.010
Yes, three groups of three.

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:39.960
And we're going to have
the behaviorist group,

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:44.340
the cognitivist group, and
the constructivist group.

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:48.690
What I want you to do is think
about a particular technology

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:53.310
that sort of would be
consistent with this--

01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:56.940
ooh, OK, one group
will have four--

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:59.760
a particular technology
that's consistent

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.600
with that particular
learning theory.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:07.590
And so this will take
about maybe four minutes.

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:09.090
And think about,
perhaps, even think

01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:11.370
about a learning outcome
that that tool advances,

01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:15.075
but at that level, so the
behaviorist level, let's say.

01:04:15.075 --> 01:04:16.950
And then what I'm going
to do is the activity

01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:19.880
is called a jigsaw.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.950
And so first, you're going to
be in these homogeneous groups.

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:26.130
So one group talks
about constructivism.

01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:27.660
One group talks
about behaviorism.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.980
And one group talks
about cognitivism.

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:31.920
And then I'm going
to mix you up.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.840
So each group then
has one cognitivist,

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.990
one constructivist, and
one behaviorist in it.

01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:39.510
So this is an active
learning technique.

01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:41.782
And I wanted to
model it for you.

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:48.394
So let's just
create some groups.

01:04:48.394 --> 01:04:51.280
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:13.900
PROFESSOR: All right, folks.

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.510
I don't know how
far you got here.

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:18.580
But now each one of you
is going to be expert

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:25.270
in your particular field.

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:37.060
So I'm going to take-- and
this is the constructivists.

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.490
So here's three constructivists.

01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:42.430
I'd like one cognitivist
and one behaviorist

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:46.180
to find a constructivist,
and to make a new group.

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.400
All right, so now
each one of you

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.280
is the content expert for
your particular theory.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.840
And just sort of explain what
you came up with to your peers.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.058
So you'll just go around
the table and talk about it.

01:06:01.428 --> 01:06:02.675
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:06:02.675 --> 01:06:04.050
AUDIENCE: They're
still learning.

01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:05.620
But they're having
an active roll

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:08.040
in participating in when
they're going to learn about,

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.090
rather than just being
passively taught that.

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:12.090
AUDIENCE: And that's?

01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:13.140
AUDIENCE: Constructivist

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:16.666
AUDIENCE: OK, so what
technology [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:16.666 --> 01:06:20.940
AUDIENCE: Well, I think
that a cool way to do it

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:24.710
is to have computers set
up throughout the room

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:26.790
to have internet access.

01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:28.770
PROFESSOR: So the class
is officially over.

01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:29.880
I mean, it's five of.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:34.680
I don't know if people have
to go other places or not.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.650
So we can take this
up beginning of class

01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:39.750
next time if there's things
you want to finish up.

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:44.340
I'd like to hear some of what
you came up with for sure.

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:48.760
So can we just plan to do that,
and just tie up the exercise?

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:52.920
Not the best of the best
pedagogical strategy,

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:59.110
to make you wait a week,
but it is what it is, so.

01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:00.450
OK, thanks very much.

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:04.990
And I look forward to seeing
your posts on the assignment.
