00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.120
NARRATOR: The hominin or
hominid, branch of the
evolutionary tree

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.670
includes modern
humans, as well as

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.670
the extinct human predecessors,
such as Neanderthal, Homo

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.500
habilis, Homo erectus, and
other early intelligent standing

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.580
primates that have
long since vanished.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.670
And despite many years
of thinking otherwise,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.710
scientists are now discovering
that many of these species

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.500
coexisted.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.920
What we're seeing,
really, is something

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.710
like out of "The
Lord of the Rings,"

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.500
where we have all kinds of
different humanoids who are

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.170
tall and short, who have
different color skins,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.920
different types of hair.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.750
Even their brains are
slightly different.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.080
Some are more animals or apes.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.170
Others are more refined.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.580
NARRATOR: Some
researchers suggest

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.920
that these recent discoveries
may require a retooling

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.710
of Darwin's theory
of evolution, which

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.040
was first proposed in 1859.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.080
In his work on the
origin of species,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.960
Darwin laid out the foundation
for evolutionary theory

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.920
by proposing that gradual
multigenerational changes

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.420
occurring due to
natural selection

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.460
would result in the modification
of existing species.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.580
If the theory of
evolution is correct,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.210
we should see a steady,
slow progression.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.790
We're actually not seeing that.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.290
We're seeing the
sudden surfacing

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.080
of early humans, who are
actually very highly evolved.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.330
The scientific
community explains

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.790
everything away by nothing
else but natural selection

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.120
and coincidence.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.420
And the intelligent
design camp suggests

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.500
everything was done by God.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.170
What if this external
force did, in fact, exist,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.000
but it may have been
an extraterrestrial?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.830
NARRATOR: Could it be that the
evolution of humans, and even

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.080
pre-human hominin, might not be
entirely what Darwin proposed?

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.120
Might there be an even
more profound explanation

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.880
for the different species
of intelligent hominid

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.620
that once existed on Earth?

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.380
Perhaps clues can be found
by exploring the details

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.000
contained within some of
humanity's earliest stories

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.790
of our creation.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.500
We have this notion that the
people that were the earliest

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.380
examples of a civilization
were not the first attempts,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.710
that there were failures
that came before.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.170
And finally, they would come
up with something better,

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.380
and that would be the prototype
that became the people.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.710
Sumerian texts speak
of deformed humans

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.250
created by Enki and the
mother goddess Ninhursag.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.000
In the course of their efforts
to fashion a perfect person,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.250
in all, six proto-humans
were made before they

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.250
came up with what they wanted.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.380
In the Mayan text, the "Popol
Vuh," the book of the people,

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.830
it is said that there were
three attempts to make people.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.580
NARRATOR: Could the stories of
gods creating multiple versions

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.710
of man, which can be
found in the Mayan "Popol

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.920
Vuh," the ancient Sumerian
texts, and other writings,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.920
be accounts of what
actually happened

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.540
on Earth in the distant past?

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.250
And if so, just who
were these gods?

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.580
There's a very good chance
that early humans were possibly

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.620
genetically manipulated by
advanced extraterrestrials

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.620
trying to formulate and create
the ultimate human species.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.210
What if, at the heart of it,
is the concept that the planet

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.710
itself has been an experimental
lab, an experimental garden,

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.290
and that all of these different
models getting to Homo sapien--

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.790
that there had been
all kinds of models,

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.790
all for different reasons,
all part of tests,

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.330
all done by DNA
manipulation by non-humans

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.670
in the extraterrestrial
category?

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.830
NARRATOR: Could the widespread
mythologies about the creation

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.460
of various human
prototypes be real accounts

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.170
of an extraterrestrial
experiment, an experiment

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.170
that continues to this day?
