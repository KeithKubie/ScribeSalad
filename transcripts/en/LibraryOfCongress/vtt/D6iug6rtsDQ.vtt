00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.150
&gt;&gt; We're at the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.376
&gt;&gt; Alright, good morning.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.843
And on behalf of the
Library of Congress welcome

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.043
to the 2010 National Book Festival.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.976
We hope you have a wonderful day
celebrating books and reading

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.170
and the joy of reading right
here on the National Mall.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.590
Before we begin I want to inform you

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.046
that the pavilion's
presentations today are being filmed

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.466
for the Library of
Congress's website.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.353
So please be mindful of this.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.193
If you have any problems you don't
have to stay but we hope you do

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.366
because this is going to be
a wonderful presentation.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.526
And please do not sit on the
camera risers that are located

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.326
in the back of the pavilion.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.793
Thank you very much.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.126
Well once again it's
nice to see you all.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.793
My name is Eun Yang.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.060
And if you are up early
getting ready for work

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.260
or getting your kids
ready for school

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.200
or just having insomnia I
deliver the news in the morning,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.960
if you turn on NBC 4;
so, good morning to you.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.053
And I love books.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.693
And I was an avid reader until I
had kids and now it's a fond memory.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.453
I still try to read once in awhile.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.043
My youngest is with me
and I apologize for that.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.063
But the boys are in soccer

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.030
and you know you gotta
do the tag-team action.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.290
[Background sound effects] But
thank you for your understanding.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.623
Since this is the teens

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.326
and children's pavilion I figured
you parents would understand my

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.120
work life.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.453
Thank you very much.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.546
And I love this day because this is
the day when authors are rock stars

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.480
and they should be treated as such,
because they fill our imaginations

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.106
and take us away from our
current life and help us

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.950
to explore our imaginations and
other worlds in so many great ways.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.536
Well our first author this
morning serves up exciting

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.070
and suspenseful thrillers that
take readers behind the scenes

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.110
of American politics.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.603
Brad Meltzer wrote the number one
New York Times bestselling book,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.490
The Book of Fate as well as the
bestsellers the 10th Justice,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.010
Dead End, The First Council
and the Book of Lies.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.846
He is the author of the
critically acclaimed comic book,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.893
Justice League of America, woo hoo.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.160
It won the Eisner award.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.050
And he also the co-creator of
the TV show, Jack and Bobby,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.603
obviously very impressive.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.403
"So why is here today at the teens
and children's pavilion", you ask?

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.566
Well you can thank
his 8 year old son.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.946
When his son was born Brad
wanted to write him a book

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.000
that would last a lifetime.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.296
But as he started writing he
realized he didn't know enough

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.140
about fatherhood to teach his son
the life lessons he wanted to share.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.773
So he went on a mission to write

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.040
about real-life heroes who've shown
strength, courage, perseverance

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.453
and kindness and the belief
that anything is possible.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.083
And then tell their stories in
hopes they will guide his son

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.950
to become a good man and
perhaps change the world himself.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.100
That labor of love resulted in
Brad's first non-fiction book.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.453
A handpicked collection of
the best stories of heroism

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.136
from the Wright Brothers, Nelson
Mandela, Jim Henson, Harper Lee,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.336
Rosa Parks and many, many more.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.173
Heroes for My Son is a gift to
his child and to his readers;

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.706
ladies and gentleman Brad Meltzer.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.940
[Applause]

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.310
&gt;&gt; My name is Suzanne Collins.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.750


00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.493
[Laughter] Come on,
when you come to speak

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.263
and everyone is the front row is
holding her book instead of mine,

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.856
like I'm not gonna make that joke.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.466
[Laughter] So, here's
the story right.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.096
I didn't know anything
about being a parent.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.763
I thought I did, right.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.563
Every parent in this audience knows

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.363
when that kid comes you think
you know what you're going to do,

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.030
but you don't know what
you're going to do.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.686
I learned however from the
greatest parents of all time.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.440
Because when my mother -- when
I went to Borders Headquarters

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.046
in Anne Arbor, Michigan they said,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.446
"Guess where you're books
sell more than anywhere else?"

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.513
And I said, "Well obviously
New York City.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.390
8 million New Yorker's
in one place you know."

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.370
They said, "Nope."

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.036
I said, "Washington, D.C. I
always right about Washington."

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.503
"No." The number one place where
by books sold was the Boca Raton,

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.983
Florida Borders, one mile
from a furniture store

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.063
where my mother used to work.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.856
[Laughter] That means my mother
single-handedly beat 8 million

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.510
New Yorkers.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.643
[Laughter] That's my mom's side.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.376
My dad, this is true, my dad

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.766
in December had heart
surgery, open heart surgery.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530
Major surgery for him
and when you go

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.300
from open heart surgery the
difference is you've got

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.786
to go interview the doctors.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.753
And you go and interview the doctors
and you don't just go, "Hey."

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.556
You know you gotta make sure you
like the guy, you know what kind

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.150
of person, you what kind

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.150
of procedure they're
going to do to you.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.750
So he's go to see the
first doctor and he says --

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.416
you know he's really finely
dressed and his manicured hands

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.883
and he just looks all put together.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.923
And he says, "I don't do the
full cut open your chest.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.710
I do a small incision up here.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.590
It's going to be completely
harmless.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.456
I'm going to go in.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.923
I'm not even going to
crack your rib cage.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.523
You're going to be done in no time.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.390
You're going to be out of
the hospital in a day."

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.990
We know he's lying to us, but
he's really put it together.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.590
And he's like, "It's
a new procedure.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.790
No one can do except me.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.190
It's fantastic.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.856
You're going to love it."

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.856
We go see another doctor.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.056
And he says, "I do it
the old fashioned way.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.790
I crack your chest open.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.856
I have to pull you apart.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.523
It's going to be a brutal recovery.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.190
You could die."

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.456
Okay. And he says as he's saying
this, he looks down at the chart

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.990
and goes, "Oh wait,
Meltzer, Brad Meltzer."

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.790
I'm in there with him and he
goes, "I read your books."

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.323
I said, "Thanks."

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.190
And he goes on and he
says, "It's really going

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.390
to be a ruthless ordeal for you."

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.990
And so we leave and I look at
my dad and it's pretty clear

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.523
which doctor we need to pick right?

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.590
The first doctor is
all put together.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.256
He's never lost anyone
on the table he told us.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.923
And my dad says, "Well,
we found our man."

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.790
And I said, "Which one?"

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.190
And he says, "The second guy."

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.056
And I said, "Dad what
are you talking about?

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.923
It's going to be harder
and you could die.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.056
And they crack your rib cage

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.856
and you're never gonna
get out of there."

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.990
And he says, "Yeah,
but he buys the books."

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.390
[Laughter] And I said, "You know,

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.856
found out if it's hardback
or paperback."

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.523
[Laughter] But the truth
was my dad actually did go

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.656
with the first doctor.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.590
That is a true story.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.456
I can't make it up.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.790
So with those parents, I
embarked on parenthood myself.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.656
And as you heard in the
introduction, eight years ago

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.123
at Sibley Hospital here in
Washington, D.C. my son was born.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.256
And I came home.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.523
I love telling this story here
because this is the hometown crowd.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.856
I lived here for so long.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.790
I had my kids here and I
thank you all for coming here.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.190
This is obviously a very
personal place to be.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.923
And I'm driving home from
Sibley, stuck at that red light

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.123
at the wonderful circle that
wraps around and you have to go

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.636
around twice because you
missed the turn hypothetically.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.410
And as I'm at that red light I
remember looking up at the sky

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.553
at night and saying, "What kind
of man do I want my son to be?"

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.386
And it's a big moment right?

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.530
It's that moment when everything
in the world is possible.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.563
That moment when you can dream
your child to be anything you want.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.806
I'm not talking about famous or
wealthy, but to be a nice person,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.513
to be kind, to be the
person who's nice

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.700
to everybody and everybody likes.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.016
And I came home that night and I
said, "I'm going to write a book

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.790
that lasts his whole life."

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.313
And the truth was I knew nothing
about fatherhood, nothing at all.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.466
And I started writing
rules for him to live by.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.533
And I said one, be nice
to the fat kid in class.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.810
And I started writing all these
rules you know one by one.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:28.323
You know one day I'd
give him this book

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:30.303
and he'd think I was
indeed the greatest father.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.550
And then a friend of mine
told me this amazing story

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.403
about the Wright Brothers.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:37.470
He said every time the
Wright Brothers went

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.423
out to fly their plane, they
would bring enough materials

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.050
for multiple crashes.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.140
That means every time they went out
they knew they were going to fail.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.786
And they will crash and
rebuild and crash and rebuild

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.073
and that's why they took off.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.173
And I said, "I love that story."

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.440
I want my son to hear that story.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.706
I want my daughter
to hear that story.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.506
I want them to know that
if they have perseverance

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.973
and if they work hard
and they have a plan

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.986
and they have a good side
order of stubbornness

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:05.850
that they can do anything
in this world.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:08.870
And I said, "That's the
book I want to write."

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.603
Not a book of rules,
but a book of heroes.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.780
And I said I just don't want
to write an obvious story.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.903
We all know the obvious
story about everyone.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.810
What I want to find was not just
stories about famous people,

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.596
but I wanted to find
moments we didn't know.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.010
So, Thomas Jefferson is in the book,

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:26.973
but not because he wrote the
declaration of independence,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.743
he's in the book because
he never took credit

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.286
for writing the declaration
while he was alive.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.266
He never stood up and said, "Hey you
know that declaration you all know

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.706
and love, that was
me I wrote it, TJ."

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.106
I totally made that part up.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.040
By the way I write fiction.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.973
He didn't call himself TJ.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.440
That's not historically accurate.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.506
[Laughter] But I will tell you
that I love that story also right.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.426
I love that story because I want my
son to learn that kind of humility.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.486
Imagine a politician today
having that kind of humility.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.990
A politician today would tattoo
the words, "I wrote the declaration

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.753
of independence" on their forehead.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.456
Right, that's what they would do
if they did something like that.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.023
And I said those are the
stories I need to find.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:05.386
Not stories of just famous people,

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.513
but stories of what we're all
capable of on our very best days.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.206
And so there are stories in
there of people you don't know.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.006
There's a guy named Frank
Shankwitz [Assumed spelling] who's a

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.220
police officer.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:20.900
And Frank Shankwitz found
out about a boy with leukemia

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:23.386
who also wanted to
be a police office.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:25.923
So Shankwitz had a police
uniform made for the boy.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.730
He had a little motorcycle
riding course made for the boy.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.596
And then the boy went into a coma.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:34.383
So Office Shankwitz goes to the
boy's hospital room and he pins

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:37.940
on little motorcycle wings on the
boy, at which point the boy wakes

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.120
up out of his coma and smiles.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.110
And then he falls back
into the coma.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.170
The boy eventually dies
and on the way home

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:50.250
from the funeral Officer Frank
Shankwitz, this police officer looks

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:54.930
at his buddy on the plane
and says, "You know,

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:56.596
we made that kid really
happy for just one day.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:09:59.876
We should do that for other kids."

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.726
And that's how the Make A
Wish Foundation is born.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.183
I didn't know that story
and I love that story too.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.870
I want my son to hear that story.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:10.136
I want my daughter
to hear that story.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.003
And these are the things
that we're all capable of.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.743
It's just the idea of what
you can do with one idea

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:16.196
when you share with somebody else.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:18.196
So the book is set up very simply.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.330
It's a one-page story

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.063
on the right-hand page,
one picture on the left.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.473
And it has Jim Henson, Mr. Rogers,
Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King,

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.253
Jr. Now I will tell you, one of
my favorite moments was when I got

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.156
to share and I couldn't tell this
at the beginning of the book tour,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.483
but I can tell it now because I got

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.550
to share the book with
my son, right.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.416
This is the moment.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.490
It's called Heroes for My Son
and I'm giving it to my son.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.076
This is the moment when the
clouds are going to part.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:44.770
The rainbows are going to
come from every direction.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.116
I've waited nearly a decade
for this exact moment.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.276
And so I go into his bedroom and I
wait until my other kids are asleep.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.566
And we get on the bed and he
doesn't care about Rosa Parks.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:58.960
He doesn't care about
Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:00.960
He wants to know where
the athletes are.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.426
He likes sports.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.160
So he flips through
the book really quickly

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.093
and he finds a guy
named Roberto Clemente.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:08.540
And Roberto Clemente is
a guy who used to play --

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.750
one of the famous baseball players
for the Pittsburg Pirates, okay.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.476
And I always tell my son
all the time I'm like,

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.953
"Just because you're a famous
athlete doesn't mean anything.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.600
It doesn't make you a hero.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.200
It just means you're good at sports.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.816
Being a novelist on the bestseller
list doesn't mean anything.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.650
It doesn't make you anyone.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.716
It just means you can write.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:31.583
And it just means your family
buys a lot of copies right?

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.250
Trust me on this one.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.583
Trust me. So I'm reading
Roberto Clemente.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.833
He's in the book not because
he was a great baseball player,

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.306
not because of the Gold
glove awards he won.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.676
He's in it because he found out
about an earthquake in Nicaragua.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.616
And Roberto Clemente wanted to get

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.283
so involved he sent
three plane loads of food

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.083
and medicine to Nicaragua.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.616
All three plane loads were stolen.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.136
They were confiscated.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.270
And so he was so determined
to make sure

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.066
that the fourth plane gets
there he says, "I'm going to get

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.340
on the plane myself and
make sure it gets there."

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.380
And he gets on the plane
and the plane crashes

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:06.763
in the ocean killing everyone on
board including Roberto Clemente.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:11.180
And then it says in the book
he's not a hero because he died.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.050
He's a hero because of
why he got on board.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.470
And so as I'm sharing this
I'm waiting for my son

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.240
to tell me how inspired
he is, what a genius I am

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.013
to produce this book for him.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:24.866
And he looks at me and I feel
him shrinking him in my arms.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.026
I can tell something's
wrong and he looks up at me

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.826
and he says, "Dad this is sad."

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.526
And now I'm terrified that
I've ruined everything right.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.030
I blew it.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.696
The book is not working
the way I wanted.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.296
This is a disaster.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.763
It's backfired in my face.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.830
And so the next night
I put the book aside.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.830
I put it on the side table.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.763
I don't even bring it out.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.296
And he races into the room and he
jumps up on the bed and he says

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.963
to me, "So who are we
going to read tonight?"

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.096
And I said, "Well what
about Roberto Clemente."

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.763
And he says, "I like him."

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.230
And I said, "Why?"

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.763
And he eventually said, "Because he
gave his life to save those people."

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.696
And I think we all know, for
those of us who are parents

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.890
that sometimes the greatest
moments in parenting are the moments

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.836
that are complete and
utter accidents.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.786
And that's how it was
for me in that moment.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.653
Everything worked out
exactly how I wanted

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.120
but in a way I never anticipated.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.830
And it was this great beautiful
reward and the idea that that story

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:24.076
of generosity and perseverance
and kindness to strangers

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.300
and charity is twisted into my
son's chest is the greatest thing

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.696
in the whole world.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.563
That's better than being
on any bestseller list,

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.830
except the hardcover
bestseller list.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.120
[Laughter] And so I want to tell you

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:39.323
about the most important
hero in the book.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:42.216
And the most important hero
in the book is my mother.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:45.570
All due respect to George
Washington and Thomas Jefferson,

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.503
my mom is in the last
page of the book.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:51.293
And I'll tell you my mom died
two years ago from breast cancer.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.733
And it was the reason that I
really decided to finish the book.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.720
I said, "You know what I'm
not saving the kind words

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.920
for the eulogy anymore."

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.853
I'm not going to wait my
whole life to give it to him.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.186
I started really thinking
I gotta finish it.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.186
And I couple years ago when I
was living here in Washington

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.600
and my second book came out, my
publisher actually shut down.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.826
It was sold and I didn't
know if anybody was going

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.186
to take over my contract.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.296
I was terrified because this was
the end of my writing career.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:18.273
And I called my mom and I
said to her how scared I was

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.210
and my mom said, and I'll
never forget it, she said,

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.616
"I'd love you if you
were a garbage man."

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.613
And she wasn't taking
a crack at garbage men.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.480
My uncle was a garbage man.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.813
She was just saying, "I
don't care what you are.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.680
I don't care what your job is.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.480
I love you no matter what."

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.000
And every day that I sit down to
write I say those words to myself.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.246
"I'd love you if you
were a garbage man",

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:41.340
just soaking in my
mom's love for me.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.676
That's what I do every
morning before I get up.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:46.133
Right before I sit down at my
writing table, that's my one ritual.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.006
And I will tell you that
that's why she's my hero.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:52.573
For you the most important hero
and heroes for my son is the

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:55.886
on the very last page, because
the very last page is blank.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.040
And it says, "Your heroes picture
here and your heroes story here."

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:02.456
And I promise you that if you take
a picture of your mom or your dad

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:07.833
or your kids or your grandparents
or a military member of your family

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.840
or a teacher in your life and you
put their picture in this book

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.160
and you write one sentence
about what they've done for you

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.170
that would be the most beautiful
written page in heroes for my son.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.796
It's a vital page and I
think that's what the book is

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.263
about is giving my son a
way to say, "Thank you.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.493
Thank you for being my hero."

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.093
Give everyone a chance.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.293
You know we are a country.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.960
I think we all recognize
we are starving for heroes.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.160
Look around it is tough
times out there.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.043
And it is tough to find a
hero and that's what's vital

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.410
to me is finding that hero.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:40.543
So this is my chance to
kind of bring it out.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.520
So what I'd love to do more
importantly is take questions.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:44.890
I always find that's
the best way rather

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:47.176
than have me lecture
for half an hour.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.710
So ask any questions you want.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:51.776
I write fiction.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.243
I'll make up an answer.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.710
It's fine.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.110
[Laughter] Yes ma'am.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.510
&gt;&gt; It's rather a statement.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.440
I am so inspired by you when you
mention Roberto Clemente [Sound

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:03.243
effects] because I
am from Puerto Rico.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.916
So thank you for make
Roberto a part of your book.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.660
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.793
The question is you're awesome
for mentioning Roberto Clemente.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.260
That is the best question
I've ever had.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.740
[Laughter] Any more questions
that say like I am the best?

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.780
I am the greatest.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.580
I am wonderful.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.180
I will take those first.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:24.713
Those are my favorite questions.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.646
Thank you ma'am.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.513
&gt;&gt; What was the most
inspiring story for you?

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.846
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the question was in doing
the research what was the most

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.646
inspiring story.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.113
There was one beside my mom
and my grandfather who are

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.446
in the book there was
one that blew me away.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.180
And it was Ann Sullivan.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.693
And I had -- Helen Keller was
actually picked out for the book.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.933
She was the one who was
supposed to be in the book.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.953
Then I found out that everyone
knows the story of Helen Keller.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.236
That's she's this woman who's
blind and deaf and supposedly dumb.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:50.190
And everyone says,
"Forget this girl.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.990
She's unteachable.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.856
Give up on her."

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.873
And her teacher Ann Sullivan --
you know we all know the story.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:58.973
Many people have seen the movie.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.440
You know she writes
in her hand everyday

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.106
and that's how she learns to talk.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.640
What I didn't also know at that time
was that there was no Braille books.

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.436
There were no Braille
books for her to read.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:21.113
So the only way she could read her
textbooks was that her teacher,

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.883
Ann Sullivan, would everyday finger
write in her hands every book.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.530
Five hours every day
just finger writing

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.783
in her hand what everything
said in the book.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.483
At the same time, Ann Sullivan's
own eyesight was fading.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.983
And her doctor said to
her, "If you keep reading

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:51.723
to this girl you are going to
risk going blind yourself."

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.216
And Ann Sullivan said,
"I don't care."

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:55.890
And she kept reading to Helen Keller

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.823
and Helen Keller graduated
from Radcliff cum laude.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.020
And as someone who had a
teacher change my life, I just --

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.580
I mean I read that story and that
was gasoline to me for months.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.826
I still, you know when I get down
and I'm thinking it's really hard,

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.173
I read that story and
it's just fantastic to me.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.400
I love that someone like that
existed on this planet with us.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.440
Yes.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.716
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible background question]

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the question is why
do you hate your daughter?

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.430
[Laughter] So the question is
what about heroes for my daughter.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.610
Yes, I am not stupid.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.463
I made when deal when I
signed the deal for this book.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.023
I said there has to
be a two-book deal.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.600
And they said, "Why?"

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.666
And I said, "You clearly
have never met my daughter."

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.906
[Laughter] Now my daughter, for
those of you who have met her,

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.626
because there a few I see here.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.910
She comes into my office every day
and says, "Where's my book dad?"

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.576
[Laughter] "When are you going
to be done with my book?"

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:54.510
She drives me harder
than my own editor.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.510
I always knew I was going to
do a book for her as well.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:58.110
I certainly saved people for her.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.643
I saved Ann Frank for her.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.296
I saved certain people that
I knew had to be in her book

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.390
and it's amazing to work
on because it's the same

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.480
and I treat them the
same, but it's different.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.200
As anyone who has a son and
daughter knows, it just is.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:12.990
And I know that my daughter's life,
no matter how idealistic I want

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.776
to be about this world
is going to be different

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.416
than my son's in experience.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.840
And so the lessons I'm picking, I
thought there would be no difference

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.660
at all and I wanted to say,

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.860
"Nope you know I treat
them exactly the same."

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.526
You know I bought wood
blocks for my kid.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.260
I didn't buy Barbies.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.060
I didn't buy cars.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.660
My son of course loves cars
and my daughter loves Barbies.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.060
Like you can't control some
things, and I can't control the fact

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.526
that I'm picking different
heroes for her

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.860
and in a strange way,
many of the same heroes.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.660
The other question, in terms
of what else am I working on,

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.170
there is a new thriller coming out
in January called The Inner Circle.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:45.720
That takes place in Washington,
D.C. It's at the National Archives.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.180
It is the beginning of a
series character for me,

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.113
the first series I've ever done.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.380
And I can't wait for it to come out.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.646
I can't wait to share it.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.113
It's the first book in four years
I've done back in Washington.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.256
Everyone knows that has come
and seen me speak here before,

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:02.583
I always steal the physical
descriptions of characters

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:08.756
from when I ride the Metro here and
so if you see yourself in the book,

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:09.033
it is because I stole your face.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.500
That is absolutely true.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.576
And the other thing we're working
on, if you look in either November

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:15.956
or December it will be on the air.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:18.090
And if you look in
our Facebook page,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:20.783
if you go to our Facebook
page, we're launching a TV show

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:26.463
on the History Channel and it is
called Brad Meltzer's Decoded.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.660
It is the greatest
title of all time to me.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.173
And as I told my wife the other day,
"You know honey, what are we having

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.706
for Brad Meltzer's
dinner tonight [Laughter]

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.383
because yesterday we had Brad
Meltzer's chicken and tonight I'd

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.753
like to have Brad Meltzer's pasta."

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:39.766
But what this show is is it lets
me take all the things that I do

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:43.623
in my thrillers and try and find
the real answers in real life.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.603
So one of the episodes in
1792 when the first piece

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:56.100
of the White House was put down, the
very first cornerstone was put down,

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.953
within 24 hours it
supposedly disappeared.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.306
For 200 years now nobody
has been able to find it.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:02.953
No one knows where the first
piece of the White House is.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.780
And Harry Truman went looking for
it when he redid the White House.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:08.620
And Barbara Bush went looking for it

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.420
when they celebrated the
anniversary celebration.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.373
Nobody knows where it is and
that's an episode of decoded

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.666
that we're going to try
and find the answer.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.800
So that's basically
what's going to be working

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.000
on from there those three things.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.800
Yes sir.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.066
&gt;&gt; I don't have a question,
I have an inspiration.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.800
&gt;&gt; Yes please.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.933
&gt;&gt; You told my wife and wrote in
a book, "No is not an option."

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.266
And she finished a book and
I want to give it to you.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.000
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.800
Yes please.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.800


00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.333
[Applause] Let me tell you
something, every time I speak,

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.106
when they ask where you got
started I tell one story.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.186
And I didn't tell it here
because I figured you know I want

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.453
to tell something new and
not do the same thing.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:52.920
But every time I got
-- I got what I got

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.520
when I wrote my first
book, 24 rejection letters.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.380
Now there were to be clear
only 20 publishers at that time

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.286
and I got 24 rejection letters.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:04.756
That means some people
are writing you twice

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:05.956
to make sure you get the point.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:08.513
[Laughter] And I remember I
was on the phone here in D.C.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:11.853
when I got my 23rd and
24th rejection letter.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.980
My agent called me up
and said, "Sorry kiddo."

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.580
I'll never forget it.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:17.380
I was looking at the fire station

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.380
across from the Ritz
Carlton downtown on M Street

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.846
and every time I pass it.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:23.980
I actually have a picture
on my phone of it

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.046
and whenever I think I'm getting
too big or I'm thinking --

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.713
like I'm too much of a
hotshot, I look at that picture

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:29.980
and remember what its
like to have nothing,

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.180
to have nothing but rejection.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.513
And every time I tell that story
someone comes up to me afterwards

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.513
and says, "I'm working on a book
and that means something to you."

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.596
But never in over a decade has
anyone come and given me a book

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:40.496
after they heard that
talk, so thank you.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.030
I appreciate that.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.030
[Applause] And congratulations
that's a big deal.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:46.580
And so every person here, every
single person here who's working

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.443
on a book, please, please, please
don't let anyone tell you no.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.250
That is a vital, vital lesson.

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.730
Other questions that
tell me how awesome I am?

00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.770
[Laughter] Yes.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:01.036
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible background question]

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.176
&gt;&gt; Yes, the question is are
there any current heroes?

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.163
Or did you just pick the dead ones.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:08.753
[Laughter] And you
know what there are.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:10.680
And I think that's what I love
the most about this book is

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.920
that there are heroes everywhere.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:16.403
There's a guy named Andy Miyares

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.270
from Florida who's a
special Olympics swimmer.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.590
And when he was born they said he
wasn't going to walk for a couple

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.830
of years and he wound
up doing it much faster.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.110
By 9 months he wound up moving
and being able to crawl.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.976
They thought it was going
to take him years to do it.

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:34.983
And they didn't think he could learn
and his parents put him in the pool

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:37.603
and he learned how to
count by swimming laps.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.003
He loved to swim.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:41.203
And he would count one, two, three,

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.016
four and even in the special
Olympics he's considered

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:46.190
an underdog.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.463
He basically has the hands a
little like a five year old.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:50.716
He has these tiny little hands.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:53.650
He's small.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:55.650
He's petite.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.583
Even in the special Olympics,
think about that for a minute.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.583
He's considered the underdog.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.316
But he has something like six
world records and he lives

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.516
in Florida, not far from me.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:05.583
And I love that that
guy is there and so many

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.450
of us don't know about him.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:08.983
There's also things like Team Hoyt.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:10.983
I don't know if you know Team Hoyt.

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:13.423
But when Dick and Judy when their
son was born he was also told --

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.076
he was so severely disabled.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.960
Excuse me.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.760
He was so severely disabled

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.893
that they told them you
have to put him away.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.693
Put him in an institution.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.093
No one will care about this kid.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.093
He's going to amount to nothing.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.760
He'll never understand you.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.560
And his parents wouldn't
give up on him.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.626
They took him everywhere.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.426
They would drag him
in the wheelchair.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.893
They would take him swimming.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.893
They would do whatever they did
and there was a charity race

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.160
for a boy who had been paralyzed.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.826
And the young son Rick
said, "You know what,

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.360
we should run in that race
dad just to show that kid

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.826
that you shouldn't give up and
anything is still possible."

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.760
And so the dad takes
his son and pushes him

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.493
in the wheelchair and
runs in the race.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.353
And when he runs in the race you
know he needs a computer to speak

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.650
and it took him until his teens
before he spoke his first sentence.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.990
And you know he typed that on a
computer using his eyes to type.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.976
And he finally said, "Go
Bruins" was his first sentence.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:09.330


00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.750
[Laughter] At least he
wasn't a Yankee fan.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.550
And basically he runs in the
race and he finishes the race

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.673
and he says, "Dad, when
I'm with you it feels

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.006
like my disability disappears."

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:21.823
And the dad continues
to run in marathons.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.190
He pushes his son.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.323
He runs in Iron men.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.293
He swims. He ties a rope
around his chest and swims

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:30.323
with his boy behind him
tugging him the entire way.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.850
And to this day the
younger son can't walk,

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.956
but with his father
these two men fly.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.340
I love that story.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.540
They still run races.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.073
They sent me a card and said,

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:45.540
"Thanks for putting
me in your book."

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.540
And I was like, "Are you kidding me.

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.940
That was the easiest part."

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.540
And I just love that people
like that are still here

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.340
and I think we just -- you know
it's so easy to focus on the bad

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.740
and I'm not saying we should
all say everything's roses

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.940
and everything's wonderful,

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.406
but don't forget how much
good there is out there.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:01.406
Don't forget the heroes are there.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.540
And most important, this
is why I saved it for last.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.940
Don't forget to thank them.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.340
So with that said let me say the
most important thing I will say

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:09.206
today and that is, "Thank you!"

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.740
Thank you for coming year
after year and supporting me.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.740
[Applause] It means more than
you will ever, ever know.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.273
Thanks very much.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.210
[Applause]

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.036
