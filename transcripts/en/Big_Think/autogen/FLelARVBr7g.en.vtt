00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.169
 
lots of questions about how

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:02.179
lots of questions about how
 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.990
lots of questions about how
irrationality changes what we do so of

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000
irrationality changes what we do so of
 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.550
irrationality changes what we do so of
course we have demonstrations of people

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
course we have demonstrations of people
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.290
course we have demonstrations of people
being irrational from time to time and

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300
being irrational from time to time and
 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.740
being irrational from time to time and
the question is how big is the impact on

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750
the question is how big is the impact on
 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.200
the question is how big is the impact on
on ourselves and the answer is that it's

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210
on ourselves and the answer is that it's
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.750
on ourselves and the answer is that it's
really very large there was this very

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
really very large there was this very
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.880
really very large there was this very
sad analysis that looked at the question

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890
sad analysis that looked at the question
 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.519
sad analysis that looked at the question
of what is the percentage of human

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529
of what is the percentage of human
 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.660
of what is the percentage of human
mortality that is either aided by or

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670
mortality that is either aided by or
 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.240
mortality that is either aided by or
caused by bad decisions right how often

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
caused by bad decisions right how often
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.370
caused by bad decisions right how often
do we make a bad decision that either

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
do we make a bad decision that either
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.709
do we make a bad decision that either
accelerates or kill us and when you look

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
accelerates or kill us and when you look
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.750
accelerates or kill us and when you look
at these results about 100 years ago you

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
at these results about 100 years ago you
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.850
at these results about 100 years ago you
say it's less than 10% think a hundred

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
say it's less than 10% think a hundred
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.530
say it's less than 10% think a hundred
years ago how could you make a bad

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540
years ago how could you make a bad
 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.170
years ago how could you make a bad
decision that would kill you not that

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
decision that would kill you not that
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.490
decision that would kill you not that
easy but you know you could do it from

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
easy but you know you could do it from
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.790
easy but you know you could do it from
time to time now it's more than 40% how

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
time to time now it's more than 40% how
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.319
time to time now it's more than 40% how
come what has changed

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
come what has changed
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.470
come what has changed
technology over time we've eventing

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
technology over time we've eventing
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.350
technology over time we've eventing
invented technology that can kill us so

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
invented technology that can kill us so
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.819
invented technology that can kill us so
of course texting and driving is very

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
of course texting and driving is very
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:56.360
of course texting and driving is very
clear

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
clear
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.020

smoking diabesity OBD obesity some of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030
smoking diabesity OBD obesity some of
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.360
smoking diabesity OBD obesity some of
those are single mistakes that can kill

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
those are single mistakes that can kill
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.549
those are single mistakes that can kill
us like texting and driving but some of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559
us like texting and driving but some of
 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.560
us like texting and driving but some of
those like obesity diabetes and smoking

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
those like obesity diabetes and smoking
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.010
those like obesity diabetes and smoking
are a series of mistakes that can kill

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
are a series of mistakes that can kill
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.590
are a series of mistakes that can kill
us and each of them is not as big but

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
us and each of them is not as big but
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.770
us and each of them is not as big but
together they accumulate and I think

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
together they accumulate and I think
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.450
together they accumulate and I think
that's actually what happens if you say

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
that's actually what happens if you say
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.390
that's actually what happens if you say
what is the percentage of the decisions

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
what is the percentage of the decisions
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.390
what is the percentage of the decisions
we make that are irrational I don't know

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
we make that are irrational I don't know
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.560
we make that are irrational I don't know
what the answer it's very hard to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
what the answer it's very hard to
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.780
what the answer it's very hard to
compute but the fact is that those that

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
compute but the fact is that those that
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.490
compute but the fact is that those that
we make are incredibly dangerous

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
we make are incredibly dangerous
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.080
we make are incredibly dangerous
you don't have to text and drive that

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
you don't have to text and drive that
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.420
you don't have to text and drive that
many times to kill yourself you don't

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
many times to kill yourself you don't
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.310
many times to kill yourself you don't
have to start many habits in order to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320
have to start many habits in order to
 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.950
have to start many habits in order to
accelerate your your death or to become

accelerate your your death or to become
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.499
accelerate your your death or to become
incredibly unhealthy so what happened is

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
incredibly unhealthy so what happened is
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.060
incredibly unhealthy so what happened is
that the world around us

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
that the world around us
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.630
that the world around us
is designed to tempt us you know one of

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
is designed to tempt us you know one of
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.830
is designed to tempt us you know one of
the principles from behavioral economics

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
the principles from behavioral economics
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.800
the principles from behavioral economics
is choice architecture the idea that we

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
is choice architecture the idea that we
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.170

when we are placed in the environment we

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
when we are placed in the environment we
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.480
when we are placed in the environment we
make decisions as a function of the

make decisions as a function of the
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.700
make decisions as a function of the
environment we're in think about the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710
environment we're in think about the
 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.069
environment we're in think about the
environment that we're in what is it

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
environment that we're in what is it
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.499
environment that we're in what is it
about is it about our long-term health

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
about is it about our long-term health
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.230
about is it about our long-term health
or is it about the short-term profits of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
or is it about the short-term profits of
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.420
or is it about the short-term profits of
that environment you walk down the

now Dunkin Donuts what is their
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.710
now Dunkin Donuts what is their
optimization function are they trying to

buy another doughnut now your cell phone
what is it trying to do to get you to be

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720
what is it trying to do to get you to be
 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.920
what is it trying to do to get you to be
a productive citizen in two years or to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930
a productive citizen in two years or to
 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.630

check your phone a couple of more times

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
check your phone a couple of more times
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.790
check your phone a couple of more times
today so what happened is that we are in

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800
today so what happened is that we are in
 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.650
today so what happened is that we are in
an environment that tempts us all the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660
an environment that tempts us all the
 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.130
an environment that tempts us all the
time these temptations are only

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140
time these temptations are only
 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.900
time these temptations are only
increasing and because of that we fail

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910
increasing and because of that we fail
 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.990
increasing and because of that we fail
we fail we fail often because of that it

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000
we fail we fail often because of that it
 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.090
we fail we fail often because of that it
reduces dramatically our ability to do

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100
reduces dramatically our ability to do
 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.930
reduces dramatically our ability to do
some things like save and it will take

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940
some things like save and it will take
 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.060
some things like save and it will take
care of our health and therefore our

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070
care of our health and therefore our
 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.350
care of our health and therefore our
total well-being is going down

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360
total well-being is going down
 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.320
total well-being is going down
dramatically as well
