JOHN POLLACK: Thank you
all for having me.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.160
I'm a big fan of Google.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.780
I use your products
every day--

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.670
seven days a week.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.150
I love the Ngram Viewer.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.560
As a researcher, it's
tremendous.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.170
So is there anybody here
who worked on that?

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.900
All right, well, whoever,
among your

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.080
colleagues, did fantastic.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.740
So I just want to say
that I don't take

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.150
what you do for granted.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.320
I mean, I think if you grow up
at a certain age, pre-Google,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.600
pre-web, you take research
a little bit for granted.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.470
And so I got started as a
reporter 25 years ago at the

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.920
Hartford Courant.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.820
And you had to track everyone
down by telephone.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.230
And so you'd call somebody and
they'd tell you, no, I'm not

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.590
the person.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.620
You need to talk to so and so.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.740
And you'd find that number.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.790
It was a process of looking
up numbers in phone books.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.470
And we used to, in the bureau
where I worked in New Britain,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.330
Connecticut--

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.150
I covered the sewer

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.580
commission, among other things--

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.530
we had all these phone books
so you could track down

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.760
people, and even out of date
phone books because people

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.070
would de-list their numbers
because they didn't want to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.980
get called by reporters.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.850
And so phone books were
our best friends.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.760
And I did this story once on
phone books and the history of

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.500
the Yellow Pages.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.520
Do you know why the Yellow
Pages are yellow?

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.750
Well, as it turns out, in 1883,
in Cheyenne, Wyoming,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.270
there was a printer and he was
printing up something new

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.620
called the phone book, the phone
directory, and he ran

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.140
out of white paper.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.910
And rather than wait for the
next train, he said, I'll just

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.850
print it on what I have,
which was yellow.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.020
And it caught on and we
have the Yellow Pages.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.020
And so ever since, we've let
our fingers do the walking.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.330
Except now, thanks to
you, we do it on a

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.700
computer using Google.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.600
So apart from the Ngram Viewer,
which I love, there's

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.920
a couple other features that
really appeal to me.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.460
And one is Google Doodles.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.900
And there's one on the
back wall, and there.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.730
I see them all the time.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.300
I love Google Doodles because we
live in this era where the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.230
corporate brand police at most
companies guard their logos

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.630
like Fort Knox.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.130
And Google plays with
it constantly.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.220
And in the process, is asks the
viewer to make sense of

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.730
it, to pull out the meaning,
to search.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.110
And I love how the use of the
logo engages people in the

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.160
very product that you sell,
which is the ability to search

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.080
for meaning.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.410
The second feature that I
love is the autofill.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.640
So on the autofill function,
I'm typing one letter.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.640
I haven't even decided what I'm
searching for exactly, and

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.830
it starts guessing ahead.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.630
And I think it's like a game.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.750
Sometimes I stop to check to
see if it was before I do

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.370
what's happening.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.370
And the ability to intuit an
answer from incomplete or

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.380
conflicting information is
exactly what we do as people

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.490
when we listen to people and
when we talk to people.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.120
As I'm speaking now, the
research shows that you're

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.990
accepting these sound waves and
processing them and trying

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.260
to guess ahead how I'm going
to finish the word, how I'm

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.370
going to finish the sentence,
what I mean.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.300
And even if you have to double
back at the end because you

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.950
guessed wrong, it's worth it
from a biological standpoint,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:55.670
because it speeds up

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.410
conversation and human exchange.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:08.750
So this happens to be the crux
of punning, too, at its core--

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.690
trying to decide, based on
conflicting information or

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.390
incomplete information,
incomplete context, what does

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.769
somebody mean?

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:25.190
And so who knew that Google
was a punning organization

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.470
intrinsically?

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.520
So that's what I love when
I get to work on Google.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.616
So what is a pun?

00:04:35.616 --> 00:04:38.980
Any definitions from
the audience?

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.280
Anybody want to hazard
a guess?

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.260
Yes.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.010
AUDIENCE: Using words in a way
that could be interpreted two

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.760
different ways.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.380
JOHN POLLACK: Exactly.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.310
Now, that's the core
definition.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.590
That's what I use.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.630
They come in a lot of
different forms.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.600
That's the beautiful thing about
punning, is that as soon

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.750
as you try and define it,
somebody can come up with one

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.310
that is slightly different.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.690
But you hit the nail
on the head.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.640
And so what do the people in
this room think about puns?

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.220
I take it it's a

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.950
self-selecting audience, right?

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.170
Raise your hands if
you like puns.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.860
Let's have a show of hands.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.760
All right, anybody?

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.950
There's one person with their
hand down, but OK.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.540
Fair enough.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.750
In general, in society, what's
the take on puns?

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.617
Anybody?

00:05:23.617 --> 00:05:25.020
AUDIENCE: Lowest
form of humor.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.840
JOHN POLLACK: Lowest
form of humor.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.860
Anybody else?

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.600
AUDIENCE: People groan.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.100
JOHN POLLACK: Groan, juvenile,
you name it, the pun gets

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.290
kicked around.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:42.800
And the truth of the matter
is that, for most of human

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.470
history, the pun was a sign of
intelligence, of wit, of

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.400
insight, of wisdom.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.680
And it wasn't always intended
as humorous.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.920
It was just a way of encoding
more meaning in fewer words.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.960
But in the last 400 years
or so, it had

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.620
this fall from grace.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.450
And so what I want to talk about
today is how it fell

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.380
from grace, why we're living
in a pun Renaissance today,

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.420
because the pun is making a
huge come back, and then I

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.190
want to share with you how the
pun enabled the rise of modern

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.900
civilization.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.680
Now, you laugh.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.810
I'm serious about this.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.550
And by the end of it, I think
you'll come away with a new

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.400
appreciation of an art
form that you all

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.940
practice every day.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:41.720
So let's start out by taking
a look at when puns were at

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.370
their apex in English, roughly
400 years ago.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.660
English as a language
was in major flux.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.130
In the couple centuries earlier,
in the 1300s, the

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.040
plague had come to England and
it had killed off a third of

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.720
the population--

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.560
a million people.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.080
And that just drove
major disruption.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.060
And people started fleeing
their villages.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.380
So you started to have a mixing
of regional accents and

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.750
a mixing of regional dialects.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.860
And English was already a
real mutt of a language.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:23.110
I mean, the Romans had brought
Latin, you had Celtic grammar,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.585
you had Anglo-Saxon
vocabulary.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.700
The Vikings had invaded.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.600
They gave us words like
knot and haggle.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.250
Good words.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.680
Who knew they were Viking?

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.780
And then you had the
Norman invasion.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.100
And then you had 10,000 French
words come into English--

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.550
decolletage, debonair,
double entendre--

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:47.620
good one.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.000
And so English was a swirl.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.430
And what happened was in the
age of Shakespeare, in the

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:04.400
late 1500s, early 1600s, puns
were just hugely popular.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.630
Lawyers punned, judges punned
in their judgments, the

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.200
playwrights were punning,
the poets were punning.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:17.440
Even condemned criminals would
pun on the gallows to show

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.600
that, hey, I'm not so low.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.130
I still have eloquence, I still
have wit, I am a worthy

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.370
human being.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:33.220
And so puns were
in power then.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.390
So what happened?

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:40.600
How did we go from puns at their
apex, extremely popular,

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.470
to puns being kicked to the curb
as low humor, juvenile,

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.210
lowest form of wit?

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.460
OK.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.150
There were several factors.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:55.350
The first was the arrival
of the printing press.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.110
So technology can
always disrupt.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.130
The first printing press came
to England in 1476.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:07.470
And what happens when
you print something?

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.900
You have to choose a spelling.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.740
And when you choose a spelling,
you favor a meaning.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.650
So as you shift from an oral
culture to a print culture,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.750
suddenly some of the wind is
lost from the sails of punning

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.160
because punning thrives
on ambiguity.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.040
And that's why I always feel
that spoken puns are better

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:35.220
than written puns because they
preserve the surprise a little

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.690
bit longer.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.780
A second factor was
the rise of the

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.610
turnpike system in England.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:48.880
As better road spidered out
from London, the accents,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.570
which had been kind of a mix of
all these regional accents,

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.100
gave way to kind of the cultural
dominance of London.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:05.510
And so the London accent became
the norm, the standard

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.030
by which others were judged.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.950
And so you started to suck out
some of the diversity in the

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.660
language and differences in

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.880
pronunciations that fueled puns.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:23.200
And then the next thing that
happened was coffee.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.600
Now, you think, what
does coffee

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.510
have to do with punning?

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.350
In 1632, I believe it was,
the first coffee

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.740
house came to London.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.360
And this was pre-tea--

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.780
England before tea.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:46.330
And so these coffee houses
became a great mixing pot of

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:52.680
social classes, and a lot of
fierce debate, and different

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.260
ideas clashing.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.970
And they were great sources
of punning.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:10.270
And if you look at the big
names of the day, you had

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:14.440
Nicholas Rowe, John Dryden,
Jonathan Swift--

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.850
all these famous writers all
going back and forth at each

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.840
other every day in
the coffee shops.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:28.060
But a funny thing happened was
that in this mixing of

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:33.150
classes, the aristocrats
realized that, hey, they

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.320
weren't that much smarter than
the average Joe when it came

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.420
to punning.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.890
And some of the social status
that had been associated with

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.780
punning was suddenly called into
question, because, well,

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.940
hey, if everyone can pun, it
must not be that great a mark

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.520
of distinction.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.970
And so class became a factor.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.600
The other thing that happened
was that people like Sir Issac

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.740
Newton started gathering, and
scientists started talking.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.610
And this was the birth
of the Enlightenment.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:12.130
And so there was a rise in the
importance of reason--

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.740
of scientific law, of logic.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.620
Puns are very unruly
by their nature.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.460
They jump fences of meaning,
they don't seemed

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.240
to belong to order.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.630
They're very subversive.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:34.340
And so as the Enlightenment
took root, the

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.890
status of puns fell.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.140
They were suspect.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:42.360
And so what playwrights had been
using to hold attention,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.060
to undermine the royal censors
through double meanings

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.490
started to fall in status.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:56.200
And so the pun started
its slide down.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.760
And then along came
Samuel Johnson.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.470
Does anybody know
Samuel Johnson?

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.700
OK.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:02.920
Yeah.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.480
He wrote the first real
English Dictionary.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.720
And the thing was is that
English had sort of been a

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.520
second-tier language.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.540
But when he wrote the
dictionary, it was an attempt

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.410
to kind of put English on the
map, to fix meanings.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.080
And he started out in
the late 1740s.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.800
To do this, he raised money for
the project as a startup,

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.260
and he locked himself in
this garret in London.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.000
You can visit it.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.510
It's a great little
garret to visit.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:39.710
And he thought he'd done
in two years or so.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.640
Two years became three, three
years became four.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.370
He ran out of money.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.370
There are bars on the windows
above the door there because

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.870
people were trying to break in
to steal stuff to collect

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.510
their debts from him.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.640
That's how bad it got.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.780
And after nine years of slaving
away in this garret,

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.480
in 1755, he came out with
the dictionary.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.550
And it made him a celebrity.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.770
He was a rock star of the age.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.510
And, of course, if you spent
nine years going crazy and

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.280
going broke writing a
dictionary, what do you

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.020
dislike most?

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.890
Double, triple meanings.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.040
So he hated puns--

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:20.960
hate them.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.350
And he used his bully pulpit
to denigrate them.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.930
In fact, he later came out
with a collected works of

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:32.440
Shakespeare, and he started
taking out the puns.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.850
And he said, Shakespeare
would--

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:34.610
I'm paraphrasing--

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.010
Shakespeare would be pretty good
if he weren't so willing

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.170
to sacrifice everything
for a pun.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:48.340
And, of course, Johnson did a
great service to English by

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.990
writing the dictionary, but he
did a great disservice by

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.750
dissing puns.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.110
But even he couldn't
resist a good one.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.130
So there's a great story.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.790
I was researching the book
and came across this--

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.910
in the rare book room
at the public

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.030
library on 42nd Street--

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:11.530
there was this little
leather-bound volume of

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.940
collected puns from 1826.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.910
And I was flipping through it.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.900
And I came across the story
about Samuel Johnson punning.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.150
And I thought, that bastard,
I've got him.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.600
And so here's the story.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.760
He's walking through London
one day with Boswell, his

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.490
assistant and later biographer,
and they're

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.560
passing Old Bailey,
the courts.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.090
And there's a crowd gathering.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.320
And he says, Boswell, go find
out what's happening.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.400
So Boswell comes back
and says, there's

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.655
going to be a hanging.

00:15:46.655 --> 00:15:48.770
He says, we'll, find
out who it is.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.320
So he goes and it turns out
that the guy being hung--

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.130
the condemned man's
name is Mr. Vowel.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:00.470
And Johnson turns to Boswell
and says, Bosie, well, it's

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:06.710
very clear that it's neither
you nor I. See, clearly, he

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:10.130
had no problem with capital
punishment.

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:16.530
So, listen.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:22.090
Despite Johnson's effort, the
pun survived, and England is a

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.580
very pun-rich culture.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.640
But here in America, even as
the English were kind of

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.500
rejecting it, we were saying
we were embracing it.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.590
And the early colonial preachers
punned from the

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.180
pulpit, here, to keep
people engaged.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:47.490
And, in fact, if you do an
image search, you'll find

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:53.210
great punning sign boards across
America today in that

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.880
same tradition.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.620
So one I loved was God
answers knee-mail.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.140
K-N-E-E. God answer
an knee-mail.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.030
There was another one--

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:06.170
the sun cures sinburn.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.200
And you'll appreciate
this one.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.700
It's not a pun, but it says,
there are some questions

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.280
Google can't answer.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.130
Anyway.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:15.380
You might doubt that.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:22.609
So the early political leaders
of this country,

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.280
too, were big punsters.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.500
And I was doing some research
and came across a great letter

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:33.330
from Thomas Jefferson to
Abigail Adams at the

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.930
Constitutional Convention
in 1789.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:42.610
And I'll get the exact quote,
but he basically said, listen,

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.560
you wouldn't believe all the
punning that's going on here.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:52.720
And he said, the people at large
view every object only

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.390
as it may furnish
puns in bon mot.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.230
And I pronounce that a good
punster would disarm the whole

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.550
nation where they ever
disposed to revolt.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:06.470
So the great orators, the great
statesman, the great

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.310
writers of the era, they
were punning too.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:11.660
And it was happening
on all levels.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:16.870
So out on the frontier in the
1830s, Davy Crockett was a big

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.780
punster and a bragger.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:26.340
And he was a celebrity in
his day, even before

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.940
he died at the Alamo.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:32.340
And there was a riddle going
around in the early 1830s--

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.640
how many years does Davy
Crockett have?

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.320
Any guesses?

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.380
JOHN POLLACK: Three--

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.480
a left ear, a right ear,
and a wild frontier.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.380
So what happened?

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:52.120
So how did we go from puns being
popular to low status?

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.910
Well, in the early 20th century,
all the Jewish

00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.410
comedians on Vaudeville
celebrated the pun--

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.860
Henny Youngman, the Marx
Brothers, George

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.870
Burns, Gracie Allen.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:05.770
Punning was a big thing.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:10.160
And then after World War II,
there was a shift in humor

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.510
just as there was a
shift in music.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.630
As jazz became less structured,
as art became more

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:23.530
abstract, humor migrated away
from set piece jokes and into

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.630
more the Woody Allen, Lenny
Bruce free-flowing

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.590
dysfunctional narrative
sort of humor.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:35.640
And puns were left high and
dry, as old fashioned.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.470
And you still got smart punning
in some pop culture.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.500
Think of "MASH" and
Hawkeye Pierce--

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.420
Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.660
Just brilliant punning back
and forth, back and forth,

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.660
again, for purposes
of subversion.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.580
But in general, the pun
was on the decline.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.375
And that's when you had
the groans set in.

00:19:59.375 --> 00:20:00.880
So just a question here.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.140
What does the groan mean?

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.590
Anybody?

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.570
AUDIENCE: It means
you got the joke.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.116
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it means you get
it, but you kind of want

00:20:10.116 --> 00:20:10.910
to pretend you don't like it.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:11.770
JOHN POLLACK: Exactly.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.180
Or, it could mean, I didn't
get it, but I don't

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.890
want to admit it.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.500
Or it could mean it was
brilliant, but I don't want to

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.660
encourage you.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.340
Or it could mean I thought
it was awful.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.170
Or it could mean that your brain
is toggling between so

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.520
many different emotions so
quickly that that's what comes

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.810
out because you just don't
know what to say.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:42.460
And so the groan as a cultural
reflex is a post-war cultural

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:49.620
reflex, just as the rim
shot set in there too.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.520
Badump-bump.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.000
Now, originally that came out
of Vaudeville, and it was an

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.150
affirmation that, hey,
good job, good joke.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:55.990
Nice work.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.900
And then after, it was
associated with,

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.970
oh, that was cheesy.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:09.490
So I don't want you to think,
though, that the idea that

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:14.850
puns are cheesy or low or
juvenile or unpopular is true,

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.660
because that's actually
not the case.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.660
Because let's look at
the marketplace.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.500
Puns sell.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:27.450
Who can think of some punning
product names?

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:27.620
OK.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.360
Let's just--

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:29.960
JOHN POLLACK: What's that?

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:33.800
It was a toilet bowl cleaner.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.240
JOHN POLLACK: OK, great.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.250
What about Cherry Garcia,
flavored ice

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.890
cream, or Carmel Sutra--

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.430
the whole Ben and
Jerry's line.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.880
How about the name of your
company, based on a pun.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.760
How about--

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.780
let's see.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:51.330
JOHN POLLACK: Yeah.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.310
Or Verizon.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:58.920
The name Verizon is a
portmanteau of very true and

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.910
horizon, true horizon.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:01.950
Try getting reception--

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.370
not always true.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.400
What about when you get your
iPhone, there's a little

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.080
booklet that comes with it
called "Fingertips." And if

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.820
Apple's doing puns, that's not
very Apple-like, but they

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.750
can't resist, because
it's cool.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.310
So who here eats
Chipotle ever?

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.070
Anybody ever eat at Chipotle?

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.960
OK, so a couple years ago,
they had this brilliant

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.900
campaign, and it was celebrating
their, I think,

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.200
17th anniversary or something
like that.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.830
And they were celebrating the
quality of their ingredients.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.030
And to do so, they were
wrapping their

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.850
burritos in gold foil.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.230
And their campaign
was ausome--

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:43.480
A-U-S-O-M-E--

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:49.870
from the gold in the
periodic table.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:54.670
And it speaks to the
intelligence of both the

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.980
people on the selling end,
but the intelligence and

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.985
expectation of intelligence on
the receiving end as well.

00:23:02.985 --> 00:23:04.040
All the movies.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.900
Think about "Gnomeo and Juliet"
or "Ratatouille." Did

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.360
anybody see "Ratatouille,"
about the

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.960
rat, the chef in Paris?

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.510
I mean, it's brilliant.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:22.220
And so the reason why people
pun in these situations is

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.450
that puns sell.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:29.930
There was this Dutch study that
showed that consumers

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.380
preferred slogans that
included puns--

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.490
the more meanings the better--

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:39.600
even when they completely
imagined that there was a pun.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.010
So there didn't even have
to be a pun, and

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.260
they liked that better.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.670
Think about the way that puns
creep into our language.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:55.040
Did anybody here have
branch last weekend?

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.660
Some people probably did.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.260
Branch--

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.070
breakfast and lunch.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.790
Smog--

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.430
smoke and fog.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.820
Medicare, Obamacare.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.630
Look at all the tabloid
newspapers.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:09.640
The headlines each day here in
New York-- the Post and the

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.170
Daily News go at it trying
to out-pun each other.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.230
Because puns sell.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.190
Now, why is this?

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.320
Well, part of the reason is that
we're so bombarded with

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.350
information all day
every day--

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.700
ads projected on the sidewalk,
blinking lights, laser beams

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.710
popping-- everyone's trying to
get our attention, saying,

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.580
hey, look at me, hey,
look at me.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.900
And part of the challenge
is just

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.090
capturing people's attention.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:40.580
And puns are sticky, because
they pack more meaning into

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.780
fewer words, and so they're
very sticky.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.720
And that's why puns
work so well.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.660
Now.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:01.620
I don't want you to think that
puns are just light, because

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.790
they're not.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:07.030
In the course of the book, I
interviewed an anthropologist

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:11.720
about the significance of puns,
and he had studied these

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:16.820
long pun duals in Tzotzil, which
is a Mayan dialect in

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.270
the Chiapas Highlands
of Mexico.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:24.160
And they have these long ritual
punning duals in which

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.400
they go back and forth, back and
forth for hours, and you

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.500
lose face if you lose it.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:33.680
But they use these pun duals to
communicate ideas that are

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.990
sensitive or perhaps taboo.

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:37.770
Like, hey, I'd like to
marry your sister.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.860
And so they might
seek permission

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.870
through these pun duals.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.890
It's called [INAUDIBLE]--

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.030
I'm probably mispronouncing
the Tzotzil.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.450
But that's the form.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:53.450
And again, I mentioned a few
moments ago about the

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:58.200
Shakespearean playwrights would
use puns to evade the

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:58.810
royal censors.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:04.000
Well today, in China, the
censors are going wild trying

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.690
to police all the puns because
while you can control what

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:13.790
someone says, you cannot control
what someone means and

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:15.760
what people infer.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:21.770
and so a good punster is the
censor's worst enemy.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:27.010
There's a video on YouTube
called "The Ballad of the

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:34.240
Grass Mudhorse." And it's an
entirely satirical punning

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:40.020
story of a unicorn-like creature
who's defeating the

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:40.930
river crabs.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:46.140
But all the names of the
creatures are punning

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:51.820
references to things that
are banned in China.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:59.080
And they're sticking a finger
in the eye of censors.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:04.780
So if you go back to George
Orwell's "1984," there's a

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.910
postscript on there about
newspeak, the language that

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.300
the government was working
on that would

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.920
eliminate double meanings.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:19.660
And he said that it would take
a while, but by 2050 it would

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.160
be complete, and that if you
could eliminate double

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.460
meanings and only have approved
words, no one could

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.390
even think a subversive
thought.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:33.480
And I think it's a testament
that he thought that

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:39.520
totalitarianism would come in
1984, but language would

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:45.400
allude control for much,
much longer than that.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:54.700
So punning is very powerful,
even today.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.790
And we're really living
in a pun Renaissance--

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:58.640
not just in the market.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.650
But for anybody who's
interested, there's a contest

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.720
called Punderdome 3000.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.050
Has anybody been to that?

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:07.160
Yeah.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.260
A couple people.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.760
It was last night in Brooklyn.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.680
It's once a month at
Little Fields.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.980
It's a great show.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:19.700
But there were 350 super nerds
in the room punning--

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.500
not everyone was punning.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.780
But it was just electric.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.250
And we're really living in
a renaissance of the pun.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:28.310
So we're lucky for that.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:33.390
So I want to talk to you briefly
about one more main

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:36.930
idea, and then I'm going
to take questions.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:42.150
And this is getting back to what
I said earlier that the

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:45.670
pun enabled the rise of
modern civilization.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:53.100
So how old do you think the
first evidence of punning is?

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.329
Any takers on that one?

00:28:56.329 --> 00:28:57.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.330
JOHN POLLACK: By
a factor of 10.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.420
So about 35,000 years
ago, we have our

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.210
first evidence of punning.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.140
Now, how do we know that?

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.800
You might say, oh, there's
no recordings,

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.110
there's no written language.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:13.170
But what we do see are these
carved stone statues about the

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:14.330
size of an Oscar.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:19.100
And on one side it's a naked
woman, and if you rotate it

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.950
180 degrees, it's an
erect phallus.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:25.110
And what it shows is that people
have the capacity to

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.275
see two ideas they
were different--

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.590
they were inseparable,
but different.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:36.650
And what you saw depended on
angle that you looked at it.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.500
So we know that people had
the capacity for punning

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.940
35,000 years ago.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.680
Now think of the challenges
of language.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.010
So if you had, say, you were in
the cave and you wanted to

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:56.410
paint a picture that said,
great buffalo hunt today.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:58.180
We killed three buffalo.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.480
OK, easy enough, right?

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.470
You light your torch, you get
your pigments, and you paint

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.480
three buffalo on the wall, and
you put in three spears or

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.690
three arrows, and boom,
you're done.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:10.970
OK.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:12.170
Great.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:12.710
All right.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:19.710
Now let's say you flash forward
to ancient Mesopotamia

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.770
and you want a contract because
you're sending 478

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:31.030
sheep to Ur on Saturday for this
price, and here are the

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.230
payment terms.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:37.490
And it's a lot more complicated,
and it's a lot

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.800
harder to do with
just pictures.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:45.450
I mean, pictures are great for
nouns, OK for simple verbs,

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:50.620
but for the complexity of law,
for the complexity of tense,

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.890
for anything subjective, it's
very, very difficult.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:59.220
So what the scribes started
doing is they needed

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.040
abstractions, they needed
relational words.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:07.970
And they had this intellectual
breakthrough in both Egypt and

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:09.510
Mesopotamia--

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.770
about the same time--

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:16.450
where they said, gosh, this
hieroglyph, this cuneiform

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:19.870
script, it sounds like x, or
part of it sounds like x.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.570
And they'd break off that piece
and they'd just harvest

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.500
the phonetic value for
other purposes.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.740
So, in essence, they
were punning.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.720
So knock knock.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:33.420
AUDIENCE: Who's there?

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.390
JOHN POLLACK: Isabel.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.060
AUDIENCE: Isabel who?

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.170
JOHN POLLACK: Isabel necessary
on a bicycle?

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:39.910
All right.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.600
OK, so you think stupid
knock-knock joke.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.810
But it's actually a very
complicated intellectual

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:51.600
process to take those phonetic
chunks and re-purpose them

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.040
into an entirely new context
and meaning.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.640
And that's what the scribes
in Egypt and

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.540
Mesopotamia were doing--

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.330
not knock-knock jokes, per se,
but they were using the same

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:09.220
process of breaking apart sound,
symbol, and meaning and

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.480
recombining.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.770
Now, you might think, oh, who
is John Pollack to assert

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:19.930
this, and I actually went and
I interviewed Richard

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.690
Parkinson, who is the
Head Egyptologist

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.140
at the British Museum.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:28.510
He's also an excellent
punster, by the way.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.700
And he said, oh, of course, and
he started pointing out

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.560
all of the puns in the ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphs.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:39.400
And not all of them were meant
as funny, but they ran

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.240
throughout the hieroglyphs, and
the ancient Egyptians were

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.110
big time punsters
on many levels.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.270
And it wasn't all about humor,
it was about religion, it was

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:51.380
about deeper meaning, it
was about identity.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:58.910
And so if you look at the
ancient hieroglyphs, as the

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:04.930
evolved into script, you started
seeing some symbol for

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:10.070
symbol noun-like meaning, and
you also saw phonetics coming

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.140
into play, where symbols had
strictly phonetic values.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.710
And in about 1700 BC, scribes
unknown and in the sign they

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.580
had this brilliant breakthrough,
and they said,

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.790
screw all the one for
one symbology.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.320
Let's just go for a straight
phonetic alphabet.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.670
And that's what they did.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.840
And they came up with the
North Semitic alphabet.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:33.820
And that became the basis for
Phoenician, for Greek, for

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.160
Russian, for Persian,
for Sanskrit,

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.170
for the English alphabet.

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:44.960
It was incredibly liberating,
because suddenly you had this

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:50.710
way to write down ideas of
infinite complexity---

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:51.120
anything.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.140
You could write about
anything.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.360
You didn't have to carve
or paint all

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.210
these complicated symbols.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.840
You could just, boom, do it
really efficiently and you

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.700
could transmit that information
over time.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:06.180
So once you could transmit ideas
of infinite complexity

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.850
over time, you had this rapid
acceleration in the

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:10.580
accumulation of knowledge.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:15.130
And so suddenly the progress
of civilization

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:16.900
started taking off.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:23.520
So, in essence, if you had no
puns, no punsters, you would

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.050
have had no phonetic
alphabet--

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:31.340
no phonetic alphabet, no
practical way of writing.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.360
No practical way of writing--

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.739
no way of transmitting knowledge
over time, and we

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:40.420
wouldn't be sitting here in a
tall building in New York City

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.540
in a modern civilization.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.530
No puns no, modern
civilization.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:46.159
Does that make sense?

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:46.989
Great.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:58.740
So there are always going to
be critics of the pun.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:05.380
And there are some people that
will deny that the pun matters

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:08.630
or that the pun played
this catalytic role.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:12.010
And I would say that a lot of
that's because they feel

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:13.670
somehow threatened by the pun.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:18.350
Because the pun fogs up the lens
of clarity through which

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:23.030
they like to view the world and
impose order, or at least

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.620
the illusion of order.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:30.380
Because when people denigrate
puns, they're denigrating one

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:34.120
of the great creative catalysts
in history.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:40.190
And I say this because puns
really sharpen our creative

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.440
thinking skills.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.980
The great thing about punning
is that it takes you from

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:51.440
topic A to topic Q very
randomly sometimes,

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.740
apparently.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:36:00.220
And you're making an assertion
that there is a connection.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:04.170
And that is the essence
of creativity.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:09.340
It's trying out new
associations, it's trying to

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:13.920
find connections between
disparate topics.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.950
And I would argue that the pun
is humanity's first hyperlink.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:22.660
Let's go from A to Q or to P--

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.610
whatever.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:29.160
And it's this power of
association that let us go

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:35.900
from cave to hut to castle to
skyscraper to space station.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:41.600
It's a series of very wild and
unlikely associations that

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:49.180
accumulate over time, and this
willingness to take risks that

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:55.260
is this ability to see
connections and meaning.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.370
That's what fuels
human progress.

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:04.340
And so when you think
about two people

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:08.110
banging rocks together--

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:10.580
somebody said, wow, that
causes a spark.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.750
And then they light a fire.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.850
And then suddenly you're
boiling water

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.390
and generating steam.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.670
And someone says, oh, we can
generate electricity, and then

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.950
pretty soon we're talking
on our iPhones.

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:27.720
And all of that sweep of
history, all of it, comes

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:34.440
through these really amazing
unlikely associations through

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.390
human creativity.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:40.520
And that is one side of
the coin, and punning

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.180
is the other side.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.100
It's the same exact process.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:48.670
Now, am I arguing that punning
is a substitute for reason?

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:49.370
No.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:50.260
I'm not.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.630
But neither is reason a
substitute for imagination.

00:37:54.630 --> 00:38:01.420
And it's the willingness to
imagine that gives us a

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:07.220
destination that we can aim at
and pursue through reason.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.790
But were it not for the
imagination, we'd be sunk.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:17.150
And in this era of great
challenges, great global

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:22.170
challenges, imagination and
innovation are more

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.040
important than ever.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:31.330
So I would just say pun with
pride and remember that your

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:34.520
wordplay is always more
than semantics.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.770
Thank you.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.380
Any questions from anybody?

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.720
Comments?

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:48.970
Yes.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:55.832
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:55.832 --> 00:38:59.420
I was reading a book by Joel
Spolsky recently, and he said

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:03.630
that there's no place for puns
in software, especially user

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:06.220
interfaces where we're trying
to accommodate people who

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.450
might not know your language
as their first language.

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.290
They might be reading it in
a different language.

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:12.850
What are your thoughts on the
place of puns in software?

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:16.020
JOHN POLLACK: Well, I confess
that I fall into the category

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.480
of I like to click the
button yes or no.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:24.940
So I'm not an expert at software
by any stretch.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:33.900
I would say that punning is
very relevant meaning.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:41.880
And if you're writing software
or writing language, you are

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:46.710
using those as a tool
to communicate.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:52.220
And in law, you're trying to,
sometimes, eliminate the

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:56.910
possibility for confusion, or
you're trying to allow for

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.160
some gray area, some wiggle
room down the line, in a

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.350
contractor, per se.

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.680
And so I think punsters would
have a great advantage in

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.280
writing software, because you
would be able to see the

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.390
possibilities.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:09.640
And listen.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:15.880
Code is a creative process,
and coding

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.050
is a creative process.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:20.520
And so it's important to have
a spirit of play and

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.550
elasticity.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:23.890
If you didn't, it wouldn't
be any fun.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:25.060
Because there's elegance
in it.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.360
And sometimes there's
elegance in a pun.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.640
So I don't know if
that answers your

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.400
question, but, yes.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.760
AUDIENCE: So regarding your
time in Spain being the

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.450
Foreign Correspondent, did you
find that punning was similar

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:44.140
in Spanish media and also in the
Spanish language compared

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.940
to English?

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.030
And if not, then what were some
of the differences in the

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:49.810
way that they use the pun?

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.440
JOHN POLLACK: With all due
credit to my high school

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:56.800
Spanish teacher, Mr. Puente, I
wasn't great at Spanish when I

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.650
arrived in Spain, although
I had a good

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:01.280
grasp of the grammar.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.060
I do recall that when I finally
made a pun in Spanish,

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:10.320
which was like two years down
the line, I felt I am somehow

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.250
achieve cultural fluency,
even though it was a

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:13.500
poor version of it.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:20.860
Any language, Spanish included,
that has a tradition

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.110
of literature--

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.990
has puns in it and tends
to celebrate puns--

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:32.830
I couldn't comment specifically
on puns in

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.190
Spanish headlines, because I've
been reading them for a

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:40.830
long time, but my guess is
they're there, as well,

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:42.910
because they are throughout
Spanish literature.

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:47.250
Yes.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.160
AUDIENCE: Actually kind of
a follow-up to that.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.000
Do you think that the notion
of the pun being the lowest

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.580
form of humor is like an
American cultural thing?

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.670
And have you noticed any
differences around the world

00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:59.830
and how they're perceived?

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:02.870
JOHN POLLACK: Well, certain
cultures, as I mentioned,

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:04.270
esteem punning.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:08.300
And, as I mentioned, in the
Tzotzil speakers of the

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.760
Chiapas Highlands,
it's high honor.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.830
One of the interesting things
that I use the Ngram viewer

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:17.960
for, which lets you search
for phrases over time

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.710
in millions of books--

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:23.880
it actually came out after I
had finished my research on

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.620
"The Pun Also Rises" and I had
been trying to figure out,

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.190
pardon the pun, no pun intended,
when did these

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:31.150
phrases come into use?

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:34.090
Because then you could track of
the denigration of the pun,

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:35.360
the fall from grace.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.760
And I was relieved that I was
within 10 years, through old

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.220
fashioned bookwork, to
the Ngram viewer.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:45.090
But in answer to your question,
I think it varies by

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:49.010
culture, and it varies by time
because puns ebb and flow in

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.240
popularity.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:50.725
And--

00:42:50.725 --> 00:42:53.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:57.100
puns are unpopular
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.820
JOHN POLLACK: I can't comment
on the popularity of puns in

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:00.330
most of the world.

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:01.630
I will say this.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:07.310
Every major language group in
the world has puns in it, even

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:10.430
Pitjantjatjara, which is a
language in the Australian

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.950
Outback, has puns in it.

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:16.770
And with so many T's and J's,
that's a challenge.

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:18.630
But it's amazing.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:19.370
They're everywhere.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:23.450
So I would say that they're
popular it at least in every

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.760
major language family.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.330
Yes.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.490
AUDIENCE: How was Clinton at
punning without his writers?

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:31.970
He certainly plays with
meaning plenty.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:32.810
JOHN POLLACK: Yeah.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:37.440
Bill Clinton is great
with language.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.180
And I can say that my arrival at
the White House had little

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.050
impact on his speaking
ability.

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:46.680
It was great before I got there,
and it's great now.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.410
I did send him a copy of "The
Pun Also Rises." and he wrote

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:53.780
me a letter back with
a pun in it.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.320
And he said he was glad to see
that the world pun champion

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.550
had another title.

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.980
So I he can hold his own.

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.510
Any last questions?

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.360
We've got one more, here.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.340
AUDIENCE: I'm introducing
my four-year-old son to

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:11.810
"Animaniacs"--

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:15.010
sort of a high point for puns
in my entertainment.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:16.340
And he really struggles
with it.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.850
And he just misses
half the meaning.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:20.710
Do you feel that puns are unfair
to those with limited

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:23.200
language or English as
a second language?

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.060
Is that maybe part
of the reason

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.390
they're looked down upon?

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:29.030
JOHN POLLACK: I think
that puns are good

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.530
for learning language.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:39.150
And I would say that if you
look at riddles and

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:43.080
knock-knock jokes, which are
some of the earliest types of

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.280
humor that kids learn,
those are almost

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.540
always driven by puns.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.210
In fact, like, what's black and
white and read all over?

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:52.700
The newspaper.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.240
That's been bouncing around
since the middle of the 1800s.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:59.140
And so I would say
push the puns.

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:00.460
The puns are great.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:04.420
The whole idea is that
I think one of the

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.520
problems in our society--

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.670
and I certainly suffered from
this in my early schooling--

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:13.430
is that apart from watching
"Conjunction Junction," what's

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:20.180
your function, grammar and
language is seen as dry and

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:25.680
inflexible instead of an
incredibly elastic, playful

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.740
putty with which you can
do virtually anything.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:37.150
And so I would say puns are an
important learning tool to

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:40.810
look beyond the surface of what
somebody means and what

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:41.980
do they really mean.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:44.130
How do you bring in context?

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:46.670
What analogies are triggered?

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:50.055
And so good for you for
introducing your son to that.

00:45:50.055 --> 00:45:51.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:54.580
JOHN POLLACK: Well, if there
are no more questions, I

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.730
really want to thank you very
much for having me.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.340
It's an honor to be at Google.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.850
And I appreciate your
warm welcome.

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:02.100
And pun with pride.
