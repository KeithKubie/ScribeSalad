[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.280
VANESSA O'LOUGHLIN: So my name
is Vanessa Fox O'Loughlin,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.550
but I write under the
pen name Sam Blake,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.800
and that's for the very good
reason, as Natalia's just

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.970
discovered, O'Loughlin's quite
a hard name to pronounce.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.540
And obviously, it's
a very long name,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.123
and to fit it onto
the cover of a book

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:20.430
would be a bit of a challenge.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.390
So when I started writing,
my agent and I sat down,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.860
and we had a little
think about it,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.402
and we wanted to
work out a name that

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:27.770
would work internationally.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.800
So now I'm Sam Blake,
but I'm here today

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.090
as both, with both hats on.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.680
I'm here as Vanessa,
and I'm here

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.405
as Sam Blake, because I started
writing originally in 1999.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.030
I don't know how many
of you guys maybe

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.322
have always felt like maybe
you wanted to write a book.

00:00:43.322 --> 00:00:46.110
I think a lot of people do,
and I was one of those people.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.620
And I really had
that, sort of always

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.560
had that, feeling since
I was quite small.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.770
I really-- I'd write.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.930
I read a huge amount.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.970
And I sat down.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.530
My husband literally
went sailing

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.950
across the Atlantic in
1999 for eight weeks,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.310
and I was at home on my
own, long, dark winter

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.870
evenings because
it was November,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.020
and I had an idea for a book,
and I sat down and started

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.560
writing it.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.612
And this is back
a long time ago,

00:01:11.612 --> 00:01:13.070
before I could even
use a computer,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.858
so I was writing
it out longhand.

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:17.150
And I'd just started working
a job where I was starting

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.275
to learn to use a computer.

00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:20.000
It makes me sound
like a total dinosaur.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.060
I know, and now we're in
here in Google of all places,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.830
but started writing
it longhand, was

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.080
going into the office in the
evenings and the weekends

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.890
to write it up, and it was a
book called "The Poison Tree,"

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.872
and it featured a detective.

00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:34.580
I'm quite lucky that
my husband, in fact,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.310
works for the [INAUDIBLE],,
so I have an access into sort

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.660
of the police side of things,
and how that whole world works.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.560
And I had this idea, so I
literally just started writing.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.270
And I obviously
thought, because you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.150
do when it's your first book,
and actually, all your books,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.320
that it was amazing
because you just--

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.613
I think one of the key
things about writing

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:56.030
is that you need
to be optimistic,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.220
and you need to be positive.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.200
And you have to
believe in your book

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.950
because if you don't
believe in your book,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.420
who else is going
to believe in it?

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.295
And so, obviously, I
though it was fantastic,

00:02:05.295 --> 00:02:06.920
finished it, and
sent it out, made

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.543
the first absolute
cardinal error

00:02:08.543 --> 00:02:10.460
when it comes to writing
a book, literally put

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.010
the last full stop down and
then started sending it out,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.150
and I sent it everywhere.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.690
I sent it to agents and to
publishers all over the world,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.860
and it was rejected by
everybody all over the world,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.720
but it didn't really put me off.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.860
I kept going.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.300
I had an idea for a second book.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.320
And so while it was out there
being rejected, I kept going

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.645
and kept writing.

00:02:31.645 --> 00:02:33.770
Stephen King talks about,
in his book "On Writing,"

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.020
about his rejections
because rejection

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.030
is one of those things
that happens in writing.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.650
It happens a lot
in life, obviously,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.080
but it particularly
happens in writing,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.780
and Stephen King talks about
putting all his rejection

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.530
slips on a nail above
his desk in his book.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.563
I didn't keep mine.

00:02:49.563 --> 00:02:50.480
I didn't collect them.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.405
I didn't want to keep that
negative energy in one place,

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:55.280
so I had them scattered
all around the house.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.363
And I remember doing a
workshop a few years later,

00:02:57.363 --> 00:03:00.870
and somebody held up a slip
from one of the Irish publishing

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.370
houses.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.760
I thought, I've
got one of those.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.730
It's one of those to
add to the collection.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.890
But I kept going, kept writing.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.680
And I said one of the
things I knew I needed to do

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.050
was improve, and get
better, and learn

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.690
the techniques of
fiction writing, which

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.610
are really, really important.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.860
I don't think I really knew
that there were techniques

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.330
when I started writing.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.440
I knew-- we all learn
English in school.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.690
I did a degree in history.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.410
You know, I'd written
creatively for school essays

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.290
and my A-levels.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.030
I think my A-level essay was
about bees, and so you know,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.030
you think you can do it.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.530
You read.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.682
Obviously, everybody reads,
so you keep on going,

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.640
but I didn't really
realize that actually there

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.070
were things that would actually
make the fiction better.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.570
And I did a workshop
down in Dingle

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.290
with a lady called Judy Parsons,
and that workshop really

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.000
helped me hugely
because it really

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.470
proved to me that I could
write and people, you know,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.430
my peers, and other writers,
said, oh yeah, you actually do

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.690
know what you're doing.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.570
But it also showed me
what I didn't know,

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.950
and how much I
needed to improve,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.720
and how much I needed to learn.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.870
And that's really how InkWell
came about and probably

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.130
how I got to where I am now.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.050
So I set up--

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.820
I wanted to do workshops.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.770
I wanted to do more workshops.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.540
The weekend that Judy
Parsons, as I said,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.610
was down in Dingle,
and to get there,

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.620
I had to fly my
parents in from the UK.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.000
I had two small children then.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.610
I had to do frozen
stuff in the fridge.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.260
I had do all the
notes, the whole lot,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.100
so it was a major
operation getting away,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.512
and that really
wasn't an option.

00:04:24.512 --> 00:04:25.970
And with my husband
working shifts,

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.190
I couldn't get out
to an evening class

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.982
so I was looking
at this problem.

00:04:29.982 --> 00:04:31.690
You know, I needed to
learn how to write,

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.773
couldn't take any classes.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:33.620
What would I do?

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.060
I decided I'd start my own.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.150
So I got in touch a friend of
mine who is a writer and said,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.205
look, I've had this idea.

00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:41.330
You know, there must be
other people out there that

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.560
want to do one-day intensive
fiction writing workshops,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.900
and she put me in touch
with some authors.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.320
And because I was working in
event management at the time,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.060
I was able to sort of bring
all those skills into play,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.450
and I set up something called
InkWell, which started off

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.570
literally as one-day workshops.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.625
And my original plan was to
do workshops on a Saturday

00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:05.000
because that's when you're
free, or most people are free,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.120
and all day, and they
would just be once a month.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.370
And they would be just once
a month during the winter

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.620
because my kids are
off during the summer,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.120
and, obviously, in Ireland we
had very long school holidays.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.650
So I wanted to make sure these--

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.540
I mean, these workshops were
absolutely, completely geared

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.040
to me.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.470
They were geared to me
learning how to write better.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.700
And it turned out, once I
got them up and running,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.440
and I found a hotel, and
I got my method sorted out

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.140
because I think it's really
important when you are learning

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.935
anything, and when you're
in that type of environment,

00:05:32.935 --> 00:05:34.810
that you bond with the
person who's speaking.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.940
So I always made sure that I had
two speakers at every workshop

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.160
because if you don't bond
with one of those people,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.430
it can ruin the day for you.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.670
And so for me, it's very
important to get that mix.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.790
So I got my mix working,
and it turned out

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.800
that I wasn't the only
person in this situation,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.550
that actually an awful
lot of other people

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.730
wanted to do the same
thing, and InkWell

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:53.960
became hugely successful.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.190
I built a huge network.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.258
I had people coming from
Switzerland and India.

00:05:57.258 --> 00:05:59.050
I had people coming
from the UK, obviously,

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.810
because it's nice and close,
to come to these workshops.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.670
I always used best
selling authors

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.360
because I'm a great believer
that you don't lick it

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.860
off a stone.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.960
If you get to be a best seller,
there's a good reason for it.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.340
And so that's really
how InkWell started.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.370
And all the while I was
doing the workshops,

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.240
obviously, I was learning
how to write better myself.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.240
I think I've probably sat
through more workshops

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.530
than most people living
because I've been to them all,

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.680
and I sit in the
back taking notes.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.240
And I kept going,
and then I discovered

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.380
that the writing.ie domain
was available, and I thought,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.980
this is great.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.920
I have this newsletter
that I was sending out

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.030
to my InkWell people,
my InkWell writers,

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.083
and in each newsletter
that went out,

00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:39.750
I'd talk about competitions, and
festivals, and different things

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.375
that were happening and what was
going on in the writing world.

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:43.790
And every single
time I sent it--

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.132
literally, I'd press Send,
somebody would get it,

00:06:46.132 --> 00:06:48.090
and they'd go, oh, did
you know about this one?

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.440
Did you know about this one?

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.450
I'd literally get three or four
emails straight back saying,

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.260
ooh, did you know about these?

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.840
And I didn't, and
I thought, well,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.298
if I'm the person who's supposed
to be trying to coordinate

00:06:55.298 --> 00:06:57.470
this information. and I
don't know what's going on,

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.780
then how does anybody else
out in the country know

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.040
what's going on?

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.490
And there was really, at
that point, no central point

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.990
for literary
information in Ireland,

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.490
even though we are this
amazing literary nation.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.860
We've got Man Booker winners.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.280
We've got Nobel laureates.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.040
We're a fantastic
storytelling nation,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.540
but there wasn't
that central point,

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.170
so I discovered the writing.ie
domain was available

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.110
and literally put the InkWell
newsletter into a website

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.342
and created writing.ie.

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:24.050
It's still going.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.490
It's an online magazine.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.060
We update daily
with information.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.060
It's got features in it.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.640
It's got competitions,
just everything really,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.760
me, as an aspiring
writer, wanted to learn

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.230
and wanted to know about has
gone into writing.ie now.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.610
And I love meeting writers
and them saying, you know,

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.430
I read writing.ie.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.190
It still amazes me.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.690
It amazed me when
Donal Ryan told me

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.160
that he goes there
every morning,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.200
and his wife has to
tell them to get off it.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.120
That's real reward.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.938
And so while all these
things are going on,

00:07:52.938 --> 00:07:54.980
one of the things that
was happening with InkWell

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.805
was that, obviously, a recession
hit Ireland, and literally

00:07:58.805 --> 00:08:00.680
the bottom fell out of
my business overnight.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.490
So the workshop side of the
business completely collapsed.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.600
They were quite high-end.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.530
They weren't cheap, and it
was one of those moments,

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.350
for anybody who's worked in
a small business will know,

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.558
that there are moments when--

00:08:13.558 --> 00:08:15.725
I think in venture capitalism
they call it pivoting,

00:08:15.725 --> 00:08:18.140
but it's that moment where
you go, it's not working.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.610
We need to re-think this.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.970
And so one of the things that
happened literally that night,

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.100
when I realized there
was no more business,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.657
was that I looked at all
the things I'd been doing,

00:08:28.657 --> 00:08:30.240
and all the workshops
I'd been giving,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.206
and the things that were
really working in the company.

00:08:33.206 --> 00:08:34.789
And one of the things
that was working

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.039
was the scouting side of it.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.840
I had built lots
of relationships

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.363
with publishers, lots of
relationships with editors.

00:08:41.363 --> 00:08:43.780
And all the way along the line,
I was meeting new authors,

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.513
and they had new
manuscripts, and I was really

00:08:46.513 --> 00:08:47.430
enjoying meeting them.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.040
But I also discovered that
I was quite good at spotting

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.162
the successful ones, and
so I was sending them out

00:08:51.162 --> 00:08:53.120
to publishers, and they
were getting published.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.080
I was sending them
out to agents,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.440
and they were getting picked up.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.815
And so basically, I formalized
that side of the business.

00:08:57.815 --> 00:08:59.810
I could see that's
where we needed to go,

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.420
so I became a literary scout.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.580
I formalized the arrangements
with various agents

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.470
that I work with in the UK.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.930
I brought on board a whole
lot of different authors

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.930
from different genres who
were able to give people

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:12.710
readers reports.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.200
One of the things that happened
to me through this process

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.983
was that I'd met an editor, and
she quite liked the the book

00:09:18.983 --> 00:09:20.400
that I was writing
on at the time,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.730
and it was probably book
number three at that stage.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:27.410
And she'd sent it
out to her readers,

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.410
and those readers had given
me feedback on my work,

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.267
and it was enormously useful.

00:09:32.267 --> 00:09:34.100
One of the problems of
being a writer-- it's

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.990
very easy as a scout
to read somebody's work

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.730
and be able to see exactly
what you need to do with it.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:38.880
And as an editor, that--

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.380
I say easy.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.410
It isn't easy, but you know,
you can see what needs fixing.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.300
With your own work, you
can't see it at all.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.730
You can't see.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.400
It's so bizarre.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.960
I think it's because
when you write

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.610
you have the images
in your head,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.530
and my job is to take
the images from my head

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.030
and turn them into
words on the page

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.050
so they reform as
images in your head.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.803
But because I can
see the picture,

00:09:56.803 --> 00:09:58.220
I might have
forgotten to tell you

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.483
that Fred Bloggs that just
walked in the back door

00:10:01.483 --> 00:10:03.900
has only got one leg because
I know he's only got one leg,

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.233
but if I haven't put that on
the page, you can't see it.

00:10:06.233 --> 00:10:11.000
So that, from a writer's
perspective, is a tricky one.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.430
So what writers need
is people to help,

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.150
is people to read their work.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.922
And so I have a
lot of authors now

00:10:16.922 --> 00:10:19.130
who work for me who do what
we call reader's reports.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.810
So they will read
a finished book,

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.580
and they will look at the plot
development, and the character

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.410
development, all of
those important things,

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.410
and help an author move
it along and bring it up

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.540
to the next level.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.540
So that's sort of how the
publishing consultancy

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.090
side grew literally as
a result of the bottom

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:36.890
falling out of the business
and is now very successful.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.793
And really, the
literary scouting side

00:10:38.793 --> 00:10:39.710
is what brought me on.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.110
So while I'm building
the businesses

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.360
and doing these various bits
and pieces, I kept writing,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.130
and I think it's absolutely
essential for people,

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.110
or for everybody--

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.193
I mean, literally the best
advice I was ever given

00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:53.450
was, just keep writing.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.950
Samuel Beckett said,
you know, fail.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:55.820
Fail better.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.530
Just keep on
failing, and I think

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.150
that's what it's all about.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.000
It's improving, and
improving, and improving.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.887
Malcolm Gladwell talks
about 10,000 hours.

00:11:04.887 --> 00:11:07.220
You know that you need to hit
that 10,000 hours in order

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.020
to reach the tipping
point, and that is so true,

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.580
and it's true in writing as much
as it is in everything else.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.650
So I kept going.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.010
I was busy writing away.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.720
And one morning I had coffee.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.470
I was having coffee
with one of the agents

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.973
I work with in London,
and we'd found a book--

00:11:25.973 --> 00:11:27.890
I'd found book, sent it
to him, and he sold it

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.190
for a lot of money, and he's
a very successful agent.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.840
And we were sitting down,
having a little cup of coffee

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.257
in Covent Garden, and I had a
book with me on the counter,

00:11:37.257 --> 00:11:39.673
and it was a book by a friend
of mine called Alex Barclay.

00:11:39.673 --> 00:11:41.540
It was a proof copy
of one of her books.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.545
And he said, oh, you're
reading Alex Barclay.

00:11:43.545 --> 00:11:45.420
I said, oh yes, she's
been really influential

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.590
on my writing because in
fact-- this is a trade secret--

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.108
I'd completely stolen Alex
Barclay's system of plotting

00:11:51.108 --> 00:11:53.400
and planning because she has
it worked out beautifully,

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.590
and I literally have taken .

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.810
She taught me how to do
it, and that's what I use.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:01.250
So he said, oh, you know,
you're reading her, and I said,

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:02.310
yeah, very influential.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.560
And he said, oh, do you write?

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.935
And somewhere in the midst of
things-- one of the things,

00:12:05.935 --> 00:12:08.715
I think, certainly for me,
and probably for the people

00:12:08.715 --> 00:12:11.090
that wear lots of different
hats in different businesses,

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.565
is that it's quite difficult for
you to understand what you do.

00:12:14.565 --> 00:12:16.190
So sometimes I'm a
literary consultant.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.580
Sometimes I'm a website
managing person.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.850
Sometimes I'm an author.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.103
I'm also the chair
of Irish PEN, and I

00:12:23.103 --> 00:12:24.270
do lots of different things.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.900
And this Simon Trewin,
who is my agent now,

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.680
hadn't grasped, obviously,
the most important bit,

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.620
which was the writing.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.278
So he said to me, what
are you working on?

00:12:34.278 --> 00:12:36.070
And I said, well, I'm
working on this book.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.362
It's called-- It wasn't called
"The Little Bones" then.

00:12:38.362 --> 00:12:41.450
It was called "The
Dressmaker," and it's

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.010
about the bones of
a baby turning up

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.177
in the hem of a wedding
dress, and the detective who

00:12:45.177 --> 00:12:46.850
has to find out what happens.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.710
And he wen, oh, I'd
like to see that,

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.350
and I had one of those
moments of total paralysis

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.690
because this is this
massive agent in London.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.660
He works for a huge company.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.460
They're a Hollywood
talent agency,

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.250
and he wants to see my
writing, which sounds

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.570
amazing, brilliant opportunity.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.230
But then, as a scout, I'm
thinking, if I sent in my work,

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.950
and he absolutely hates it, I've
completely shot myself in foot.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.908
I mean, it's-- what
happens if it's a disaster?

00:13:11.908 --> 00:13:14.450
It's like, OK, yes, I can find
other people's, but I actually

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.598
can't write myself, but
I'm under this illusion

00:13:16.598 --> 00:13:17.390
that perhaps I can.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:20.750
So I had one of those moments
of oh my god, literally.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.540
But fortunately, we
had a happy ending

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.720
because he did I like it.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.990
I read the book right the
way through the next day,

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.160
and I'm getting an
email saying, you

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.090
know, when are you sending it?

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.140
When are you sending it?

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.170
And eventually, I did send it,
and thank god he did like it.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.540
And even better, he was able to
sell it, which is also a bonus.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.178
So the first book came out in--

00:13:38.178 --> 00:13:39.470
I've never forgotten the year--

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.620
2016, I think, "Little
Bones," and that

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.760
is the story of the baby's bones
in the hem of a wedding dress.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.780
And that story really came
about because Stephen King talks

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.760
in his book "On Writing,"
which for anybody

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.660
who is interested in writing
and wants to go that way,

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.400
it's absolutely the Bible.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.130
It is the best book possibly
ever written on writing.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.250
It's fantastic, and every
single published author I know

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.170
has it on their shelf.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.200
So in that book, he
talks about great story

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.330
being the collision of
two unrelated ideas,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.490
how he talks about
how with his books

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.850
how two completely separate
ideas came together and created

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.822
a new idea, created
the story, and that's

00:14:18.822 --> 00:14:20.780
really what happened to
me with "Little Bones."

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:26.400
I'd seen an RTE documentary
years ago about a serving girl,

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.580
or a girl who I thought
was a serving girl.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.030
As it turned out, she
worked in a rubber factory

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.863
when I went to go do
the investigation-- who

00:14:31.863 --> 00:14:34.730
had left Ireland in the 1930s,
and she'd gone to the UK

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.380
because she was
pregnant, and she

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.000
wanted to hide the pregnancy.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.060
And she found herself living
in the landlady's house,

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.318
and working in a factory,
and unable to cope

00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:45.110
with the situation.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.027
And what happened to her
was that she actually

00:14:47.027 --> 00:14:49.235
had the baby in the middle
of the night in a room

00:14:49.235 --> 00:14:51.110
that she shared with
the 12-year-old daughter

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.910
of her landlady.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.630
And obviously, you can imagine
the state that she was in.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.700
She went to the bathroom
to sort herself out,

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.890
and when she came back,
the baby wasn't breathing.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.320
So she wrapped the baby up,
I now know, in a blue dress

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.690
because I went to find
all the court details,

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.580
and she put the baby
into a suitcase,

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.090
and put it under her
bed, and went back

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.230
to Ireland at Christmas.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.490
It is just before Christmas--
went back to Ireland

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.200
at Christmas to
talk to her priest.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.900
And in that time
that she was away,

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.570
the baby's body was
discovered, and she

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.320
was one of the last
people to be convicted

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.360
of infanticide in the UK.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.370
And for some reason, this just--

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.550
I call them light bulb moments,
when you see something,

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.050
or you hear
something, or you can

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.060
be at Tesco's looking in
somebody's basket, or overhear

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.310
something on the train, and
you get this little light bulb

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.540
moment.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.165
You say, oh, that's
really interesting,

00:15:36.165 --> 00:15:39.440
and this thing stuck with
me, the baby, the suitcase

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.640
under the bed.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.970
And then I was driving back
from the airport then a few--

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.770
10 years later, I
think, possibly--

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.050
and I put on the
radio, and RTE had

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.740
a documentary about a chap
who had written a play called

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.020
"The Country
Dressmaker," and his play

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.120
was one of the plays
saved the Abbey

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:01.730
Theater from total
disaster, and he had died.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.530
He was a very, very
successful playwright,

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:08.000
but he died destitute in a
little room up in Cable Street

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.350
in Dublin.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.320
And what he'd done is
he'd left all his plays

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.500
in a suitcase on his bed,
and it was the suitcases

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.510
that connected in my mind.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.305
And this is a few years ago now
when I started working on it,

00:16:20.305 --> 00:16:22.430
before they built the M50,
and there were, I think,

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.290
32 sets of traffic
lights between my house

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.380
and the airport, so
it was a long drive.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.460
And on that long
drive, by the time

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.970
I got home, I had been thinking
about dresses, been thinking

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.210
about dressmakers, been thinking
about unplanned pregnancies,

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:39.230
and I'd come up with the idea
that perhaps the girl, Mabel--

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.740
Agnes Regan I think her name was
in England, the one thing she

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.180
wanted was a wedding dress.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.422
And so by the time
I arrived home,

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:48.380
the bones were in the
hem of the wedding dress.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.710
Now, I didn't know until I was
2/3 the way through that book

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:52.907
how they actually got there.

00:16:52.907 --> 00:16:53.990
I knew they were in there.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.573
I had a really clear
impression of it.

00:16:55.573 --> 00:16:59.190
I had the people starting to
map, sketch out in my head,

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.887
but I didn't really know
how they'd got there at all.

00:17:01.887 --> 00:17:04.220
And it wasn't until I started
writing a piece of witness

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.275
testimony in the
book that I realized,

00:17:07.275 --> 00:17:09.950
and I remember emailing Alex
Barclay, back to Alex Barclay,

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.867
I know why the bones are
in the wedding dress,

00:17:11.867 --> 00:17:13.240
and she's like, yes.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.230
And it's funny, when
you write crime,

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.910
you have to plot to
a certain extent.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.030
You have to plan to a
certain extent because

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:21.223
of all the things.

00:17:21.223 --> 00:17:22.640
You know, plots
are quite twisted.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.765
For any of you who've read
"No Turning Back," which

00:17:24.765 --> 00:17:27.310
is the most recent Sam Blake,
it's quite a complex plot.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.810
There's two or three different
storylines going on in there,

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.540
and making sure that those
things dovetail together,

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.140
and that the right bits are
left in the right places

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.490
is part of that
plotting process.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.990
And as I say, I've stolen Alex
Barclay's system of plotting,

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:43.580
so I use columns across a
page and make my notes in it

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.810
as I go along.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.880
But often with writing, and
most importantly with writing,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.550
is allowing the characters
to breathe on the page

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.690
and allowing them
to speak to you.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.810
And when they do, when
they take over the story,

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.270
and when they start to do things
that you don't necessarily

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.687
expect, that's when the story
is really, really happening,

00:18:01.687 --> 00:18:03.437
and that's what happened
in "Little Bones"

00:18:03.437 --> 00:18:05.110
when I found out
about the bones.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.252
And in fact, in "No Turning
Back," the ending of,

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:08.960
the original ending,
in "No Turning Back"

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.080
was totally different.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.497
There was a
different-- everything

00:18:11.497 --> 00:18:15.380
was different about it, and
it didn't feel quite right.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.260
I'm a great believer
that when you

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.090
write you're using
your subconscious mind,

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.480
and I remember Joseph
O'Connor at an event I was at

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.840
was talking about how the
characters sort of float

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.060
in ether above your head a bit.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.290
And as a writer, you're
sort of channeling them.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.032
It's a very strange process,
but it is a bit like that.

00:18:35.032 --> 00:18:36.740
It's like they're all
actually out there,

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.690
that every character
in every book

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.790
is actually floating
around out there somewhere,

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.373
and they're just waiting to find
the person to channel through

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:44.790
to tell their story.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:49.550
And so certainly when you find
Cat Connolly, the detective,

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.590
she came to me pretty
much fully-formed,

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.390
kickboxing detective.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:58.730
And with the various stories,
your subconscious mind

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.170
is the thing that really works.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.450
And if you're going
wrong, or people

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.220
talk about writer's
block a lot, I really

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.762
believe that writer's block is
your subconscious mind putting

00:19:06.762 --> 00:19:07.707
the brakes on.

00:19:07.707 --> 00:19:09.290
And certainly in my
second book, which

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.050
is called "In Deep Water," I
got stuck writing that about 2/3

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.540
of the way through, even though
I had my plot worked out,

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.200
and my plans, and
all the rest of it,

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.420
and I realized I'd gone wrong.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.695
And then when I went back to fix
the bit where I'd gone wrong,

00:19:21.695 --> 00:19:23.570
I realized it had actually
gone wrong earlier

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.330
than that even, so there
were two twists in it that

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.650
were wrong.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.840
And I think it's understanding
that's really important.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.020
So for anybody who
is writing and does

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.423
find that they
get stuck, there's

00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:35.840
usually a very
good reason for it.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.882
As I was coming in here
in the dark this morning,

00:19:37.882 --> 00:19:39.800
I'm just starting a
new book, and it's

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.320
about some terrorist
stuff happening in London,

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.078
and I've just realized that
the reason that's not working

00:19:46.078 --> 00:19:47.370
is there's something a bit off.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.770
I hadn't been able to
work out what it was,

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:49.820
and I think I've got
my chemistry wrong.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.490
So I was texting my daughter on
the train coming in and saying,

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.323
do you know anybody
who's good at chemistry?

00:19:54.323 --> 00:19:56.767
I need to check my chemicals.

00:19:56.767 --> 00:19:58.850
So that, I think that's a
really, really important

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:02.600
element to understand,
but one of the key things

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.410
with writing--

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.230
I suppose with
anything in life--

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:10.170
is to just embrace it,
enjoy it, and to try,

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:11.670
and try, certainly
for new writers,

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.170
to get to the end
of the manuscript.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.330
That's really, really
important to try and write

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.610
that first draft right
the way through to the end

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:18.690
because very often--

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.570
and this is, I suppose, the
scout end of things speaking--

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.985
the first three chapters
of the manuscript

00:20:23.985 --> 00:20:26.110
aren't really the first
three chapters of the book.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:28.318
They're not the first three
chapters you, the reader,

00:20:28.318 --> 00:20:31.290
will necessarily see
because it takes a while

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.767
to get into the story,
and so quite often it

00:20:33.767 --> 00:20:35.350
can be-- especially
with a new writer,

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.433
it can take a while for
you to get into the story.

00:20:37.433 --> 00:20:39.330
And I know, certainly,
"Little Bones"

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.980
had a whole long prologue.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.420
There's a bit--
it's now-- there's

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.610
one paragraph in
the start of "Little

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.760
Bones" in the first chapter,
where an artist called Zoe

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.370
talks about this piece of
work that she's working on,

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.257
and her family, and
things like that,

00:20:52.257 --> 00:20:53.340
and that was the prologue.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.980
That was 2 and 1/2
thousand words,

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.630
but it was something
I needed to write

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.465
to find my way into the
story, but it wasn't something

00:21:00.465 --> 00:21:02.090
that you necessarily
all needed to read

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.048
so that has ended up now
down as one paragraph,

00:21:04.048 --> 00:21:05.590
but it's just very interesting.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.800
One of the absolute
crucial things,

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.570
I suppose, to
understand but also

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:13.140
to know as a writer is that it's
the reshaping and the rewriting

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.110
of the manuscript which is
the bit that makes it happen.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.123
Once you get the story
down, you lay it down.

00:21:18.123 --> 00:21:20.040
It can be a bit of a
muddle; it can be a mess;

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.360
bits can not work, but
it's really that reshaping.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.000
It's the editing,
it's the rewriting,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.350
that is absolutely crucial
to making it into something

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.490
that people want to read.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.550
So how are we doing
for time, Natalia?

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:33.690
Are we-- we're good?

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:40.800
So I suppose one of the
key things as well in terms

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.810
of crime writing is plot,
but at the same time,

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.660
there's character, which
is absolutely essential.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.190
Unless you have good characters,
why would you want to read on?

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.810
So plot-- plot is
very, very important.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.750
Those two unrelated
ideas are absolutely

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:00.330
essential to try and
bring them together,

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:01.860
but story is all
about character,

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.440
and you need to be able to
empathize and really love

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.570
that character in order
to want to read the story.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.550
Because as an author,
I'm asking you

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:10.525
not only to part with
your cash to buy my book,

00:22:10.525 --> 00:22:12.900
but I'm asking you to part
with that sort of six or seven

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.880
hours of your time, and
that's an important contract.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.890
So in order to deliver a
story and to deliver something

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.420
that makes you want to
keep turning those pages,

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.420
character is absolutely
vital, and understanding

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.450
your characters and knowing them
is really, really important.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.410
And characters change.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:29.130
They develop.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.360
They can develop while
you're writing the book.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.107
I was blessed with Cat Connolly
because she came fully formed.

00:22:34.107 --> 00:22:35.940
And one of the things
about writing a series

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.962
is that when you go
back to the next story,

00:22:37.962 --> 00:22:40.170
it's a bit like going to
meet your friends in the pub

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.760
because you know them so well.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.680
You know what they're going to
say, and it's sort of the cast,

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.930
if you like, is already there.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.370
So it's a bit like writing
a sitcom, isn't, where

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.040
you know everybody already?

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.040
And then you just have
to apply the story.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.648
So writing a series is fantastic
from a writer's point of view

00:22:55.648 --> 00:22:57.690
because you can really
get into the sort plotting

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.482
end of things.

00:22:58.482 --> 00:23:00.690
And I think, I'm hoping, I
get better with each book,

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.398
and I think "No Turning
Back" is probably

00:23:02.398 --> 00:23:04.740
one of the best so far,
but literally the book

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.548
I've just written, and
hopefully will be coming out

00:23:07.548 --> 00:23:09.090
towards the end of
this year or early

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.100
next year, is a whole new cast.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.620
It's a standalone,
and so that meant

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.930
a whole new set of
characters, a whole new story.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.693
It's about two women
who meet on a plane

00:23:18.693 --> 00:23:20.610
and discover that they
have men in their lives

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.760
who aren't doing everything
they should for them

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.370
and that they can help each
other out a bit to right

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:31.210
the wrongs, and that's a
whole new set of people.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.067
And again, it's
developing those people.

00:23:34.067 --> 00:23:35.150
It's getting to know them.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.320
It's knowing their
background and names,

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.507
where they come from, all of
the things that make you you.

00:23:40.507 --> 00:23:42.090
And I think for
anybody who's writing,

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.632
I always think one of those--
you know when you meet somebody

00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:46.920
for the first time, and
you form-- we talk about,

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.420
psychologists always
talk about, you

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.380
form an opinion in the first
30 seconds of meeting somebody.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.380
What is it that you see?

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.370
You maybe see the hair.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.020
You see what color
jumper they're wearing.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.395
You might make assumptions
about them from their footwear

00:23:57.395 --> 00:23:59.640
if you're a Sherlock
Holmes fanatic.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.895
He was always looking
at people's shoes.

00:24:01.895 --> 00:24:04.270
And they're the impressions
that you form of a character,

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:08.722
so it's very important when,
certainly for me as a writer,

00:24:08.722 --> 00:24:10.180
to get a feel for
those characters,

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.347
to know what they look like.

00:24:11.347 --> 00:24:13.760
I use storyboards, and I
go around the internet,

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.510
and I go to magazines,
and I find pictures

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.480
of the characters, the people
who look like the people who

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.070
are in my head,
and they can come

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.580
from all sorts of
strange places.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.747
There's some poor guy from
New York who's on Tinder,

00:24:23.747 --> 00:24:26.247
and I'm not allowed to use to
Tinder because, obviously, I'm

00:24:26.247 --> 00:24:28.542
happily married, but who I
found on a Google search who

00:24:28.542 --> 00:24:30.750
is the spit of one of my
characters in the next book,

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.040
so he's up there too.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.470
So they can come from
anywhere, and it's just

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.938
like a private
reference point for me.

00:24:36.938 --> 00:24:39.480
And I find that really useful,
particularly because I'm busy,

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.605
because I'm working, and
I'm doing the various bits

00:24:41.605 --> 00:24:43.320
and pieces with
the running InkWell

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.580
and helping new writers all the
time, and moving around a lot.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.190
I don't get to write
every single day.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.360
I mean, writers talk
about writing every day

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.030
and that that's
really important,

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.160
but it's not always feasible.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.990
I try and write
as often as I can

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.492
and try and stay
in the story, but I

00:24:59.492 --> 00:25:01.200
find storyboards are
really useful for me

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.110
because I've got a visual
representation of who everybody

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.440
is, and I stick that--

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.110
I make a big A3, and
partly it's procrastination

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:11.130
because I think as an
author, when you start off

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.310
with a story, and you've got
this big blank thing in front

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.800
of you, you spend a lot of time
not actually writing anything

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.470
and just knowing that you
should be doing something,

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.910
but anyway, I spent a lot
time making storyboards.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.470
And I put it on
my desk, and that

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.553
means that those characters
are calling out to me.

00:25:23.553 --> 00:25:26.240
So whatever else I'm doing,
that those people are there

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.410
looking at me and literally
saying, come, tell my story,

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.610
and I really, really find
that a really useful part

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.660
of the process.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.990
So will we go to questions?

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:41.300
AUDIENCE: From the perspective
of an unpublished writer,

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.120
everything looks
really, really bad.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.490
The first question is,
how do you actually

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.892
stop writing because every time
you're finished with your draft

00:25:49.892 --> 00:25:51.350
it kind of looks
good, but then you

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.720
read a book, like you
read a really good book,

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.572
and you look at your
draft, and it's awful?

00:25:55.572 --> 00:25:56.780
You start rewriting it again.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.980
It never stops.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.480
You send it to an editor.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.323
Editor gives you
back the comments.

00:26:01.323 --> 00:26:02.240
You've worked on them.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.460
The draft looks good, but
then you look again at it

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.540
in a month's time.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.460
It's awful again.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.540
And the second
question is, given

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.280
the first writing--
like everyone

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.850
says their first
writing is awful.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.550
It's fine, like you need to
improve and work on that.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.340
What do you do with
your first drafts?

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.540
Do you just touch them off?

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.510
Is there any reason
to self-publish those?

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:30.032
Is there any reason to send
them to magazines or whatever?

00:26:30.032 --> 00:26:31.740
Like what do you do
with the first drafts

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:35.375
that you know in your heart--
like those are your children.

00:26:35.375 --> 00:26:36.500
You've worked on them for--

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.120
VANESSA O'LOUGHLIN:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.180
AUDIENCE: --such a long time.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:38.980
What do you do with them?

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.340
VANESSA O'LOUGHLIN: OK.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.850
AUDIENCE: How do
you give them up?

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.730
VANESSA O'LOUGHLIN: I think the
first thing is to try and work

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:47.280
on your book until you can't
see anything else wrong with it,

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.280
until you get to a point--
yes, because that is,

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.530
the whole process is, that
every time you go back,

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.420
and you see something
else you want to fix.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.370
So keep working on it, and
it might be a long process.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.240
I mean, I said I
started writing in 1999.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.460
It took me 15 years
now to actually

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:06.070
get a deal, now with five books
later, but it was a long time,

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.945
and the best advice I was ever
given was, just keep writing.

00:27:08.945 --> 00:27:11.570
You only get better-- going back
to Malcolm Gladwell-- you only

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.263
get better through writing,
and you only find your voice

00:27:14.263 --> 00:27:14.930
through writing.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.480
Writing, also
publishing, is always

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.940
looking for what's called
voice, unique voice.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.410
We don't need
another JK Rowling.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:22.530
[INAUDIBLE] we
don't need another--

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.640
well, we'd love to have other
JK Rowling, and another Stephen

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.330
King, but do you
know what I mean?

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.497
We've already got one, so
we don't need another one,

00:27:27.497 --> 00:27:30.040
so finding your voice
and your unique voice

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.960
is really important, and
you only do that, literally,

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.070
through putting
words on the page.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.210
So in terms of drafts,
the rewriting is vital.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.170
That polishing process is vital.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.425
I think you have to just keep
on going until you cannot see

00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:45.050
anything else that
needs to be changed,

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.090
when you get to the point where
you just don't know what else

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:48.710
you can do to it
to make it better.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.490
And that can be a
long, long time.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.800
It could be 10 drafts later.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.190
I mean, I'm on, what,
published book four now.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:57.740
I've just finished and
I'm onto the next one.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.065
I've written probably four
or five complete books

00:28:00.065 --> 00:28:01.940
before that, so I'm
looking at having written

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.140
nine books of 100,000 words
each, and I still, on the book

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.510
I've just sent
in, its draft six.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:12.277
So that drafting process is
vital all the way through.

00:28:12.277 --> 00:28:14.485
So when you get to the point
where can't say anymore,

00:28:14.485 --> 00:28:16.152
or you don't know
what else to do to it,

00:28:16.152 --> 00:28:20.690
then is an opportunity
to get professional help

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:22.940
and see if you can get
somebody like an editor to read

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.740
it and try and improve it.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.290
If you get to the point then
where you think it's done,

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:28.940
it's ready to go,
it's at that point,

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.910
then, send it out, absolutely,
to publishers, to agents,

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.380
and see how you get on with it.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.120
The thing with self-publishing--

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.790
self-publishing is wonderful
because you can actually

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.560
find-- you can get out there.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.780
You can get books out
there, those drafts.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.070
At the end of the day,
there's an awful lot

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.987
of writers in the world,
and there are only so

00:28:44.987 --> 00:28:46.440
many books that
can be published,

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.750
and so there's always
going to be more writers

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.970
than there are people with
the capacity to publish,

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:51.840
so I think self-publishing
is amazing.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.890
I know some people have been
incredibly successful at it.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.830
The key is that you
need to see it as a job,

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.395
and approach it
very professionally,

00:28:59.395 --> 00:29:01.520
and understand that the
marketing, and the editing,

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.920
and the cover needs to be
to professional standards

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.877
because you're competing
with published books

00:29:06.877 --> 00:29:08.960
out there on the shelf,
so it's all about learning

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.943
that whole process.

00:29:10.943 --> 00:29:12.110
So self-publishing is great.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.150
Yes, absolutely,
if you send it out,

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.300
and you can't land an agent,
and you can't land a publishing

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.460
deal with it necessarily,
Absolutely self-publish.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.668
I self-published of my books.

00:29:20.668 --> 00:29:22.850
I wrote a romance, romance-y.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.970
It wasn't really crime, sort
of dark romance-y thing called

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:26.900
"True Colors."

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.040
And I'd had another agent a long
time ago, and she sent it out,

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.175
and I got what we
call rave rejections.

00:29:33.175 --> 00:29:34.550
Self-publishers--
well, everybody

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.592
calls them rave rejections,
where somebody-- they

00:29:36.592 --> 00:29:39.385
love your book, but nobody
can find a place for it,

00:29:39.385 --> 00:29:41.510
or they're not actually
quite in position to buy it

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.750
even though they love it.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:45.230
And I felt that that
was a great book,

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:48.150
and I decided, I'll get it out
there and to see, absolutely,

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.040
self-publish it too.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.040
So there's-- and there's
different-- these days,

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.780
there are different
routes for writers,

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.190
so you can be a hybrid writer.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.780
You can do both.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.250
So absolutely, send it out.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.850
Work on it till you
can not see any more

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.380
things that can be improved.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.780
Then get professional help.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.180
Then send it out.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.060
If you're still not gelling
with that particular book,

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.890
then absolutely look
at self-publishing it.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.140
The key with self-publishing
is that, again, as I say,

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.057
you're competing with
the published books that

00:30:15.057 --> 00:30:17.280
are out there, so it
needs to be of the highest

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.950
possible standard
that you can get it,

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:22.370
and you can't take
back negative reviews.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.860
If it goes out on Amazon, and
we haven't had it proofread,

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.510
and there's masses
of typos in it,

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.860
somebody's going to tell you,
and you can't change that.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.777
So it's really important
to be as professional

00:30:31.777 --> 00:30:34.830
as you can about it, but
it's an exciting world.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.460
And one of the most exciting
things about writing

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.560
is the fact that it-- you
know, can do anything.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.840
You don't know where
it's going to take you.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.130
Publishing is always looking
for something original,

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.505
and it's looking
for a new voice.

00:30:46.505 --> 00:30:48.840
It's looking for a new concept.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.600
They're looking for
authors, debut authors

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.840
that they can build that
they can put marketing behind

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.160
and to break you out.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.618
So they're looking for what's
called a breakout book, which

00:30:58.618 --> 00:31:01.500
is a big story if you can
do that, and sometimes--

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.030
I think it's a book for people
to understand that sometimes it

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.800
isn't your first book
that gets published.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.170
Quite often, your first book
is that learning ground.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.910
You know, if we started--

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.000
back to the 10,000
hours, a friend of mine

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.780
has a great analogy when she
talks about playing football

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.850
and how you guys
all learn-- well,

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.730
we all learn football in school
and people, and people go out,

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:23.130
kids go out, and they kick
a ball around on the green

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.460
outside the house, put the
jumpers down for goalposts.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.190
None of those people expect
to go and play for AC Milan

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.148
the next morning, and I
think one of the things

00:31:31.148 --> 00:31:32.857
with writing, certainly
one of the things

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:34.350
that I did with
that first book way

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.390
back when, was that
when you write you think

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.000
it's going to be the book.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.612
It's fantastic,
and it's amazing,

00:31:39.612 --> 00:31:42.070
and that you're going to be
out there playing for AC Milan,

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.170
but it's that learning
process that takes time.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.890
And you're doing all
the right things.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.385
If you're keeping redrafting,
and you're doing absolutely

00:31:49.385 --> 00:31:50.260
all the right things.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.630
You just have to keep on going.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:52.950
Just keep writing.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.200
That's the best advice.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.600
AUDIENCE: I have a quick
question about your writing

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.340
process.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.950
Would you usually
write every day,

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:03.930
force yourself to
write every day,

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:07.960
or would you, perhaps, wait
for when you're inspired?

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.980
And would you also write
in the right order,

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.720
or would you maybe write
random dialogue, for example?

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.220
Thank you.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.240
VANESSA O'LOUGHLIN: OK, that's a
really good question, actually,

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.400
because I'm a really
organized person,

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.252
and I need to write
in a linear fashion,

00:32:19.252 --> 00:32:21.210
so I have to start at
the beginning of the book

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.980
and end at the end.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.180
Other friends of mine don't
write like that at all.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.120
I don't know how they do it,
but obviously their minds

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.750
work in a completely
different way,

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.040
and they would write a
scene-- like if they suddenly

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.540
want to write a fight scene,
they'd write that from the end,

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.332
and then something else
from the beginning,

00:32:35.332 --> 00:32:38.500
and then they'd put
it all together.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.100
I use a tool called Scrivener,
and quite a lot of authors use

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.780
Scrivener, to collect
the bits together.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.405
I actually just used
it for my research

00:32:44.405 --> 00:32:48.510
so that I can put stuff into
files and then find them again.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.870
And so if you do write
in that out-of-order way,

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:53.740
then that can be a
really useful tool.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.550
Personally, I write in
a very linear fashion,

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.230
and I do try and
write every day,

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:01.477
but it doesn't always happen.

00:33:01.477 --> 00:33:03.060
You think about your
book all the time

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:03.900
when you're working on it.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.108
So like I was saying, coming
out of the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:33:06.108 --> 00:33:08.640
I wasn't actually writing,
but I was plotting in my head.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.140
I'm was thinking,
trying to work out

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.240
where I was going
with the story,

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.460
and I think, as a writer,
it's always there with you,

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.168
and it needs to be
always there with you.

00:33:16.168 --> 00:33:19.990
I remember somebody emailed me
once, a long, long time ago,

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.675
and she said, oh, yeah, I'm
going on holiday, so you know,

00:33:22.675 --> 00:33:23.800
I won't be taking the book.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.230
I won't be able to work on that
because I'm going on holiday.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:28.020
And I thought, well, if you're a
writer, you write all the time.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.360
I drive my family mad
because I write on holiday,

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.340
and it's my thing.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.805
It's the thing I love
to do most, and so yeah,

00:33:35.805 --> 00:33:36.430
so I sit there.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.805
I get up at 6 o'clock in the
morning when I'm on holiday,

00:33:38.805 --> 00:33:41.512
and to me it's a couple of hours
typing away is the thing to do.

00:33:41.512 --> 00:33:42.970
Yeah, so I try and
write every day.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:47.520
If I'm not writing every
day, I am thinking about it.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.840
When you're under
deadline, it's different.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.750
I suppose one of
the crucial things

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.520
is that when you
don't have a contract,

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.890
when you're an unpublished
writer as I was,

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.628
you have the luxury
of time, and it's

00:33:57.628 --> 00:33:59.670
really difficult to
recognize that because you're

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.600
desperate to get
published, and you're

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.400
desperate to get the deal, but
you have the absolute luxury

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:03.900
of time.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.300
You can spend as long as
it takes and make that book

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.620
the best that it can be.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.520
And if it's not
that book, might be

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.603
the next book, or the next
book, or the next book,

00:34:10.603 --> 00:34:13.679
but you've got all the time
in the world to do that.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.980
When you get under contract,
you suddenly get deadlines,

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:20.070
and you suddenly find
that actually you've

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.670
written book one
because that was fine

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:23.080
that you had that written.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.409
And then all of a sudden,
you've got to write book two,

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:27.330
and then you've got to come up
with an idea for book three,

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:28.650
and then you might
be launching--

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.659
what happened to me was
I was launching book two

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:33.330
and trying to finish book
three at the same time.

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.219
And suddenly, you
might have to write--

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:37.157
I had to write 30,000
words in nine days

00:34:37.157 --> 00:34:38.699
once just to get
book three finished,

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:41.157
which is partly why the end
had to be completely rewritten,

00:34:41.157 --> 00:34:44.199
but it's a whole
different world.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.449
So I think, enjoy that time.

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:48.840
And yeah, so when
I'm under contract--

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.110
when you're under deadline,
it's much more every day.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.409
It's like, this is a
thing I've got to do.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:56.760
And it actually helps
if you're in the zone,

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.848
and you can stay
in it, much more

00:34:58.848 --> 00:35:00.390
than trying to write
bits and pieces,

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:01.500
but you do train yourself.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.250
I think you train yourself to
write to suit your lifestyle.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:10.780
So I wrote at least 2,000
words of one of the books

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.510
on plane to Frankfurt Book Fair.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.000
It leaves here at, what,
7:00 in the morning,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.510
so it was an early start.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.970
And you know, I've
written on trains.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:19.930
I write in cafes.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.240
I write everywhere, and
noise doesn't bother me.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.860
One of the things
I do do is I have

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.820
tend to have a
soundtrack for each book.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.478
So Cat Connolly is obviously
24, a lot younger than me.

00:35:29.478 --> 00:35:30.520
She listens to pop music.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.820
She's a 24 year
old, so whatever's

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.860
in the charts is her
soundtrack at the time,

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.930
so I would make a
soundtrack for each book,

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:40.900
and I'd plug my earphones
in and stick them in,

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.150
and that helps drown out
everything else that's

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.248
going on in my head as well
as the noise around me.

00:35:46.248 --> 00:35:48.040
So it means I can really
focus on the book,

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.623
and when I hear that
sound then I know

00:35:49.623 --> 00:35:51.880
I'm in the zone for writing.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.470
This book is about a woman
who was an ex-ballerina,

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:56.800
so it's the Mahler
symphony, and I'm

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.110
using that for this one,
the soundtrack for this one.

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:01.090
The next book, I don't know what
that soundtrack is going to be.

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:03.132
I'm only just starting
it, so we'll wait and see,

00:36:03.132 --> 00:36:05.440
but I find that enormously
useful because it just

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.540
helps block out the sound
wherever you are, but also

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.460
what's going on in your head.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.650
Yeah, so I think one of
the things about writing

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:18.520
is that it's really worth
listening to writers, lots

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.820
of different writers, because
we all do the same thing,

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.740
and we all use bits
of the same technique,

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.920
but we all have developed
them in our own way,

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.320
and there's no right
or wrong way to write.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.480
So some people write
bits all over the place.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.160
Some people write organically,
and they don't plot and plan

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:33.660
at all.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.440
A friend of mine,
Monica McInerney wrote--

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:39.190
I remember her telling me she
wrote 40,000 words of a book,

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:41.730
and in totally the
wrong direction.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.542
It was a complete,
like, all wrong.

00:36:44.542 --> 00:36:46.000
She had to literally
delete 40,000.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.770
That's half a book, right?

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.780
But in that 40,000 words,
there were a couple

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.370
of paragraphs, which
were absolutely

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:53.060
crucial to the
progression of the plot

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.090
that she wouldn't have found if
she hadn't written the 40,000

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:55.720
words.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.847
So nothing is ever
wasted writing.

00:36:57.847 --> 00:36:59.680
You know, it might be
that you write a book,

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.950
and it never sees
the light of day,

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.410
but it's not wasted
because you've

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:06.910
used that time and your creative
mind has been working on it.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:09.790
And you know, it's really,
really vital, so yeah.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:11.770
So technique--
listen to writers.

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:14.020
Find out how everybody
else does it.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.690
Find out what works
for you, and then you

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:20.138
can draw in and devise your
own way of doing things

00:37:20.138 --> 00:37:21.430
that works with your lifestyle.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.500
Some people have little kids,
and they can't-- they can only

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.077
write--

00:37:24.077 --> 00:37:26.160
I used to only write during
my daughter's naptime,

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.577
and my daughter would only
sleep for 20 minutes at a time,

00:37:28.577 --> 00:37:31.180
so I think I learned quite
early on to 20 minutes.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.680
And when you've
only got 20 minutes,

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.430
it's amazing what you can do.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:35.930
You block everything else out.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.260
So yeah, everybody's
different, but yeah,

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.610
find the way that works for you.

00:37:44.168 --> 00:37:45.960
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the luxury of time,

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.335
and I've been sitting on a
manuscript for about 13 years,

00:37:48.335 --> 00:37:50.048
so what's your advice
for someone who

00:37:50.048 --> 00:37:51.590
just wants to get
the thing out there

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:54.173
but doesn't want to be dealing
with loads and loads of details

00:37:54.173 --> 00:37:57.440
like cover design, ISBN,
this thing, that thing,

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.742
some other detail,
as most Googlers

00:38:00.742 --> 00:38:02.200
just want to get
a thing out there.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.742
They're not really interested
in making a whole bunch of cash

00:38:04.742 --> 00:38:05.330
out of it.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:05.720
VANESSA O'LOUGHLIN: OK.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.560
AUDIENCE: So they've
got a day job.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.890
VANESSA O'LOUGHLIN: But
you want people to read it?

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:08.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.460
VANESSA O'LOUGHLIN: OK, so if
you want people to read it,

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.835
then there are lots of companies
who do all that for you.

00:38:12.835 --> 00:38:14.627
So you don't have to
worry about any of it.

00:38:14.627 --> 00:38:16.880
You just go to one of them,
and they're professional.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.760
I can give you the names.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.170
There's a couple, two, here
in Ireland who are very good.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:20.810
They come back from
trade backgrounds,

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:22.670
and they understand
the business.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:26.570
But things like, yeah, getting
a good cover is crucial

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.490
because that's how a
reader recognizes a book.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:30.050
You know, yourself, when
you go into a bookshop.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:32.592
You pick the book up, depending
on what the cover looks like,

00:38:32.592 --> 00:38:34.625
turn it over, read the
back, open it, read

00:38:34.625 --> 00:38:35.750
those first few paragraphs.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:39.627
So those things are
really, really important.

00:38:39.627 --> 00:38:41.210
So yeah, if you're
at that point where

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:45.210
you don't want to be bothered
with the doings of the makings,

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.210
but you've already done
your bit of the makings,

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:48.830
then I think I would
probably just get

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.442
one of the companies come who
do that professionally to do it,

00:38:51.442 --> 00:38:52.900
and they'll do it
properly for you,

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.350
and they'll get
you a great cover.

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.750
They'll help you with
the blurb, and then

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.907
you can still self-publish, so
you're still doing it yourself.

00:38:59.907 --> 00:39:01.490
But do send it out
to the trade first.

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:03.900
You know, do get an editor
to have a look at it

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.860
or get a reader's report done on
it so you know that what you've

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:12.130
got there is the right
bit, and do think about,

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:13.270
another story too.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.990
You know, I suppose
that's really

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.583
important, is that if you are--

00:39:17.583 --> 00:39:18.500
everybody's different.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.417
I mean, maybe you only
want to write one book,

00:39:20.417 --> 00:39:22.480
and that's fantastic
because you have, obviously,

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.010
and actually getting to the
end is a massive achievement

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:27.460
because there are lots of
people who want to write books.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.820
Not very many people
actually finish them.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.425
But if you are writing, and you
finish one book, keep thinking.

00:39:33.425 --> 00:39:34.550
Think about the second one.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.840
Because if you do
get a contract,

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.882
it won't be for one book.

00:39:36.882 --> 00:39:39.290
It'll be for a minimum
of two, and you

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:40.992
need to have that
next idea ready to go.

00:39:40.992 --> 00:39:42.200
It'll make a huge difference.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.260
It will help you with this
awful contract deadline block.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.863
So yes, do keep writing.

00:39:46.863 --> 00:39:49.280
But no, absolutely, people can
help you out and get it out

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.680
there for you, but do, yeah--

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.420
Yeah, it's hard when you spend
a lot time working on things,

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.300
but do start-- like if you
enjoyed that process, start

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.467
thinking about the next one.

00:39:57.467 --> 00:39:57.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.800
Move on.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.050
AUDIENCE: You usually
give really good advice

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.750
to those who are in the
beginning of the process,

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.870
and I really like the
idea about the storyboard.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:10.310
So how it usually works?

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.700
For example, it's like
detectives in crime movies

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.970
do this by thinking,
searching, putting together all

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:18.030
the pieces?

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.750
For writing, how
you will recommend

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:21.982
to use the storyboard?

00:40:21.982 --> 00:40:22.940
VANESSA O'LOUGHLIN: OK.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.780
So I get the pictures of
people, and then the locations.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.360
I spend a lot of time looking--

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.350
because I'm a detail
person, I like

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:33.920
to be in control of
everything, and I'm really

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.750
into the whole getting
everything right,

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:39.290
so I would go to
find the locations.

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:41.748
I try and visit the locations
if I'm writing about them.

00:40:41.748 --> 00:40:43.040
I try and use places I've been.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.957
So if it's the inside
of somebody's apartment,

00:40:44.957 --> 00:40:47.840
I've been to the apartment,
but I do go onto these property

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.370
websites, and I
get people's floor

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:52.910
plans, and the interior shots
of different people's houses,

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:54.530
and I put those
into my storyboard.

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:56.905
So it just means that if I'm
writing about somebody going

00:40:56.905 --> 00:40:59.303
into the living room, I don't
forget that actually-- what

00:40:59.303 --> 00:41:00.470
they can see out the window.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:02.930
Or I don't forget
that the kitchen's off

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.570
this particular room as
opposed to off a different one.

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:07.070
In theory, when you
get to the point

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:09.200
where you have a
copy editor looking

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.498
at your book and that sort
of final editorial process,

00:41:11.498 --> 00:41:13.790
they'll notice, like if eight
people went into the lift

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:16.280
and only four people
came out, or somebody's

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.630
pregnant 14 months.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.570
I think one of my
friends managed.

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:23.603
But those type of
details, I think,

00:41:23.603 --> 00:41:25.520
are great for storyboard
because, particularly

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.420
locations, then you can
see where your people are.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.250
I've got one
character who I think

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:32.972
might live on a
houseboat, and so,

00:41:32.972 --> 00:41:34.930
because we're very close
Grand Canal Dock here,

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:36.950
I spend a lot of time walking
around Grand Canal Dock,

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:38.240
getting pictures of
house boats, trying

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.615
to find the right layout for
the houseboat, for the story

00:41:40.615 --> 00:41:41.510
that I wanted.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:44.298
And so I've got a whole
houseboat layout on mine,

00:41:44.298 --> 00:41:46.340
and pictures of Grand
Canal, and different places

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.560
where they might have
stayed on my storyboard.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.630
Yeah, so I just find
them really useful.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.090
I mean, in film,
obviously, people plot out

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.270
the actual story on
storyboards, and they use them

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:58.940
for-- in animation and stuff,
you use them to actually tell

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.310
the story, but I just tend
to have a static one, which

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.180
has locations.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.970
And sometimes, the dressmaker
had bits of lace on it

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:08.150
for wedding dress, and
it had a deck of cards,

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.520
I think, I had stuck on it,
all sorts of bits, just bits

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.645
that were just, I felt,
going to go into the story.

00:42:12.645 --> 00:42:15.850
It's sort of pooling, I
suppose, the creative place.

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.840
Yeah, but I find
them really useful.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.210
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.120
I think that's all for today.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:22.510
VANESSA O'LOUGHLIN:
Are we all right?

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:24.052
AUDIENCE: And I
really appreciate it.

00:42:24.052 --> 00:42:26.060
It was, I think, a
very inspiring story,

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.010
and it's always
good when you can

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:31.790
talk to a person who has
already success career, and who

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:35.330
can also share some advices,
and give some tips, and tricks,

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:37.430
and all those small
exercises that are

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:39.110
quite useful for many people.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:39.860
Thank you so much.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:40.350
VANESSA O'LOUGHLIN: Thank you.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:41.767
Thank you very
much for having me.
