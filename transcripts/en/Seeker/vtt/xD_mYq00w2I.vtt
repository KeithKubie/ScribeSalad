00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.759
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE EVERYBODY THAT LIVES
IN MASSACHUSETTS AND GIVE THEM A NEW HAT!

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:13.120
That's a terrible idea

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.110
Howdy deciders and hunger-queens, this is
DNews; I'm Trace!

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.660
When you're hungry, your body makes all sorts
of changes, chemically and physically to make

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.430
sure everything continues to work properly;
we've talked about it a bunch on DNews.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.450
You change how your metabolism works, whether
your stomach is going to produce acids, and

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.610
if left long enough your brain starts to break
down your own body.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.789
It's actually kinda nuts.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.660
Eating food is basically the main job for
a living organism, except of course, gettin'

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.660
it on.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.800
But both of those things require a solid grasp
of the world around you, which, ironically,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.809
is super impaired when you're hungry.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.859
It's almost like we get hunger goggles.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.229
According to a new study in Neuropsychopharmacology
the body releases a hormone called ghrelin

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:51.889
(GREL-in) when we're hungry that makes people
more impulsive.

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:56.389
Ghrelin and leptin are hormones which regulate
hunger and satiation.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.769
Ghrelin is released from the gastrointestinal
tract, telling your body EAT EAT EAT!

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.360
Then, as the stomach stretches, leptin is
released from fat cells telling your body

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.360
Fuuuuuullll….

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.360
Fuuuuulllll…

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.030
To make us eat, ghrelin triggers the hypothalamus
-- which releases gastric acids and the muscles

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.259
that move food through your gastrointestinal
tract.

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.159
If you don't eat, ghrelin levels go up, and
up, and eventually, according to this new

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.700
research, its presence increases impulsivity!

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.310
JUST EAT ALREADY, it's saying.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.470
But impulsiveness to eat, doesn't just affect
food intake.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.869
It also can spill over into the rest of your
life, causing us all to make bad decisions.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.659
In the scientific community, impulsivity is
so serious, it's considered an indication

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.100
of some neuropsychiatric disorders!

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.409
According to a study in Psychiatry Research,
people who are impulsive don't associate making

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.040
good decisions with reward, or bad decisions
with punishment.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.370
For example, a study in the Journal of Neuroscience
scanned the brains of people asked to make

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.999
a decision, and provided them with the hormone
dopamine -- also linked to impulsivity.

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:59.280
The people who were more impulsive would take
a small sum of money right now, rather than

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.640
the (obviously better) large sum of money
later.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.680
In fact, impulsivity caused 30 percent more
people to take the small sum now!

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.410
If you connect these two studies you'd see
that hunger makes you impulsive and being

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.980
impulsive makes you a worse decision maker;
thus, simply being hungry can keep us from

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.970
acting in our own best interest.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.750
And if that weren't enough, when you're hungry,
you are likely feeling hunger pangs -- or

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.750
pain!

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.090
A study in PLOS One, found acute pain made
people more self-interested and of course,

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.640
more likely to get angry.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.250
Combine that with impulsivity and you're just
a mess of poor decision making, says most

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.250
research.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.320
THERE IS ONE BENEFIT though.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.330
Impulsive, panged, decision-making may help
you when gambling.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.780
In a single PLOS One study, they looked at
a small group of people who'd been fasting,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.260
and had them gamble.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.120
Those who were hungry, and supposedly more
impulsive: performed better on a gambling

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.120
game, than those who were satiated… though
they didn't know exactly why…

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.540
In the end, the science seems to say making
decisions on an empty stomach is a bad decision.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.020
If you're hungry right now, go have a snack,
and then decide whether you believe me.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.540
If you're hungry for more from DNews, you're
not alone.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.180

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.750
But back to your stomach.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.430
You're probably thinking, what about getting
'hangry,' where does that come in?

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.310
Oh, it comes in all right, and rocks you like
a hurricane.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:49.790
Go feed yourself Seymour, and learn about
how we get hangry in
