00:00:13.924 --> 00:00:18.175
It is only in the last 100 or so years that human kind has understood

00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:22.137
that the nucleus of the chemical elements is not always fixed.

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:26.453
It can change spontaneously from one element to another.

00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:29.743
The name for this process is radioactivity.

00:00:29.743 --> 00:00:33.015
You probably already know something about the nucleus:

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.176
it's much tinier than the atom,

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:38.133
it's made of particles called protons and neutrons,

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:41.214
there are electrons orbiting around it.

00:00:41.214 --> 00:00:45.042
And though the atoms can share or swap electrons when they bond together,

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:47.932
the nuclei themselves never change.

00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:48.978
Right?

00:00:48.978 --> 00:00:50.128
Well, no.

00:00:50.128 --> 00:00:52.923
Certain nuclei are not stable in that way.

00:00:52.923 --> 00:00:55.372
This means they may change suddenly,

00:00:55.372 --> 00:00:57.199
spontaneously.

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.010
The radioactive nucleus flings out a small particle

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.891
and transforms into another element, just like that.

00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:04.715
For example,

00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:07.568
the carbon nucleus can eject a fast-moving electron

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.527
and turn into a nitrogen nucleus.

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:13.341
There are two different particles that can be emitted from radioactive nuclei,

00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:14.662
but never together.

00:01:14.662 --> 00:01:18.087
The very fast electron is known as a beta particle.

00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:21.665
If you know a little bit about electrons, you may be thinking,

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:25.285
"What was the electron doing in the nucleus in the first place?"

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.759
The answer is there is a neutron in nucleus

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.231
spontaneously changed into a proton,

00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:31.508
which stayed behind,

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:35.166
and the electron flew out as a beta particle.

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.993
This is not what chemistry has taught us to expect.

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:40.200
The nucleus is supposed to be stable.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.395
Neutrons don't change into protons.

00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:44.534
Except, sometimes they do!

00:01:44.534 --> 00:01:46.663
The other particle it emits spontaneously

00:01:46.663 --> 00:01:49.415
from an unstable nucleus is alpha.

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:53.519
An alpha particle is 8,000 times more massive than beta,

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:54.811
and it's a bit slower.

00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:58.120
Alpha is made from two protons and two neutrons.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.203
If we trap all those alpha particles together,

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.265
we get helium gas.

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:05.150
Alpha is a helium nucleus.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.512
Like the beta particle, you would not have expected

00:02:08.512 --> 00:02:11.615
a heavier nucleus to throw out helium.

00:02:11.615 --> 00:02:13.380
But again, it happens,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.118
and the nucleus becomes a new element.

00:02:16.118 --> 00:02:20.782
So, is radioactivity useful or just dangerous?

00:02:20.782 --> 00:02:21.801
Wherever you are sitting,

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:24.474
it is quite likely that there is a device nearby

00:02:24.474 --> 00:02:27.290
which contains a source of alpha particles:

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.322
a smoke detector.

00:02:28.322 --> 00:02:31.053
The source is radioactive Americium.

00:02:31.053 --> 00:02:33.279
You are totally safe from these alpha particles,

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.254
which cannot travel more than a few centimeters in air.

00:02:36.254 --> 00:02:38.691
Beta particles penetrate much farther

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.181
through materials than alpha can.

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:44.687
Radioactive atoms are used in medicine as traces,

00:02:44.687 --> 00:02:46.902
to show where chemicals travel in the patient.

00:02:46.902 --> 00:02:49.615
Beta particles are emitted and have enough energy

00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:51.944
to emerge from the body and be detected.

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:54.465
There is a third type of nuclear radiation:

00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:56.684
gamma, which is not a particle at all.

00:02:56.684 --> 00:02:58.659
It is an electromagnetic wave,

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.141
like microwaves, or light,

00:03:01.141 --> 00:03:05.419
but it is actually 1,000 times more energentic than visible light.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.017
Gamma rays may pass right through your body.

00:03:08.017 --> 00:03:12.021
Gamma is used to zap the bacteria in fruit to increase its shelf life,

00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:15.732
or in radiotherapy to kill cancer cells.

00:03:15.732 --> 00:03:17.922
Radioactive substances get hot,

00:03:17.922 --> 00:03:20.363
and this heat can be used to generate power.

00:03:20.363 --> 00:03:22.783
This heat has been brought to you since space probes,

00:03:22.783 --> 00:03:26.269
and, in the past, in pacemakers for hearts.

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.303
The more abruptly nuclear radiation is slowed down,

00:03:29.303 --> 00:03:32.166
the more damage it does to the atoms it hits.

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.456
This is called ionization.

00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:39.056
Alpha causes the most ionization as it crashes into other atoms

00:03:39.056 --> 00:03:41.189
and gamma the least.

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.085
In humans, the most serious effect of radiation

00:03:44.085 --> 00:03:47.336
is the damage that it can cause to our DNA.

00:03:47.336 --> 00:03:50.072
Although alpha cannot penetrate your skin,

00:03:50.072 --> 00:03:52.905
if you inhale or injest a radioactive nucleus,

00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:55.882
the health consequences can be severe.

00:03:55.882 --> 00:03:59.325
Radioactivity is both useful and deadly,

00:03:59.325 --> 00:04:04.347
but it is all around us as a background to the natural world.
