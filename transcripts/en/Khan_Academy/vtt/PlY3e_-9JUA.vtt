00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.810
I thought I would do a few
examples using the angle

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:03.950
bisector theorem.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.700
So in this first
triangle right over here,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.440
we're given that this
side has length 3,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.330
this side has length 6.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.030
And this little
dotted line here,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.570
this is clearly
the angle bisector,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.444
because they're telling
us that this angle is

00:00:15.444 --> 00:00:17.153
congruent to that
angle right over there.

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:18.693
And then they tell
us that the length

00:00:18.693 --> 00:00:21.220
of just this part of this
side right over here is 2.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.120
So from here to here is 2.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.670
And that this length is x.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.380
So let's figure out what x is.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.410
So the angle bisector
theorem tells us

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.360
that the ratio of 3 to 2 is
going to be equal to 6 to x.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.240
And then we can
just solve for x.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.290
So 3 to 2 is going to
be equal to 6 to x.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.770
And then once again, you
could just cross multiply,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.290
or you could multiply
both sides by 2 and x.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.000
That kind of gives
you the same result.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.760
If you cross multiply, you get
3x is equal to 2 times 6 is 12.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.910
x is equal to, divide both
sides by 3, x is equal to 4.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.939
So in this case,
x is equal to 4.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:02.480
And this is kind of interesting,
because we just realized now

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.069
that this side, this entire
side right over here,

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.615
is going to be equal to 6.

00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:08.240
So even though it
doesn't look that way

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.885
based on how it's drawn, this is
actually an isosceles triangle

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:16.000
that has a 6 and a 6, and then
the base right over here is 3.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.010
It's kind of interesting.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.290
Over here we're given that this
length is 5, this length is 7,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.570
this entire side is 10.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.386
And then we have this angle
bisector right over there.

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:29.760
And we need to figure out just
this part of the triangle,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.760
between this point, if
we call this point A,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.490
and this point right over here.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.680
We need to find the length
of AB right over here.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.090
So once again, angle bisector
theorem, the ratio of 5

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.960
to this, let me do this in a
new color, the ratio of 5 to x

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.200
is going to be equal
to the ratio of 7

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.947
to this distance
right over here.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.030
And what is that distance?

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.030
Well, if the whole thing
is 10, and this is x,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.960
then this distance right over
here is going to be 10 minus x.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.060
So the ratio of 5 to x is
equal to 7 over 10 minus x.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.160
And we can cross
multiply 5 times 10

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.630
minus x is 50 minus 5x.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.990
And then x times
7 is equal to 7x.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.340
Add 5x to both sides
of this equation,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.110
you get 50 is equal to 12x.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.290
We can divide both sides by
12, and we get 50 over 12

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.960
is equal to x.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.190
And we can reduce this.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.570
Let's see if you divide the
numerator and denominator by 2,

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.584
you get this is the
same thing as 25 over 6,

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:41.000
which is the same thing, if
we want to write it as a mixed

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.620
number, as 4, 24
over 6 is 4, and then

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.300
you have 1/6 left over.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.790
4 and 1/6.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.120
So this length right
over here is going,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.945
oh sorry, this length right
over here, x is 4 and 1/6.

00:02:55.945 --> 00:02:57.320
And then this
length over here is

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.909
going to be 10 minus 4 and 1/6.

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:00.450
What is that?

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.740
5 and 5/6.
