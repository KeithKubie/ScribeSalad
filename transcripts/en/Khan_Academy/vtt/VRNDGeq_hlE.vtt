00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.290
- [Instructor] After
practicing the violin together

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.930
for 15 years, Justine told Katie

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.480
that she was the better violinist.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.280
Alright, so immediately when I read that

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.650
when they say that she
was the better violinist,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.880
I don't know, is Justine
talking about she Justine

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.220
or is Justine talking about she Katie?

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.400
So this pronoun she,
who is it referring to?

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.100
Is it referring to Katie or
is it referring to Justine?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.490
It could be either one.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.140
Justine could be saying
that Justine is better

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.820
or she could be saying
that Katie is better.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.400
The way it's written, you do not know

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.077
which kind of makes the
sentence fairly meaningless

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:37.990
so I definitely don't wanna
keep it the way it is.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.560
So what I would want is some clarity

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.940
on who was the better violinist.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.520
So what I like about this second choice

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.560
is it makes it very clear

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.430
that Katie was the better violinist.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.500
Let's read that.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.550
After practicing the violin
together for 15 years,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.340
Justine told Katie that Katie
was the better violinist.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.360
Yep, I definitely like it.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.390
Now you might say oh look,
I'm using the Katie twice

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.210
in three words in the sentence.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.320
Isn't that redundant?

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.560
And it might feel that
way but you really do

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.490
need to use Katie twice
in order to make sure

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.760
that you understand that Justine thinks

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.010
that Katie was the better violinist.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.810
So this needs to be Katie right over here.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.643
If you don't do that,

00:01:14.643 --> 00:01:16.510
you don't know who
Justine is talking about.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.920
And then the other choices, let's see.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.130
After practicing the violin
together for 15 years,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.730
Justine told Katie that
she's was the best, better.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.260
Well this one is just,
this one is ambiguous,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.081
this one's just grammatically incorrect.

00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.230
You're having a possessive pronoun here,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.300
what are you possessing?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.180
So definitely rule that one out and then

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.470
after practicing the violin
together for 15 years,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.470
Justine told Katie that they
were the better violinist.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.640
Well they were, that's not making sense.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.190
It's saying that they were both

00:01:51.124 --> 00:01:53.230
but it's making a comparison
to whom, I don't know.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.740
They could say Justine
told Katie that they were

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.440
both good violinists, that would
have been an okay statement

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.360
but that's not what they're saying.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.320
They were making a comparison
on who is a better violinist,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.053
so this doesn't make sense either.
