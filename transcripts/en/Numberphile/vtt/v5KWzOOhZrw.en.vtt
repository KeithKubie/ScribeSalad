00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.200
What's this, Brady?

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.160
It's like a graph, or joined up circles?

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.740
No, this is an ant. You can see the antenna up there, and then this is the body of the ant.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.700
Oh yeah, OK.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.420
We're going to place odd consecutive integers starting with one into this ant.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.160
So, what are those odd consecutive integers starting with one?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.500
Well, we need one, three, five, seven, and nine.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.280
We're going to be placing them in here.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.800
So, what number do you want here?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.140
Seven.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.380
Seven, and here?

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.239
Three.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.580
And here?

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.080
One.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.800
Let's put nine.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.440
And?

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.360
Five.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.280
OK, so this is an example of a failure.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.040
We're going to look at five minus one; that is four.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.580
4 9 minus 1 that's 8 3 minus 1 that's 2

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.819
everything looks different so far looking good

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.419
Sadly 7 minus 3 is also

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.909
4 so we failed this is an example of a failure your job, is to try to make all of those differences

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.609
different if I go seven three one nine five

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.779
then we have 4 &amp; 8 &amp;

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.400
6 &amp;

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.900
4. Oh wait no this is still a disaster I wonder if this is even possible to solve this at your you're okay to fail

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.079
but I I'm supposed to be succeeding here okay um

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.900
let's go 9 1

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.739
No, maybe I'm gonna put the 7 up

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.470
Here and the 5 here and a 3 here does this work

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.549
Yeah yeah yeah yeah this looks good so this is nine minus one that's eight seven minus one

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.509
six

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.509
four and two

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.320
We're all different

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.889
we are successful we get to ride the end

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.809
So this is part of an unsolved problem from

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.680
1967 called the graceful tree conjecture but it belongs in every elementary school's

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.290
curriculum, whenever they're learning subtraction so the general problem is given any number of connected circles so they have to be

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.360
connected any

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.940
number that you want they have to be connected and there can be no loops so this would be a fine

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.739
Insectoid to solve let me show you a loop so you could ask can this be solved so this might be solvable it might not

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.049
But it's certainly not the graceful tree conjecture the graceful tree conjecture means that there's no loops, okay?

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.310
okay, but why don't we try to solve this so now we need 1 3 5 7 &amp;

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.960
9 in 2 &amp; 2 here can this be solved

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.760
Consider how many even numbers you can get what's the biggest even number that you can get as a difference between

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.530
these right 8 yeah 9 and 1 the biggest you can get is 8

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.970
what's the second biggest number that you can get 6 yes and

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.839
The third biggest number 4 and then the last one is 2 there are only

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.619
4 different numbers that you can have but how many lines do we have to satisfy we have got

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.550
5 lines we've only got 4 even numbers to distribute between these five lines

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.100
So no matter how you distribute

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.680
these odd numbers

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.309
You are always going to end up with a duplicate so here we have 8

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.989
6

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.700
4 2

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.700
&amp; 4 again

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.089
We've ended up with a duplicate over here so this starfish

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:04.489
Cannot be solved it will fail every time if we have n circles and n lines connecting them

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.629
We will never be able to solve that we can potentially solve for M

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.010
circles in this case 5 circles and n minus 1

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.510
Maximum of four lines, we?

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.859
Sometimes can solve for that so five circles where you you could solve it so here's a butterfly

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.849
There are five lines and one less connector so this could be solved what about this

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:37.489
Five circles and four connectors I don't know if this can be solved but this might be able to be solved the graceful tree

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.090
Conjecture doesn't include loops but this is still an

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:48.919
Interesting question I I don't know the solution to this so the graceful tree conjecture is one where you have all of your circles connected

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.070
So you don't have an outlier here and there's no loops

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.009
So that is guaranteed if you've got n circles you're going to have n minus 1 connectors

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.740
so here we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 circles 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.389
lines and this is what is unsolved whether 4 n

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.690
circles and n minus 1 lines

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.240
Where there are no loops

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.510
Can you always put in there odd?

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.639
consecutive integers

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.639
such that the difference between

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.269
all connected circles all of those differences

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.820
Are different what's it's not proven for that surely you mean for old designs of three

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.060
oh

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.210
yeah for all

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.130
insectoids or all trees that you would care to design so this one for seven has been solved this is an example of

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.619
Seven circles and six connecting lines there are actually 11 different ways

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.130
that you can do that so here we have the 11 different ways to have seven circles all

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.330
connected no loops

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
What is unsolved is?

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.940
going for more circles if you go into

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.060
30 or 40 circles

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.090
Are these all solvable this has

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:13.039
been an open conjecture since 1967 so presumably God if I start having more circles like 30 circles of 40 per calls the number of

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.090
insectoids possible must just get metal it explodes

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.250
Exactly right up to what number of circles is it solved for there are

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:30.079
individual cases that have been solved for example I can put Circle in the middle and I can add any number of

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.500
Circles on the outside that you want and this is always

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:40.970
solvable and I can prove that quite easily I can put a 1 in the middle then I can go 3 5 7 9 11

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.410
13

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.410
15 17 19

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.639
21 23

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:54.379
And you can imagine I can keep on going here and this is always solvable because these differences are always different I could also put

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.189
The largest number in the middle 23 could go in the middle and then I could distribute

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.600
The other numbers all around all we solvable another example of a species that is always solvable are

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.669
Snakes so you could imagine a snake of any length that you want

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:17.690
and these are always solvable you might want to try this you can start with one and then you can go to your

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.389
largest one I'm actually going to just skip I'm gonna go 1 3

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:24.679
5 7 and then I'm gonna come back 9

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.060
11 13

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.060
here, we have a difference of

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.310
12 a difference of 10 a difference of 8 a

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.869
difference of 6 a difference of 4 and a difference of 2

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:45.229
All snakes can be solvable just by replicating that pattern there's lots of species out there

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:51.799
Not everything is a snake not everything is a sea star

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:59.119
There's lots of species out there you could very easily create and explore new species for example what happens if we have

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:05.509
Something crazy that you know to sea stars joined with the long dendritic chain

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:11.929
So is that solvable you can imagine that these can get very very complex very very quickly and

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:18.019
Most species by the time you get to 40 circles most of those insectoids

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.969
Very difficult to solve so presumably good if this is still an unanswered question

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.339
That means there's yet to be a species of tree found that is definitely

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.859
Unsolvable because that would that would ruin it that's correct

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.770
We have not found an example that doesn't work but that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.479
there are plenty of mathematicians who believe that that tree

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:48.689
Exists that that there is a tree out there that cannot be solved would you be happy or sad if one was found oh

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:54.929
I would be thrilled if one was find because I do this with my elementary school kids and

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:02.400
after a week of them struggling to find one that can't be solved I would love to say and

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.930
Here, we have

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.450
but it feels like it

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.720
feels like nature is telling us they can always be solved like it feels like a

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.349
Beautiful thing they're also about it feels like it would break something beautiful

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:21.960
Well it's already broken like if you look beyond the graceful tree conjecture to allowing loops so here

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.960
we have seven circles

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:30.509
Six connectors so these ones cannot be solved so in a way it's already broken but it's interesting which

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.089
Species work which species fail

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.399
I like that I sort of see them as

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.270
abominations and therefore they should

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:43.049
It's fair enough that they can't be solved but there's something perfect about the tree that has no loops and no islands

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:48.420
Well that that's where the crux is well where does a dividing line between

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.040
Species that are always solvable and species that aren't that's what becomes interesting

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:58.199
Are, you right are all of the trees really beautiful, well we'll have to wait and find out
