("Hail to the Chief" playing)

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.609 line:0%
Wow. Unbelievable.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.344
What an incredible crowd.

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:13.212
What great little kids.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:16.983
I wanted to come here because
education is so important,

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:20.286
and we want to make sure
that the school is good for you.

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:22.622
We think you guys
can go without lunch.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.558
You don't need lunch.
You know you don't need lunch.

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:27.860
And we want to shorten
the school day.

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:29.962
'Cause we can't afford
to fund the schools.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:32.231
All right, great.
All right, well, such fun.

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:33.533
Wonderful kids.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.535
Okay, Bridget, I'm done.
Let's go.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.370
-Uh, sir? Sir?
-Thank you so much.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.372
-WOMAN: Excuse me, sir,
-Wonderful time. Great time.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:40.673
No, no, no, no. Sir?

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:42.642
Remember? You're supposed
to read to the kids?

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.777
All right. Let's read this.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.080
This is an incredible book

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:49.449
called<i> The Art of the Deal.</i>

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.151
I filmed this book cover
in a forest.

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:55.221
Look at that guy. So handsome.

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:57.590
"I call Ivan Boesky.

00:00:57.623 --> 00:00:59.125
"Boesky's an arbitrageur.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.961
My idea is to hire Steve Rubell
and Ian Schrager..."

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:03.796
You guys know who they are.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.033
"...the creators of Studio 54
and the Palladium."

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.434
What is it, kid?

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:09.902
Who are they?

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:11.904
They are incredible
real estate guys

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:13.973
who owned Studio 54,
and that's a place

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:15.708
where you could do<i> anything.</i>

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.444 line:0%
Yeah, "what the heck" is right.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:20.146 line:0%
-Fake children. Fake children.
-No. We are not!

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:21.747 line:0%
-Fake children.
-No. We're not fake.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.249 line:0%

Play with the kids?

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:27.620 line:0%
What's fun about them?

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.622 line:0%
Now, first off,
you're the foreman.

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:31.958 line:0%
Okay? You're
the chief electrician.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:34.327
Now, this is a contract, okay?

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.163
Now, this guy, he's
gonna want to take a kickback

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:38.631
for everything you do.

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:40.333
Now, bring me three yellow ones.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.236
The yellows are the illegals
that we hire to do the job

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.904
that the guys
in workman comp won't.

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:46.706
And that's the way to treat
an illegal--

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:48.207
just throw 'em right on there.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.076
So these guys
are gonna do the work.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.544
The foreman's
gonna get a kickback,

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:53.713
but he's gonna have to pay
the Mob guys.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.082
Now, the Mob guys,
they talk to me, okay?

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:58.317 line:0%
Only me.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.320 line:0%
This is what's so much fun about
building-- are you kidding me?

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:03.289
Oh, no! Oh, no.

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:05.525
-GIRL: Let's build it bigger.
-But this is fine.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.293
We can claim insurance on that.

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:09.795
See, now, we could just claim
a bankruptcy

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:12.231
against the construction costs.

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:14.767
Then we can sue
to lower the costs,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.336
make $40 million off a building
we don't even build.

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.871
Then take my name

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:21.340
and just slap it
on the front of this building.

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:23.376
We don't even need
to construct it.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.645
And that's how business works.

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:32.585
Now, I'm thinking about creating
a mass deportation program,

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:35.154
where we're gonna take people
who are illegal immigrants,

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:37.156
separate them
from their families

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.192
and ship them
to other countries.

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:40.760
What do you think of that?

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.962
-No. Don't do that.
-You shouldn't take them away

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:44.063
from their parents.

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:45.631
What do I do about that?

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:46.933
You could just keep them here.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.268
Sir, do you want to go,
or are you, uh...?

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:50.670
-Excuse me?
-I'm s...

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.104
Mike, get out of here.

00:02:52.137 --> 00:02:54.440
-We're making beads.
-Sorry, sir. Sorry.

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:57.176
Unbelievable. You know, you got
to have a best friend, right?

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.878
But, boy, they can get
on your nerves.

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.213
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.881
Mike's always like,
sir, this, sir, that.

00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:04.617
Oh, sir, don't do that.
Sir, sir, pull your pants up.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.053
-PENCE: Sir, I can hear you.
-All right, good.

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:09.322
-Okay.
-Maybe you'll take the note.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:12.825
Anyway, I want to give you
a friendship bracelet

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:14.660
that I've made for you.

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:18.531
Annabelle, I give you
this friendship bracelet

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:21.634
because you're now
my new best friend

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:24.103
and my only best friend
in the world.

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:28.674
Everybody else, including the
last person I was talking to,

00:03:28.707 --> 00:03:30.877
is no longer my best friend.

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:34.180
