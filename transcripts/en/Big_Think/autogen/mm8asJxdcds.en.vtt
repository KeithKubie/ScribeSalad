in unilateral disarmament they would be
 

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:27.910
in unilateral disarmament they would be
at risk let's look at the structure that

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920
at risk let's look at the structure that
 

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.100
at risk let's look at the structure that
governed the choice that those two

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.110

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.950

couldn't choose whether the Soviet Union
 

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.690
couldn't choose whether the Soviet Union
disarmed or not it could only choose

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:37.700

countries their first choice was that

the other country disarmed while they
 

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.560
the other country disarmed while they
kept their weapons let's think it

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:56.570
kept their weapons let's think it
 

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.180
kept their weapons let's think it
through from the perspective of the

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:58.190
through from the perspective of the
 

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.270
through from the perspective of the
United States if the Soviet Union

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:01.280
United States if the Soviet Union
 

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.910
United States if the Soviet Union
disarmed and the United States kept its

disarmed and the United States kept its
 

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.480
disarmed and the United States kept its
arms the United States was better off it

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:07.490
arms the United States was better off it
 

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.540
arms the United States was better off it
was getting its first choice if the

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:10.550
was getting its first choice if the
 

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.090
was getting its first choice if the
Soviet Union didn't disarm and the

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:13.100
Soviet Union didn't disarm and the
 

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.090
Soviet Union didn't disarm and the
United States kept its arms it was

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:16.100
United States kept its arms it was
 

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.180
United States kept its arms it was
better off it was getting its third

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:19.190
better off it was getting its third
 

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.400
better off it was getting its third
choice which is certainly better than

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:21.410
choice which is certainly better than
 

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.100
choice which is certainly better than
its fourth choice of unilaterally

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:24.110
its fourth choice of unilaterally
 

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.640
its fourth choice of unilaterally
disarming so the rational thing for the

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:27.650
disarming so the rational thing for the
 

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.580
disarming so the rational thing for the
United States to do regardless of what

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:30.590
United States to do regardless of what
 

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.250
United States to do regardless of what
the Soviet Union did is to keep its arms

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:33.260
the Soviet Union did is to keep its arms
 

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.280
the Soviet Union did is to keep its arms
in so doing it guaranteed that it either

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:36.290
in so doing it guaranteed that it either
 

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.970
in so doing it guaranteed that it either
gets its first choice arming without the

gets its first choice arming without the
 

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.910
gets its first choice arming without the
other country doing so or its third

other country doing so or its third
 

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.210

choice keeping its arms but at least not

giving up its arms when the other
 

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.970
giving up its arms when the other
country didn't and the situation was

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:51.980
country didn't and the situation was
 

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.970
