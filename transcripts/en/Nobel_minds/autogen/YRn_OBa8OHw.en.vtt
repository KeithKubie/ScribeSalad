you

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490
 
 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.650
 
the first of those two problems the the

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660
the first of those two problems the the
 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.150
the first of those two problems the the
reactivity of chromosomal ends had

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160
reactivity of chromosomal ends had
 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.759
reactivity of chromosomal ends had
actually been a long-standing puzzle for

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769
actually been a long-standing puzzle for
 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.339
actually been a long-standing puzzle for
many decades and this this puzzle was

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349
many decades and this this puzzle was
 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.890
many decades and this this puzzle was
defined through the work of both Herman

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900
defined through the work of both Herman
 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.120
defined through the work of both Herman
Miller and Barbara McClintock in the 30s

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130
Miller and Barbara McClintock in the 30s
 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.409
Miller and Barbara McClintock in the 30s
Miller used x-rays to create breaks in

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419
Miller used x-rays to create breaks in
 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.400
Miller used x-rays to create breaks in
DNA and mcclintock used cytogenetic

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410
DNA and mcclintock used cytogenetic
 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.460
DNA and mcclintock used cytogenetic
tricks to break chromosomes but they

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470
tricks to break chromosomes but they
 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.410
tricks to break chromosomes but they
both came to the same conclusion which

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420
both came to the same conclusion which
 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.840
both came to the same conclusion which
is that those broken ends are very

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850
is that those broken ends are very
 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.060
is that those broken ends are very
reactive and do a lot of things that

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070
reactive and do a lot of things that
 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.369
reactive and do a lot of things that
normal chromosome and never do and so

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379
normal chromosome and never do and so
 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.219
normal chromosome and never do and so
this is a diagram and illustration of

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229
this is a diagram and illustration of
 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.890
this is a diagram and illustration of
the famous breakage fusion bridge cycle

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900
 
 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.049
 
explored by mcclintock and the basic

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059
explored by mcclintock and the basic
 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.460
explored by mcclintock and the basic
observation is that if you have a

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470
observation is that if you have a
 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.630
observation is that if you have a
chromosome with a broken end after DNA

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640
chromosome with a broken end after DNA
 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.390
chromosome with a broken end after DNA
replication you get two ends which join

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400
replication you get two ends which join
 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.630
replication you get two ends which join
together you now have a chromosome which

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640
together you now have a chromosome which
 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.179
together you now have a chromosome which
has two centromeres when the centromeres

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189
has two centromeres when the centromeres
 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.480
has two centromeres when the centromeres
are pulled into towards opposite poles

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490
are pulled into towards opposite poles
 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.349
are pulled into towards opposite poles
during cell division the DNA or the

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359
during cell division the DNA or the
 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.599
during cell division the DNA or the
chromosome in between is broken again

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:25.609
chromosome in between is broken again
 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.090
chromosome in between is broken again
and now you get back to where you

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100
and now you get back to where you
 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.560
and now you get back to where you
started with so you go through cycles of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570
started with so you go through cycles of
 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.410
started with so you go through cycles of
fusion and breakage and a consequence of

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420
fusion and breakage and a consequence of
 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.690
fusion and breakage and a consequence of
this is that you're spinning off cells

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700
this is that you're spinning off cells
 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.639
this is that you're spinning off cells
which have lost important parts of

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649
which have lost important parts of
 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.300
which have lost important parts of
chromosomes are so many dead cells that

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310
chromosomes are so many dead cells that
 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.349
chromosomes are so many dead cells that
are generated in this process and normal

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359
are generated in this process and normal
 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.230
are generated in this process and normal
chromosome ends never do this kind of

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240
chromosome ends never do this kind of
 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.059
chromosome ends never do this kind of
thing so it was clear that there was

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069
thing so it was clear that there was
 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.069
thing so it was clear that there was
something very special and different

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079
something very special and different
 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.289
something very special and different
going on at the ends of normal

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299
going on at the ends of normal
 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.069
going on at the ends of normal
chromosomes but at the time of this work

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079
chromosomes but at the time of this work
 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.859
chromosomes but at the time of this work
it wasn't even known that DNA was the

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869
it wasn't even known that DNA was the
 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.199
it wasn't even known that DNA was the
genetic material so they had no way to

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209
genetic material so they had no way to
 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.719
genetic material so they had no way to
think molecularly about what was going

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729
think molecularly about what was going
 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.430
think molecularly about what was going
on

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440
on
 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.500
on
