00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.270
Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course
European History.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.730
So, remember back in May of 1453 when the
Ottomans smashed the thick walls of Constantinople,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.749
captured the city, and beheaded the Byzantine
emperor?

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:16.890
You probably don’t remember May of 1453,
come to think of it, but you remember learning

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.890
about it.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.470
It was a bit of a footnote in our first episode,
but you never know when the footnotes are

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.920
going to be very important, but that one really
did change the world.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.759
With the Ottomans now also controlling much
of southeastern Europe, they established a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.989
navy, which they used in the Black, Adriatic,
and other seas in the region.

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.240
Ottoman domination meant that European kingdoms
and empires needed to find different paths

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.980
to Afroeurasian trading routes--which ultimately
helped spark the voyages of explorers from

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.980
the Iberian peninsula.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:58.390
INTRO
So we’ve talked already in this series about

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.870
the importance of shifting perspective when
looking at history, and today we’re going

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.530
to ask you to shift perspective several times,
but let’s begin with the perspective of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.530
the Portuguese.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.600
In the fifteenth century, Portugal was poor,
and it became more so as the Ottomans contested

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.790
their access to overland trade.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.210
But luckily for Portugal, the fourth son of
their king was Prince Henry, who came to be

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.650
called The Navigator because he funded and
encouraged exploration, the study of navigation,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.580
and the development of new tools to aid in
navigation.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.780
The Portuguese began to increase their travels
along the Mediterranean’s southern shore.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.200
And by the mid-15th century, they were venturing
southward along the Atlantic coast of Africa,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.700
where they expected to find vast wealth.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.509
In those days, Africa was rich in food, salt,
gold, and slaves.

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.930
Mansa Musa, the Malian king who made a spectacular
hajj to Mecca in 1324-1325, was legendary

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.040
and very inspiring to the Portuguese.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.469
He had an entourage of 60,000 people including
12,000 slaves and huge quantities of gold.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.860
He seemed like the model of what the Portuguese
hoped to become by traveling to Africa: that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.990
is, rich beyond imagining.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.820
In this pursuit of food, slaves, and gold,
the Portuguese gradually made their way down

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.000
the African coast, locating island clusters
like the Canaries.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.100
And they kidnapped local people to sell into
European slave markets and began dotting the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.250
coast with stone fortresses that doubled as
trading stations.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.720
And there, many European men partnered with
African women and started families.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.850
These women were often themselves traders
and would be crucial for all European nations;

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.320
because they were the main force behind local
markets and regional trade networks, and they

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.070
provided essential connections to trade.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.530
Again, most of the Portuguese explorers were
poor, and many of these female traders were

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.510
wealthy and successful.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.100
From their perspective, Portuguese traders
offered them access to new markets and access

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.100
to new goods.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.680
I know we’re all very accustomed to thinking
of Europe as rich and Africa as poor, but

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.320
that frame is both relatively new and way
too essentializing--the truth as always resists

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.320
simplicity.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.540
So in 1488, Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape
of Good Hope, or, as it was called at the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.900
time, the Cape of Storms.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.280
And then the Portuguese ventured further afield
into the Indian Ocean.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.740
When we talk about explorers and exploring,
we often conjure up images of intrepid groups

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.850
wearing hats trekking through empty lands
in search of hidden treasures, but that was

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.390
certainly not the reality when, for instance,
Vasco De Gama reached India in 1498 and found

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.740
a highly developed Indian Ocean commerce with
trading posts run by sophisticated Muslim

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.740
merchants.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.080
Da Gama’s instincts were to menace and fight
them and he did.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.000
And when the Portuguese reached Southeast
Asia and China, they found a cornucopia of

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.580
goods that Europeans came to crave and about
whose production they hadn’t the slightest

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.090
knowledge: colorful, washable cottons, and
finely crafted porcelain, also tea.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.090
Where would we be without Tea?

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.140
Well, I’d be fine, actually.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.510
I’d just drink coffee.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.510
What’s that?

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.080
Oh, Stan informs me that coffee also isn’t
from Europe.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.810
By the seventeenth century, the Portuguese
were importing millions of pieces of porcelain

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.160
into Europe along with lots of delicious spices.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.230
And spices were not only important for flavouring,
but also for food preservation.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.390
Which I suppose is a kind of flavouring if
you like your food not-mouldy tasting.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.750
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.660
The Portuguese “empire” was, at first
anyway, a trading empire,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.640
with small and agile ships known as caravels
patrolling ports and collecting large fees.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.550
The wealth would be extracted from controlling
shipping and trading routes,

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.180
as the Ottomans were doing in the eastern
Mediterranean.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.350
In contrast, the Spanish empire, which began
in 1492 with the exploratory voyages of Genoese

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.160
ship captain Christopher Columbus,
was based on colonies--

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.630
that is, rather than controlling trade routes,
the empire would control the land itself and

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.290
the people who lived there,
and extract wealth from them to enrich the

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.290
empire.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.610
Columbus was a student of geography and maps
and he’d lobbied the Portuguese king to

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.720
back his voyages.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.320
But when that didn’t go to plan, he headed
for Spain to petition its devoutly Catholic

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.700
rulers,
Queen Isabella of Castile and King Ferdinand

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.100
of Aragon.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.980
These two monarchs were finishing up the drive
to expel Muslims from Spain

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.630
and to force Spanish Jews to convert to Christianity.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.980
But religious persecution wasn’t cheap.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.460
The motto of the Iberian pathfinders—God,
gold, and glory—perfectly described their

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.460
ambitions.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.060
Although perhaps not in that order.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.850
Hopping the islands along the African coast
and using the trade winds,

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.500
Columbus’s ships made it to the Caribbean
islands,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.230
and his crews, which tellingly included both
clergy and bankers,

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.370
found signs of gold but not great quantities
of it.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.210
However, they did find people to enslave,
and because no one knew the size or shape

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.090
of the Americas,
there was the perpetual hope that gold or

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.510
other riches
might lie just on the other side of this river,

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.080
or that mountain.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.080
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.810
So I want to stop here to shift perspective:
From the perspective of European explorers,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.160
these lands were new, and potentially very
lucrative, and the colonization model that

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.220
Spain adopted, and that Portugal began using
in Brazil, and that the rest of Europe’s

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.380
empires would eventually use, was built on
the idea that colonies existed for the benefit

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.560
and enrichment of the colonizers--and secondarily
to convert human souls to Christianity.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.250
Much of the wealth that was generated by these
empires was done so by claiming human beings

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.200
as a form of property--both through the slave
trade and through forcing colonized people

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.200
to work.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.419
And the systems that were built to support
the colonies--from roads and bridges to churches--were

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:57.910
built to extract wealth and convert people
to Christianity.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.110
So from the perspective of indigenous people
living in colonized communities, colonization

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:09.030
meant impoverishment in many forms--the loss
of land for use, the loss of life itself at

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.910
an unprecedented scale, the loss of long-held
religious beliefs, and the loss of all sorts

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.480
of community assets.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.160
But from the colonziers’ perspective, it
meant the possibility of getting rich, and

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.850
so waves of ambitious sailors followed Columbus,
searching both North and South America for

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.370
extractable wealth.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.370
OK.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.520
Another breakthrough occurred in 1519-22,
when Ferdinand Magellan’s Spanish ships

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.570
circumnavigated the globe.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.290
Magellan had alienated members of the Portuguese
court and like Columbus he found no backing

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.460
for his proposed trip there.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.550
Also like Columbus, he went to Spain to fund
his voyage.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:53.650
If you were going to be somewhere between
1519 and 1522, on one of Magellan’s ships

00:07:53.650 --> 00:08:00.200
was not necessarily the best place.The conditions
and Magellan’s no-nonsense discipline caused

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.970
mutinies and other problems which Magellan
also handled harshly, executing or marooning

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.130
mutineering captains in the fleet.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.320
But after finding the straits at the tip of
South America, the fleet set out across the

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.720
Pacific, eventually returning to Spain despite
Magellan’s death at the hands of local leaders

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.360
in the Philippines in 1521.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:27.850
Of the 237 original voyagers and five ships,
only eighteen men and one ship returned to

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.400
Spain in 1522.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:35.349
But, the voyage arranged and headed by Magellan
was a revelation, it opened the world up to

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:42.800
global transportation, exchange, settlement,
and yes, global slavery, warfare, pandemics,

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.650
and conquest.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:49.520
The Spanish could now stock their new world
settlements with Chinese and Indian luxuries

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.810
by crossing the Pacific and fill their coffers
from profits in New World goods by crossing

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:55.810
the Atlantic.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:01.670
In 1519, Spanish invader Hernan Cortés came
in contact with indigenous people in present-day

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.560
Mexico, landing on its Mayan eastern coast
with several hundred soldiers and making his

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.600
way inland, starting battles and forging alliances.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.570
He eventually reached the center of the Aztec
empire at Tenochtitlan, the Spaniards were

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:21.000
astonished at the wealth of this civilization
and Cortes bowed before its king, Montezuma

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.330
II, who led a vast empire that stretched to
present-day Honduras and Nicaragua.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.890
The capital had tens of thousands of inhabitants,
perhaps hundreds of thousands.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.630
Markets overflowed with luscious produce and
crafts, and the city had a sophistication

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:42.110
that, like the wealth itself, was foreign
to Europeans, even if the Aztec practice of

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.370
human sacrifice was also foreign.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:49.330
A similar awe filled Francisco Pizarro when
he saw the superb textiles and silver and

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:54.810
gold objects crafted by the Incas, who’d
also created thousands of miles of roads and

00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:00.130
efficient institutions to hold their vast
empire together along the west coast of present-day

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.360
South America.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.960
Both Pizarro and Cortes relied on help from
rival indigenous communities to help them

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.610
take control from the Incas and Aztecs.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.680
The conquerors also married the princesses
and other noble women they had raped as a

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.450
ritual of domination.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:20.590
And marriage gave them access to insider information,
local networks, and the wealth that such women

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.320
possessed—including wealth in enslaved peoples.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:28.780
So, Iberians were incentivized to set sail
by their poverty and by their Catholic faith,

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:33.529
but they were disadvantaged by a comparative
lack of manufacturing skills when it came

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:34.600
to trade.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.910
What they did have, at least at first, was
sailing prowess and weaponry on their side.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.330
Iberian caravels were nimble and they could
be loaded with cannons.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.610
The Portuguese borrowed the use of triangular
sails from the Arabs, often combining them

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.650
with square-rigged ones to make better use
of the winds.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:56.440
And Iberians also employed a range of navigational
instruments—technology generally taken from

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.780
other cultures—in determining latitude,
while their on-board cartographers created

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:06.280
portolan charts--literally, charts related
to ports--indicating coastal dangers, good

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.490
harbors, and other details important to seafarers.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:14.500
Astrolabes, quadrants, compasses, and other
instruments gave good indications of location

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.000
and direction but you know what you really
needed?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
A clock.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.240
That’s right, there’s a clock in the center
of the world.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.899
This six dollar clock is an astonishing piece
of technology.

00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:28.710
Stan would like me to point out that it was
actually eight dollars.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.520
Thank you for your support on Patreon.com/crashcourse
it wasn’t until the eighteenth century development

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.880
of the chronometer that sailors could chart
longitudinal location, and even now, GPS relies

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.899
on an extremely precise knowledge of the time.

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:45.400
In short when it comes to history and also
everything else, it’s not just a question

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.839
of where you are, it’s a question of when
you are.

00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:53.990
Early European explorers almost always had
to enlist local people to advise them how

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:59.540
to navigate the seas, especially the Indian
ocean, and local, non-European traders served

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:04.420
as intermediaries for the artisans in porcelain,
cotton, and other crafted products.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.610
Through them, Europeans slowly learned about
trading procedures, sources of goods, and

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.240
the means of judging quality, as initially
the Iberians were not well acquainted with

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.260
the goods available in these trading ports.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.899
And there were other go-betweens, like translators,
connecting Europeans and local people.

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:24.700
One example is Malinche (or Doña Maria, as
the Spanish called her).

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:30.060
She facilitated the passage of Hernan Cortes
and his small army across Mexico and into

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:35.000
the capital of the Aztec empire, gathering
allies for him and warning him of impending

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.860
danger along the way.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:43.620
Because of the hostility among different groups,
go-betweens who knew about the animosities

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.190
and warfare among them could help mobilize
support for the Europeans, so that one local

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.760
group would lead the charge against another.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.810
That happened in the conquest of both Central
America in the 1520s and the Inca Empire in

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.050
the 1530s.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:02.120
In Europe meanwhile, all of this voyaging
and conquering produced chaos between the

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.970
Iberian kingdoms--what land would be Spain’s,
and what land would be Portugal’s?

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.410
A treaty sponsored by the Church eventually
settled disputes between Spain and Portugal

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.300
over territory that each was claiming.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.830
I mean, who do you call about property disputes,
if not the pope?

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:21.270
The Treaty of Tordesillas, which was signed
in 1494, provided a permanent line of demarcation

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:27.440
370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands
off the Atlantic coast of Africa.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.399
In 1529, another treaty set bounds for each
country in the Indian Ocean and Pacific regions.

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:37.790
But treaties of course did not prevent the
death at the hands of European weaponry and

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.610
diseases that contact entailed.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:44.330
In the Western Hemisphere, the local inhabitants’
lack of resistance to European diseases was

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.550
probably a more important factor than in conquest
than weaponry was.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:53.339
In the long run, violence, enslavement, and
European diseases like smallpox and measles

00:13:53.339 --> 00:13:59.540
led to the death of perhaps as much as ninety
percent of the indigenous American population.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:04.300
Diseases spread and killed so quickly that
entire communities ceased to exist almost

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.670
--- at once, and with them their traditions,
stories, and values.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:13.950
Meanwhile, colonization proved extremely lucrative
for Spain and Portugal, which within a century

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:20.460
went from being poor kingdoms to astonishingly
rich ones, especially after 1545, when the

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.730
Spanish uncovered a huge deposit of silver
in Potosi, in present day Bolivia, and began

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.620
conscripting indigenous people to do the most
dangerous work in the mines.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:35.260
Migration to both regions swelled, and ships
now criss-crossed both Atlantic and the Pacific.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:40.250
And this huge influx of wealth to Spain and
Portugal would reshape power in Europe and

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:47.400
also life everywhere else, as everything from
microbes to ideas suddenly had a truly global

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.750
reach.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:49.750
Thanks for watching.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.755
I’ll see you next time.
