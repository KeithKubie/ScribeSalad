00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.070
Oh hi, Michelle.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.260
It's Colin Heywood from Anderson &amp; Sheppard.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.940
Very well, thank you.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.000
How are you?

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.860
Yes, it's going very well, thanks, and just
want to say how honored we are to be involved

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.120
and thank you for selecting us to showcase
our suit.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.040
Can I just run through the details with you?

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.000
So, it's going to be a three-piece, single-breasted
suit, isn't it?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.300
In a plain navy blue hopsack material.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.410
And I've got the fabric here in front of me.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.200
So, it's a Smith fabric, which is one of the
companies we use a lot.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.820
Yes, it's a nice classic blue, so it's going
to, you know, really showcase

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.300
our sort of cut.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.420
–Four.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.900
–Four.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.660
–Eighteen and a half.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.440
–Eighteen and a half.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.540
–Thirty two.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.620
–Thirty two.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.320
–Forty three.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.060
–Forty three.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm looking for the length of the coat.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.890
But what we're also doing is we're going to find

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.640
out the natural waist.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.260
–Relax please, sir.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.380
You just have to press and if someone is standing right

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.470
what'll happen is their center of gravity

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.080
it's like a see-saw, you can just press it
and it starts to topple forward naturally.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.640
So, on Matthew, we're probably going around
18 1/2.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.600
Then down to the length of the coat.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.460
42.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.460
We go to the back of the knee, which on the
measurements is 43.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.880
For me, I'd probably just come a fraction
longer, sir.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.010
The cuff on the shirt looks a little short.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.613
If the shirt were a little longer, I'd bring
the cuff down.

00:02:28.613 --> 00:02:29.590
Just a fraction.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.820
Once again, we can have a look at the fitting
stage and determine if need to make any adjustments.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.500
–Twenty five.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.020
–Twenty five.  –Right.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.180
At the end of the day, our customers could
be wearing a suit all day long.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.860
It needs to obviously look and fit beautifully.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.320
But at the same time, we want it to be practical.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.480
We want that practical elegance.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.900
So, throughout the day, you're wearing a suit
for twelve hours

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.820
you feel like it's a second skin.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.480
You can move about it in.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.940
You can function in it.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.960
It is comfortable to wear for twelve hours

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.000
every business day.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.680
We're probably looking at about four weeks
for a fitting

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.500
And I'll see you and we'll slip your jacket on.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.220
We'll see you in four weeks.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.330
My colleague, Mr. Malone, will come in and
take some trousers now.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.380
Thank you very much, sir.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.360
–John Malone.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.720
–Pleasure to meet you. Matthew.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.860
–Alright.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.100
How are you going to support them?

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.360
–Umm.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.360
–With side straps?

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.220
–I'd say so, yeah.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.100
–Cut high in the waist?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.260
–Yeah, I'm having a waist coat.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.400
–You're having a waist coat, okay.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.000
–Forty-five.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.380
So a couple of things we'll always do.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.900
Make sure the cloth is flat.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.900
Make sure the edges are together.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.960
Okay.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.720
Shears.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.580
All the cutters and all the tailors have their
own shears.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.680
Obviously, our cutting shears are quite large,
quite weighty.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.120
We know our own shears.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.880
First line of polish in the cutting room is

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.460
I'd be able to pick out my shears blind-folded.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.060
Obviously, tape measure, which we always have.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.410
String is not.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.340
And then the other main...it's very simple
really.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.100
We are not overly reliant on technology.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.820
This little symbol here just means it's also
a jetted pocket.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.750
You'll find all sorts of customer requests.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:48.790
One customer used to have a pocket in the
back of his jacket and the reason for it was

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.480
when he was on a plane he could put his passport
in and his ticket.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.340
So it was always easy to get his tickets

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.620
and he didn't have to go fumbling.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.170
That's the beauty of what we're doing.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.060
Being bespoke

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.680
the customer can ask for these requests

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.060
and we will try and sort them out

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.120
these little details and these quirks.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.280
And that's the beauty of it.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.560
That's why it's bespoke.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.090
This is what the cutters do at this stage.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.960
This is where the cutter is deciding where
to take shape and stuff.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:28.620
At the next level is where the tailor will
also then do what he does, and he'll start

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.370
to shape it by manipulating the cloth.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.740
Because what it's all about with the cutters
and the tailors

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.620
is putting the necessary marks

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.140
to shape the suppression and manipulating the cloth

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.470
to turn something that's two-dimensional

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:49.080
and flat into a three-dimensional object to
place over the individual.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.400
Alright.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.920
What we do, we check the balance.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:11.140
Armhole pitch, waist, suppression, waistline
throughout...

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.320
You see the bottom of the coat

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:20.020
and this is our little marking signal for
slits at side.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.690
At this end here are the sleeves.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.211
So, we start to parcel it all up.

00:08:27.211 --> 00:08:31.776
What will happen is once I've put these together...

00:08:31.776 --> 00:08:34.150
So you've got the fundamental

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.220
building blocks of the garment.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
This is where nothing goes to waste.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.519
So we've got the top collar, what we call
the top collar.

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:46.900
I'm obviously marking directions

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.360
of the grain of the cloth

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.620
just to help and aid the tailor

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.620
again.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.140
You've got to think, there's gonna be the
flaps.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.420
There's gonna be jettings.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.520
Job ticket.
