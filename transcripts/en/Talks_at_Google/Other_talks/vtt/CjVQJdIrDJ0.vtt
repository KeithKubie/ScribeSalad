00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.200
&gt;&gt; John Boyd: All right. I'm John Boyd. It
is my great pleasure to introduce Professor

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.080
Kahneman today. And I just want to give you
a brief background on his outstanding career.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.310
He started in 1954 received his bachelors
in experimental psychology and mathematics

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.789
from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In
1961, he was awarded his Ph.D. from University

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:31.050
of California Berkeley right across the bay
in Experimental Psychology. In 1979, he and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.310
his coauthor Amos Tversky published their
seminal paper on Prospect Theory which started

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.800
to change the way people reframed the argument
around gains, losses, and decision-making

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.219
under uncertainty. Several years later in
2002, Professor Kahneman was awarded the Nobel

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.130
Prize largely on the work of Prospect Theory
of. And Nobel Prize isn't always impressive;

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.559
his perhaps more so because there isn't a
Nobel Prize in psychology. He had to win his

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.550
Nobel Prize in economics. And as far as I
know, there's only one other person, one other

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.830
psychologist, who's won a Nobel Prize and
that's Ivan Pavlov. He may be a physiologist,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.940
we could argue about that. Years later, in
2007, Psychologist tried to reclaim Professor

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.710
Kahneman as one of their own when the American
Psychological Association awarded him Lifetime

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.250
Distinguished Contribution Award. And today
he is a Senior Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.640
School of Public and International Affairs
at Princeton University and he's here to talk

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.050
about his new book Thinking Fast and Slow.
Now Google's mission which we all know is

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.970
to take the world's information and to make
it more useful and universally accessible.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.410
And all information, all knowledge, is important,
but I think some again is more important than

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.630
others. Because the information that he'll
present today I think it's very personal;

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.740
it's about each of us. And, if you'll listen
carefully it's going to change the way you

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.340
think about yourself and the world around
you. So please join me in welcoming Professor

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.910
Kahneman to Google.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.910
[Applause]

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:23.900
&gt;&gt; Kahneman: Thank you. Well, I think intuition
has been discussed a lot in recent years and

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.370
I'll be talking about intuition. There are
two camps in this discussion naturally there

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.090
is the pro and the con. And of course, many
people here will have read Malcolm Gladwell

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.530
Blink which although it's not unconditional
defense of intuition, it certainly gave people

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:52.850
the impression that sometimes we magically
know things without knowing why we know them.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.470
Within the discipline of psychology and the
decision making there is a group and it is

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.540
headed by a very interesting figure called
Gary Kline who wrote a book that I recommend.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.260
Its Sources of Power is one of his books that
I would recommend the most warmly. And they

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:22.460
are great believers in expert intuition. The
other side there are skeptics about intuition

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.010
in general and including expert intuition.
And I have long been counted as one of the

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:36.440
skeptics because my early work with Amos Tversky
was about intuitive errors and flaws and biases

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.860
of intuitive thinking. Today you find that
discussion in many places and for example

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.110
in medicine among the popular writers; two
writers both of whom write for the New Yorker,

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.880
Jerome Groopman and Atul Gawande. They clearly
differ. Atul Gawande is in favor of formal

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.730
systems, very skeptical about human judgment
and wanting to prove all the time and Jerome

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.560
Groopman being in fact, although he doesn't
quite admit he really likes good old fashioned

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.400
medical intuition. Of course he likes physicians
well-educated. But he doesn't like formal

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.130
system and the issue in medicine is "What
are the role of evidence based medicine and

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:32.680
how do you allocate that with 
the function of intuition?" The background

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.629
actually, part of the background for what
I'll talk about today is a strange collaboration

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:41.599
in which I engaged with about eight years
with Gary Klein, whom I mentioned. He is a

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.460
guru of a group of people who really, I wouldn't
say they despise what I do but they certainly

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.259
don't like what I do because they think that
the emphasis and biases of judgment has drawn

00:04:53.259 --> 00:05:01.300
an unjustly unfavorable picture of the human
mind. And by and large I am inclined to agree.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.259
Seven or eight years ago I invited him and
we worked together for a number of years trying

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.560
to figure out where is the boundary? Where
is intuition marvelous and where is it flawed?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.499
And I think we can tell. And we wrote a paper
at the end of six or seven years with a lot

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:25.749
of vicissitudes that we went through since
we basically don't agree. We wrote a paper

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:33.020
the title of which was A Failure to Disagree,
because on the substance I think we know and

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.569
we both agree where you can trust intuition
and where you cannot. Emotionally we haven't

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:46.360
changed. He still hates the biases and doesn't
think that errors of experts are very funny

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.529
and I think that errors of experts are quite
funny [laughter] so that's a difference right

00:05:51.529 --> 00:06:00.090
there. There are two modes of thinking that
all of us are familiar with. And there is

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:06.939
one mode, one way for thoughts that come to
mind and listen to this. You know about this

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:12.150
lady that she's I think adjust as quickly
as you know her hair is dark. And it's interesting

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.820
to dwell a bit about this. It is this is not
something that the judgment that she is angry,

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.039
the impression that she is angry. Doesn't
feel like something you did. It feels like

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:29.619
something that happens. It happens to me.
We have the basic experience is a passive

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:35.610
experience in those judgments. And that is
true of perception, when we see the world

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:42.509
we don't decide to see it. It is true of impression.
And it is true in general what we call intuitive

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:49.650
thinking. It just happens. It comes from somewhere.
And we are not the author of it. Now, there

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:56.649
is another way that thoughts come to mind
and here I suppose essentially nothing came

00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:05.740
to your mind, but the answer is 408. To produce
the 408, requires a completely different kind

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.610
of operation. You have to retrieve the program
that you learned in school. The program consists

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.979
of steps. You have to go through the steps.
You've got to pay attention successively to

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:21.770
partial products and so on. And keep things
in mind and keep the whole program in mind.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.800
This is how it works. This is something that
you do. It is not something that happens to

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:37.919
you. And there are many indications that this
is how it works. One is that Physiology indicates

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:42.629
and this is how it works: pupil dilates. This
is something that I studies many, many years

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:47.629
ago that people really on a program like that
if you're on a problem like that if you're

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:56.059
going to do it in your head, your pupil will
dilate. The area will increase by about 50%

00:07:56.059 --> 00:08:01.319
as soon as you engage in that. And it will
stay dilated as long as you're working and

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:08.869
it will sort of collapse back to normal size
either when you quit or when you find the

00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:14.740
answer. So this is another way thoughts come
to mind. And this is definitely not the intuitive

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:21.149
way. Here we are we feel a sense of urgency.
We feel something deliberate is happening

00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:28.960
and a very important aspect of it this is
effortful and what psychologists mean by effort

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.190
is basically, if you want the quick introduction
to what effort is, this is something you cannot

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:41.229
do while making a left turn into traffic.
You cannot do it and you shouldn't try. And

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:47.940
the reason is that there is limited capacity
to exert effort. And if you are engaged that

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:57.120
capacity or those resources at one task less
is available for another task. Now, there

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.350
is another function of System 2. And here
I'm going to tell you a riddle. Most of you

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:09.790
are familiar with it. A bat and a ball together
costs 1.10. The bat costs more than the ball.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:16.130
Of course how much does the ball cost? How
many people know this riddle by the way? Oh,

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:22.790
okay. So it's still usable. The point about
this riddle is that the number came to your

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:30.990
mind. And the number is ten cents. And everybody
just, I think. Maybe here they're exception,

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.690
very few exceptions. People confess that the
number ten cents immediately came to mind.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:44.579
Now, it's wrong. Ten cents and dollar 10 is
a dollar 20. The solution is five cents. What

00:09:44.579 --> 00:09:55.200
is interesting here is that at Princeton,
at MIT at Harvard and I don't know about Stanford

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:03.060
or CalTech about 50% of students asked this
question of undergraduates say ten cents.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:09.100
And we learn something very interesting when
somebody says ten cents. We learn that they

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:16.259
didn't check because if they had checked,
they wouldn't say ten cents. So, there is

00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:23.129
a sense of confidence that people have that
these people in particular have and it brings

00:10:23.129 --> 00:10:30.300
us to another function of what I'll call System
2. System 1 is the intuitive one; they perform

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:40.709
those automatic and activities and System
2 is the effortful one the one that the deliberate

00:10:40.709 --> 00:10:48.140
one. And the reason that I classify this as
System 2 operation is that self-control and

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:55.870
controlling your attention and deliberate
exertion of effort are impaired when by other

00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:04.950
activities. So, if for example, a trivial
example, if somebody is asked to retain seven

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:10.380
digits in their head and you then give them
a choice between chocolate cake, sinful chocolate

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:15.480
cake and virtuous fruit salad they're more
likely to choose the chocolate cake than they

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.910
would if they didn't have seven digits in
their head. It takes effort to control your

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:31.730
impulses even such mild impulses as a preference
for chocolate cake. So 

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:37.519
you should be aware of that difference between
System 1 operations, the automatic ones and

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:44.629
System 2 operations, the deliberate ones,
it comes very clearly when in driving. So

00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:51.790
driving is a skill. And any skilled activity
measure of skill is that things begin to happen

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:58.879
automatically. So you can drive and conduct
a conversation. You cannot make a left turn

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:05.670
into traffic, but by and large, we can drive
and talk. So driving is largely automatic.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:11.290
Braking, when there is any sign of danger,
braking is completely automatic. That is,

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:17.420
you can notice while you're braking, but you
first respond so that the response is immediate,

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:26.300
it is fully automatic. Now, in some places,
not here where people drive in snow or ice,

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:33.339
they learn about skids. And then, occasionally,
you'll find yourself as a driver in a skid.

00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:38.670
And then System 2 will be mobilized because
in a skid you're not supposed to do anything

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.860
that comes naturally to you. You shouldn't
brake and you shouldn't steer away from the

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:48.660
skid. You should leave the brakes alone and
steer into the skid, completely non-intuitive.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:57.050
Now, when people have a lot of practice with
skids that too becomes automatic. So one thing

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:03.510
that we can tell about System 1 and System
2 those two types of operations, is some of

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:11.170
the basic innate operations, functions that
we have such as having emotional reactions

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:19.779
to things, all this is System 1. We don't
choose to do it. It just happens to us. But

00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:28.089
also System 1 is where skill is. That is when
we get to be skilled at something it becomes

00:13:28.089 --> 00:13:34.370
automatic and it demands your resources and
we get to be very good at it. Now, the issue

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:41.310
of intuition and here I'm not sure, but I
suspect that Malcolm Gladwell really did us

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:46.459
a disservice by giving us a sense there is
magic to intuition. There really is no magic

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:54.800
at all and we should understand how it works.
Intuition and Herbert Simon who was Psychologist

00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:00.130
then and economist and a political scientist
Nobel Laureate, Herbert Simon gave a very

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:06.300
good definition about what intuition is. It
is simply recognition. There is really no

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:12.040
difference between the physician recognizing
a disease, you know, a particular disease

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:18.670
from a facial expression or something and
a little child learning, pointing to something

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:24.589
and saying doggie. The little child has no
idea what the clues are but he just said.

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:33.000
He just knows this is dog without knowing
why he knows. And once you think about it

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.290
this way, this really demystifies intuition
to a very considerable extent. And it also

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:46.471
leads you to sort of a solution to the problem
Gary Klein and I were trying to solve. When

00:14:46.471 --> 00:14:53.580
can you trust intuition and when can't you?
And then it becomes an issue of is the world

00:14:53.580 --> 00:15:02.600
regular enough so that you can learn to recognize
things? Or and then did that particular individual

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:09.639
have an opportunity to learn the regularities
of the world? And so, the world of chess players

00:15:09.639 --> 00:15:14.670
is highly regular. And statistically, the
world of poker players is very regular. So

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:22.300
there is an element of chance, but there are
rules and the mind is so set that if there

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:28.470
are rules in the environment and we're exposed
to them for a long time, and we get immediate

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:34.559
feedback on what is right and wrong, or fairly
immediate feedback, we would acquire those

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:43.649
rules. So all of us have expert intuition
even if we are not physicians and we're not

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:53.370
master chess players. I recognize my wife's
mood from one word on the telephone. You know,

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:58.779
most of you can do that. There's people that
you know very well. All of us recognize dangerous

00:15:58.779 --> 00:16:05.439
driver on the next lane. And you know we get
cues and we don't necessarily know what is

00:16:05.439 --> 00:16:11.520
the cue but this person is driving erratically
and could do something dangerous. And this

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:20.910
is a lot of reinforced practice and we're
very good at that. We can learn about those,

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:31.720
there are differences. Among experts, among
professionals, in the level of expertise that

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:37.639
they have and they depend in the level of
intuitive expertise that they can develop.

00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:43.649
So for example, compare anesthesiologists
to radiologists. Anesthesiologists get very

00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:49.100
good feedback, an immediate feedback whenever
they do anything wrong. You know they have

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:57.439
those measurements in real time. Radiologists
get really miserable feedback about whether

00:16:57.439 --> 00:17:03.270
they're right or wrong. So you could expect
an anesthesiologist to develop intuition much

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:10.770
more than you would expect radiologist to
develop intuition. And so, that is part of

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:18.130
the answer about intuitive expertise. We don't
need to disagree about that because we know

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:24.960
pretty much when intuitive expertise is likely
to develop. And as I said, we also that means

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:31.510
that intuitive expertise is not going to develop
in a chaotic universe or in a chaotic world.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:40.540
So for example, I personally do not believe
that that's stopped because people pick stocks

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:47.430
to invest in can develop intuition because
simply the market takes care of it. There

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:53.380
isn't enough regularity in what's going to
happen to prices for intuitions to develop.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:18:00.030
We also know about political forecasters when
they forecast long-term, they are really no

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:07.000
better than a dart-throwing monkey. And they
are certainly not better than the average

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.410
reader of the New York Times. Intuitions and
the reason it's not the pundit's fault. And

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:20.740
that research has been done with pundits and
CIA analysts and regional experts. It is really

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:26.770
not their fault that they cannot predict the
long range future 10 or 15 years. They are

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:31.820
quite good at short-term predictions. They
are really not good at all in long-term predictions.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:38.550
It's not their fault. It's the fault of the
world. The world is probably not predictable.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:43.611
And if the world is not predictable, then
you are not going to predict it. When there

00:18:43.611 --> 00:18:50.750
are marginal situations where there is some
predictability but poor formulas do better

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:58.700
than individuals. That is the domain where
formulas beat individuals regularly is a domain

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.920
of fairly low predictability. Because when
there are weak cues, people are not very good

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:11.510
at picking them up and are not good at using
them consistently. But formulas can be generated

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:19.060
on the basis of experience and they will do
a better job than individual judgment. Okay.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:26.840
Now, I've introduced you to System 1 and System
2 and I've told you something about skill

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:39.890
and about skill in System 1. Now I'd like
to point out something that we sometimes have

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:47.411
intuitions and that applies to political forecasters
and to stock pickers and to all of us. Quite

00:19:47.411 --> 00:19:54.891
frequently we have intuitions that are false.
And they come up and come to mind and they

00:19:54.891 --> 00:20:01.880
are subjectively undistinguishable from expert
intuitions. So I'm now talking of people who

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:07.580
have intuitions that are not based on expertise.
And they come. They're System 1 in the sense

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:14.490
that they are effortless and automatic. And
where do they come from? And that is what

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:21.580
I'm going to try to illuminate, shed some
light on in the rest of the talk. So I want

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:28.600
to introduce you to System 1. And first of
all, let me get one thing clear because I

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:35.950
might forget. I use System 1 and System 2
those terms and very shocking terms in my

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:42.700
discipline. You are really not supposed to
do that. Because every psychologist gets told

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:48.400
fairly early you're not supposed to explain
what happens in the mind by invoking little

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.940
agents inside the mind and explain what the
mind does by what the little agents do. Those

00:20:53.940 --> 00:21:01.440
are homunculi and that's a bad word in psychology.
I'm going to use System 1 and System 2 absolutely

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:10.440
as homunculi. Now, what do I have to say in
my defense? First of all, well, I'm warning

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.640
you. Those are fictitious characters. They
don't exist. I don't believe there is such

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.250
a thing as System 1 and System 2. Don't look
for them in the brain, because they are not

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:23.840
two systems in the brain of which one does
one and the other does the other. So why am

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:30.020
I using this terrible language? I'm using
it because I think it's helpful. It fits the

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:35.900
way our minds work and to explain the background
of that decision of why I use System 1 and

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:48.090
System 2, I refer you to a very good book.
It's very entertaining. It's by Joshua Foer

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:55.990
and it's called Moonwalking with Einstein.
It came out earlier this year. And what the

00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:02.790
book is about. Joshua Foer, he's a science
writer. And he went to the Memory Championship

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:07.460
of the United States. You might not know there
is such a thing but there is. So people memorize

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:15.820
decks of cards and very, very long lists of
things and perform feats that we think are

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:22.280
completely extraordinary. Joshua Foer decided
to find out what happens. And a year later

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.860
he was actually the champion -- the Memory
Champion of the United States. And the book

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:34.520
is a story of how he did it. And basically
the story which was known to the Greeks in

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:41.800
some form is that memory is very, very good
at something and terrible at other things.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:48.000
Memory is terrible at remembering lists. We're
really not good at remembering lists. Memory

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.880
is superb at remembering routes through space.
That evolution, evolution has endowed us with

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:03.530
an ability to remember routes and not lists.
So now, you can trick yourself. If mentally

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:08.890
you have a list and you want to remember the
list, then you create a mental route and you

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:13.000
distribute the items on your list along the
route. And then, when you want to remember

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.170
the deck of cards or whatever it is, then
you go through your route and you pick out

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:23.580
items one after the other, because that you
can do. It turns out something very similar

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:32.690
happens in another context. People are very
good thinking about agents. The mind is set

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:41.000
really beautifully to think about agent. Agents
have traits. Agents have behaviors. We understand

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.070
agents. We form global impressions of their
personalities. We are really not very good

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:53.460
at remembering sentences where the subject
of the sentence is an abstract notion. But

00:23:53.460 --> 00:24:00.540
an agent is very, very good. So just remember
whenever I say System 1 does X what I mean

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:07.010
is x is a mental activity that can be performed
without effort. You'll remember a lot more

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:12.910
about System 1 if you think about it as doing
things than if you think of those mental activities.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:17.730
It helps me think and I think it helps other
people understand. Okay. So let me introduce

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:30.870
you to System 1. I begin with a study, just
an extreme case of this study was done at

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:38.600
the University in the UK and like in many
department of biology actually. And like many

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.360
places in the UK, they have a small room which
is a tearoom, coffee room, where people can

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:49.480
make themselves tea or coffee and get some
biscuits and there is an honesty box and they

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:57.520
pay into the honesty box. And somebody had
the bright idea of sticking a poster right

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:03.300
on top of the honesty box and of changing
the poster once a week. And so, this is week

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:17.820
one. And that's the poster. Week 2 is flowers.
Week 3 is eyes. And so on. Now, what is remarkable

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:23.190
about this is, this is something that happens
to people. They have no idea it's happening

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:28.320
to them. In fact, they have no idea about
the posters. They are barely aware there are

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.060
posters there. They certainly don't know the
posters change systemically. They have no

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:40.570
idea that the posters influence their behavior.
System 1 can do those things. Those things

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:46.710
we, a lot is happening in our mind that we
are not fully aware of. We are not aware of

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:57.220
at all in fact. And there is a link between
eyes and being watched and being watched and

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:04.200
not wanting to do bad things or wanting to
do good things. All of this is deep in our

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:10.520
associative memory and it gets activated.
You see eyes especially those large eyes on

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:18.770
week 1 and it does something to you that you
may not be aware it does. Now let me show

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:31.750
you something else. This, I just want to enumerate
very briefly what happened to you in the first

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:39.820
couple of seconds when I put this on the screen.
And first of all, you read them. You read

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.480
the words. Now, you didn't intend to read
the words. You didn't have to decide. You

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:50.400
had to read them. You had no choice in the
matter. Second, ideas and images and memories

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:56.830
came to mind probably none of them very pleasant.
So that's the second thing. Another thing

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:02.610
that happened is physical. You recoiled. This
is actually being measured. And when people

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:09.840
are exposed to threatening word, they move
back. So the threat is to some extent to some

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:18.410
slight extent taken to be real. The symbolic
threat is taken to be real. You made a disgust

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:24.480
face. You experienced disgust. And that is
getting to be interesting because those things

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:31.150
are reciprocally reinforcing. So if you make
a disgust face, you are more likely to feel

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:39.020
disgust. If you make a smiling face, you are
more likely to think that things are funny.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:44.320
So you know, one of my favorite experiments
along those lines is, you take a pencil, you

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:49.690
stick it in your mouth like that. And cartoons
will appear funnier to you. Because, when

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:57.220
you stick a pencil into your mouth like that,
you're making a smile. And just the sheer

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:04.630
muscular change is enough to feedback into
our emotions and our feelings. This is all

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:12.810
fairly important, because what it means is,
you can think of well, let me add something.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:22.530
Then I'll pull it together. I think of System
1 very largely in terms of what happens in

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:28.010
associative memory. To think of associative
memory, you can think of a gigantic network

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:32.960
of ideas. And the ideas are linked to each
other in various way, associatively, some

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:41.560
of them are causes of other things or categories,
example, instances of. There are many different

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:50.350
links but you have a huge representation of
what we have in mind. And at any one time

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:58.110
the stimulus occurs, it activates a subset
of those notes in that representation of memory

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:05.370
and then activation spreads through the associative
network; not a lot, but it spreads some. So

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:15.450
for example, you're now and we can know that
it spreads, because we become sensitized to

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:22.320
other ideas that have been activated in this
fashion. So for example, right now, if somebody

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:28.760
whispered words in your ears, you would be
much more likely to detect and recognize words

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:36.840
like sickness and smell, instinct, and nausea,
and hangover. A lot of the associations have

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:41.660
been activated. You're not aware of any of
them. You're not aware of anything. Those

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:48.140
are not conscious activations. But they are
activations nonetheless. And because those

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:55.110
ideas are partially activated, weak stimulus
is going to be sufficient to bring them over

00:29:55.110 --> 00:30:01.261
threshold. This again is a very important
function of System 1 associative memory. We

00:30:01.261 --> 00:30:09.820
are prepared basically by this spreading activation
prepares things for what might come next.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:20.140
You will be able to recognize and respond
to things more easily than before. Then something

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:32.160
else happens. And this is there are two words
here, banana vomit and you made a story. What

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:38.700
happens, you know, there is really no need
to do that, but in effect, this was sufficient

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:45.101
to create a causal link so that somehow the
bananas caused the vomit. You didn't make

00:30:45.101 --> 00:30:51.410
a conscious decision for that to happen, but
we know that's the kind of thing that happens.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:58.390
As soon as a stimulus is presented, we look
back for causes; the associative machinery

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:04.630
looks back and latches on possible causes.
Here it's very simple to find a cause and

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:10.850
you know this has an effect. So temporarily,
you know, you don't like bananas because an

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:29.650
association has been created. And that happens
because of the causal surge. So [pause] this

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:41.570
should give you a sense of one of the functions
of System 1. And to complete that, let me

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:48.090
show you something else. So this is a famous
psychological demonstration. Many of you might

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:55.240
not have seen it. You read that as A B C.
You read this as 12, 13, 14, but the B and

00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:01.320
the 13 are physically identical. So this tells
us something quite important about the way

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:10.880
that associative machinery in System 1 work
on new stimuli. Everything is made coherent.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:17.130
So, in the context of letters, that ambiguous
stimulus is going to be read as a letter.

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:22.700
In the context of numbers, it is going to
be read as a number. What is quite important,

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:28.680
two aspects here, one is the coherence and
the other is that you are not aware of the

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:35.750
ambiguity. The ambiguity is suppressed. That
is, you just get one interpretation. In this

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:40.970
case, it's a coherent interpretation. And
that is the way that the system works. It

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:50.820
generates associatively coherent representations
of reaction to situation. Associative memory

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:59.980
or System 1 is also very pository about world
knowledge. So when an event occurs, our reaction

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:05.970
to it is informed by a lot of things that
we know. And I'll give you my favorite example

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:13.640
of this. This is people are listening to sentences
while events in their brain are recorded.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:21.610
An upper class male British voice says, "I
have a large tattoo, I have large tattoos

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:28.830
all down my back." And approximately 3/10th
of a second later the brain responds with

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:37.800
a characteristically surprise. This is astonishing
if you stop to think about it. There was that

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:43.380
voice. You have to classify it as an upper
class British voice. Now upper class British

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:51.320
men don't have tattoos down their back, something
is odd and you get a surprised reaction. You

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:57.810
get a mobilization of System 2 because System
2 is the one that pays attention. Surprise

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:07.880
calls attention. A male voice saying I believe
I'm pregnant of course same thing. So this

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:15.100
system holds a world knowledge and uses a
world knowledge to classify situations as

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:24.050
normal or abnormal and it does that at top
speed. And it updates very quickly. Well,

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:34.390
I'll tell you a story about updating. It updates
what it considers normal. Now, this is an

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:39.190
anecdote. You're free not to believe me. I
believe it because it's a personal experience.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:50.620
We were some years ago on vacation in Australia
in resort all of 40 little villas and in the

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:55.830
evening we go to have dinner first evening
and we meet a psychologist from Stanford.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:03.070
Ah, surprise, coincidence and we are very
delighted to meet each other. Now, two weeks

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:14.240
later, we're in the theater in London. And
it goes dark. And we watch. And then, the

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:22.650
lights come back on and next to me, same guy.
Now, the important point is that I was less

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:31.250
surprised the second time than the first.
Because "Oh, John, he is the guy I meet everywhere."

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:35.360
[laughter]
It takes very little time to create what we

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:43.780
call "a norm." So one event, the second event
links back to the first. If I had met anybody

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:51.510
else, that is what's impressed me. If I had
met anybody else, I would have been more surprised.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:58.100
And that's odd if you think about statistically,
it's crazy. But in fact, it was very clear

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:04.200
that and I wouldn't say that I consciously
expect to see John wherever I go. But, you

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:09.160
know, if I'm going to meet someone, I'd be
prepared to meet John.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:13.850
[laughter]
Now, I've mentioned something about causal

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:20.551
thinking. And I want to give you some sense
how that works. So it's a question, which

00:36:20.551 --> 00:36:27.020
is more probable that a mother has blue eyes
if her daughter has blue eyes or her daughter

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:35.521
has blue eyes if her mother has blue eyes?
Now again, as in the bat and ball, there is

00:36:35.521 --> 00:36:40.890
an intuitive response and the intuitive response
is that it's more probable that a daughter

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:45.810
has blue eyes if her mother has blue eyes
than the other way around. If you stop to

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:51.060
do the math on the assumption that the incidence
of blue eyes is the same two generations the

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:58.670
probabilities are strictly equal but even
before you do the math, your reasoning flows

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:05.931
along causal lines. Your thinking flows along
causal lines. This happens intuitively. One

00:37:05.931 --> 00:37:13.710
of these feels okay. It feels more coherent
and the coherence that we experience can be

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:19.870
turned into a judgment of probability. That
is, the confidence that we experience is a

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:34.090
judgment of probability. Now, I'm going to
skip the other example. And I said earlier

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:42.230
that people have intuitions that are not necessarily
true. And that people are confident in judgments

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:50.900
that are not necessarily true. And I would
like to sort of present a tentative theory

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:58.780
about how that happened. And the general idea
is very straightforward. When we're asked

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:06.700
a question that we cannot answer, typically
System 1 is going to come up with the answer

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:12.310
to a related question that is easier. And
it's going to use that answer to the wrong

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:19.870
question, the question that hasn't been asked
in place of the question that was asked. We

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:25.890
call that a mechanism of substitution: substituting
an easier question for a hard one. It happens

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:31.620
automatically. People are not aware that it
happens and it is a source of many intuitions

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:37.330
that don't come from expertise and they are
much less likely to be correct than the intuitions

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:43.570
that do come from expertise but they come
with equal confidence just about. So there

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:48.180
are several mechanisms that take part in this
substitution thing and I'd like to introduce

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:55.800
them. One of them which I call the mental
shotgun is that when you are instructed to

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:01.470
perform an operation, you typically perform
other operations as well that are related

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:08.230
to it associatively, are related to the target
operation, but they are different. My favorite

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:14.520
example is, I'll say words and you are to
judge as quickly as possible whether the words

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:20.560
rhyme or not. And the first pair of words
is vote note. That's easy. The second pair

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:28.441
of questions is vote goat. And vote goat is
substantially harder than vote no. Why? Although

00:39:28.441 --> 00:39:36.190
nobody else asked you to, you spelled. And
vote goat, there is a mismatch in spelling.

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:41.930
Although they rhyme at least as I pronounce
them just as well as vote note, you have a

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:49.040
conflict and the conflict slows you down.
So typically, we compute more than we intend

00:39:49.040 --> 00:40:02.231
to compute. And we can and that allows for
substitutions to take place. So let me give

00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:10.231
you an example of the substitution here. The
question here would be, "Which of the three

00:40:10.231 --> 00:40:23.100
figures is larger on the screen?" And the
answer is, "they're equal." All three figures

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:30.120
on the screen are of equal size. But it's
a very powerful illusion. We see the figure

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:36.640
on the right as larger than the figure out
left. And we see it because we can't help

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:43.020
it. Although you were told to think of it
as a two-dimensional object, you compute the

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:47.850
three-dimensional solution in which the object
on the right is in fact larger than the object

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:55.000
on the left and that is what you see. There
are many other examples of this general process.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:04.360
Another one I like is called the dating heuristic.
Students are asked in a survey they're asked

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.610
a couple of questions. How happy are you and
the other is how many dates did you have last

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:16.480
month? And if you ask the questions in that
order, the correlation is essentially zero.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:22.440
Turns out there are many things in life that
determine happiness and dating is not particularly

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:27.290
important. You invert the order. So you ask
people, "How many dates did you have last

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:32.920
month and how happy are you with your life
as a whole?" Correlation is .66.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:38.630
[laughter]
What has happened and this is both a heuristic

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:45.520
and example what I call a focus and an illusion.
That you have an emotional reaction to the

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:50.480
student has an emotional reaction to the question
about the number of dates. That emotional

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:55.930
reaction is sitting there. Then you're asked
the related question about happiness and without

00:41:55.930 --> 00:42:01.021
knowing that you are doing this, you substitute
one for the other. And you can do it for many

00:42:01.021 --> 00:42:07.580
questions. Now, it's not that people are confused
what happiness is. They know happiness is

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:13.220
not satisfaction with the number of dates.
It's just that this is the answer that comes

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:20.830
to mind to the happiness question. There has
been substitution and you are not aware of

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:29.350
it. Now, there is a process that is essential
to this and this is another strange ability

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:38.040
of System 1. We can map intensities across
different dimensions. So I'll give you my

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:44.730
standard example for this. It's about Julie
who is a graduating senior and she read fluently

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:53.330
when she was age 4 and the question is what
is her GPA? And the odd thing is that you

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:57.810
know what her GPA is pretty much. At least
you have an idea. I mean, it's clearly about

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:05.420
3.2. It's clearly less than 4 about 3.7 maybe
which is ridiculous of course. But how do

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:14.180
people get to 3.7 or somewhere like that?
Well, here is how it goes. She read fluently

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:23.270
at age 4. That gives us an impression of precocity.
How precocious was she as a reader? And that

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:28.190
people could express that in percentiles.
What is the likelihood that you could meet

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:32.940
a child who would read faster than that? Then
when you are asked a question about what is

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:40.190
her GPA? Without your knowing it, you are
matching the percentiles and you get the GPA

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:46.550
that is about as extreme in the distribution
of GPA as reading at age 4 is in the distribution

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:54.800
of reading age. Completely unaware. Statistically,
completely absurd. You should be much more

00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:02.310
regressive. This is not the correct answer.
But this is a compelling subjective answer.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:09.420
This is one of the mechanisms that leads to
intuitive errors this mechanism of substitution.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:16.900
And I'll give you one more example. International
travels, this is an experiment. The experiment

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:22.950
was run during a period when there were many
terrorist incidents in Europe. So that's a

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:27.260
background. How much will you pay for insurance
that pays 100,000 dollars in case of death

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:33.750
for any reason? And how much would you pay
for insurance that pays 100,000 dollars in

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:39.380
case of a death in a terror incident? People
pay much more for the second than for the

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:40.890
first.
[laughter]

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:47.070
And the reason that they do is that there
is an immediate response which is how afraid

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:53.660
am I? And I am more afraid, most people are,
I'm more afraid of the idea of dying in a

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:59.430
terrorist incident than they are afraid of
dying. And that is the mapping that takes

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:07.090
place. Again, you know, it's that's the way
it works. This is the associative machinery.

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:13.430
And when beautiful thing about it it doesn't
get stumped. It produces an answer to questions

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:19.360
that it doesn't know how to answer. But it
produces them by answering easier questions

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:33.250
and a lot of our mental life is conducted
in just this way. So let me complete the circle

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:43.030
and talk a little bit about subjective confidence.
Subjective confidence, which is closely related

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:50.100
to the probability of being correct, is actually
not a judgment at all. It is a feeling. It

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:56.220
is a feeling that people have. And I think
we know where the origin of that feeling is.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:03.950
And it is System 1 if you will assessing the
fluency of its own processing; assessing the

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:10.750
coherence of the story it has created to deal
with the current situation. And if the story

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:17.560
is coherent, confidence is high. Now, this
is disastrous in some ways, because you can

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:23.420
make a very coherent story out of very little
information and out of information that is

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:29.640
in fact not reliable. The quality of the story
depends very little on the quality and quantity

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:38.060
of the information so people can be very confident
with very little reason. Confidence is therefore

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:45.721
not a good diagnostic for when you can trust
either yourself or somebody else. And if you

00:46:45.721 --> 00:46:50.550
are to evaluate whether you can trust somebody
who has a lot of confidence, that's not the

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:57.900
way to do it. The way to do it as I'm saying
earlier is to ask what environment have they

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:03.330
been in? And have they had an opportunity
to learn its regularities? Subjective confidence

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:15.090
is not a good indicator. So that's, you know,
the story I could tell in about 45 minutes

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:21.890
about the two systems. So let me remind you
they don't exist. But I think you should feel

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:28.460
free to think in those terms, because what
you may be beginning to do is, you may be

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:34.820
beginning to have an idea of the personality
of System 1 and System 2. Now this is ridiculous,

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:41.150
but having an idea of those personalities
will actually enable you to think better about

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:48.090
psychological events than if you were just
had a long list of unrelated phenomena. So

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:53.120
those ideas, those personalities, have a certain
coherence. And, you know, they're worth something

00:47:53.120 --> 00:48:05.330
in the coin of being able to make judgments.
Okay. I think we should open for questions.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:06.330
So.

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:07.330
[Applause].

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:22.260
&gt;&gt; John: We have the mic up there and I also
have hand-held mics if somebody has questions.

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:27.500
Somebody's got to ask the first question.

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:35.200
&gt;&gt; Male # 1: Hey. How fixed or plastic are
the System 1 processes? And are there thing

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:40.030
like mindfulness or emotional regulation that
have any effect?

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:48.700
&gt;&gt;Kahneman: As I have described it, System
1 can be updated in terms of content very

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:54.710
regularly. So you can learn in one trial what
is normal and what is not normal. What is

00:48:54.710 --> 00:49:05.200
very difficult to do is to get control over
how it works, over the rules of its operation.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:14.010
And so, I do not know of a lot of evidence
that people, that System 1 can change unless

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:20.260
you have a quiet skill which requires reinforced
practice. What you can do and what people

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:28.680
clearly can do is you can educate your System
2. And you can educate and you can learn to

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:37.210
recognize situations in which System 2 takes
over and takes control of the reaction thereby

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:43.050
avoid some mistakes. Can't be done too much.
But if I don't sound optimistic about training

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:46.710
System 1, it's because I'm not.

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:53.660
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Another question about training
System 1. You talked about reinforcement learning

00:49:53.660 --> 00:50:00.000
and the time constants and the immediacy in
building expertise, but many of the practices

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.730
we have around building software development,
the time constants are somewhat longer and

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:12.410
in particular you gave a counterexample which
was your Australia/UK visit and the fact that

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:21.290
a single incident with John predisposed you
to that association. And so, I wonder if there

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:28.400
has there been any testing to see what time
constants really play a role here?

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:33.240
&gt;&gt; Kahneman: No. In terms of updating and
learning associations, this is something we

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:40.170
can learn quite quickly. You can be taught
to be afraid of something without anything

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:49.750
else happening. And so, in that sense, System
1 associative memory can be updated. And you

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:56.760
can now be developing software expertise that
is a somewhat different story and it's more

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:04.859
like learning how to be a chess master. And
that takes a lot of experience. So that you

00:51:04.859 --> 00:51:11.250
and a lot of reinforcement and it had better
be effective reinforcement. Now, in the software

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:17.030
thing, the time is to some extent not a big
problem. Because ultimately you are going

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:22.720
to see it all together: the error you made
and the correct solutions. So time is not

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:32.410
major factor. In learning, you know, how to
not steer a tanker, that's reinforcement is

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:39.590
very slow. And it's a lot harder to learn
to do that than it is to learn to steer a

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:40.590
smaller ship.

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:44.961
&gt;&gt; Male #3: So this is a pretty broad question
so please take this whichever direction you

00:51:44.961 --> 00:51:49.860
like. But I was just wondering how these systems
come into play and how you see it in media

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:56.030
and advertising and maybe I was thinking of
how it's changed over time.

00:51:56.030 --> 00:52:02.660
&gt;&gt; Kahneman: Well, it's very clear that advertising
is here to address System 1. It doesn't convey

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:08.760
information for judgments. It moves your emotions
and it creates associations. That's what it

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:18.730
is intended to do and it's pretty effective.
So, a lot of politics is addressed to System

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:26.710
1, a lot of political messaging. The influences
of System 1 activities and you know which

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:33.000
are really important and we should be thinking
about. It's pretty frightening. One of my

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.720
colleagues at Princeton, my younger colleagues
at Princeton, has done studies on the effects

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:49.010
of facial characteristics on political preferences.
And it's utterly amazing. You take 538 pairs

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:56.590
of pictures of the two contestants for each
Congressional race and you show those pairs

00:52:56.590 --> 00:53:01.760
of pictures to Princeton students for 1/10th
of a second and you ask, "Which looks more

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:10.370
competent?" That predicts 70% of elections.
So the impact of System 1 on the decisions

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:15.640
we make for example, how much to pay in an
honesty box, that is something that we're

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:20.190
really very rarely aware of and it's much
more than we think.

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:26.940
&gt;&gt; Male #4: So in, although that you say System
1 and System 2 don't show up as specific structures,

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:32.950
have there been functional MRI, diffusion-spectral
imaging, diffusion-tensoral imaging studies

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:40.340
that highlight whether System 1 is more primal
brain initial activation and System 2 is more

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:41.340
neocortex?

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:53.480
&gt;&gt;Kahneman: Well, you know, System 1 is extremely
sophisticated. So it's not, that is in part

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:59.940
why I don't believe there is any simple representation
in the brain of those two systems because

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:06.720
what I've called System 1 operation by their
characteristics include both innate responses

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:14.640
and highly skilled responses. And the whole
the representation of world knowledge is in

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:22.010
System 1. So it's hard to classify one as
primitive. And I should add that System 2,

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:29.260
the reasoning system as it were is not necessarily
rational. I mean, System 2 knows what it knows.

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:36.890
It knows what we know and we don't know a
lot. So it's not that System 2 is infallible

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:42.000
and that all the mistakes come from System
1. We make very significant mistakes when

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.860
we think very seriously. Yes.

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:51.680
&gt;&gt; Male #3: So you mention that experts when
making long-term forecasts and they trust

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:56.780
their intuition they're often wrong. But there
are still a lot of people who listen to them.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:02.740
So, is it bad for the society in general that
we listen to experts who may be just as wrong

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:08.560
as we are and should we be worried? Should
we try to do something?

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:15.800
&gt;&gt;Kahneman: I think there is a very good reason
for the demand for experts. I was referring

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:21.640
to a particular book that you may want to
read or you may want to look for the New Yorker

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:28.070
review of that book. It's a book by Phil Tetlock
on political judgment where he studied forecasts

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:34.690
in the time range of 10, 15 years of political
forecasts. And one of the interesting observations

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:39.920
is who are the people we like to listen to
as pundits? And there are people with very

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:45.260
high confidence who think they understand
the world. Now, they actually are worse than

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:51.191
chance. I mean, they are worse than people
who are more hesitant. But we want them. We

00:55:51.191 --> 00:55:58.150
need them. And so, there is a real demand
for overconfidence. [laughter]

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:05.280
&gt;&gt; Male #5: So as you were going through all
the slides of the various illusions, by the

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:10.300
time you came to the three figures on the
screen, I guess I was expecting there was

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:16.310
something. So even though the lot on the right
looked bigger, I looked again okay and they're

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:18.720
the same. So was that System 1 or System 2.

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:25.030
&gt;&gt; Kahneman: That is clearly System 2. And
that is the way we can learn to overcome illusions

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:34.099
both visual and cognitive. You still see it
as one larger than the other, but you know

00:56:34.099 --> 00:56:40.390
that when you see a display like that, you
shouldn't trust your eyes. And to a similar

00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:46.480
extent you can recognize that you're in a
situation where somebody is having too much

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:54.410
effect on you because she's very eloquent.
But you know the content may not be there.

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:56.800
And so, you force yourself to be skeptical.

00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:02.480
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Is there any research to that effect
that people would avail that advertising is

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:06.430
going to have an emotional effect on them?
Is there any res- let me say that I'm aware

00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:11.520
that advertising is supposed to have an emotional
effect on me activate System 1, will I be

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.609
better suited to sort of ignore those things?

00:57:14.609 --> 00:57:19.970
&gt;&gt;Kahneman: I mean you certainly are going
to ignore it better than if you didn't know

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:27.800
it whether you're capable of ignoring it altogether,
that I'm much more skeptical about. The real

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:33.970
thing is not to expose yourself to it. Because
once you're exposed to it, it's going to affect

00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:43.180
you. And you know, those effects are the cues
in our world that we are not aware of can

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:48.290
be extremely powerful. There is a whole line
of study, it's not exactly to your point,

00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:53.359
but I must tell you that story. There is a
whole line of studies on what happens to people

00:57:53.359 --> 00:57:59.680
when they're exposed to the idea of money.
And for example, they perform one task and

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:04.990
there is a computer nearby and on the computer
there is a screensaver and the screensaver

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:11.040
are dollars floating in water. Dollar bills
floating in water. That makes you selfish.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:17.770
It makes you reluctant to ask for the help
of others. It makes you put your chair further

00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:23.090
away from the chairs of other people when
you have to set up an interview situation.

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:28.869
It has effects on all sorts of behaviors that
people are completely unaware of. And the

00:58:28.869 --> 00:58:36.490
links are symbolic. And you can be aware of
that. How can you resist it? We are exposed

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:42.100
to money and it's going to have some effect.
Now, if you're designing an organization or

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:47.280
if you're designing an environment for people,
you can create an environment that will remind

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:51.980
people of money all the time or you can create
an environment that will remind them of other

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:56.620
things and that will control their behavior
to some extent.

00:58:56.620 --> 00:59:01.910
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Although possibly not one of the
big five in the personality trait categories

00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:08.180
yet, have you developed any empirical testing
that ranks people on a scale of one-to-two

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:12.499
and shows where they fall in terms of default
behaviors.

00:59:12.499 --> 00:59:20.730
&gt;&gt; Kahneman: Well, there is a relevant scale
on the activity of System 2. And the bat and

00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:26.950
ball question is actually a very, very good
question. There are several examples of this.

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:33.130
My former colleague Shane Frederick developed
that test. It's called the Cognitive Reflection

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:40.600
Test and the people who fail that item that
is, who say ten cents they are different in

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:45.710
some interesting ways from the people who
are better able to make it. And let me give

00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:52.290
you an example. You ask them, you know, standard
Amazon questions. So you ordered a gift for

00:59:52.290 --> 00:59:56.910
yourself. How much will you pay extra to have
it tomorrow rather than the second business

00:59:56.910 --> 01:00:02.099
day? And the people who fail this item are
willing to pay more to get it tomorrow. So

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:11.369
there are connections. What there isn't and
I'm very surprised there isn't, I don't know

01:00:11.369 --> 01:00:17.320
there should be tests of intelligence that
are tests of System 1. That are tests of the

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:22.910
richness and subtlety of the model of the
world that we have. All the intelligence tests

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:28.609
that we have are tests for System 2. They're
reasoning tests. We don't have and I wish

01:00:28.609 --> 01:00:33.280
somebody would develop it and I hope somebody
will but, in fact, we don't have it.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:40.119
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Hi. So this is sort of a 2-part
question. So do you find that people who are

01:00:40.119 --> 01:00:47.230
more System 1 or System 2 prone for immediate
judgments are more likely to be that way long-term

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:49.400
like larger decisions?

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.580
&gt;&gt;Kahneman: I don't know enough about this.

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.580
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Yeah.

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:59.960
&gt;&gt;Kahneman: We do know that self-control and
the general activation of System 2 is an important

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:06.070
personality characteristic. And you know its
presence in a rudimentary form at age four

01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:14.490
and has implications. The ability the test
is called The Marshmallow Test. You ask a

01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:20.961
child you can have one marshmallow now or
you can have two if you wait 15 minutes. That

01:01:20.961 --> 01:01:27.550
predicts what they will do 20 years later
remarkably well so there are things that are

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.550
quite stable.

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:32.780
&gt;&gt; Male #6: And the other part is that have
you encountered people who would say they

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:37.359
have to make a decision and they're aware
that their System 1 mind is telling them decision

01:01:37.359 --> 01:01:43.630
A their System 2 mind is telling them decision
B. What do people go with?

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:46.680
&gt;&gt;Kahneman: I don't know enough.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.300
&gt;&gt;Male #6: No?

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:55.330
&gt;&gt;Kahneman: No, I don't know enough. [pause]
No, I don't know enough. It would be so dependent

01:01:55.330 --> 01:02:05.460
on circumstance whether you impose the System
2 judgment. In many cases, really System 2

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:11.740
just endorses what System 1 subjects to. That's
the model you have. Sometimes you can overturn

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:16.070
it. It's hard work.

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.150
[pause]

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.310
Thank you.

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:20.400
[Applause]
