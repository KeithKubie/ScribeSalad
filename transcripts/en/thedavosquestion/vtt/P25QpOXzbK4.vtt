00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620
&gt;&gt; I think India has an fantastic opportunity
facing it as it moves

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.179
forward.
[INAUDIBLE] discussed in this conference about

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.849
infrastructure,
organization, massive resources out there

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.190
at their disposal.
One of the key challenges, can they harness

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.910
that?
Can they bring it together and put it into

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.450
being?
If they do so, becoming an economic opportunity

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.370
to beyond any question,
they will achieve that.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.210
The challenge is enormous, but the optimism
I've seen among this

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.510
conferences, they can do it and I look forward
to sharing that with

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.559
them over the next 5, 10 years of development.
Thank you.
