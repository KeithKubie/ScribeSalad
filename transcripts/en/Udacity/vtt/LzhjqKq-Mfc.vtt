00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.860
During this course, you'll complete a variety of different kind of assessments.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.720
These assessments play different roles.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.430
First, they help you learn by demonstrating and

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.560
testing what you know. Second, they help you reflect on what you've learned.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.070
Third, they help us understand what material is being taught well,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.970
and what is not being taught well. The main assessment of the projects. You'll

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.750
complete a series of programming projects in designing AI agents that address

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.440
a pretty complex task. We'll talk a little bit more about it in a few minutes.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.670
Second, written assignments. We'll compete a number of written assignments that

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.667
will tie the course material to the projects. Third, tests. There will be

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:42.656
two tests in this class using the content of this class to introduce a broad

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:47.460
variety of problems. Fourth, exercises. Throughout the lessons there'll be

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.870
a number of exercises to help you evaluate and manage your own learning. Fifth,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.200
interactions. We'll be looking at the interactions of the forum and other places

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.030
to get a feel for how everyone is doing and how can we help improve learning
