00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 align:start position:0%
is yourself and you're also putting out
 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
is yourself and you're also putting out
a<00:03:28.690><c> skill</c><00:03:29.019><c> in</c><00:03:29.200><c> the</c><00:03:29.260><c> performance</c><00:03:29.799><c> but</c><00:03:30.220><c> it's</c><00:03:30.370><c> a</c>

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 align:start position:0%
a skill in the performance but it's a
 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.309 align:start position:0%
a skill in the performance but it's a
vehicle<00:03:30.970><c> to</c><00:03:31.180><c> put</c><00:03:31.330><c> yourself</c><00:03:31.780><c> out</c><00:03:31.989><c> and</c><00:03:32.819><c> so</c><00:03:33.819><c> I</c>

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle to put yourself out and so I
 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.890 align:start position:0%
vehicle to put yourself out and so I
learned<00:03:35.319><c> that</c><00:03:35.500><c> early</c><00:03:35.560><c> on</c><00:03:35.920><c> because</c><00:03:36.870><c> when</c><00:03:37.870><c> I</c>

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 align:start position:0%
learned that early on because when I
 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
learned that early on because when I
started<00:03:38.410><c> performing</c><00:03:38.620><c> I</c><00:03:39.280><c> was</c><00:03:39.760><c> actually</c>

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 align:start position:0%
started performing I was actually
 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.490 align:start position:0%
started performing I was actually
performing<00:03:40.450><c> on</c><00:03:40.569><c> the</c><00:03:40.690><c> streets</c><00:03:41.019><c> in</c><00:03:41.260><c> Tel</c><00:03:41.470><c> Aviv</c>

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 align:start position:0%
performing on the streets in Tel Aviv
 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.930 align:start position:0%
performing on the streets in Tel Aviv
and<00:03:42.150><c> so</c><00:03:43.150><c> there</c><00:03:43.480><c> I</c><00:03:43.810><c> had</c><00:03:44.680><c> to</c><00:03:44.890><c> put</c><00:03:45.069><c> myself</c><00:03:45.250><c> into</c><00:03:45.670><c> it</c>

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 align:start position:0%
and so there I had to put myself into it
 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.690 align:start position:0%
and so there I had to put myself into it
because<00:03:46.269><c> otherwise</c><00:03:46.510><c> I</c><00:03:47.280><c> wouldn't</c><00:03:48.280><c> get</c><00:03:48.489><c> much</c>

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 align:start position:0%
because otherwise I wouldn't get much
 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.789 align:start position:0%
because otherwise I wouldn't get much

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 align:start position:0%
out something and and my tendency was
 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.690 align:start position:0%
out something and and my tendency was
has<00:03:53.950><c> been</c><00:03:54.280><c> to</c><00:03:54.579><c> to</c><00:03:55.480><c> just</c><00:03:55.810><c> play</c><00:03:56.440><c> it</c><00:03:56.560><c> safe</c><00:03:56.829><c> and</c><00:03:57.250><c> not</c>

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 align:start position:0%
has been to to just play it safe and not
 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
has been to to just play it safe and not
to<00:03:57.910><c> put</c><00:03:58.120><c> myself</c><00:03:58.450><c> out</c><00:03:58.900><c> but</c><00:03:59.140><c> to</c><00:03:59.290><c> put</c><00:03:59.470><c> out</c>

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 align:start position:0%
to put myself out but to put out
 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.850 align:start position:0%
to put myself out but to put out
something<00:03:59.920><c> cool</c><00:04:00.760><c> or</c><00:04:00.900><c> fancy</c><00:04:01.900><c> or</c><00:04:02.110><c> impressive</c>
