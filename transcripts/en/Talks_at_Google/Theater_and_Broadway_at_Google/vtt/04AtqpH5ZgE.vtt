SPEAKER 1: How about another
round of applause for them.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.880
Are they amazing, or what?

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.290
Right?

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.770
Amazing.

Awesome.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.162

00:04:42.162 --> 00:04:43.370
thank you all for being here.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.390
You guys are amazing.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.510
I had a chance to see
the show on Monday

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.152
and was totally blown away.

00:04:49.152 --> 00:04:50.610
But before we get
to the questions,

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.090
I would love it if you could
all introduce yourselves.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.660
Maybe say your name and then
what part you play in the show.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.985

can say how old you are.

SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:05:45.832 --> 00:05:48.280
So, first question for you guys.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.980
So this is obviously,
the show is

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.650
based upon the movie,
which came out in 2003.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.570
It was a pretty major hit.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.980
I actually learned that it was
the best-selling, best-selling

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.290
musical comedy until
"Pitch Perfect 2" came out,

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.710
which is pretty awesome.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.470
So quick question for the kids.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.090
Were any of you actually born
by the time the movie came out?

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.285
GABRIELLE GREENE: Well,
the movie came out in 2004,

00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:12.830
so I was born a year after.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.260
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.230
GABRIELLE GREENE: I
was two years late.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.850
SPEAKER 1: A few who are close.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.640
But the serious question
is, so obviously it's

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.350
a very well known movie.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.030
A lot of people know it.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.530
How much did you
guys, when you were

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.380
getting ready for the show, how
much did you watch the movie?

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.470
How much did that
influence your characters?

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.420
Or did you mostly
learn the characters

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.010
through the process
of rehearsal?

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.250
ZACHARY ZWELLING:
So me, like, we

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.110
didn't really base our
characters off the movie.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.060
Yeah, that movie was part
of our influence cause

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.200
it's the movie,
"School of Rock."

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.190
But our characters are kind of,
like, they're really different.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.530
Like, so I didn't really look
up to the Zack in the movie.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.804
But we, yeah, our
characters are different.

00:07:02.804 --> 00:07:04.230
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.772
Anybody else?

00:07:06.772 --> 00:07:08.230
OLIVIA CHUN: I
never, I don't think

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.470
I actually watched the movie.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.400
I watched it like a little bit.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.255
But when I auditioned, I
just, I did like an open call.

00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:18.664
So I was auditioning
for anybody.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.890
JOHN ALLYN: Well, I
mean, in my real life,

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.635
I'm kind of like Billy
cause I'm always very sassy.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:38.001
But I kind of base Billy off
of me, not off of the movie.

00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:38.876
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:39.792
How about you, Conner?

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.160
Counter Because I know--

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.670
so particularly,
obviously, Jack Black,

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.270
he's not somebody who's
known for being unoriginal.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.120
He's definitely a
strong character.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.760
How much pressure did you
feel coming into the role,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.700
that people are coming in
expecting to see Jack Black?

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.320
And how do you
navigate that line

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.050
between being original
but also staying

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.560
true to an iconic character?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.500
CONNER GILLOOLY: Yeah.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.130
Good question.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.840
I, like, I grew up
watching the movie.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.670
And I've always been
really influenced

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.430
by Jack Black and his
energy and his passion.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.370
And I was a worshipper
of Tenacious D,

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.600
maybe when I was too young.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.360
But I, when I went
into the audition,

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.090
I knew that nobody
does Jack Black the way

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.340
Jack Black does Jack Black.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.890
So I wasn't going to go in
there and do an impression.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.150
And I was just like,
I got to do it my way.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.770
Because I figured like, I've
been watching him for so long

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.110
that, you know, the rocket sauce
would shine through on its own,

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.179
I think.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.190
So I really-- and they
seemed to enjoy that.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.940
So all of the
Deweys, they all were

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.572
encouraged to put their
own fingerprint on it

00:08:44.572 --> 00:08:45.780
and really make it their own.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.050
Because you know, you go in
and expect to see Jack Black.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.810
But there's no substance
to it if you're

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.280
doing just an impression.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:53.970
You know?

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.400
So it's got to come from
a real place of excitement

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.290
and like energy.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.780
And they really
bring that out in me.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.640
And it's just, yeah, there's
no use in doing an impression.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.770
Because you just do it your way.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.240
And I think they
seem to enjoy it.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.085
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:14.751
You bring up a really
interesting point,

00:09:14.751 --> 00:09:19.020
that you are actually one of two
Deweys in the course of a week.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.330
So do you feel-- and
it sounds like you

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.430
don't feel like you
need to portray it

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.780
the same way as the other Dewey.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.890
How about for you guys?

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.010
Is it really different
working with different Deweys?

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.930
Do they do things
differently every time?

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.910
And what's that like?

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.750
RACHEL KATZKE: Oh,
she can go first.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.550
AMADI CHAPATA:
Well, for me, I feel

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.020
like it's really fun being able
to have three Deweys and go on.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.200
Because I feel like
doing like the same show

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.670
with like the same
Dewey is kind of boring.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.680
So I love to see like different
like personalities go on stage.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.150
And I love performing
with Connor and Justin

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.070
and everybody.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.365
It's really fun.

00:09:57.365 --> 00:09:59.490
GABRIELLE GREENE: Well, I
feel like all the Deweys,

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.299
they have different
kind of aspects

00:10:01.299 --> 00:10:02.340
that make them their own.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.640
For example, Connor, he's
so good at physical humor.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.730
Like throughout the
show, he's so good at at.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.410
And then Justin, like,
say something went wrong.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.560
He, like, his improv is
literally like right on point.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.210
Like, no hesitation at all.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.570
So I really like
how Dewey brings out

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.130
these two in such a special way.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.312
And they're both so talented.

00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:23.770
SPEAKER 1: So you
mentioned improv.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.619
So I guess, I would imagine the
show changes a lot, day to day.

00:10:27.619 --> 00:10:29.160
Especially, I mean,
obviously there's

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.560
a lot of set, funny
written lines.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.260
But have you guys ever
had things happen over

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.050
the course of the show that
are either something Dewey did

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.365
or something one of the kids
did that's just hilarious?

00:10:41.365 --> 00:10:42.700
Maybe you, Levi.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:49.710
LEVI BUKSBAZEN: So I think,
Wednesday, the Miss Mullins

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.010
missed her entrance
into the classroom.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.940
So Justin just started
making up a bunch of things.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.490
And he just started rambling
for like four minutes.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.530
And it was super funny.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.488
CONNER GILLOOLY: Right.

00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:03.840
It was like, it was
Mullins was coming in

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.820
and he had to cover
up and be like,

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.560
and lo, the wooden
toothed, salty

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.420
haired George Jefferson
Washington crossed

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.815
the Delaware.

00:11:10.815 --> 00:11:12.950
LEVI BUKSBAZEN: And
created the light bulb.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.260
CONNER GILLOOLY: Yeah.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.520
He did this and he did this.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.470
And please come.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.119
And he did this.

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:20.160
SPEAKER 1: And what's that
like for you guys when

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.118
you're on stage, right?

00:11:21.118 --> 00:11:23.257
Because you are obviously
waiting for your lines

00:11:23.257 --> 00:11:24.840
to come up or the
next thing to happen

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.340
when somebody has to vamp like
that for a couple of minutes?

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.340
John.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.430
JOHN ALLYN: Well, I am
next to Marcy and Sophie,

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.010
one of the roadies, and
Marcy the backup singer.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.850
And we were looking at each
other like, what's going on?

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.850
And I could hear the
two people around me,

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.310
we were like laughing with air.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.860
It was like, the whole time.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.440
And then when she finally
came in, all of us were like.

00:11:55.224 --> 00:11:56.267
SPEAKER 1: Olivia?

00:11:56.267 --> 00:11:57.850
OLIVIA CHUN: I think
it's really cool.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.370
Because after
like-- even if this

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.536
is not good for like any
of the prop or the crew--

00:12:02.536 --> 00:12:04.660
but like any time something
like a little different

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.390
happens on stage, after
we come off stage,

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.160
so Rachel and I share
a dressing room.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.980
We're always talking like, oh,
that made our adrenaline go

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.680
up, and stuff like that.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.710
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.210
Yeah, Gabby.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.470
GABRIELLE GREENE: I think
it's like a daily reminder

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.319
that you always have to stay
in character and be on edge.

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:21.610
Like you can't get comfortable.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.710
You have to stay on
edge and be in character

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.470
and be ready when
things happen like that.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.566
SPEAKER 1: Totally.

00:12:27.566 --> 00:12:29.690
So one of the things-- just
to pivot a little bit--

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.780
one of the things I think
everybody finds really

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.990
interesting, especially a show
with a lot of kids, right,

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.377
is what it's like for you guys
to do this, day in and day out.

00:12:39.377 --> 00:12:40.960
And so one of the
things I was reading

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.510
is that a lot of you guys
actually aren't from New York,

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.850
or not even from
the New York area.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.860
I think I saw West Coast.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.690
I saw people from the South.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:55.100
So a question, how on earth
did the producers discover you?

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.694
Amadi?

00:12:56.694 --> 00:12:58.110
AMADI CHAPATA: One
word, Facebook.

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:01.870
SPEAKER 1: Wait a minute.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.828
Could you tell us a little
bit more about that?

00:13:03.828 --> 00:13:07.180
AMADI CHAPATA: So
well, basically,

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.650
my mom, one of her
friends saw it on Facebook

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.189
and she was like,
hey, well, there's

00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:15.480
auditions for "School of Rock."

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.210
It's for Tomika.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.080
Thank you.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.180
And she has to be like 10 to 12,
I think that's what they said.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.310
And I did a video audition.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.420
And I sent it to them.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.190
And I got a call back.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.159
I did another song.

00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:34.950
And then they asked me
to come to New York.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.030
And I'm from Atlanta.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.507
So it was just like in one week.

00:13:37.507 --> 00:13:38.840
And they told me I got the part.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.640
So I had to hurry up and move
like in a week and then start

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.500
rehearsals the next day.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.942
SPEAKER 1: So did you move--

00:13:44.942 --> 00:13:46.400
and this is I guess
for all of you,

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.135
too, might have
similar experiences--

00:13:47.135 --> 00:13:48.810
did your whole family move up?

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.265
Did you move up by yourself?

00:13:50.265 --> 00:13:51.390
AMADI CHAPATA: Just my mom.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.950
But we didn't know if we were
going to stay for another year.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.780
But I am, and now my
brother's moved with us.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.720
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.070
Yeah, Zack?

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.180
ZACHARY ZWELLING: And then, so
I moved from Santa Monica, LA.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.990
And we basically just sent
in a video, cause we're like,

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.441
it's worth a shot.

00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:10.440
SPEAKER 1: Did you see
this on Facebook as well?

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.315
ZACHARY ZWELLING: No.

00:14:11.315 --> 00:14:16.320
I went to like a music program
in LA, a School of Rock,

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.602
West LA, actually.

00:14:17.602 --> 00:14:19.560
So it's like a School of
Rock learning program,

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.240
teach kids how to
play instruments.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.850
And the head of School of Rock
was walking around one day

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.260
and I had a guitar lesson.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.800
And he came to me, he's
like, oh, you're Zack.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.180
You should audition for Zach.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.545
So I'm just like, OK.

00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:34.560
At first, I'm like, no.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.390
Maybe not.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.120
I don't know.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.030
But then a little while
later he reminded me.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.520
I'm like, why not?

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.630
So I sent in a video and six
months later I got a call back.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.100
It said, come to New York.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.430
And it all went off from there.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.190
SPEAKER 1: And did your, did
your whole family move out

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.600
from the West Coast as well?

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:51.880
ZACHARY ZWELLING: Yeah.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.100
My whole family moved out.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.140
They're very supportive.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:54.660
Yeah.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.285
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:14:55.285 --> 00:14:56.970
That's amazing.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:57.630
Yeah, Gabby.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.650
GABRIELLE GREENE: Well,
I'm not too far from here.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.566
I'm from Philadelphia.

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:01.080
But we still had to move here.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.420
And like Amadi said, like
we got a week notice.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.240
We had to move here and start
rehearsals the next day.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.460
But open calls are
just life savers.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.860
Like, you just go in there,
put your talent out there.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.720
Even if they don't
select you for that,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.030
then you know that they
have your talent information

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.416
and they can just
contact you for any part.

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:18.540
So that's kind of my thing.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.414
I was just like, OK,
I'm just going to do it.

00:15:20.414 --> 00:15:21.540
I might not get it.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.460
Because my mindset
was I might not

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.610
get the first 100 auditions, but
eventually I'll get something.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.440
Then a few months after,
I got a call back.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.000
I was like, oh, OK.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.220
And then I went there,
did the other callback,

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.170
and then they called
me saying that they

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.497
want me to do the part.

00:15:35.497 --> 00:15:37.782
I was like, yay.

00:15:37.782 --> 00:15:38.700
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.547
LEVI BUKSBAZEN: So I
just sent in the video.

00:15:41.547 --> 00:15:42.380
SPEAKER 1: And wait.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.090
Where are you from, Levi?

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.400
LEVI BUKSBAZEN: I'm from
Charlotte, North Carolina.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:44.820
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.590
LEVI BUKSBAZEN: So I just
like, sent in a video.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.006
I'm like, I'm not
going to get it.

00:15:48.006 --> 00:15:51.420
It's like winning the
lottery, basically impossible.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:55.590
And then I think a couple
weeks later I got a call back.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.480
I'm like, wait.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.750
You're telling me
I got a callback?

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.090
And then I just kept
getting callbacks.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.190
And then they asked
me to go to New York.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.630
I'm like, all right.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.610
And then after
that, I got the job.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.770
And they said, you have
a week to move up here

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.475
and you start the day after.

00:16:13.475 --> 00:16:14.100
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.780
Well, and because
obviously this is

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.640
sort of a different
audition probably

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.140
than a traditional
musical theater,

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.740
because for a lot of
you, you are playing

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.760
the instruments live on stage.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.250
And for those of you who
haven't seen the show,

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.880
these guys are basically
professional level musicians.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.200
It is amazing.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.450
This is not like a kid's band.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.690
This is like a band band.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.090
So what was the audition
process like for those of you

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.330
who played instruments?

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.004
Yeah?

00:16:41.004 --> 00:16:42.420
RACHEL KATZKE: So
I play the bass.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.000
So I first sent in a
video of me playing

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.559
"Teacher's Pet," which is
one of the songs on the bass.

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:49.350
And then they called
me in for an audition.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.130
And then it just
escalated from there.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.050
And then I got the job.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.410
SPEAKER 1: And by the way--
so again, for those of you

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:58.110
haven't seen the
show, you probably

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.317
have the best rock face of
anybody in the entire show.

00:17:01.317 --> 00:17:03.150
Can you, would you mind
showing the face you

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.957
make when you play the bass?

00:17:05.957 --> 00:17:06.644
Pretty bad ass.

00:17:08.535 --> 00:17:10.910
So how about for the rest of
you that played instruments?

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.619
Like when you, like Levi,
because you play the drums.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:16.470
You had to come in and
basically show them your stuff.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.270
Did you have a preset routine?

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.119
Or did they something
that they wanted

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.410
you to play when you showed up?

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.285
LEVI BUKSBAZEN: Yeah.

00:17:22.285 --> 00:17:24.270
So they wanted me to
play "Teacher's Pet."

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.400
And then after
that, they asked me

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.160
to play a song that I prepared.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.980
But I didn't know that.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.700
So I just basically just like,
oh, well, I can play this song.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.330
So I'm just going to do that.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.981
It was kind of
intimidating, though,

00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:41.230
with all those other drummers.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.510
I'm like, hmm.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.260
SPEAKER 1: I'm sure.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.360
So when you guys got here, so
this is a pretty intense show.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.360
There's what, eight shows
a week for you guys?

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.690
How does that work
with going to school?

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.480
Do you go?

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.980
I've never seen so many people
excited to talk about school.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.360
This is amazing.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.990
We'll start with you, Amadi,
then we can work down.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.800
AMADI CHAPATA: Well, I
have an online school.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.200
And basically I get my subjects.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.560
They send me, my teachers,
and I can call them any time.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.120
So I always have help.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.730
And I have five lessons.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.780
And then I do, I have to do
like maybe five hours a day

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:26.400
or six hours a day, and
27, 25 hours a week.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.560
But I get my
lessons from online.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.800
And I do them, I submit them,
and then I'm done for the day.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.460
Also, I get to be in my
pajamas and that's amazing.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.879
SPEAKER 1: This is all through
Google Classroom, right?

00:18:37.879 --> 00:18:39.170
AMADI CHAPATA: Yeah, of course.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.800
JOHN ALLYN: So I go to a
public school every single day.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.910
But when I first started,
when school started,

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.587
I went to this tutoring
program on Wednesdays

00:18:56.587 --> 00:18:57.670
because we have a matinee.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:01.770
But because it was easier
just to go to school

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.680
and have the teacher
explain the lessons to you,

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.450
I go to school every single day.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.240
But it's kind of annoying
having to wake up

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.870
at 7:30 and after doing a show.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.852
It's hard but it's fun.

00:19:15.852 --> 00:19:17.330
SPEAKER 1: Olivia?

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.540
OLIVIA CHUN: So this is
my third year doing this.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.310
I was in "The King
and I" before.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.820
And so I started at
the age of eight.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.450
And so for now I'm
doing public school.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.630
Over the summer we tried
doing homeschooling.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.850
It was a little more
difficult because my mom's not

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.060
an actual teacher,
and stuff like that.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.930
But I go to public school.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.060
And it's definitely
tiring, especially

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.530
having to wake up early in
the morning after a show.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.980
But it's also, we're getting
something good out of it

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.372
because we're getting
to do what we love.

00:19:50.372 --> 00:19:51.330
ZACHARY ZWELLING: Yeah.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.140
I completely agree with Olivia.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.510
It's totally all
worth it when you get

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:57.010
to do something that you love.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.040
And I go to a public
school in Tribeca.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.430
And waking up in the
morning, although it's hard--

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.300
and I feel bad for my mom
trying to get to wake--

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.550
have to wake me
up every morning--

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.760
after doing a show
the night before.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.280
It's very tiring, but it's
something that I love,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.907
so it's completely worth it.

00:20:16.907 --> 00:20:18.490
CONNER GILLOOLY: I
don't go to school.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:22.790
LEVI BUKSBAZEN: So
I'm home schooled,

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.360
but I personally don't
like it since you don't

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.530
have like other kids there.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.030
So.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.890
RACHEL KATZKE: I get a mix of
homeschooling and tutoring.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:35.190
So like a little bit of both.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.240
It's fair.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.830
GABRIELLE GREENE:
So my mom, well,

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:39.820
we when she was
back in Philadelphia

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:40.945
she used to be a principal.

00:20:40.945 --> 00:20:42.610
So she's like,
you're doing school.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:43.767
She's like, no excuses.

00:20:43.767 --> 00:20:44.600
You're doing school.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.970
So I just do online school.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.370
But she's there to help
me whenever I need it.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.869
My online school is not
a public school that's

00:20:50.869 --> 00:20:51.910
like sending me homework.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.824
It's basically just online.

00:20:53.824 --> 00:20:55.240
So it's really
helpful that I have

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.390
online teachers that are just
there whenever I need them.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.290
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.540
And what do your friends
think about the fact

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.454
that-- or your classmates think
about that you're on Broadway?

00:21:06.454 --> 00:21:07.780
Zack?

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.300
ZACHARY ZWELLING:
Well, I kind of like,

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.220
something that I
went by my whole life

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.630
is just always be humble.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.630
So I don't really talk
about it much at school.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.630
I go to school and then I
go to the show every day,

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:20.770
pretty much.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.350
So with my classmates, like
on the first day of school,

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.650
cause I moved to New
York, so I was a new kid.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.610
And on the first day of
school, some kids told me like,

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:31.450
you're a liar.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.260
You're a liar.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.590
I'm like, OK.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.830
So.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.940
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, Amadi?

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.600
AMADI CHAPATA: Well, since
my friends are in Atlanta,

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.710
so like I can't see them every
day, which is really sad.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.615
But I always talk to them.

00:21:47.615 --> 00:21:49.960
And just like Zach
said, I'm always humble.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.460
I don't really
talk about it a lot

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.918
because I don't
really want to make

00:21:52.918 --> 00:21:54.430
anyone feel bad or anything.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.400
And I miss them a lot.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.650
But they're really supportive.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:00.164
When I left I had a party
and it was really fun.

00:22:00.164 --> 00:22:01.287
SPEAKER 1: Olivia?

00:22:01.287 --> 00:22:03.370
OLIVIA CHUN: So because
I've been doing this three

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.920
years, as I said
before, a lot my friends

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.910
are really supportive.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.680
And 10 of them have
come to see the show.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.290
And they really enjoyed it.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.770
But a lot of other kids
that are not in my class

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.890
are sometimes like, oh--
like Zack's friends--

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.200
they're like, oh, you're
not actually on Broadway.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.890
I'm like, OK, whatever.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.390
SPEAKER 1: And Connor, I know,
obviously, you're not a kid.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.460
So your classmates are
probably not saying a lot.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.140
But you were talking a
little bit earlier before,

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.590
and this is actually
your Broadway debut,

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:30.980
which is awesome.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.580
Can you talk a little bit about
your journey getting here?

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.990
CONNER GILLOOLY:
It's crazy, man.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.600
I graduated in 2016.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.360
And I got an agent
through a showcase.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.410
And I mostly did
film work up until--

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.800
I mean, I did musicals
and stuff like that.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.690
But I thought I was just
going to pack all my stuff up

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:50.590
and moved to LA.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.530
But then I got this agent
and so I moved to New York.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.120
And I've been
living in a closet.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.399
And I just got out--

00:22:56.399 --> 00:22:57.190
that sounded weird.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.510
So I went on auditions.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.850
And I did some stand up.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.690
And then I auditioned for the
tour and like did a callback

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:08.770
that same day.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.530
And then I auditioned
for Andrew Lloyd Webber.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:15.040
And then I got a call that
said I didn't get the tour.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.715
I got Broadway.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.090
So since the 5 of July,
life has been a whirlwind.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.500
It's just, it's been madness.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.490
I went from like
nannying to make money,

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.370
just barely making rent,
and then this happened.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.067
And I started, like you
guys, it was the next day.

00:23:33.067 --> 00:23:34.150
SPEAKER 1: That's amazing.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.560
And like the kids in
the show, obviously, you

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.500
shred on the guitar.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.560
It is not a joke what you
have to do on the guitar.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.889
Were you already a guitar
player coming into the role?

00:23:43.889 --> 00:23:45.430
CONNER GILLOOLY:
Oh, I'm lucky enough

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.080
to play with them on stage.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.600
But I really, I knew,
I played like acoustic.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.310
I played chords.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:54.340
So the company was kind enough
to give me lessons and work

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.640
on my solo game, which
has been amazing.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.280
Because it's like
learning another language.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.200
And I'm just learning,
you know, I would

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.560
like to order the chicken.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.060
You know?

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.850
Just like a little, I got
like a little solo in it.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:10.660
So they really took time
to work on the stuff

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.070
that I'm playing live.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.100
And we just really
honed in on that

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.550
just so it's good for the stage.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:22.060
But now I'm sort of spreading
out and expanding my skill set.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.750
But I didn't know, I really,
I thought I knew about guitar.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.360
And then I got
this job and like,

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.110
just the musicians there, them,
and the house band, they're

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.590
incredible and so helpful.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.890
And they've been so
great teaching me.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:38.220
And like they're teaching
me more than anything.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:38.810
Really.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:39.700
SPEAKER 1: Well, you
would never know.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.820
I mean, you look like a
pro up there, for sure.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.540
CONNER GILLOOLY: Oh, thanks.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.123
SPEAKER 1: So actually, speaking
of that, do all of you guys--

00:24:45.123 --> 00:24:47.310
since you're all musicians--

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:48.780
are you active?

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.120
Do you do any form of
lessons throughout the course

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.980
of the show to like,
keep the skills up?

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.930
Or just playing every day
sort of makes it happen?

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.630
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.070
RACHEL KATZKE: So
I like, I take,

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:04.504
we don't have time
for tons of lessons.

00:25:04.504 --> 00:25:06.420
So like every once in a
while I'll take a bass

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.070
lesson and then like
voice and dance.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.080
So like I don't have
that much time for it.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.284
But we like try to fit
it in as much as we can.

00:25:14.284 --> 00:25:15.250
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.966
Zack?

00:25:16.966 --> 00:25:19.590
ZACHARY ZWELLING: For me, at the
very beginning when I started,

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.350
I think the company
provided three lessons

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.140
to learn the entire material.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.490
And so I took
those three lessons

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:33.480
and then I went on the
stage and did this.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.630
And then for the next month
I wasn't taking lessons.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:41.610
And I'm like, and then I decided
like you can never, like you

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:43.360
never stop learning.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.460
So I need to get
back in lessons.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.030
So now I'm taking lessons
once a week with a teacher.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:48.970
Yeah.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:49.679
SPEAKER 1: Amadi?

00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:51.928
AMADI CHAPATA: Well, I don't
play an actual instrument

00:25:51.928 --> 00:25:52.740
in the show.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.830
Well, like, I do but I don't.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.770
I play my voice.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.662
SPEAKER 1: Which is absolutely
amazing, by the way.

00:26:00.662 --> 00:26:01.620
Totally blows you away.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.880
It's amazing.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.630
AMADI CHAPATA: Thank you.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.470
What was the question?

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.010
SPEAKER 1: If you do lessons
over the course of the show.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.500
AMADI CHAPATA: I,
honestly, I'm so tired.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.350
I feel like I need to rest.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.540
I don't really
have like the time

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.900
or like the energy
to take lessons.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.080
But my mom, she's an
actress and a singer.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.050
So I practically get my
lessons from her at home.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:29.460
So that's really easy.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.540
And yeah.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.730
SPEAKER 1: Olivia?

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.340
OLIVIA CHUN: So I don't play an
instrument in the show, also.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.650
I could say I play the
triangle in the show,

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.320
but that's about it.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.470
But I, on every Thursday,
which is my day off,

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:44.730
I take piano lessons.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.060
And I've been doing that
since I was really little.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:47.890
So I do that.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.187
But then also like I
play like the ukulele

00:26:50.187 --> 00:26:51.520
and like a little bit of guitar.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.625
So I just like practice
at home, just for fun.

00:26:53.625 --> 00:26:55.984
But it's Nothing professional
like these people.

00:26:55.984 --> 00:26:56.650
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:58.525
Real quick, I just want
to say, we definitely

00:26:58.525 --> 00:27:00.990
want to open it up for
Googlers to ask any questions,

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.020
if you have any.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.380
So if you have any
questions, just make your way

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.786
to the mics on either side.

00:27:06.786 --> 00:27:08.160
And then if
anybody's up there, I

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.070
will make sure that
we get to answer them.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.100
So while we're waiting
to see if anybody

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.500
wants to ask any questions,
I definitely have more.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.180
One is, so this is a show
all about rock, obviously.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.491
Are you guys die hard rock fans?

00:27:24.491 --> 00:27:24.990
OK.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:26.095
Zack, your hand shot up.

00:27:26.095 --> 00:27:26.970
ZACHARY ZWELLING: OK.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.455
So I came into this
show, like, I'm

00:27:31.455 --> 00:27:35.156
like now I consider myself an
actor and like and a dancer

00:27:35.156 --> 00:27:36.030
and like all of this.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:40.320
But I came to the show
like for the music.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.230
I came into the
show, like, oh gosh,

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.570
I get to play my guitar
eight times a week in front

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.070
of 1,600 people a night.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:48.840
Pretty cool.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.880
So that was like, I love
the guitar, and I sing.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.770
And my favorite band
is Led Zeppelin.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:59.970
So I look up to Led Zeppelin.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.010
I look up to Jimmy
Page, pretty much.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.320
Like he's just amazing.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.440
He's fantastic.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.440
I can play a lot
of Zeppelin songs.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.760
And so I, but now like, the
show has really taught me a lot.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.444
It's taught me about dancing,
acting, and I've learned a ton.

00:28:17.444 --> 00:28:19.110
SPEAKER 1: And what's
your favorite song

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.524
to shred on the guitar?

00:28:21.524 --> 00:28:23.190
ZACHARY ZWELLING: Any
Led Zeppelin song.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.770
SPEAKER 1: You've
trained them well.

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:28.270
Amadi?

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.590
AMADI CHAPATA: Well,
I didn't really

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.600
know any bands or
anything until like I

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.746
met these people, especially
the old cast that would

00:28:42.746 --> 00:28:43.870
talk about it all the time.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.480
This cast talks about
it all the time.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.060
But right now, I
love Guns N' Roses.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.410
That's one of my favorites.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.730
And my favorite song
is "Paradise City."

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.944
One of my favorites.

00:28:52.944 --> 00:28:53.610
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:55.443
I'm actually going to
open it up real quick.

00:28:55.443 --> 00:28:57.119
We had a question over here.

00:28:57.119 --> 00:28:57.660
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.080
I was curious at what age you
started playing instruments

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.100
or singing.

00:29:04.019 --> 00:29:06.060
SPEAKER 1: Maybe we can
go quickly down the line,

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.264
because that would be
really interesting to know.

00:29:08.264 --> 00:29:10.680
GABRIELLE GREENE: So I basically
started singing at seven.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.010
But since then, one
personality thing about me

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.480
is that once I'm into something,
it's like I'm into it.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.200
I'm doing this.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.610
Like this is what I want to do.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:20.380
So just over time
and over time, I just

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.120
started perfecting my voice.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.060
And then this is, I decided
this is what I want to do.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.390
RACHEL KATZKE: I started
professionally doing theater

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.890
when I was seven going on eight.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.470
And then I started learning
bass like about two years ago,

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.420
and I learned it for the show.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:35.690
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.550
LEVI BUKSBAZEN: I
started playing drums

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:41.500
when I was about five.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.463
So yeah.

00:29:42.463 --> 00:29:44.720
CONNER GILLOOLY: I didn't
start doing anything til

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.120
like the seventh grade.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.350
And there was like a
community theater I went to.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.630
And then I just started
doing every single musical.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:55.070
The first musical ever
did was "West Side Story,"

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:57.458
and I was a shark.

00:29:57.458 --> 00:29:59.690
Yeah.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:01.610
ZACHARY ZWELLING: I
started playing guitar

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.080
when I was seven.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.270
And then, I totally
agree with Gabby,

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.520
that once you find
something that you love,

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.370
it's not even like,
it just, you gotta

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:12.194
keep doing it and enjoying it.

00:30:12.194 --> 00:30:14.610
OLIVIA CHUN: I started playing
like the piano when I was I

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:16.160
think like five.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.346
And but professionally singing
and acting and dancing,

00:30:20.346 --> 00:30:21.470
I started when I was eight.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.407
And then also singing and
dancing non-professionally,

00:30:25.407 --> 00:30:26.990
I started when I was
like five or six.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:33.560
JOHN ALLYN: I started doing this
professionally when I was seven

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.860
because I was also in another
show called "Peter Pan

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:42.470
Live," which was really fun, but
this was the big step for me.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.720
"Peter Pan" was just
a small little step.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.370
But this was the bigger step.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.610
SPEAKER 1: In front
of millions of people.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.830
A little thing called
"Peter Pan Live."

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:54.080
AMADI CHAPATA: Well,
I have been doing

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.820
what I've been doing,
literally, all my life.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:30:59.390
Literally.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:02.600
Because my mom, like I said,
she's an actress, singer.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.970
So I followed her like a duck.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:08.210
And like, so I get
everything from her,

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.280
like the acting, the singing.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.210
And also my dad.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.260
He's a musician.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.690
So I play a little
bit of a ukulele

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:16.910
and a little bit of guitar.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:18.170
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.260
Laura?

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.230
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.870
You are all so poised and
polishes at such young ages.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:25.100
I'm so impressed.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.920
Does anybody get stage fright?

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.640
And if so, how do
you overcome it?

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:32.050
SPEAKER 1: Gabby?

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:32.925
GABRIELLE GREENE: OK.

00:31:32.925 --> 00:31:35.560
So you know like saying, like
picture everybody in underwear?

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.920
Well, I picture everyone like in
pajamas or Halloween costumes.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.310
So that kind of makes
me laugh, like you know.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.210
SPEAKER 1: Olivia?

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.210
OLIVIA CHUN: So on my
opening night for the show,

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.060
I was performing with
Rachel over there,

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.800
and we were both
like really nervous.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.160
And we both were squeezing
each other's hands.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.210
We did like a shake off.

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.310
It was really fun.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:00.070
SPEAKER 1: Zack.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:04.010
ZACHARY ZWELLING: So, I
don't get stage fright

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.010
but I do get nervous sometimes.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:10.240
I get nervous more from the
small crowds than the Broadway.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.550
Because when you do
something so much

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.530
and you don't tend
to get nervous

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.170
that much for like Broadway.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.700
Also, on my opening night,
it's hard to be nervous

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.450
like when you have
so many amazing cast

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:25.360
mates just cheering you on,
telling you, you're awesome.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.070
It's going to be great.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.080
SPEAKER 1: John?

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.120
JOHN ALLYN: Well,
I joined the cast

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.940
with Zack, Gabby, and Levi.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:37.930
And before I went on
stage, I enter with Levi.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.690
And we were both really
nervous, like what Olivia said.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:43.360
We were squeezing each other's
hands, taking deep breaths

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.410
in and out.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.690
And then when we
opened the doors,

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:48.580
I was shocked that
I was actually

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.020
living my dream on Broadway.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.040
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:52.840
I'd love to get to
more of you, but we're

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.320
going to take another one
from the crowd real quick.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.350
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:59.770
So I'm just curious, between
school and performing,

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.350
do you actually have time for
extracurriculars, hanging out

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:03.070
with friends?

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:06.370
And if you do, what
do you like to do?

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:07.120
SPEAKER 1: Rachel?

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.200
RACHEL KATZKE: So, in
terms of hanging out

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.210
with school friends, I actually
don't have that much time.

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:13.390
Like actually last
night, my friend

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:16.000
wrote to me, like hey, can
we have a sleep over tomorrow

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.157
night, which is like today.

00:33:17.157 --> 00:33:17.990
I'm like, no, sorry.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.573
I can't because I
have a show tonight.

00:33:19.573 --> 00:33:21.730
And then for like extra
curricular, I have--

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:24.910
since I'm home schooled
I have more time--

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:30.180
so yeah, I have a lesson
every week or something.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.650
SPEAKER 1: Amadi?

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.260
AMADI CHAPATA: Well,
we do have days off.

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:38.632
Like on Wednesday, we have the
rest-- we have one matinee.

00:33:38.632 --> 00:33:39.840
Then Thursday, whole day off.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.470
Then today, we have
a show tonight.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:45.730
But I love to hang out
with different friends.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:49.600
Like a friend that actually
just left the cast,

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.210
sadly, her name is Ruthie
and she played Marcy.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:55.540
We had like sleep overs
and had a lot of fun.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.492
We went out to eat.

00:33:56.492 --> 00:33:58.450
But we don't do too much
because we, of course,

00:33:58.450 --> 00:33:59.158
have to get rest.

00:33:59.158 --> 00:34:03.475
Because eight shows a
week is pretty intense.

00:34:03.475 --> 00:34:04.750
SPEAKER 1: Olivia?

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:08.280
OLIVIA CHUN: So after school
on Mondays, I have a club.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.852
On Tuesdays, I have a club.

00:34:09.852 --> 00:34:11.310
And then on Fridays,
I have a club.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.520
So this year, my
parents have tried

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:19.659
to get me more into like school,
like being like a normal child,

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:22.570
instead of just doing this
even though I love doing it.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:24.449
I just get to hang out
with my friends after,

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:26.920
so I do different clubs.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.850
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, John.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.625
JOHN ALLYN: So I don't
really see my best,

00:34:31.625 --> 00:34:34.429
best friends until
Thursday or day off.

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:38.090
But I still get to see my
really good friends at school.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:41.179
But what I do on my day off is
that I go to my country club

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:44.480
with all my friends and we
try to have as much time

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.993
as we can together because we
never get to see each other.

00:34:48.993 --> 00:34:49.659
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:52.630
I'm going to switch
you questions.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:54.679
So for some of
you, I know we have

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:57.440
Olivia, at least you've been
in another show on Broadway.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.610
I think for everybody else,
this is their first show

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:00.110
on Broadway.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:00.990
Is that right?

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.490
ALL: Yes.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:04.580
SPEAKER 1: So now
that you've done this,

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.590
is this what you
see yourself doing

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.690
for the rest of your life?

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:11.180
Or is this like, you're
just happy to have done this

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.090
and want to go do
something else?

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:13.730
Yeah.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:14.060
GABRIELLE GREENE: Yeah.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.500
I'm a total theater geek.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.640
Like as soon as I
moved here, I'm like,

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.060
whoa, like I started
looking up some old shows,

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.000
listening to music, just kind of
getting out there just in case

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.180
like revivals and stuff,
there's like a lot of revivals

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.530
that's been happening recently.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:30.270
So I just look up some
songs, like "Cabaret,"

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.850
I've been obsessed
with "Cabaret."

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.440
"Hamilton," of course.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.010
SPEAKER 1: Lauren?

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:37.926
RACHEL KATZKE: Rachel.

00:35:37.926 --> 00:35:39.052
SPEAKER 1: Rachel, sorry.

00:35:39.052 --> 00:35:41.510
RACHEL KATZKE: As a kid, like
I definitely love doing this.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.480
And I'm going to be keep doing
it like as much as I want to.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.690
But when I'm an adult,
I'm a huge fan of animals,

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.150
so I want to be a veterinarian.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:52.052
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:35:52.052 --> 00:35:53.000
Levi?

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.240
LEVI BUKSBAZEN: So after
this, I kind of just

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.085
want to stick with my drumming
and get so much better at it,

00:36:01.085 --> 00:36:05.750
like try and be Neil Peart-ish.

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:06.860
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.735
Let's just go down the
rest of the line then.

00:36:08.735 --> 00:36:11.874
We'll take another question
from another Googler.

00:36:11.874 --> 00:36:13.790
CONNER GILLOOLY: This
is just a stepping stone

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:17.720
to get to my real passion,
which is quilting.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.710
This is cool.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:19.370
I'll stay here.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.480
ZACHARY ZWELLING: So
I agree with Levi.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.200
The thing is, I never thought
I would be on Broadway.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:35.780
Like it's all, the future
is just so unpredictable.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.780
And I can't, I don't
ever, ever, ever want

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.970
to say that I'm
going to do this.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.930
Like I want to, like because
I want to be able to,

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.070
I want to have options.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.290
I want to do as many
things as I want.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:53.450
And after this, if there's a
Broadway show that I really

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:56.930
want to do, try out for,
then I'll try out for it.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:00.230
But I really, I aspire
to be like Jimmy Page.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.360
So I like the guitar playing.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.280
Yeah.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.740
OLIVIA CHUN: For me, I
really love doing this.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.980
But also, I want to be
a doctor when I grow up.

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:14.670
So I think, if I get another,
if I do something after this,

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:15.990
then like maybe I'll do it.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:17.615
But it's going to be
harder because I'm

00:37:17.615 --> 00:37:18.890
in middle school next year.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:21.900
But I also, later on, maybe
after like middle school,

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.850
I just wanna, I want to kind of
be a normal child a little bit

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:29.502
and then move on.

00:37:29.502 --> 00:37:31.460
JOHN ALLYN: I definitely
want to stay with this

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.810
for the rest of my life.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:36.680
But after "Peter Pan,"
I needed a long break

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.780
to have time with my friends.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.120
And I feel the same after this.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.800
But if this doesn't
work out for me,

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.630
I also have another
thing I want to do,

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:47.706
and that would be
professional swimming.

00:37:47.706 --> 00:37:48.372
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.949
AMADI CHAPATA: Well, I
definitely want to do this.

00:37:53.949 --> 00:37:55.740
Like I said, I've been
doing it all my life

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:59.160
and I really want
to stay up to this.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.730
I will do anything that
the Lord takes me to,

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:05.580
and where the path goes--

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.419
Broadway, TV, anything.

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:09.210
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:10.433
We have one more question.

00:38:10.433 --> 00:38:11.058
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:11.058 --> 00:38:13.014
I have another question.

00:38:13.014 --> 00:38:14.970
You guys are so cool.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.470
I imagine, being
on Broadway, you

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.320
get to meet other
really cool people.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.935
Have you ever gotten to meet--

00:38:21.935 --> 00:38:22.810
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:25.710
We'll go down the
line, best star

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:27.222
sighting since you started.

00:38:27.222 --> 00:38:28.680
We'll start here
and we'll go down.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.470
GABRIELLE GREENE: Tyler Haynes
from "Cats" at Starbucks.

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:34.221
RACHEL KATZKE: Bruno
Mars and Ben Platt.

00:38:34.221 --> 00:38:35.970
LEVI BUKSBAZEN: Christian
Borle on his way

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:37.992
to "Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory."

00:38:37.992 --> 00:38:39.450
CONNER GILLOOLY:
I met Reed Bernie.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.076
He's a really nice guy.

00:38:41.076 --> 00:38:42.454
Yeah.

00:38:42.454 --> 00:38:44.870
ZACHARY ZWELLING: Probably
Michael Rucker that plays Yondu

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:46.036
in "Guardian of the Galaxy."

00:38:46.036 --> 00:38:48.030
He came to see the show.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:50.610
OLIVIA CHUN: I would
say Michelle Obama.

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:52.470
I was in "King and
I" and she came

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.330
for one of the King's last day.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:58.070
And also Ben Platt
and Bruno Mars.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.090
JOHN ALLYN: Christian
Borle, Kelly O'Hara,

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:04.280
Christopher Walken, Allison
Williams, and Ben Platt.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.812
SPEAKER 1: Who?

00:39:05.812 --> 00:39:08.670
JOHN ALLYN: Ben Platt.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:10.970
AMADI CHAPATA: I honestly--

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:13.350
it was my opening
night, actually.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.030
And I got to meet Bruno Mars.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.932
I got to hug him.

00:39:15.932 --> 00:39:16.890
He gave me a handshake.

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.450
And he told me
that I did awesome.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:21.210
And I'm very sad that
I had to wash my hand.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.544
But that's OK.

00:39:23.544 --> 00:39:24.210
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.549
Well, we are coming close
to the end of the time.

00:39:26.549 --> 00:39:28.840
We're going to have one more
performance from the cast.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.690
But before we do, I have one
parting question for everybody.

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:33.190
All right.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:36.150
So this is a school all
about rock, all about music.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:37.620
You're on a desert island.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.720
You can listen to one song
for the rest of your life.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.590
What is it?

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:45.064
Amadi, we'll start on your side
and we'll work our way down.

00:39:45.064 --> 00:39:46.230
You've been last every time.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.980
Now you're first.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.370
AMADI CHAPATA: OK.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:51.870
OK.

00:39:51.870 --> 00:40:02.040
I think I'm going to go with
Michael Jackson, I don't know.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:02.880
All of his songs.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.750
All of it.

00:40:13.782 --> 00:40:16.240
JOHN ALLYN: Not to be a copier,
but I love Michael Jackson.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.510
So his whole playlist.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:19.894
SPEAKER 1: It's a good choice.

00:40:19.894 --> 00:40:21.810
OLIVIA CHUN: Does this
have to be a rock song?

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:22.393
SPEAKER 1: No.

00:40:22.393 --> 00:40:23.400
One song.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.316
OLIVIA CHUN: If there's
one song I could pick,

00:40:25.316 --> 00:40:27.390
it would be "Should Have
Been Us" by Tori Kelly.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:28.620
She's my favorite artist.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.870
ZACHARY ZWELLING: Can you
come back to me because this

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:33.070
is a hard question.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:36.436
CONNER GILLOOLY: It's got to be
"Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen.

00:40:36.436 --> 00:40:37.480
ALL: Ooh.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.160
CONNER GILLOOLY:
Did I steal yours?

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.350
SPEAKER 1: Crowd favorite.

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:42.510
LEVI BUKSBAZEN: That
was a nice answer.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.830
I don't know if any
of you know this band,

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:48.560
but it's called Snarky Puppy.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.257
SPEAKER 1: No, but I will
Google it afterwards.

00:40:51.257 --> 00:40:52.840
LEVI BUKSBAZEN:
Google the song, "What

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.156
About Me" because I
absolutely love that song.

00:40:56.156 --> 00:40:57.280
SPEAKER 1: By Snarky Puppy.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.224
All right.

00:40:58.224 --> 00:41:00.640
"Dreaming of the Broken Heart"
or "Gravity" by John Mayer,

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.682
or any song from John
Mayer's "Continuum" album.

00:41:03.682 --> 00:41:04.640
SPEAKER 1: Nice choice.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.181
GABRIELLE GREENE:
"Bohemian Rhapsody"

00:41:06.181 --> 00:41:09.040
by Queen, or Roberta
Flack, "Killing Me Softly."

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.316
ZACHARY ZWELLING: OK.

00:41:10.316 --> 00:41:12.970
He gave me the Queen idea.

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.350
So I'm going to do "Don't
Stop Me Now" by Queen.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:18.320
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.590
Guys, this was so much
fun talking to you.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:24.590
As everybody said, you are so
poised and fun and intelligent,

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.090
obviously.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.430
Super talented musicians.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.330
So thank you all so
much for being here.

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:30.880
I think we're going
to close it out

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.920
with one song from you, Connor.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.640
And then if we can just
get a round of applause

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.270
to thank them for being here.

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:41.680
CONNER GILLOOLY: You thought
they were impressive,

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.130
be prepared to be
slightly disappointed.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:49.496
Feast your eyes, your
ears, and your butts.

00:41:49.496 --> 00:41:51.906
[SINGING]

00:45:20.139 --> 00:45:20.930
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.
