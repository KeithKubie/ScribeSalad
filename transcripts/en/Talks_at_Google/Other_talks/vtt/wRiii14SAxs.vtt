&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Good afternoon, everyone.
[audience responds] My name is LaFawn Bailey.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.190
I'm with the Global Diversity and Inclusion
Team. I'm also a member of the Black Googler's

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.380
Network. So, on behalf of the Network and
Authors at, I'd like to welcome you here today.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.939
I have the absolute pleasure of introducing
D. Clarence B Jones.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.909
His remarks today are titled, "Reflections
on The Legacy of Martin Luther King, Junior

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:29.679
and Black History Month." Dr Jones is a--.
I'm just gonna give you a few highlights 'cause

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.579
I don't want to ruin the conversation. But
he's a Scholar Writer in Residence and Visiting

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.950
Professor at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research
and Education Institute at Stanford University

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.860
at Palo Alto.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.870
He served as Speech Writer and counsel to
Martin Luther King, Jr. and was co-writer

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.170
of the "I Have a Dream" speech. He's also
provided strategic, legal, and financial consulting

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.769
services to several governments around the
world, including the Bahamas, the Dominican

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.460
Republic, Jamaica, and Zambia.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.420
He has received numerous state and national
awards recognizing his significant contributions

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.690
to American society. He's kind of a super
star. He has also been a subject of numerous

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:19.880
television and radio interview programs, such
as CNN, the O'Reilly Factor, NPR, and BBC.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.200
He completed teaching for the second time
of his successful course, "From Slavery to

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.829
Obama," at Stanford University's School of
Continuing Studies, Master of Liberal Arts

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.770
program. He wrote, "Behind the Dream: The
Making of a Speech that Transformed a Nation."

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.310
He's currently co-writing a book, "Where Were
You?" for the 50th anniversary of the assassination

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.950
of President John F. Kennedy. And he's also
a regular columnist on the Huffington Post.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.310
Lastly, he is writing his autobiography, "Memoirs
of a Wintertime Soldier." So, without further

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.130
ado, Dr. Clarence B. Jones.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.130
[applause]

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.369
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: Thank you very much.
This is my second time here at Google. The

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:14.160
first time, I came to be with my god-daughter,
Soledad O'Brien. And so, when you had this

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.310
special program in, I had a chance to see
the campus and so forth as I said.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.200
Anyway, I'm delighted to be here. I am honored
that you provided me with this opportunity

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.010
to share with you my views on the legacy of
Martin Luther King Jr. and Black History Month.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.010
Very succinctly.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.379
In 12 years and four months, 1956 to 1968,
aside from President Abraham Lincoln and the

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:45.170
Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, Martin
Luther King, Jr. may have done more to achieve

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.709
social, racial, political, and economic justice
in America than any other single event or

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.280
person in the previous 400 years of history
of our country.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.120
My oldest daughter is a graduate of Brown
University. I have five children. Brown University,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.590
Georgetown University Law School, and Wharton
School of Finance. Perhaps like some of you

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.610
today, at one time, she believed her subsequent
career opportunities and success were solely

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.299
because of her individual dedication and achievement.
With her newly minted, prestigious academic

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.629
degrees, she just knew she was bad.

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:23.629
[laughter]

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:30.170
Help me, somebody. Prior to Martin Luther
King Jr., America was like a dysfunctional

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.930
drug or alcoholic addict. We had become addicted
to racial segregation. We had tried to kick

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.069
our habit of dependency and addiction to racism
and institutional segregation.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.909
With his tough love of non-violent civil disobedience,
Dr. King forced America's conscious to publicly

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:55.010
confront the contradiction between the reality
of how it treated 12 percent of its population--African

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.630
Americans--and those precepts enshrined in
our Declaration of Independence.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.599
Dr. King's tough love enabled America to embark
on an extraordinary, peaceful journey to recover

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.400
its soul. He raised the consciousness of America
on the issue of race and gender equality in

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.970
America, making it possible for my oldest
daughter and many of you--white, black, and

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.720
Asian--to enjoy the opportunity and positions
you now have at Google.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.550
America has been a country of slavery longer
than it has been a free country. The ideological

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.820
foundation of slavery was that the ancestors
of African Americans were of a different species

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.770
of human beings, inferior in intellect and
culture to that of their slave masters.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.850
Slave owners had no interest in the language,
culture, or history of their slaves. It was

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.360
a criminal felony in slave-holding states
to teach a slave to read or write. Therefore,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.370
slaves were deemed to have no history worthy
of transmitting from generation to generation.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:05.120
The average white person and African American
was for decades educated in school systems

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.830
where most textbooks omitted or relegated
to inconsequential textual coverage the history

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.660
and contributions of generations of African
Americans to our society.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.420
James W. Loewen's book, "Lies My Teacher Told
Me: Everything your American history textbook

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.970
got wrong," should be read by everyone who
has any doubt about the accuracy of my assertion.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.500
Why no Irish, Italian, Jewish, or Scandinavian
History Month?

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:43.350
Irish, Italian, Jewish, or Scandinavian forefathers
and foremothers were not forcibly uprooted

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:50.070
from their native homelands and brought to
America in chains and endured a Middle Passage

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:57.320
aboard slave ships that killed an estimated
25 million plus during transport to our shores.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.770
They and the forefathers of other ethnic groups
in our country were not enslaved by our national

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:10.890
government, or sanctioned by our national
government. To fully appreciate the magnitude

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:16.900
of Dr. King's contribution to our country,
we have to revisit an important crossroad

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.340
in the development of race relations in America.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.270
In 1857, the United States posed this question.
Quote. Can a Negro whose ancestors were imported

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:33.430
into this country and sold as slaves become
a member of the political community formed

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.650
and brought into the existence by the Constitution
of the United States, and as such become entitled

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:47.400
to all rights and privileges and immunities
guaranteed by that instrument to the citizens,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.180
one of which rights is the privilege of suing
in a court of the United States?

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.870
The Supreme Court of the United States, in
the decision of Dred Scott versus Sanford,

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:05.410
ruled that blacks, both free and enslaved,
were guaranteed no rights, civil, social,

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.960
or political by the United States Constitution.
Chief Justice Taney stated that blacks were

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.270
not citizens because at the time that the
Constitution was drafted they were, quote,

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:22.300
considered as a subordinate and inferior class
of beings and had no rights or privileges

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.100
but such as the government might choose to
grant them.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:31.250
The court did not say that the Irish, Italian,
Jewish, Scandinavian, or the forefathers of

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.100
other ethnic groups were guaranteed no rights,
civil, social, or political by the United

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.980
States Constitution. Justice Taney continued
and said, "When the founding fathers wrote

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:48.240
the Declaration of Independence, the legitimacy
of slavery, quote, was fixed and universal

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.900
in the civilized portion of the white race.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:08:00.720
It was regarded as an axiom in morals as well
as in politics. Now, this Supreme Court ruling

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:09.720
was superseded and overruled by the passage
of the 13th and 14th Amendments in 1865 and

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:19.070
1868, respectively. This was the legal foundation
underlying Martin Luther King Jr.'s moral

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.040
leadership to transform America.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.970
That is, Section One of the 14th Amendment
which provides that all persons born or naturalized

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:35.090
in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof are citizens of the United States

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.470
of the state wherein they reside.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:42.470
And that no state shall make or enforce any
law which shall abridge the privileges or

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:48.430
immunities of the citizens of the United States,
nor shall any state deprive any person of

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:55.410
life, liberty, or property without due process
of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.580
the equal protection of the laws.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:05.450
Against the background of systematic exclusion
of the history, of the language and culture,

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.640
and other contributions of African Americans
to the development of our country, a month

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.740
devoted to reflecting on black history is
not inappropriate. A focus on our history

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:22.950
will also reveal the significant contributions
of white people, especially Jewish people,

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.490
to the struggle for our civil rights.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:30.010
Jews played a leading role in the formation
of the National Association for the Advancement

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:37.140
of Colored People. Two Jewish brothers, Joel
Elias Spingarn and Arthur Spingarn, served

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:46.070
at varying times as the organization's president.
November 28th, I was watching the Presidential

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:51.130
Election returns at Palo Alto at the home
of a colleague of mine, Dr. Clayborne Carson,

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:56.070
who is the director of the King Institute
here at Stanford.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:02.630
There were several people assembled when the
TV networks announced that Senator Barack

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:12.121
Obama had accumulated sufficient Electoral
votes to be declared President Elect. Several

00:10:12.121 --> 00:10:18.680
persons in the room began to shed tears. I
was asked, have I ever thought I would live

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.950
long enough to see an African American elected
President of the United States?

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:32.510
I said, "No." However, I also said, "My tears
were not because of Senator Obama's election.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:40.510
My tears were for all those persons whom I
personally knew who were no longer living,

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:47.200
but who had made possible the election of
Barack Obama." Black history has been written

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.380
from the struggle of black people to be free.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:55.680
It includes not only the role and contributions
of people like Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman,

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.710
Frederick Douglas, W. E. B. DuBois, Rosa Parks,
Jimmy Lee Jackson, Ella Baker, Fannie Lou

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:09.510
Hamer, Hosea Williams, Martin and Coretta
Scott King, at all, but also several white

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:17.730
people such as Viola Liuzzo, Reverend James
Reeb, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, Jonathan

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:24.670
Daniels, Rabbi Harold and Marcia Saperstein,
and two young men from Manhattan, New York,

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:30.730
Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, who
in the summer of 1964 went to Mississippi

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:35.120
to assist African Americans to vote.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.790
They were brutally murdered by the Ku Klux
Klan in Philadelphia, Mississippi. John Johnson,

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:48.040
the founder and publisher of Ebony and Jet
magazine, and Martin Luther King Jr. may have

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.980
done more to enable a whole generation of
African Americans to look from whence they

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.500
came.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.210
Their contributions to our country and who
they really are than perhaps any two single

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:06.600
individuals in the 20th Century. Bombarded
24/7 in print and in television with the white

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:12.390
Hollywood standard of beauty and success,
Ebony magazine sought to celebrate the achievement

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:17.100
of blacks in America and the black experience
in general.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:23.920
Martin Luther King Jr. gave black people a
sense of purpose that they were somebody.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:30.570
Yes, that indeed, black was beautiful and
that a racist could not ride on your back

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:38.050
if you are not bent over, but walking upright
and tall. Black history has been written from

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.940
the struggles of black people to be free.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:48.840
Today, we witness the peculiar historical
attributes of the black experience becoming

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:56.960
the fuel that drives the engine of much of
the popular culture in America in dance, language,

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:04.090
fashion, sports, and music. In 2008, as I
said, Americans elected an African American

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.850
as its 44th President of the United States.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:15.490
Maybe the power of the absorption and the
adoption of the historical experience of black

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:24.110
Americans into the mainstream majority in
America means that someday, Black History

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:33.670
Month will no longer be necessary, potentially
becoming an anachronism and an historic dinosaur.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.270
Thank you so much.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.590
[applause]

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.550
I'll take questions.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:47.440
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: One of the first questions
that were posted is, in your book, you have

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.650
a chapter where you write about James Earl
Ray. And as you would say, it's truth-telling

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:58.920
time. In your opinion, what would Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. say about his assassination?

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:13.200
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: In my opinion, one of
the things he might say is that he would forgive

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:22.940
James Earl Ray, but he would not forgive the
United States government and media that would

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:33.750
want to perpetuate the fairy tale that James
Earl Ray was the sole, single person involved

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.650
in the assassination of Martin Luther King,
Jr.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:43.779
And let me be very clear. James Earl Ray pulled
the trigger of the rifle that killed Martin

00:14:43.779 --> 00:14:49.800
Luther King, Jr. But let me also be very clear.
The assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:56.860
did not result from James Earl Ray getting
up one morning on April 4th, 1968 and say,

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.850
"Today is the day I'm gonna kill that King
nigger."

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:09.440
That is not what happened. Martin Luther King
Jr. was killed with the James Earl Ray pulling

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:20.750
the trigger by the cold, premeditated, calculated,
conspiratorial determination of murder. He

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:27.940
was killed as a result of cold, calculated,
conspiratorial agreement of murder.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:37.930
We don't know who the other people are yet.
But as they say, at least in the older generations,

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:43.630
there used to be a saying that the truth will
out. It probably won't come out in my limited

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:51.990
life time, but it will come out. It will come
out someday as to who the other people were

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.050
who participated.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:16:00.130
A fourth grade educated person, convict, had
intimate knowledge of Canada, had intimate

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:04.180
knowledge of the geography of London, had
all these plans? Please. Give me a break.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.870
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Thank you. Did you want to
ask a question?

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.110
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: Hi. Thanks for visiting us and
sharing with us. It's an honor to speak with

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:17.480
you. I'm curious about your opinion about
what is the greatest obstacle to that day

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:24.420
that you speak of when we don't even need
Black History Month because racism is forgotten?

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.779
What is the greatest obstacle to achieving
colorblind equality and what can we do to

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:30.149
confront it?

00:16:30.149 --> 00:16:41.160
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: OK. First, let me respond
and define because you use a phrase which

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:46.350
is frequently used and I've used it myself,
but I want us to be speaking in the same language

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.110
and the same baseline.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:55.101
The concept of colorblind equality may mean
different things to different people. But

00:16:55.101 --> 00:17:06.380
in the Martin Luther King Jr. sense, colorblind
equality means not that a person is blind

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:13.230
to color, but that the color is irrelevant
in the judgment you make on a person.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:18.670
Anybody who tells me that I'm colorblind,
I would say, "Well, you need to go see an

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.350
ophthalmologist because you have a serious
problem."

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.350
[laughter]

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:30.420
OK? Colorblind, in terms of prejudice and
racism, really means we arrive at a point

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:35.830
where the judgment or determination as to
what opportunities will be made available

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:42.560
across the whole spectrum of circumstances--education,
housing, employment--is that the color of

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.130
the person who's seeking those opportunities
is totally irrelevant.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.540
The only thing that's relevant is their qualifications.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:58.090
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: I'll read a question from
our moderator page. "If you were to rewrite

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:02.160
the speech for today's audience, what would
you change, if anything?"

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.930
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: Well, it's interesting
that you should say that [audience chuckles]

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:15.330
because one of the things I'm contemplating
is that 2013 is going to be the 50th anniversary

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:24.050
from the march on Washington and the "I Have
a Dream" speech and I am contemplating drafting

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:33.300
a 2013 version of what that speech might say.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:47.920
But in direct response to your question, it's
hard for me to give a weighted sequence of

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:59.520
importance. I can think of one thing, for
example. Over the years, whether as a result

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:09.020
of a failed drug policy or whether as a result
of the unequal racist application of laws,

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:16.800
is that young black men who have run afoul
of the law for a whole combination of reasons--many

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:26.480
of them being drugs--constitute an overwhelming
segment of our incarcerated population in

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.480
prisons.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:33.570
It is a national disgrace. Someone who has
studied this extensively is Professor Michelle

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.980
Alexander. She has a book out on this, which
I recommend, whose title I can't think of

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:42.100
right now, but she deals with I think it's
the rise of the--. I think it's "Jim Crow

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.730
and the Rise of the Incarcerated State," but
I may be wrong.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:52.370
So, that's one thing I would change. And Dr.
King was a minister of the gospel before he

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:57.250
was a civil rights leader. And the intersection
of both of those things and his study and

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:02.679
commitment to the velocity of Gandhi made
him deeply spiritually, intellectually, and

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:03.760
totally committed to non-violence.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:14.240
So, he would be appalled by the escalation
of violence. I might remind you that on April

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:23.110
4th, 1967, one year to the date of his assassination,
he gave a speech at Riverside Chapel in New

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:28.020
York before a committee called Concerned Laymen
and Clergy. It was time to break the silence.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:38.330
It was his first public declaration of opposition
to the Vietnam War. And in that speech, there

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:44.179
was one sentence that was so powerful. As
you get down in like, the first three minutes

00:20:44.179 --> 00:20:51.410
of the speech as you read it, it has a sentence.
It says, at that time, April 4th, 1967, calling

00:20:51.410 --> 00:21:00.190
for an end to the Vietnam War he says, "The
United States today is the greatest purveyor

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.450
of violence in the world. Period."

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:04.200
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: It's still true.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.940
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Hi, Dr. Jones.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.340
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: Yes.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:13.870
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Thank you for coming today. My
question is this, and as you mentioned, unfortunately,

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:17.260
many of the leaders that you marched alongside
and worked alongside are no longer with us

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.260
today.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:24.380
And obviously as time goes on, we're looking
for that next generation of leadership to

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.990
be that moral compass, if you will. So, I
wanted to know in your opinion, if there's

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:33.990
anybody that you see now as the up and coming
rising star? And if so, and even if not, what

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.440
advice would you give them?

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:41.090
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: [sighs] Well, there
are lots of up and coming rising stars, a

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:46.450
new generation of leaders. But here, I'm gonna
have to give you an answer that I've given

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:50.961
ad nauseum. And so, maybe some of you have
read it or heard it because I've given it

00:21:50.961 --> 00:21:52.500
on NPR.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:58.030
And so, I have to just say it again. When
people ask me who, today, if anyone, do I

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:04.620
think is most like Martin Luther King Jr.,
I use the Latin phrase called "svi generis,"

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:10.960
which means one of a kind, unique. And I answer
their question with a rhetorical question.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:23.320
Who today, if anyone, is like Galileo? Like
Mozart? Like Beethoven? Shakespeare? Copernicus?

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:40.600
Michelangelo? No one. If you were fortunate
enough to be alive from 1956 until April 4th,

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:49.190
1968, and metaphorically, you walked outside
at midnight and looked up at the sky and saw

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:57.130
a shooting star across the heavens, and you
saw a shooting star of such incandescent brightness,

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:05.000
a brightness that had never been seen before
by any astronomer or by you, that shooting

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.720
star was Martin Luther King Jr.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:19.040
We will never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
see that shooting star again in our lifetime

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.390
or in the millennium.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.840
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: OK. Did you have another
question?

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:31.210
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: So, like possibly many people
in here, when I was in college, I did some

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:37.440
research and a paper on Martin Luther King.
And one of the things that I noted is that

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:43.240
it was Vietnam when he started talking about
Vietnam, that seemed to cause more problems

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.830
for him than anything else.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:54.200
And also the Kennedys were starting to object
to Vietnam. And so, when you were saying like,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:24:00.299
the conspiracy that James Earl Ray and obviously
the others, weren't the ones that organized

00:24:00.299 --> 00:24:07.980
pulling the trigger. Do you think that Vietnam
actually influenced his death along with the

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:08.980
Kennedys?

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:19.600
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: I think that his public
opposition to the war in Vietnam, I think

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:27.700
more on a continuing basis is beginning his
raising the issue of poverty and income inequality

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:28.820
in America.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:36.590
It is important, some of you by looking at
your apparent age demographic, may not know

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:47.310
that when he spoke in April 4th, 1967 at the
time of his assassination, while there was

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:53.480
a great national outcry of grief, while subsequently
there were national monuments, the fact of

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:58.790
the matter is that he had become a pariah.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:09.000
Even people--many leaders of civil rights
organizations--begin to publicly turn on him.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:18.840
And so-called liberal friends, and this includes
people from the churches, it includes people

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:25.799
among civil rights organizations, and certainly
people in Congress, they, in effect, felt

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:32.000
that he didn't have the right that, "Who is
he? Just a preacher. How dare he speak out

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.661
and challenge the policy, the government of
the United States?"

00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:43.480
The fact of the matter is that he had become
persona non grata. Now, with respect to the

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:52.850
Kennedys, I don't have enough time to say
and give the right nuanced response to the

00:25:52.850 --> 00:26:00.450
question, but I will simply recite a historical
fact. And you conclude from that historical

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:05.000
fact whatever you wish to conclude.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:18.490
From July 13th, 1963 to December 1967, on
the authorization of the Attorney General

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:27.490
of the United States, Robert Kennedy and J
Edgar Hoover every single telephone call that

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:36.320
occurred between Martin Luther King Jr. and
myself, from my home to his home, from my

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:45.010
home to his office, from his home to my office,
24/7 was wire-tapped.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:54.770
And a written transcription of the conversation
written down so that you--. Let me make it

00:26:54.770 --> 00:27:01.980
plain. When I was writing the first book,
the publisher--maybe it was the first or second

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.540
book, I can never remember--the publisher
said to me, "You know, Mr. Jones, we don't

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:12.470
doubt what you say, plus you signed an agreement
warranting us against any suits for anything."

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:18.630
He said, "But some of the things you say or
suggest based on what you say, and you appear

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:24.940
to have a pretty good recollection." So, I
said, "Well, that's not completely true."

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:32.210
So, whenever this instance would come up challenging
my memory or credibility, I would simply bring

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.450
in a photo static copy of the FBI transcript.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:42.950
So, somebody will say, "Well, you said he
gave this speech in August in San Francisco

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:46.910
from the Mark Hopkins Hotel about this." And
I says, "Yes, he did." So, I just bring in

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:55.190
the transcript. The transcript reads, "August
so and so, 10:30 in the morning. Clarence

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:57.320
Jones and Martin Luther King, Jr."

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:03.230
It's just right on everything. So, what's
connecting it to that? It's tied into also

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:09.120
the first question, one of the first questions,
James Earl Ray. So, when Martin King was assassinated,

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.510
I'm saying to myself--. My first reaction
start when I got over the grief and horror

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.510
of it all.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:22.920
I said, "You know? They knew everything I
was doing and he was doing 24/7." When I went

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.480
to the bathroom. By the way, it's included
photographic surveillance, not just--. I mean,

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.000
do you understand what I'm saying? There were
cameras, people with cameras, little telescopic

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.530
ones, taking photographs everywhere we went
when we met.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:39.370
So, I'm saying, "If they can do that to Martin
Luther King and myself, you mean to tell me

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:46.360
they knew nothing about James Earl Ray?" I
rest my case.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:53.230
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Thank you. I'll ask one more
Dory question here. It says, "At first, you

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.270
were hesitant to leave domestic tranquility--

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.270
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: Oh, I know what that
is.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:01.780
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: "to help a total stranger,
Dr. King. Could you talk about the important

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.910
role that your wife played in encouraging
you to get involved?"

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:13.900
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: Well, I have to make
this, a long answer, short. But in 1960, Dr.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:20.370
King was indicted by the State of Alabama
for lying on his tax for federal tax evasion.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:27.010
And I had just gotten out of law school after
being in the military service after the Korean

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:28.010
War.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:34.169
I didn't combat, but anyway, I had just been
out of law school six or seven months. And

00:29:34.169 --> 00:29:39.370
his chief defense counsel got in touch with
me in California. He said, "We need a law

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:45.010
clerk to go and help us prepare the defense
of Dr. King. The only problem is you have

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.980
to travel to Montgomery, Alabama 'cause that's
where the defense of the case is."

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:54.600
So, I said, "No, I can't do that Judge." His
name was Judge Delaney. Fast forward is that

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:03.720
during the course of this, he arranged for
Dr. King to come to my home, not specifically

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:10.309
to see me, but Dr. King had a speaking engagement
in Los Angeles for something else.

00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:12.620
And since his chief defense counsel said,
"Well, since you're gonna be in Los Angeles,

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.390
why don't you stop by and see this lawyer
and tell him what you're trying to do?" I

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:21.669
said, "Dr. King, come into my house." We sit
down and he--.

00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:28.060
My wife was—who is now deceased--the mother
of my adult children and he says, "You know,

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:34.150
Mr. Jones? We have lots of white lawyers who
help us, but we need young Negro lawyers like

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:38.040
you to help us." And I said, "Well, Dr. King,
I'd love to help you, but I can't."

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:44.970
Anyway, I decided I just couldn't do it. So,
when he leaves--. I'm fast forwarding this.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:49.740
I describe in greater detail in one of the
books. But when he leaves, my deceased wife

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:56.049
turns to me and she says, "What do you think
you're doing that is so important that you

00:30:56.049 --> 00:30:59.460
can't help this man that came all this distance
to see you?"

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:05.130
And I said, "Excuse me." Her name was Ann.
I said, "Ann. That's not quite true. He did

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:11.030
not come all this distance to see me and ask
my help. He had a speaking engagement and

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:15.580
Judge Delaney suggested he stop by and see
me. And besides, just because some Negro preacher

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.530
got his hand caught in the cookie jar stealing,
that's not my problem."

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:19.820
[laughter]

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:26.419
"And anyway, if he wasn't guilty he wouldn’t
have been indicted." She says, "I don't believe

00:31:26.419 --> 00:31:32.320
you." I said, "Well, that's how I feel." It
was a cold night in the Jones household that

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.179
night.

00:31:34.179 --> 00:31:36.039
[laughter]

00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:44.620
So, I went to church to see him be a guest
preacher. I mean, a guest sermon. This was

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:51.159
on a Friday night and Thursday night he came.
I'm sorry, Friday night he came. And then,

00:31:51.159 --> 00:32:00.470
on Sunday, I went church where he was a guest
preacher. And listening to him substantially

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:01.470
changed my life.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:08.350
But the answer to the direct question: Ann
Norton Jones had a profound affect because

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:16.800
she had a higher level of consciousness about
the importance of helping Dr. King than I

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:23.440
did. I was narrowly focused and only wanted
to get on with a career in intellectual property

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.440
law.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.440
[laughter]

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.200
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Well, thank goodness for
her.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.510
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: Right.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.140
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: OK, next question.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.830
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: Hi. You alluded to this a little
bit as you were speaking, but can you talk

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:38.250
a little bit more about how Dr. King's religious
convictions influenced all that he stood for?

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:46.830
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: How his religious convictions?
His religious convictions defined to the core

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:57.920
who he was. He was a fourth generation Baptist
preacher. He was encyclopedic with the knowledge

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:16.549
of the Bible and of the Talmud. The "Dr."
in his name is for the PhD he had for a PhD

00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:22.429
in Theology from the Boston School of Theology.

00:33:22.429 --> 00:33:29.640
He used to remind those of us who were close
to him that he was a minister of the gospel

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:40.450
before he was a civil rights leader. An example
of how it influenced him was when we used

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:51.280
to be concerned about his safety. And he would
say, in effect, there is no man, there's nothing

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.950
on Earth that could be done to protect him.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:34:06.140
He lives in the 24-hour protection of the
arms of his Lord Jesus Christ. There's no

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:16.269
need to protect. We were always concerned,
very much concerned, of his safety. President

00:34:16.269 --> 00:34:27.169
John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Friday,
November 22nd, 1963. On the evening of Friday,

00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:34.030
November 22nd, 1963, Dr. King and I finally
both spoke because he had been trying to reach

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.030
me.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.669
And he said, "I'm being besieged by newspaper
reporters. I've got to issue some statement

00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:43.299
in connection with the Kennedy assassination."
He asked if I could come to Atlanta. And I

00:34:43.299 --> 00:34:49.190
said, "No, I couldn't." So, he flew up to
New York and we met at La Guardia Airport

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.040
in the Eastern Airlines lounge terminal.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:58.289
And for three and a half hours, we sat and
crafted the statement that he would issue

00:34:58.289 --> 00:35:05.680
on the assassination of President Kennedy.
But the very first thing he said as he was

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:12.930
coming through the lounge, coming down, deplaning,
coming to the lounge that he saw my attention.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.719
When he got to me, he didn't say "Hi, Clarence.
How are you?" The very first thing he said,

00:35:16.719 --> 00:35:24.829
he said, "You see, if they can get to the
President, they can get to me. So, let's stop

00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:27.880
worrying about all this nonsense of protecting
me."

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.119
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Thank you.

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:37.109
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: Hi. Towards the end of your book,
you talk about the progress that has been

00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:42.749
made since the Civil Rights Movement. And
you talk about redressing some of the inequalities

00:35:42.749 --> 00:35:45.979
that were the legacies of slavery and discrimination.

00:35:45.979 --> 00:35:50.769
So, and I know this is a big question, in
your opinion, where are we on race in America

00:35:50.769 --> 00:35:51.940
today?

00:35:51.940 --> 00:36:05.359
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: We have, America, has
come a long distance, a great distance on

00:36:05.359 --> 00:36:14.339
the question, to use your words, on race in
America today. The election of Barack Obama

00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:30.809
is just some evidence of that. And that the
changing demographics in the population, both

00:36:30.809 --> 00:36:42.499
from age and ethnicity, is generally creating
a much more favorable climate for African

00:36:42.499 --> 00:36:45.440
Americans and other minorities.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:55.809
But in direct response to your question, unfortunately,
we have not reached Nirvana. Or, we have not

00:36:55.809 --> 00:37:09.290
reached Shangri-La. Race still matters. We
wish it didn't matter. In response to an earlier

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:14.720
question, I said about the concept of being
colorblind.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:26.280
I really would like for us to be today, February
15th, 2012, in Mountain View Google Headquarters,

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:34.710
I'd like for us to be in a country where we
could say without fear of contradiction that

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:44.829
racism against African Americans and other
minorities does not exist. But that simply

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:47.010
is not the case.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:58.309
One of the things I think that moral leadership
requires, it requires the ability to see things

00:37:58.309 --> 00:38:08.469
as they really are and not how we would like
them to be. Daniel Patrick Moynihan is quoted

00:38:08.469 --> 00:38:14.160
as saying, "Everybody's entitled to their
own opinion, but you're not entitled to your

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.819
own set of facts."

00:38:17.819 --> 00:38:28.229
There is, really going back on my legal training
and profession, a devastating bill of particulars

00:38:28.229 --> 00:38:39.450
can be compiled about America on February
15th, 2012, that can be submitted in evidence

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:46.009
for the court or the jury determining the
question of whether racism exists.

00:38:46.009 --> 00:38:54.240
Now, there is another question that hasn't
been asked, but I'm sure. And that is, who

00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:00.780
is responsible for this? I don't, I mean,
I'd be, you'd think I was stupid if I came

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:08.299
up to you and said, "Well, there hasn't been
any progress." There's been major, major,

00:39:08.299 --> 00:39:09.839
historic progress.

00:39:09.839 --> 00:39:17.150
I can't tell you, I can't prescribe to you
the time-line when someone sitting in this

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:24.979
chair, or someone we can wake up in America
and we can say, "Today, we are America without

00:39:24.979 --> 00:39:33.249
institutions, without any source of power
being directed against a person or a group

00:39:33.249 --> 00:39:38.509
of persons because of the color of their skin
or their gender."

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:48.430
I am hopeful. I am hopeful because just as
America came through this whole transition

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:55.319
of struggling with race, we're now struggling
with the whole question of gender equality.

00:39:55.319 --> 00:40:02.480
And when you listen and read some, when you
listen to some people and read certain articles,

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:08.859
you would think that the Republic is going
to disintegrate and come apart, you know?

00:40:08.859 --> 00:40:17.709
I mean, I didn't know until recently that
the fact that a woman could love a woman or

00:40:17.709 --> 00:40:22.499
a man can love a man and want to marry, that
that was gonna destroy the Republic. I didn't

00:40:22.499 --> 00:40:32.640
realize that had such consequential effects.
I was raised as a Catholic. And I'm a spiritual,

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.319
religious person.

00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:40.069
And so, I have a practical answer to all of
this anti-gay. I said, "You know, there's

00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:43.229
some contradiction." I just came back from
Jerusalem. I visited Jerusalem and the Holy

00:40:43.229 --> 00:40:46.670
Place and I said, "You know, there's some
contradiction on this whole question of gay

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:56.809
rights. If gay relationships were so bad and
gay people were so bad, per se, why does God

00:40:56.809 --> 00:40:58.849
keep making so many of them?"

00:40:58.849 --> 00:40:59.849
[laughter]

00:40:59.849 --> 00:41:00.849
[applause]

00:41:00.849 --> 00:41:12.700
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Very good point. [laughter]
Thank you. I'm gonna read another question.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:18.099
"Dr. King survived the Civil Rights Movement,
but was killed a month before the Poor People's

00:41:18.099 --> 00:41:23.940
March on Washington. If he were alive today,
how would he try to change the heart of the

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.329
country on the issue of economic justice?"

00:41:27.329 --> 00:41:37.109
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: He would say that that
is the central core question confronting America

00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:52.619
today. Income, inequality, economic injustice,
as you say, I think that he would totally

00:41:52.619 --> 00:42:05.079
identify except for activity of violence and
except for expressions of anti-Semitism.

00:42:05.079 --> 00:42:09.709
Limited expression of violence. Limited activity
of violence. And limited expressions of anti-Semitism

00:42:09.709 --> 00:42:14.390
expressed by the Occupy Wall Street. He would
identify that. He would get it. He would see.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:23.339
I mean, as I say, you don't have to be brilliant.
You have to be deaf, dumb, and blind not to-.

00:42:23.339 --> 00:42:29.059
Even if you can't read a lot, even if you
don't have a lot of education in political

00:42:29.059 --> 00:42:36.690
science and history and so forth, but if you
just look around there's something wrong.

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:49.150
People, there's something wrong. My favorite
statement I say sums up my feelings. Notwithstanding

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:56.089
all of our debt and the public debt, notwithstanding
all of our, we're still an extraordinary rich

00:42:56.089 --> 00:42:57.299
country.

00:42:57.299 --> 00:43:03.759
So, I can't compute when I go back East, I
see it more than I see here, but I see it

00:43:03.759 --> 00:43:12.650
here in parts of San Francisco. I can't compute
in my mind how this rich country can permit

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:20.190
a child to wake up hungry, can permit people
sleeping on the streets. It's not as if we

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:22.319
don't have the resources.

00:43:22.319 --> 00:43:34.430
There is something wrong. So, the answer to
your question. The demonstrated, statistical,

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:44.309
data-supported information of the spread,
the disparity and the wealth, and the disparity

00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:51.500
in income would be something that would be
front and center of his attention today.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:57.959
And he would probably say that you--. Well,
yes. He would probably say. I'm going out

00:43:57.959 --> 00:44:11.489
on a limb. I knew the gentleman fairly well.
He would probably say, "The dream that I had

00:44:11.489 --> 00:44:23.029
in 1963 and the dream which I hope can be
realized in 2013 will never ever be fulfilled

00:44:23.029 --> 00:44:30.230
until we deal with the question of income
inequality, poverty, and wealth disparity.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:33.450
Never, will never be done. That's the challenge."

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:40.269
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Thank you. All right. We're
skipping down a question. This actually has

00:44:40.269 --> 00:44:47.720
to do with your previous answer about the
LGBT community. And it says, "Numerous parallels

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:54.049
exist between the 1960s Civil Rights Movement
and the present movement for LGBT rights slash

00:44:54.049 --> 00:44:59.970
marriage equality. What do you believe we
in the latter struggle can learn from the

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:04.730
former? How best can we build movements that
are inclusive of all?"

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:19.029
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: Well, the first thing
to do, however, is you want to avoid making

00:45:19.029 --> 00:45:28.040
a profound political mistake. They have to
see the qualitative difference between the

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:35.720
struggle that was undertaken by African Americans
against the institution of segregation and

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:43.269
racism in the United States and the struggle
that the LGBT--lesbian, gay, trans-gender--communities

00:45:43.269 --> 00:45:45.410
struggling.

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:49.859
There are significant differences, but the
fact that there are significant differences

00:45:49.859 --> 00:46:00.039
does not mean that those of us who support
the struggle for gay rights can't look and

00:46:00.039 --> 00:46:08.979
learn from some of the history of the struggle
for civil rights. They are very different,

00:46:08.979 --> 00:46:15.369
but being very different, they also have something
very much in common.

00:46:15.369 --> 00:46:24.019
And that is the elementary, it's so simple
and elementary and profound. And that is a

00:46:24.019 --> 00:46:35.380
person should not be deprived of a millionth
of an inch, a scintilla of his or her rights

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:44.579
in the society because of their gender preference.
That is totally unacceptable. And as I said

00:46:44.579 --> 00:46:55.249
to you earlier, I believe that it's very contrary
to the deepest religious principles.

00:46:55.249 --> 00:47:03.920
And what confounds me is I listen to so-called
leaders of the evangelical and Christian church

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:16.309
and they have a whole theorem, a whole mindset,
that rationalizes why gays should not be loved,

00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:27.559
why gays should be treated as second class
citizens. That is a corruption and a prostitution

00:47:27.559 --> 00:47:32.829
of the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ
that I understand.

00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:48.059
Total corruption. Those of us from the Civil
Rights Movement, and by the way, I was so

00:47:48.059 --> 00:47:58.059
singularly disappointed and actually blown
away when I learned that a number of African

00:47:58.059 --> 00:48:06.380
American ministers in churches opposed gay
rights in California. So, I'm saying to myself,

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:09.390
"Where have these brothers been?"

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:16.079
I mean, sometimes an otherwise sane person
can have moments of insanity. So, that's the

00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:22.199
only way I can explain it. How can some African
American minister in a church publicly go

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:28.699
out and say he is opposed to the rights of
gay people? It doesn't make sense.

00:48:28.699 --> 00:48:36.209
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: When you wrote your controversial
piece in the Huffington Post, "Time to Think

00:48:36.209 --> 00:48:42.239
the Unthinkable," you stated "progressers
might have to consider running a campaign

00:48:42.239 --> 00:48:47.009
against President Obama in 2012." What was
your reasoning behind this statement?

00:48:47.009 --> 00:48:51.420
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: My reasoning behind
the statement was that I had, at that time,

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:59.619
had seen President Obama make what --, a number
of cumulative compromises--a number of compromises

00:48:59.619 --> 00:49:06.269
that I thought were inconsistent with the
level of leadership that I believed he should

00:49:06.269 --> 00:49:08.180
exercise.

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:17.109
And so, I began to think that--. The other
side of leadership, with respect to the people

00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:22.969
you want to lead, there's an element called
accountability. You can't be a leader without

00:49:22.969 --> 00:49:29.880
being accountable for your actions. And I
don't remember the particular. I think it

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:34.109
may have been the compromise on the Bush tax
cuts or one other thing.

00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:42.049
But I found it to be, I found him to be, he
compromised in direct contradiction to what

00:49:42.049 --> 00:49:48.019
he had campaigned on one or two issues. And
I said, "OK. That's it. I love the brother."

00:49:48.019 --> 00:49:53.089
I said, "But there's something called political
accountability and the only way we can make

00:49:53.089 --> 00:49:58.940
him accountable is to think the unthinkable,
is to raise the question that if he, at that

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:04.630
time, is not going to live up to the promises
and the hopes that he engendered in so many

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:08.210
people, then we have to think of another candidate
who will do so."

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:16.340
In a subsequent article, I then said, based
upon whether you read my article or not, but

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:29.339
I then softened it up. And I said, I was very
pleased. January 16th, I was in Washington,

00:50:29.339 --> 00:50:34.400
DC and I was a recipient of what is Georgetown
University Legacy of Achievement Award, named

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.240
after John Thompson, at the Kennedy Center.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:42.780
And the entire Kennedy Center, it was standing
room only. And the President and the First

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:50.741
Lady came and before the official proceedings
of the Kennedy Center, President and First

00:50:50.741 --> 00:50:55.699
Lady came to see me in a private room at the
reception. And he came over to me and he said,

00:50:55.699 --> 00:51:03.219
"Mr. Jones, I want to thank you so much for
everything you've done for our country."

00:51:03.219 --> 00:51:08.369
And the First Lady said something about, I
can't exactly quote her, but some reference

00:51:08.369 --> 00:51:13.289
to the Huffington Post. So, I guess they read
it.

00:51:13.289 --> 00:51:14.499
[laughter]

00:51:14.499 --> 00:51:21.140
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: There has been tremendous
social and cultural changes since the climax

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:26.990
of the Civil Rights Movement. What themes
and challenges from then are still present

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.990
today?

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:32.880
More importantly, is the future you see today
the future you envisioned back then?

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:43.039
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: No. The future I see
today is by far greater than the future that

00:51:43.039 --> 00:51:52.150
we saw back then. I'll give you a classic
example. There were 250 thousand plus people

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:59.109
at the March at Washington. About 25 percent
of those people were white, assembled in front

00:51:59.109 --> 00:52:02.150
of the Lincoln Memorial.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:11.690
If in the planning of the march in the summer
of 1963, if we had a cell phone, if we had

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:17.890
a laptop, if we had a Blackberry, if we had
Twitter and Facebook and Google, you know

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:22.709
how many people we would've had at that march?
Not less than a million. Not less than a million.

00:52:22.709 --> 00:52:36.099
The thing that we didn't foresee, that I certainly
didn't foresee, I didn't see the confluence

00:52:36.099 --> 00:52:41.770
of the emerging communication technologies,
the power of being able to communicate and

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:51.430
message through multi-platforms that would
enable you to affect how people think about

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:57.199
things and thereby potentially being able
to mobilize them.

00:52:57.199 --> 00:53:03.269
We actually didn't see that. The other thing
we didn't see is we didn't see that over a

00:53:03.269 --> 00:53:12.930
period of time the great wealth disparity
that would occur. The other thing that we

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:21.059
didn't fully appreciate and see, we didn't
think that the United States Supreme Court

00:53:21.059 --> 00:53:29.369
would hold fast to the interpretation of the
Second Amendment that was debated in Constitution

00:53:29.369 --> 00:53:32.359
Hall in 1789.

00:53:32.359 --> 00:53:42.369
It was the right to bear arms as enshrined
in the Constitution, did not contemplate automatic

00:53:42.369 --> 00:53:49.499
weapons and uses and this great proliferation
of guns. So, we didn't see the proliferation

00:53:49.499 --> 00:54:01.219
of violence. And the other thing we didn't
see was we didn't see that the United States

00:54:01.219 --> 00:54:16.660
would, for a whole combination of reasons,
become awash in all sorts of addictive drugs.

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:21.640
And this has influenced--. First of all, it's
drained our natural resources. The War on

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:33.230
Drugs has been a total failure in terms of
significantly reducing or limiting drugs.

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:39.401
That is not to say there hasn't been some
improvement. But at what price? You have a

00:54:39.401 --> 00:54:42.999
neighboring country that's almost a failed
state.

00:54:42.999 --> 00:54:51.390
So, we didn't see that. And I would say the
principle thing we didn't see was that the

00:54:51.390 --> 00:55:00.369
absence of real opportunity for all people
of all races and genders to overcome what

00:55:00.369 --> 00:55:04.209
I call the poverty gap and the income disparity
gap.

00:55:04.209 --> 00:55:10.789
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Thank you. Dr. Jones, I am
humbled, honored, and inspired to have you

00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:15.400
here today. So, on behalf of Google and even
the people you can't see that VC'd in, thank

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.400
you so much for joining us today.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.619
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: Can I say one final
thing?

00:55:17.619 --> 00:55:19.509
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You sure can.

00:55:19.509 --> 00:55:25.900
&gt;&gt;Dr. Clarence Jones: OK. You know, last,
on Dr. King's birthday, on January 15th--it

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:33.939
was earlier this year--I was very pleased
when Stanford University had a banner opening

00:55:33.939 --> 00:55:44.269
across Palm Drive onto the campus that said,
"Stanford Remembers Martin Luther King, Jr."

00:55:44.269 --> 00:55:54.959
Now, I am hopeful that in the next King holiday
that when I open up my laptop and I see Google

00:55:54.959 --> 00:56:02.439
or Facebook, I hope I see something in Google
that says, "Google Remembers Martin Luther

00:56:02.439 --> 00:56:09.750
King Jr." Or, "Facebook." I wanna see every
major company in Silicon Valley to do what

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:17.839
Stanford University did in displaying this
banner across the campus that said, "Stanford

00:56:17.839 --> 00:56:19.339
Remembers Martin Luther King, Jr." Thank you.

00:56:19.339 --> 00:56:19.539
[applause]
