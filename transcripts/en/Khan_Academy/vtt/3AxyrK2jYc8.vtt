00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.890
- [Voiceover] So we have a trapezoid here

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.510
on the coordinate plane
and what we want to do is

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.652
find the area of this trapezoid,
just given this diagram.

00:00:08.652 --> 00:00:10.120
And, like always, pause this video and see

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.879
if you can figure it out.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.271
Well, we know how to figure
out the area of a trapezoid.

00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:16.924
We have videos where
we derive this formula.

00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:19.246
But, the area of a
trapezoid, just put simply,

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:23.777
is equal to the average of
the lengths of the bases,

00:00:23.777 --> 00:00:27.944
we could say base one plus
base two times the height.

00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:31.846
And, so what are our bases here?

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:35.106
What are, and what is going
to be our height over here?

00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:38.139
Well, we could call base one,

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:40.346
we could call that segment CL,

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:43.268
so it would be the length of
segment CL, right over here.

00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:45.169
I'll do that in magenta.

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:47.207
That is going to be base one.

00:00:47.207 --> 00:00:49.790
Base two, base two, that could,

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.117
we'll do that in a different color.

00:00:53.117 --> 00:00:56.700
Base two would be the
length of segment OW,

00:00:58.577 --> 00:00:59.748
or b two would be the length

00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:03.011
of segment OW, right over there.

00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:06.526
And then, our height, our height h,

00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:07.759
well, that would just be an altitude

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.739
and they did one in a dotted line, here.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:12.449
Notice it intersects the, base one,

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:15.918
I guess you could say segment
CL at a right angle, here.

00:01:15.918 --> 00:01:19.188
And so, this would be,
this would be the height.

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:21.416
So, if we know the
lengths of each of these,

00:01:21.416 --> 00:01:22.847
if we know each of these values,

00:01:22.847 --> 00:01:24.480
which are the lengths of these segments,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.349
then we can evaluate the area
of this actual trapezoid.

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:30.838
And, once again, if this is
completely unfamiliar to you

00:01:30.838 --> 00:01:32.418
or of you're curious,
we have multiple videos

00:01:32.418 --> 00:01:33.518
talking about the proofs

00:01:33.518 --> 00:01:35.788
or how we came up with this formula.

00:01:35.788 --> 00:01:37.878
You an even break out,
break down a trapezoid

00:01:37.878 --> 00:01:39.269
into two triangles and a rectangle,

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:40.965
which is one way to think about it.

00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:43.334
Anyway, let's see how we
could figure this out.

00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:45.694
So, the first one is,
what is b one going to be?

00:01:45.694 --> 00:01:48.444
B one is the length of segment CL

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:53.906
and you could say, "We'll
look, we know what these,

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:55.876
"the coordinates of these points are."

00:01:55.876 --> 00:01:57.922
You could say, "Let's use
the distance formula,"

00:01:57.922 --> 00:01:59.307
and you could say, "Well,
the distance formula is just

00:01:59.307 --> 00:02:01.618
"an application of the
Pythagorean Theorem."

00:02:01.618 --> 00:02:02.907
So, this is going to be

00:02:02.907 --> 00:02:06.477
the square root of our
change in x squared,

00:02:06.477 --> 00:02:09.258
so our change in x is going
to be this, right over here.

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:11.056
And, notice, we're going
from x equals negative four

00:02:11.056 --> 00:02:13.928
to x equals eight, as w go from C to L.

00:02:13.928 --> 00:02:18.095
So, our change in x is equal
to eight minus negative four

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.700
which is equal to 12.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.299
And, our change in in y, our change in y,

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.290
we are going from y equals
negative one to y equals five.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.478
So, we could say our change in y

00:02:32.478 --> 00:02:35.828
equal to five minus negative one

00:02:35.828 --> 00:02:37.189
which, of course, is equal to six.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.450
And, you see that: one,
two, three, four, five, six.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.299
And, the segment that we care about,

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.268
its length that we care about,
that's just the hypotenuse

00:02:46.268 --> 00:02:48.909
of this right triangle
that has one side 12

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.687
and one side six.

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:52.209
So, the length of that hypotenuse,

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.942
from the Pythagorean Theorem,

00:02:53.942 --> 00:02:55.770
and, as I mentioned,
the distance formula is

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.091
just an application of
the Pythagorean Theorem,

00:02:58.091 --> 00:02:59.724
this is going to be

00:02:59.724 --> 00:03:02.664
our change in x, squared, 12 squared,

00:03:02.664 --> 00:03:06.074
plus our change in y,
squared, so plus six squared,

00:03:06.074 --> 00:03:09.221
and this is going to be
equal to 144 plus 36.

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:12.054
So, the square root of 144 plus 36

00:03:13.983 --> 00:03:16.816
is one hundred, one hundred and 80

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.964
which is equal to, let's
see, 180 is 36 times five.

00:03:22.964 --> 00:03:27.131
So, that is six square roots,
six square roots of five.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.332
Oh, let me not skip some steps.

00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:33.901
So, this is the square
root of 36 times five

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:36.577
which is equal to, square root of 36 is 6,

00:03:36.577 --> 00:03:38.910
so six square roots of five.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.950
Now, let's figure out b two.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.759
So, b two, once again, change in x squared

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.828
plus the square root
of change in x squared

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:50.418
plus change in y squared.

00:03:50.418 --> 00:03:53.068
Well, let's see, if we're going from,

00:03:53.068 --> 00:03:55.298
we could set up a right
triangle, if you like,

00:03:55.298 --> 00:03:58.279
like this, to figure those things out.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:02.446
So, our change in x, we're
going from x is at negative two,

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.000
x is going from negative
two to positive four.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.036
So, our change in x is six.

00:04:09.036 --> 00:04:11.953
Our change in y, we are going from,

00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:18.125
we are going from y equals, y
equals five to y equals eight.

00:04:20.048 --> 00:04:23.139
So, our change in y is equal to three.

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.217
So, just applying the Pythagorean Theorem

00:04:25.217 --> 00:04:27.055
to find the length of
the hypotenuse, here,

00:04:27.055 --> 00:04:28.209
is going to be the square root

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:31.109
of change in x squared, six squared,

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:34.176
plus change in y squared,
plus three squared

00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:36.213
which is going to be equal to,

00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:39.463
it's going to be equal to 36 plus nine,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.613
which is 45, so, square root of 45

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.948
which is equal to the square
root of nine times five

00:04:50.948 --> 00:04:55.501
which is equal to three
square roots of five.

00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:56.990
And so, we only have
one left to figure out.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.717
We have to figure out h.

00:04:58.717 --> 00:05:01.889
We have to figure out the length of h.

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.128
So, h is going to be equal to,

00:05:05.128 --> 00:05:07.860
and so, what is our, if
we're going from W to N,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.810
our change in x is two.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.520
Change in x is equal to two.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.790
We're going from X equals
four to x equals six.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.141
If you want to do that purely numerically,

00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:17.940
we would say, "Okay, our
endpoint, our x value is six.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.351
"Our starting point, our x-value is four.

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:21.400
"Six minus four is two."

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.790
You see that visually, here.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.601
So, it's going to be the square root

00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:26.968
of two squared plus our,

00:05:26.968 --> 00:05:29.771
let me write that radical
a little bit better.

00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.090
So, it's the square root
of our change in x squared

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.318
plus our change in y squared.

00:05:35.318 --> 00:05:38.002
Our change in y is negative four.

00:05:38.002 --> 00:05:40.031
Change in y is negative four

00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:41.410
but we're going to square it,

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.428
so it's going to become a positive 16.

00:05:43.428 --> 00:05:44.750
So, this is going to be equal

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.602
to the square root of four plus 16.

00:05:46.602 --> 00:05:48.102
Square root of 20,

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.490
which is equal to the square
root of four times five,

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.992
which is equal to two times
the square root of five.

00:05:55.992 --> 00:05:58.221
It's nice that the square
root of five keeps popping up.

00:05:58.221 --> 00:05:59.240
And so, now we just substitute

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.042
into our original expression.

00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:04.731
And so, our Area of our
trapezoid is going to be

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:08.719
one half times six square roots of five,

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:10.800
six square roots of five,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.319
plus three square roots of five,

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.530
plus three square roots of five,

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.501
let me close that parentheses,

00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:20.819
times two square roots of five,

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.021
times two square roots of five.

00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:26.401
And, let's see how we can simplify this.

00:06:26.401 --> 00:06:27.411
So, six square roots of five

00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:28.450
plus three square roots of five,

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.021
that is nine square roots of five.

00:06:32.021 --> 00:06:33.840
Let's see, the one half times the two,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.811
those cancel out to just be one.

00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:36.644
And so, we're left with

00:06:36.644 --> 00:06:39.387
nine square roots of five
times the square root of five.

00:06:39.387 --> 00:06:40.838
Well, the square root of five
times the square root of five

00:06:40.838 --> 00:06:43.198
is just going to be five.

00:06:43.198 --> 00:06:45.996
So, this is equal to nine times five

00:06:45.996 --> 00:06:50.163
which is equal to 45 square
units or units squared.
