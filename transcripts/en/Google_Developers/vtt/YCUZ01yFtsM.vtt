AUDIENCE: I'm Peter Norvig.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.520
This is Julia Wilkowski.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.820
We're going to talk
to you about how

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.810
to make sense of data
coming from online classes.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.470
I think there's a
great opportunity now

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.680
we all know of so much more
information being available,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.300
so many opportunities
to take online classes.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.190
But if you're
running one or you're

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.200
trying to understand
one, how can

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.040
you tell what's working
what's not working?

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.240
The first thing you
need is to understand

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.770
the data is to be able
to take a look at it.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.270
Last week we had a
great talk at Google

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.150
from Mikey D., one of our
site reliability engineers

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.130
who went to work on
the healthcare.gov site

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.390
and was part of the team
that helped rescue that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.550
from not working to working.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.960
And he reported that the very
first thing he did was say,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.190
we need to have a dashboard.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.720
We need to have big screen
TVs in every room that

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.540
says exactly what's
up and what's not.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.270
It's not very
sophisticated, right?

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.230
So I could stand
here and lecture you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.230
about complex statistics and
machine learning algorithms

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.820
for understanding data.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.790
And yes, there's
a place for that.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.400
But the main part is
just to have the data

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.400
and start looking at it.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.810
And the great American
philosopher Yogi Berra

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.180
summed that up.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.090
"You can observe a
lot just by watching."

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.550
So what can we look at?

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.840
Well, here's the
past and the future.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.650
So on the left is
the report that you

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.420
get from standard education,
a college transcript.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.920
This has a bandwidth rate of
about 10 bits per semester.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.390
On the right is a mobile device.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.740
This has a bandwidth rate
of 192,000 bits per second.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.380
So that would be more.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.380
You also notice if you've
ever had to pay for college

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.050
that the one on the right
is actually cheaper as well.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.790
So how can we take
advantage of all the data

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.140
that is now available compared
to the paucity of data

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.940
in the past to improve
education continuously?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.590
That's the challenge.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.030
Google's always been a
data driven organization.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.020
So we're comfortable doing that.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.330
I see some of our friends
from Coursera are here.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.390
And they were kind enough to
lend us this dashboard, which

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.530
is the simplest
plot you can make,

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.090
which is just the
number of users

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.430
that are on the site over time.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.990
And from this, you can see
three components superimposed.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.490
One is that there's a startup.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.149
So not everybody
gets going on time.

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:46.690
It takes a couple
days into the class

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.650
before people start
to get into it.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.480
Secondly, there is
an exponential decay.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.390
Now, Coursera got
to choose which

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.880
class timeline they
wanted to publish.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.990
So this decay is much
less steep than for most

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.710
of the classes, which
usually drop off

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.530
a lot more of their
students over time.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.890
And the third is these
spikes, this stegosaurus

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.860
looking pattern.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.270
Anybody know what
those spikes are for?

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.490
Due dates, exactly.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.990
Right.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.300
So some people thought that
they were weekends or something

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.830
like that.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.970
If you look at web
logs, yeah, there's

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.960
always a weekend pattern.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.960
But these are due dates.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.725
So we've proven that due
dates are, in fact, important.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.760
Here's another dashboard.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.890
This was from one of
the classes I taught.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.230
And this is just each
of the assignments

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.897
and the percentage of
people who got it right.

00:03:37.897 --> 00:03:40.230
And you go through and mostly
they're doing pretty good.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.710
There's the 80s, 90s percent,
some even on the high 90s.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.189
And then there were two problems
where they're doing really bad.

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:48.980
And that doesn't mean
the students are bad.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.460
That means that we screwed up.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.660
And you have to take a
look at the problems.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.370
And it turns out
one of them, I had

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.640
said something kind of ambiguous
in the wording and that tripped

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.580
people up.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.390
And the other one,
the TA had written

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.030
the wrong regular expression
to grade the examples.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.550
And that screwed up.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.830
But we had this and were
able to fix it quickly,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.620
because we're monitoring
it all the time.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.121
And here's another dashboard.

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:16.620
This is the dashboard
that a student

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.050
would get from Google
classroom, which

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.579
is one of the products we offer.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.680
But there would also
be a similar dashboard

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.020
for the teacher and for the
administrators and so on.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.940
So you just want to be up to
date and know what's going on.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.250
Now let's get into
a little touch

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.500
of the more sophisticated
machine learning after we've

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.160
driven in this point that
you've got to just pay attention

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.710
to the data.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.150
So what this is, is
a graph of states

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.220
that students went in,
in submitting programs

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.390
for a programming assignment.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.930
And it starts off in the lower
left hand corner in state S,

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.150
which is submitting
an empty assignment.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.690
And then you build
up from there.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.740
And the students followed
these various paths.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.090
And each of the circles was
made by clustering together

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.960
similar programs by having
an algorithm that figures out

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.310
the similarities between
two different programs.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.830
And the size of the circle
is how many of those programs

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.950
there are.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.300
And the G1 and the
G2 are two goals.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.630
So there are sort of
two possible solutions

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.565
to this assignment.

00:05:24.565 --> 00:05:25.695
It was a simple assignment.

00:05:25.695 --> 00:05:28.600
So there's really
basically two solutions.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.980
And students converged
along various paths

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.400
to get to one of those two.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.020
And most of the student's
made it to one of those goals.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.970
But you also see a
couple states that

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.050
were with no paths going
out of them like the state

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.850
16 over on the left.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.560
So a small number of students
got stuck in that state.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.220
And so this is was an
automatic clustering algorithm

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.130
that gave us this kind of graph.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.240
And now you can use you're
not automated analysis

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.770
to go in there and say, hey
what's happening in state 16?

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.140
Why are students messing up?

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.080
Why are they
getting stuck there?

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.660
Why do some students take
this path from eight to 11

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.884
to goal two and some other
students take this other path?

00:06:08.884 --> 00:06:10.300
It gives you
something to start on

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.700
to understand what's
actually going on.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.210
And this is just
one more example,

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.400
a little bit more artistic
looking, from this same work.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.565
This is work by some students
at Stanford University.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.140
OK.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.370
Let's have one more example.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.680
So let's say where we have
another programming assignment

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.520
and we described the mathematics
of what you're trying to do.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.440
And you write a mathematical
equation like that.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.020
And when you write that, if
you have beginning programmers,

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.720
they often try to
translate it literally.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.050
So if you're writing Python
and you took that math

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.390
and transliterated
it, that's not

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.930
going to be a valid
Python program.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.096
Anybody know what they error
message is going to be?

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.260
So it's going to be type error
float object is not callable.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.570
So not a very useful error
message for a beginner.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.500
The reason that happens is
because x was a float number.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.130
And what's going on
there is that this

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.520
is syntactically correct.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.440
And it looks like
a function call

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.780
where the thing on the
right is the argument.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.152
And the thing on
the left is computed

00:07:21.152 --> 00:07:23.360
that should be something
that computes to a function.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.390
But it computes to
a number instead.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.110
so this is a terrible
error message

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.130
unless you're an
expert in the language.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.810
But compare that to
what you sometimes

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.560
get when you go to Google
and you type in something

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.100
and you make a spelling error.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.860
You get something
like, did you mean?

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.554
And then we give you a
pretty good suggestion.

00:07:43.554 --> 00:07:44.970
And we do that not
because we have

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.440
a formal grammar of
English, but because we

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.530
have lots and lots
of examples of people

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.930
who came before who
typed one thing,

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.640
didn't like what they got,
and then typed something else.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.040
Compilers don't have that
corpus of past history.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.340
They just know what the
grammar of the language is.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.780
And they know whatever tricks
the compiler writer put in.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.590
But we can now instrument
compilers to say,

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:08.980
let's take this.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.230
Take all these bad
programs that students

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.400
wrote, the mistakes that an
expert would never think of,

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.280
and have that as part of
what the compiler knows.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.310
And we could do it for
first-year students.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.200
We could do it for more
experienced students.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.850
We could do it from students
coming from one language

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.610
to another language.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.250
And we could even do it for a
particular problem for this one

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.130
assignment.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.850
We could say, take all the
last submissions that student's

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.470
made, and the errors
that they made,

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:41.240
and build a compiler that
is specialized for that.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.630
We have that capability if
we can collect the data.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.370
Item response theory
is an approach

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.680
to understanding
the relationship

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.360
between the
difficulty of problems

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.560
and the capabilities
of students.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.780
And here we have
students clustered

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.930
into bins and the histogram.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.040
So the better students
are on the right.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.060
The worst students
are on the left.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.150
And here's two problems.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.610
The blue problem was
a pretty easy one.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.780
So the best students got 100%.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.130
the worst students
are around 50%.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.850
The red problem is a hard one.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.720
So the best students
are only 60% or so.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.230
And the worst
students are at 20%.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.010
But these are typical
curves for problems.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.117
But now we get a curve
that looks like this.

00:09:28.117 --> 00:09:30.200
And this is an indication
that something is wrong.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.560
So what's happening here?

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.330
So the best students
are doing better

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.590
than the mediocre students.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.550
And they're getting 30% or 40%.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.940
But the bad students are doing
better than the best students.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.030
That's an indication
that something is wrong.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.240
We took this problem,
went in and looked at it.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.800
And we found that there
was, A, an ambiguity

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.520
in the wording of the problem.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.120
And B, if you made
a math mistake,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.680
those two mistakes
would cancel out.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.920
And you would get it right.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.290
So the bad students were
getting it right more

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.710
than the good students.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:06.147
And you're only able to discover
that by making this plot

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:07.480
and doing this kind of analysis.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.390
So that gives you
some hint of the types

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.870
of things you can do with data.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.580
Now Julia is going to tell you
more specifically about what

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.531
we've done with the classes
that we've presented at Google.

00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:23.780
JULIA WILKOWSKI: Thanks Peter.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.250
So as Peter mentioned, my
name is Julia Wilkowski.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.040
And I'm one of the instructional
designers at Google.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.900
I've been involved
in six of the MOOCs

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.812
that we've launched
to the general public.

00:10:32.812 --> 00:10:35.020
And I'm going to give you
a little bit of an overview

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.770
about the work that
we've done, what

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.875
we've learned from our courses,
and some design applications

00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:41.250
for other people
who are thinking

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.520
about creating online
courses and helping

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.334
the ecosystem evolve.

00:10:45.334 --> 00:10:47.500
So I'm going to start out
by asking, how many of you

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.610
know what a MOOC is?

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.420
Raise your hand.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:50.920
Great.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.920
I'm seeing about 90% of the
audience raising their hand.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.790
But just for the
other 10%, I'm going

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.985
to define the acronym MOOC.

00:10:57.985 --> 00:11:01.980
It stands for a massive
open online course.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.230
By massive, we
mean these classes

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.965
have had upwards of 150,000
registrants at a time.

00:11:08.965 --> 00:11:13.300
By open, we mean that they're
available most likely for free

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.060
to anyone with an
internet connection.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.092
They're online meaning
that anyone, again,

00:11:18.092 --> 00:11:20.300
with an internet connection
or access to the internet

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.130
can access them.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.290
And by course, we imply
some kind of a structure,

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.515
a start date, an end date,
some kind of an instructor

00:11:28.515 --> 00:11:30.960
or professor who's
involved in the course,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.090
either as a figure in videos
or are able to answer questions

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.580
throughout, and a sense of
community where people together

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.814
are going through the course
within a similar time frame.

00:11:40.814 --> 00:11:42.480
Now I should mention
that Peter actually

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.740
hates all of the
words in this acronym.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.750
And I also don't
believe that MOOCs

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.590
are the future of
education or they're

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.720
going to put universities
out of business.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.100
And Google's role is
we're trying to figure out

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.940
what really works well
in online education

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.310
so that we can help move
the ecosystem forward.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.830
So about two years
ago, there started

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.140
to be more and more of these
online classes from our friends

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.120
at Coursera, Udacity, and edX.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.470
And some of us started
to wonder, well,

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.660
these courses seem
like they're using

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.050
a lot of the similar
tools that Google

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.830
has made available for
free to the public.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.950
So we wondered if we
could replicate what

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.820
a lot of these other platforms
were doing with Google tools.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.390
Thus, we created Power
Searching with Google,

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.090
which was a search
course to teach

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.910
the members of
the general public

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.000
how to use Google search tools
more efficiently and more

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.430
effectively.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.900
We had about 150,000 students
register for this course.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.105
About 40,000 of
them completed it.

00:12:43.105 --> 00:12:46.320
And along the way,
we learned a lot.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.580
So here's a brief timeline.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.140
We launched this
course in July of 2012.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.820
Several months later, we
re released the same course

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.390
after we fixed a number of bugs.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:00.460
At the same time, we released
the Course Builder Open Source

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.160
code, which powered the
Power Searching Course.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.770
Since that release
almost two years ago,

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.730
94 partners have released
their own courses

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.401
using this code that we know of.

00:13:11.401 --> 00:13:13.400
There may have been other
downloads and releases

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.595
that we weren't aware of.

00:13:14.595 --> 00:13:17.580
And people are using this
code in many different ways

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.880
to launch their own
MOOCs as well as

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.330
to implement a flipped classroom
approach where people are using

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.990
the infrastructure that
we provide with videos

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.259
to assigned videos
before the class

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:29.800
and have their
students come together

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.854
in class to have
better discussions

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:34.020
and solve problems together.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.150
We then tried another
class called Advanced Power

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.420
Searching.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.230
We launched a course
for web developers

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.250
on implementing Web
Accessibility Best Practices.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.470
We launched Mapping With
Google to teach people

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.240
how to use Google
Maps and Google

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.410
Earth more efficiently and more
effectively about one year ago.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.220
And most recently,
we launched Making

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.930
Sense of Online Data
just a few months ago.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.644
So in all of these courses,
I've been involved in some way,

00:14:03.644 --> 00:14:06.060
whether it's scripting videos,
writing activities, writing

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.990
test questions, figuring out how
the community can help support

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.690
each other, and analyzing
a lot of the data that's

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.300
coming back from these courses.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.800
So again, to figure
out what works

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.720
and what's not working in
these online experiences.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.840
So two of our areas
of research have

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.120
centered around scaling
evaluation mechanisms.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.670
And the other one is
about how students,

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.450
why students register
for a MOOC and what

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.430
we can learn from that.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.800
So the Power Searching course,
again our first course,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.300
was a very traditional
online course,

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.250
even though we had
a massive scale

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.450
where you watched a video, you
did some activity questions.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.010
You watched another video.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.400
You answered some
more questions.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.460
And at the end, you're presented
with a multiple choice test

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.810
to evaluate how well
we felt that you

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.370
had achieved those skills.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.160
But advanced Power Searching
was slightly different.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.870
We wanted to teach people
how to solve complex research

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.630
challenges using Google tools.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.700
And by complex, we
mean that the problems

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.510
had maybe more than one right
answer, more than one right way

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.790
to get the answer,
or multiple steps

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.420
that you had to achieve
to get the answer.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.110
So we presented
students with a number

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.850
of challenges,
which I'll show you

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.500
an example in the next slide,
with supplementary videos

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.880
and case studies that you
could use if you were really

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.550
stuck solving that problem.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.350
For evaluation,
we asked students

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.110
to submit case studies of
how they had solved a search

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.650
problem related to
their own lives.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.000
Actually we had them submit
two of these followed

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.060
by a final challenge, which
we graded by a machine

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.310
grading or regular expressions.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.490
So here's an example.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.990
I know the text is hard to read.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.880
But let's say you were hiking
and you saw this feather

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.897
on the ground.

00:15:47.897 --> 00:15:49.480
And you didn't have
a camera with you.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.780
So you whipped out
your sketch pad.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.196
And you drew a picture of it
so that you could identify it

00:15:53.196 --> 00:15:55.930
once you were back
in internet range.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.980
So this is one of the
challenges we presented.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.447
What is this bird?

00:15:59.447 --> 00:16:01.780
And if you're really bored
during the rest of this talk,

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.950
you can try to figure
this one out as we speak.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.460
So our question was, how
could we effectively evaluate

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.727
learners qualitative
work at scale?

00:16:11.727 --> 00:16:13.560
We'd already shown that
we could effectively

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.580
evaluate multiple choice
questions and short answer

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.540
questions.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.237
But we really wanted to
evaluate these case studies.

00:16:20.237 --> 00:16:21.820
Because life is more
like a case study

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.153
than a multiple choice question.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.220
So we decided to
evaluate or practice

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.650
using self-evaluation methods.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.350
And we decided to go
this route instead

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.940
of the more traditional,
and traditional in quotes.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.370
Because the MOOC space is
not anything but traditional.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:44.000
But we decided to use
self-evaluation metrics instead

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.700
of peer evaluation for
a couple of reasons.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.230
Some of the research
that we've read

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.980
has indicated that people learn
more when they're evaluating

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.590
their own work than evaluating
someone else's work.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.450
You're also a little bit more
motivated to evaluate your own

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.662
work than someone else's.

00:17:00.662 --> 00:17:02.120
And again, some of
the research has

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.020
indicated that you have
better metacognition, which

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.790
is, you're thinking
about these skills

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.339
and you're evaluating
your own work

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.450
even after you leave the class.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.482
So for example,
we asked students

00:17:14.482 --> 00:17:16.940
to present a case study of how
they solved a complex search

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:17.910
problem.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.169
One of the questions we
asked them to evaluate

00:17:20.169 --> 00:17:23.079
was how well they had
evaluated the credibility

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:25.060
of those websites.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.050
So this is because we
want them, when they're

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.520
doing a complex search
challenge after the class,

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.730
to think about the
credibility of the websites

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.620
that they're looking at.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.460
So here is our process.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.570
We had students submit
their case studies.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.950
We gave them a couple of
practice calibration exercises

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:46.130
where we had graded them.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.260
The course staff
had graded them.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.150
They got some feedback
about how well they

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.630
were grading these
practice exercises.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.040
Then they evaluated
their own work.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.206
And at the end of course,
we scored a random sample

00:17:58.206 --> 00:17:58.830
of assignments.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.190
And we wanted to see how well
the student scores aligned

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.690
with our course staff scores.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.460
And here's what we found.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.840
Now ideally, all of
the students' scores

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.450
would line up 100%
with the TA scores.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.780
And you'd see every single
dot on that diagonal line.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.470
We didn't quite see that.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.020
But we did see over
half of the assignments

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.700
were within one
point of each other.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.310
Again, TA's versus
student scores.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:28.050
And surprisingly, 73%, or
nearly 3/4 of the assignments,

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.820
received at least
a B by the TA's.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.840
So this seemed like it
was a promising start.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.880
But we knew we had
a long way to go.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.100
Now, you may be
wondering, well, what's

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.480
to prevent someone from giving
themselves 100% even when they

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.460
submitted nothing or poor
work or someone else's work.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.050
And we did see a
little bit of this.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.590
In fact 70% of the assignments
gave themselves full credit.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.190
Not all of them merited
that full credit score.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.810
And of those, 10% were blank.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.050
And another 9% were
duplicate assignments.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.730
So again, this was promising.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.890
But we had some work to do.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.840
So how could we
improve how students

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.310
evaluated their own work?

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.800
In our next course,
Mapping With Google,

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.690
we had students complete
a final project,

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.980
which was to create their own
map using Maps Engine Light ,

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.620
to tell the story of
some geographical data.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.110
Here's an example
that compares apple

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.240
an orange production
in the Americas.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.620
Students were asked to come
up with their own data set.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.580
Or we gave them some
provided data sets

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.180
They had to style the points
in some way that told a story.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.010
So again, we had a
very similar process

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.890
where students
submitted their work.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.260
They calibrated their work.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.900
They evaluated their own
work after the course closed.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.220
We evaluated a random
sample of those assignments.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.040
And we saw much better
alignment in this class

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.390
than the Advanced
Power Searching class.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.770
Again nearly 3/4 where
within two points.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:09.310
And almost 100% received
at least a B by the TA's.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.290
So what changed
between the first class

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.210
and the second class?

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.940
Well, a couple of things.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.290
One, in the search
class, we felt

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.710
that our criteria
that people were

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:25.660
using to evaluate themselves
were much more subjective

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.000
than objective.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.610
So for example, how
well did you evaluate

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:33.860
the credibility of a website is
much more difficult to evaluate

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.230
consistently than how many
points are on your map, one

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.640
through five for example.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.120
So having that clear
rubric or checklist,

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.360
our criteria was, I think,
one of the key factors

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.850
that improved our results.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.510
Another key factor was this
last one on our screen.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:56.310
We ask students how worthwhile
was doing this project.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.530
And in the search class,
just under half of them

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.640
said, yes, this is was a
really worthwhile project.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.390
In the mapping,
nearly 3/4 of them

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.080
said, yes, this was a
really worthwhile project.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.870
Now the survey scores might
have some self-selection bias.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.580
But I think there's
something here.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.710
But if students find more value
in the work that they've done,

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.510
they're going to be much
more likely to grade it

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:21.760
on a more accurate level.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.230
So what does this
mean for people

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.300
who are creating online courses
and online course platforms?

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.140
We feel that self-evaluation
is an effective evaluation

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.901
mechanism for some low
stakes environment.

00:21:34.901 --> 00:21:37.150
Now of course, you're not
going to get a job at Google

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.520
if you pass our class.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.280
Although some students
did think that.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.385
And I mentioned this in
a research presentation

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:44.980
that I gave on this.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.560
And I made the offhand
comment that well, I'm

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.430
not sure I would
want my surgeon going

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.355
through a
self-evaluation process.

00:21:51.355 --> 00:21:52.730
And one of the
people in the room

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.000
said that he actually
had worked with surgeons

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.550
and was practicing
self-evaluation with them.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.350
So, I don't know,
maybe it does have

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.609
merit in high stakes
environments as well.

00:22:02.609 --> 00:22:04.900
We found that it's really
important to test our rubrics

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.325
or grading checklists
in advance.

00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:08.950
Because I think we
would have uncovered

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.480
some of those subjective
versus objective measures.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.460
Also we think that it's really
important to teach students

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.560
how to evaluate their own work.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.110
And although we did
it a little bit,

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.930
I think there's a lot
of room for improvement

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.100
if we really want
to give the students

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.940
those metacognitive skills.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.720
So another area of
our research has

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.980
focused on how well students
achieve the goals that they

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.620
set out to achieve when
they register for a MOOC.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.600
So first question, many of
you knew what a MOOC was.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.290
How many of you
have registered for

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.651
a massive open online course?

00:22:43.651 --> 00:22:44.150
All right.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:46.890
I'm seeing about
80% of the hands.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.340
And how many of you
completed that course?

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:50.840
All right.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.670
I'm seeing maybe
20%, which actually

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.112
is what we've been
seeing as well.

00:22:55.112 --> 00:22:56.820
And if you've read
any press about MOOCs,

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.010
you'll see people
saying, MOOCs only

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.260
have a 10% completion
rate that's really dismal.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.610
So we wanted to unpack
what this really meant.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.340
So in the Mapping
With Google course,

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.580
we had 40,000 registrants and
about 20,000 active students

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.612
from all around the world.

00:23:13.612 --> 00:23:15.320
And one of our first
questions was, well,

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.525
why do people
register for MOOCs?

00:23:17.525 --> 00:23:20.270
There are lots of
different reasons.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.424
So our research has differed
from other people's research

00:23:23.424 --> 00:23:25.090
in that we're combining
students intent.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.110
We're actually asking them
why are they coming to a MOOC.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.530
And we're doing the
analysis to measure

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:35.527
how well they are
meeting those goals.

00:23:35.527 --> 00:23:37.860
So at the beginning of the
course, when they registered,

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.310
we asked them up front.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.050
Why are you here?

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.760
And was it to earn a
certificate in maps?

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.810
Was it to earn a
certificate in Earth?

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.500
Was it to earn a combined
certificate in both?

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.120
Was it to learn about one or
two new aspects of Google Maps?

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.790
Was it to learn about one or
two new aspects of Google Earth?

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.290
Or were they just
dropping in to see

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.370
what this online
course was all about?

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.650
So not unlike the
folks in this room,

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.200
we found that just
over half of the people

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.820
actually intended to
complete the course.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.790
And almost half had no
intention, whatsoever,

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.459
of completing the course.

00:24:12.459 --> 00:24:14.750
Now if you stop and think
about this from an educator's

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.180
perspective, it's
kind of shocking.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.860
As an educator, we
feel like everyone

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.180
wants to come and learn
everything that we know

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.260
and that we're
going to offer them.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.551
And they have to go through
everything in a linear way,

00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:26.570
right?

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:27.070
Wrong.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:30.610
This data clearly shows
that half of people

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.200
had no intention of
reaching the endpoint.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.290
Or that they were redefining
what their endpoint should be,

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.150
which I think has huge
implications in how

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:43.010
we design our online courses.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.867
So we did this experiment in
the Web Accessibility Class.

00:24:46.867 --> 00:24:48.200
We found something very similar.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.960
Just over half of
people intended

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.950
to complete the course.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.700
So our next question
was, OK, well,

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.740
people have lots
of varied goals.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:00.470
How well are they
achieving those goals?

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.580
So here was our process.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.650
Again, students, when they
registered, selected the goal.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:08.070
They interacted with the course
for a 2 and 1/2-week period.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.290
When the course closed, we
extracted the course data

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.140
as JSON files.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.210
And then we ran some R scripts
to analyze their behavior.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.020
And here's what we found.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.350
If their goal was to learn
new things or a specific maps

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:23.990
feature, we found that
nearly 2/3 of them

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.770
actually achieved that goal.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.880
And the way that we
inferred it was we

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.780
said, OK, if they want to
learn a specific maps feature,

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.080
we then took the maps
lessons in the course

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.970
and we saw, did they
watch at least 90%

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:36.370
of one of the maps videos?

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.830
Did they complete one
of the maps activities?

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.050
Or did they read the
maps text lesson?

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.160
And if any of those
criteria were met,

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.390
then we counted them
as achieving that goal.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.840
Even among folks who wanted
to earn a certificate, which

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.680
was a much more
rigorous process,

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:56.640
we had between 13% 25% of people
achieving those goals, which

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.560
are much more
representative of true life

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.920
then if you hear the
statistic only 10% of people

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.730
really complete MOOCs.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.360
So we found similar
things in the Intro

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.752
to Web Accessibility course.

00:26:11.752 --> 00:26:13.710
As a whole in the
mapping course,

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.350
we had 42% of people meeting
their goals, Web Accessibility

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.980
about half.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.220
And again, what does
this mean for members

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.910
of people who are designing
courses or creating

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.580
courses or working
on MOOC platforms?

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.520
We feel that it's important to
make content available upfront

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.390
instead of the
traditional metered way

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:36.070
where the professor
says, OK, week one,

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.670
this is what you're
going to learn.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.980
And if you want to
go ahead, you can't.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.396
Because I'm not
releasing the next

00:26:40.396 --> 00:26:41.960
set of content until week two.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.070
And if you want to
go ahead, you can't.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.830
Because we're going
to give you the next

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.510
set of content the week after.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.050
So what if we could offer
all of the course content

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.656
at the beginning and
enable and encourage people

00:26:52.656 --> 00:26:54.030
to search for the
pieces that are

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.140
relevant and
interesting to them?

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:00.280
What if, when we send out
course emails to students,

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.570
we could link to
specific lessons that

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.780
are based on their interests
and their backgrounds?

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.600
So for example,
you said you wanted

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.180
to learn how to navigate from
point A to point B om Maps.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.105
Let's give you a targeted link
in that email that says, hey,

00:27:14.105 --> 00:27:14.730
you registered.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.430
You'd said you
wanted to do this.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.490
Here's how you get there.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.760
We're experimenting
with two other elements

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.300
of the design, which
is allowing students

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.490
to create their
own playlists given

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:28.677
a list of all of
the course content.

00:27:28.677 --> 00:27:31.010
So what if we gave them a
list of all of the videos, all

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.930
the activities,
all of the lessons,

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.070
and all of the final
projects, and allowed students

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:40.030
to pick and choose to create
their own customized course.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.880
Or if we did enough
analysis, we could

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.290
offer predicted
learning paths that

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:48.130
says, OK, the students with this
background and this goal tended

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.360
to go through the
class in this way.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.390
Then we could offer the
next set of students

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.220
those learning paths.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.230
So we're going to
keep experimenting

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:57.970
with many of these elements.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.502
And we're helping the course
builder platform evolve.

00:28:00.502 --> 00:28:02.710
And we're hoping that all
of the other MOOC platforms

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:03.620
will evolve.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.400
So that in five
years, MOOCs look

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.390
completely different
than they do today.

00:28:14.919 --> 00:28:17.460
PETER NORVIG: So I hope we've
been able to tell you something

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.280
about how we look at courses,
how we look at the data

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.020
we collect, and where
we think it's all going.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.594
And we've got some
time so we can

00:28:25.594 --> 00:28:26.760
throw it open for questions.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.040
JULIA WILKOWSKI: And
if you have a question,

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.260
please come to one
of the microphones.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.740
There's one in each
of these aisles

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.990
so that everyone can hear you.

00:28:39.124 --> 00:28:40.540
AUDIENCE: How much
analysis do you

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.226
do of the online forum
posts of students?

00:28:44.226 --> 00:28:46.510
And have you gained
any insight from those?

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.218
JULIA WILKOWSKI: That's
a great question.

00:28:48.218 --> 00:28:50.640
And so the question was
about our online forum posts.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.760
And the forum is a
critical way for students

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.200
to ask questions and
get questions answered

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.500
either by course staff
or by other students.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.610
And we actually haven't done a
lot of sophisticated analysis

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:02.490
on the forum posts.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.905
One, because it's difficult.

00:29:03.905 --> 00:29:06.030
And two, because we have
to delete all of the forum

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.080
posts 60 days after
the course closed

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.280
to comply with our
privacy regulations.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.100
So unfortunately we haven't
done a lot of that analysis yet.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.370
Although Google is funding some
other researchers in cognitive

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.250
linguistics to do
some of that research.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.487
So maybe we can report
on that next time.

00:29:22.487 --> 00:29:24.070
PETER NORVIG: And I
think it certainly

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.870
is important to
monitor the forums

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.050
and get a feeling
for what's going on.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:30.870
You can learn something
just by looking at them

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.700
without doing the
sophisticated analysis.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.270
It also is possible to do at
least a sentiment analysis.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:38.870
So if you're
looking for one bit,

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.940
is this positive or negative?

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.640
There are classifiers that
will do that pretty well.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.970
But there still are a lot
of privacy issues involved

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.140
in what exactly can--
what information can you

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.330
keep, how much can you tie
the identity in the forum

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.750
to the identity of the student?

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.224
Can you tie that to their
identity someplace else?

00:30:00.224 --> 00:30:01.640
And I think the
field, as a whole,

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.430
has to come to grips
with these privacy issues

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.600
so we can share
and learn what we

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.277
want without violating privacy.

00:30:10.277 --> 00:30:11.860
JULIA WILKOWSKI: A
question over here.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.592
AUDIENCE: So what do you
think about the distinction

00:30:14.592 --> 00:30:18.250
between an online course and,
I guess, an online reference?

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.850
I work at Udacity and,
you know, a tension

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.379
we're struggling
with all the time

00:30:22.379 --> 00:30:24.045
is you want lots of
students, of course.

00:30:24.045 --> 00:30:25.120
That's a good thing.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.344
But you also, we're a
company full of educators

00:30:27.344 --> 00:30:29.260
who want to do really
well for these students.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.759
We want to give
them what they need.

00:30:30.759 --> 00:30:32.805
And sometimes what
students think they want

00:30:32.805 --> 00:30:36.080
and what we, as educators
and experts in the field

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.145
believe they need,
are kind of at odds.

00:30:38.145 --> 00:30:42.568
And so this modularity is, it's
hard to incorporate modularity,

00:30:42.568 --> 00:30:44.734
or ultramodularity, in that
sort of way of thinking.

00:30:44.734 --> 00:30:45.598
PETER NORVIG: Yeah.

00:30:45.598 --> 00:30:46.587
Yeah.

00:30:46.587 --> 00:30:48.170
I think there is a
lot say about that.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.790
And I think the course
versus reference shows

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.540
up and in two places.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.280
One is for the schedule.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.230
Now I showed you that
graph with the spikes.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.950
And that says, if you have a
course with a schedule, boy

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.140
that really helps a lot.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.441
That motivates students
to get stuff done.

00:31:03.441 --> 00:31:04.940
They know the
deadline is coming up.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.440
They know if they
go into the forum,

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.770
everybody's talking about
it at the same time.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.354
And so having a course with a
schedule is useful that way.

00:31:11.354 --> 00:31:12.770
On the other hand,
a lot of people

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.330
drop out because they
can't meet the schedule.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.120
And they want to work
on their own time.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.339
Or they want to go in
their own direction.

00:31:19.339 --> 00:31:21.130
I'd like to have some
kind of a compromise.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:26.540
I talk about what I call the bus
model where you get on the bus.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.670
There's a schedule, scheduled
stops along the way.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.690
And you work towards those.

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:33.760
But if you want, you
can get off the bus

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.870
and wait for the next one.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.245
You may not be able to say,
all right, I want to sign up.

00:31:37.245 --> 00:31:38.600
I want to continue tomorrow.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.135
Maybe you have to wait a week.

00:31:40.135 --> 00:31:42.770
But at least you don't have
to wait a whole semester.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:44.590
So I think we want
to work that out.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.074
And then the other
part is, what is

00:31:47.074 --> 00:31:48.490
the content that
you want to take?

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.570
Should the student be
allowed to pick and choose?

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.540
I think we need some
mixed initiative

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.410
where the instructor
knows something

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.800
about how to put
together a sequence.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.230
But the students also have
their own particular needs.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:05.027
And we have to figure out a
way to serve both of those.

00:32:05.027 --> 00:32:06.485
Did you want to
add to that, Julia?

00:32:06.485 --> 00:32:06.980
JULIA WILKOWSKI: No.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.970
PETER NORVIG: OK.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:08.090
Yeah.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:08.881
AUDIENCE: Hi Peter.

00:32:08.881 --> 00:32:10.970
At the top of the
presentation, you

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:13.400
mentioned analytic dashboards.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.600
And I was just
wondering if you've

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.410
been using Google
Analytics as a tool

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.050
to give a course overview and--

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:21.800
PETER NORVIG: Yeah

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.802
AUDIENCE: Some
[INAUDIBLE] breakdown

00:32:22.802 --> 00:32:24.070
and that sort of thing.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.520
PETER NORVIG: Yeah.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.890
A lot of people have been
using the Google Analytics.

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.510
So this is a tool
that you can track

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:35.610
where people go through a
site from one URL to the next.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:38.540
Depending on how your
course is set up,

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.900
that can be easy to
difficult, right?

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.570
So Google Analytics is
designed to track URLs.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:48.510
You can set it up,
if you work at it,

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.730
to track all sorts
of Ajax events.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:55.930
So you can get very
fine, detailed students

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:57.380
who were on this question.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.610
And then they answered
C on this quiz.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.120
And then they went
someplace else.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:05.710
Or you can have it more
not as fine grained

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:07.559
if you don't want
to put in the work.

00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:08.850
So people have been doing that.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:11.750
You get some good reports just
by looking at the raw Google

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.580
Analytics.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.210
People sometimes feel like
that's not quite enough.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:20.150
That it was designed for
shopping websites and so on.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.486
And if you really want to get
everything out of the course,

00:33:24.486 --> 00:33:26.110
sometimes you have
to take the data out

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.180
of the Google Analytics.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.526
And do some separate
processing on it.

00:33:30.526 --> 00:33:32.650
JULIA WILKOWSKI: But there
is a course from Google,

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:34.358
from the Google
Analytics team, about how

00:33:34.358 --> 00:33:36.400
to use Google Analytics
more effectively.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.990
And they set up these
amazing dashboards.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.460
They didn't look at any of
the Course Builder dashboards.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.689
They just built everything
in Google Analytics

00:33:43.689 --> 00:33:45.730
and had some really
interesting findings as well.

00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:49.210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:49.961
My name is Daniel.

00:33:49.961 --> 00:33:51.584
I would like to know
if you have looked

00:33:51.584 --> 00:33:53.270
at the technical
parameters or if you're

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:58.240
aware of technical parameters
that can predict drop out rates

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.745
or how to lower them, either
what kind of video formats

00:34:01.745 --> 00:34:02.610
are used.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:05.480
Or, I myself, ran into a
problem with one of courses

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.070
that the volume
wasn't high enough.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.860
And I cranked it up all the way.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.670
I couldn't use it on my phone.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:13.960
So I just couldn't understand
the guy so actually I gave up.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.019
So is that something
that has been studied?

00:34:18.019 --> 00:34:18.810
PETER NORVIG: Yeah.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.699
I don't know how much.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:24.590
I mean, I think there's
always a lot of factors.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.110
You can go into
the forum and see

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.449
what people are
complaining about.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:32.960
It's sometimes hard to
get the feedback, right?

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.948
Because especially the
people who drop out,

00:34:34.948 --> 00:34:36.239
you don't hear from them again.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.290
And you can send them
a survey or something.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.980
They tend not to answer those.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.260
So it's sometimes hard to
understand why they do that.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.662
As Julia said, and sometimes
it's they got everything

00:34:47.662 --> 00:34:48.870
they wanted out of the class.

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.900
So dropping out wasn't
a negative for them.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.159
It was what they intended
to do in the first place.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.570
I think, look at
all the factors,

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:04.930
measure things, see what people
are asking about in the forum,

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:08.835
try to do as much of
post analysis as you can.

00:35:08.835 --> 00:35:14.210
If you can get people to answer
surveys, that's really useful.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.296
And use all tools you can.

00:35:16.296 --> 00:35:18.170
JULIA WILKOWSKI: We did
send out some surveys

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:20.890
to people who didn't complete
some of our early courses.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.475
And the number one
reason that people

00:35:22.475 --> 00:35:24.100
said that they didn't
finish the course

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.189
was that they didn't
have enough time.

00:35:26.189 --> 00:35:28.730
And it's easy to say, I don't
have enough time for something.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:30.190
But I think what
that really means

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.980
is that they didn't
see the value in making

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:36.070
that extra time for that
course at that time.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:38.710
Or they had some other
urgent need come up.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:43.035
But it's easy to say
there's not enough time.

00:35:43.035 --> 00:35:44.410
AUDIENCE: But over
time, question

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.240
was more from the
other way around.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.635
Did you look at if
it's flash or if people

00:35:48.635 --> 00:35:50.140
who use a certain
operating system

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.960
have higher or
lower dropout rates.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.230
PETER NORVIG: Right.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.313
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] four
versus [INAUDIBLE] two.

00:35:54.313 --> 00:35:56.421
I don't know, you know,
just some technical stuff?

00:35:56.421 --> 00:35:58.420
JULIA WILKOWSKI: We haven't
looked at that data.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.211
PETER NORVIG: Yeah.

00:35:59.211 --> 00:36:00.654
JULIA WILKOWSKI: Thanks.

00:36:00.654 --> 00:36:01.195
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:01.195 --> 00:36:02.950
I'm also Daniel.

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:06.530
And I got quite intrigued by the
idea of self-selected learning

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:07.510
plans.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:10.500
Because I've been trying
something like this since 1999.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.520
I have been doing
multiple online courses.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.685
And I found out that
the learning path,

00:36:14.685 --> 00:36:18.110
it's like one of these
untouchable cornerstones.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:21.270
Like both for the
designers of courses.

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.270
Like they were able to
compromise from anything.

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:26.290
But the learning path
from ABC, this is mine.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:27.550
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:31.540
And for the students, when
I go into the course, which

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:35.250
was like just the pieces
and let me find my path.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.950
They would feel
kind of confused.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:39.960
So I'm pretty anxious to hear
some more data on it, some more

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.380
experience like what is the
reception of the students?

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.005
What is the reception
of the designers?

00:36:47.005 --> 00:36:47.880
JULIA WILKOWSKI: Yes.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.426
So I can talk about
some experiments

00:36:49.426 --> 00:36:52.155
that we've run in the
Making Sense of Data Course.

00:36:52.155 --> 00:36:53.530
And this is actually
interesting.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.580
Because in previous
courses, we'd

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.767
seen that people who
do activities actually

00:36:57.767 --> 00:37:00.100
have a higher completion rate
than people who just watch

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.970
the videos or people
who don't engage

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:03.880
in the content in some way.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.740
So in this course,
we decided let's put

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.120
the activities front and center.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.170
Let's encourage them
to do the activities.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:12.410
And then if they're
stuck, they can go look

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:13.784
at the other content.

00:37:13.784 --> 00:37:15.200
And when we did
some user testing,

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.930
we actually found that
they hated this model.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.340
People just want to sit.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.340
And they want to absorb videos.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.970
Or that's what
they say at least.

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:27.890
But our data shows
that this isn't

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:30.190
how people really learn best.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.560
So I think when you're
setting up a learning path,

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.934
or encouraging people to set
up their own learning paths,

00:37:34.934 --> 00:37:36.880
there needs to be some
kind of a scaffolding

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.300
where you give them some hints
about what they could choose

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.530
or what people like them
have chosen in the past.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:48.690
Or some kind of a map or maybe
there's five different options.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.710
I think if you just
put it out there

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:54.370
and say, just go create your
own course, some really highly

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.560
motivated people who are
already succeeding in MOOCs

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.627
will do really well
and will love it.

00:37:58.627 --> 00:38:00.460
But for the vast majority
of the population,

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:05.276
I think they'll be hesitant and
not really know where to begin.

00:38:05.276 --> 00:38:08.050
AUDIENCE: How about training
designers, the instructors,

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:10.977
how they would
welcome this model?

00:38:10.977 --> 00:38:12.560
JULIA WILKOWSKI:
Personally, I love it

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.959
as a training
instructional designer.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:17.500
Because I want people to get
out of the course what they want

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.490
to get out of the course and
that it's tailored to them.

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:22.840
Because I think that will
increase the motivation

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.890
to complete the course
or meet their own goals.

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.290
PETER NORVIG: Yeah.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:30.220
I know for me in teaching
the I class with Sebastian,

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.000
we really felt like
it was flipped.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.220
And we had read about
what Daphne Koller had

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.150
done in the flipped classroom.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.980
But we really
flipped our whole way

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:44.740
of thinking about instruction
by saying, rather than thinking

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.530
what is it that we have
to say to explain a topic,

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:51.710
we instead thought, what is it
that we want the students to be

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:53.290
able to do.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:56.420
So we first said, here's a skill
we want the students to have.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.030
We want them to be able to
solve this type of problem.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.650
Then we had to translate
that into, well,

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.850
how could we have them
do that problem online

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:07.150
where there's some
limitations and grading.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:08.320
It's hard and so on.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.820
And then we would
come up with that.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.750
And then we'd design
that exercise.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:16.000
And only then would we say, now
do we have to open our mouths

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.380
and say something?

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:17.880
Right?

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.255
And we had to say, now we have
to introduce this problem.

00:39:20.255 --> 00:39:21.990
We have to give them
some background.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.095
We have to tell them something.

00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:26.220
But if it turned out we
could introduce the problem

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.790
without saying anything,
then we would just

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:28.664
go ahead and do that.

00:39:31.269 --> 00:39:31.810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:33.790
I'm curious about if
you've done any work

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.220
on different levels of students?

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.870
For example, early childhood
education or high school

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.832
students or college students
versus adult education?

00:39:42.832 --> 00:39:45.290
And if there are differences
in the kind of recommendations

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:48.547
you would give for designing
an online class in that case.

00:39:48.547 --> 00:39:49.880
JULIA WILKOWSKI: Great question.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.470
In all of our
courses, we have seen

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.730
similar trends what the broader
MOOC community has found,

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:58.180
which is that the most
likely population to take

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:03.600
MOOCs are well educated,
English speaking Americans who

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.770
are between 35 and 45.

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:10.730
So although the promise of MOOCs
is that anyone, anywhere can

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:13.710
take these classes and
become enlightened,

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:16.540
we haven't actually
seen that realized yet.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.690
So unfortunately we've had
a very narrow population

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:21.390
taking our classes so far.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.110
So we haven't done
that kind of analysis

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:25.150
of what's better
for this population

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.162
versus that population.

00:40:27.162 --> 00:40:28.620
PETER NORVIG: I
think that's right.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.080
Although the way
I think about it

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.840
is when you have
such a big audience,

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.290
you've got 100,000
people or something,

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:37.550
there's multiple
ways to look at it.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.820
And if you look at
it by majority rules,

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.230
then yes, the demographic
that Julia described,

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.330
that's the dominant demographic.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:45.780
They're the early adopters.

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:50.570
So the people that are lining
up to buy the latest tech

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:52.640
toy on the day that
it's announced,

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.390
those are the same
ones that are lining up

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.730
to take these online classes.

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.500
On the other hand, although
the tens of thousands of people

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.590
are in that
demographic, there are

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.890
people in other demographics
that are spread out.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:07.280
There is the high
school student.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.700
There is the
Asperger's student who

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.890
didn't fit in in a
traditional school.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:15.610
There's the kid in the
developing world who otherwise

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:16.950
wouldn't have had a chance.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:20.300
And small numbers of
these are able to succeed.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.160
They're not the majority.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.790
But it's part of it.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.320
And we like to
think about those.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.670
I think these people are
succeeding mostly on their own,

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:31.700
not because of
something we did, right?

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.950
So we gave them the opportunity.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.200
But they had to be
exceptional in order

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.382
to succeed with
that opportunity.

00:41:40.382 --> 00:41:41.370
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:44.430
I had a question on the
differences in platforms.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:46.140
I think not too
long ago Google said

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.874
they would be contributing
to the edX platform.

00:41:48.874 --> 00:41:50.415
So I was wondering
if you could speak

00:41:50.415 --> 00:41:53.690
to the differences and the
analytic tools between Course

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:58.169
Builder, edX, and
possibly even mooc.org.

00:41:58.169 --> 00:41:58.960
PETER NORVIG: Yeah.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.500
So mooc.org is still
a work in progress.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.920
So that's a joint
effort between edX

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.150
and Google where it's going
to be sort of the intent

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.660
is that will be the long tail.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:16.790
That edX is primarily
focused on the partner

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:18.620
schools that are part of edX.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.040
And mooc.org will be for
all the other schools.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.390
And we're working
to support that.

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:26.540
But it's got a ways to go yet.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:31.560
For edX, we work
closely with them.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.890
We do stuff for them.

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:34.580
They do stuff with us.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:39.230
We worked towards
interoperability.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:46.240
So we contributed various stuff
like Easy Google Login to them.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.930
And being able to take material
out of our Course Builder

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:55.410
platform and put it into the
edX platform and vice versa.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:57.570
We're making it all
run back and forth.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.550
We'd like to get
to the point where

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:02.490
the platforms are
merged completely.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:04.837
But so far it's at the
level of interoperability

00:43:04.837 --> 00:43:05.670
rather than merging.

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:06.336
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:43:06.336 --> 00:43:11.940
Is there any time frame for
retirement of Course Builder

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:12.770
or is it just--

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.644
PETER NORVIG: We don't
have a time frame yet.

00:43:14.644 --> 00:43:19.280
You know, it's just there's some
technical issues of basically

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.720
the difference between Google
App Engine and the Amazon

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.760
Cloud.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:28.640
And you'd think that that stuff
would just port automatically.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.600
But it doesn't.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.280
There's real work involved.

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.340
And it will take time
to work that out.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.560
AUDIENCE: Thanks very much.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.660
AUDIENCE: I work for a
brick and mortar university

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:42.270
and will luckily
and fortunately be

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:43.730
retiring in the next 10 years.

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:48.400
I see a lot of these young
faces in the classroom

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:52.650
who probably are either
pursuing or already

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:55.010
have a traditional
college degree.

00:43:55.010 --> 00:44:00.940
Do you see their
children as even

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.500
pursuing a traditional
college degree?

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.910
Or do you think that the model
is going to completely change

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:09.770
over perhaps the
next generation?

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:11.610
That's more or a
philosophical question

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:12.770
than a logistical question.

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.660
But it's really one of those
things I think about sometimes.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:19.150
I really think everything
shifting and whether 128

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:22.280
credits equals a degree
that will be conferred

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.134
on a sheet of paper
from a University.

00:44:24.134 --> 00:44:25.550
I don't know if
that's going to be

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.040
in existence 30 years from now.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:30.400
So just kind of a directional,
how do you think this

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.190
is going to go.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:35.150
PETER NORVIG: I'm the
wrong one to predict.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:38.310
I remember 20 years ago
my daughter was born.

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:41.270
And at the time, there was this
sort of financial instrument

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:43.530
you could buy that was a
hedge against increasing

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:44.870
cost of college.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.780
And I said, no way am I buying
that because in 20 years

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.480
everything will be online.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.380
So I was wrong.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.070
But maybe only by
one generation.

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:56.240
But I think what's
more important

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:59.820
than what leads up to
your college degree

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.310
is what's after that.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:06.340
And I think this notion that
you go someplace for four years

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.750
and then you get a
certificate and now you

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.850
don't have to learn
anything again,

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:13.010
that's clearly
isn't going to work.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.500
That we're going to have to
have continuing education.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.990
You know, you're going to
be educated in one field,

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:22.300
start to have a career in
that, and then that career

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.640
is going to be automated away.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.610
And you have to retrain
in some other field.

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:28.050
And that's going to be
more common than it is now.

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:30.900
So we'll see continuing
education, whether it

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.330
will be associated with
traditional colleges

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:37.550
or associated with these
online institutions,

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:38.640
it'll be some mix.

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.140
And I can't predict
what it will be.

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.223
JULIA WILKOWSKI: And it
looks like we are actually

00:45:42.223 --> 00:45:42.770
out of time.

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:45.400
So thank you all
for coming today.
