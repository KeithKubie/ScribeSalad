00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.670
- [Narrator] What we're
going to read together

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.720
in this video is what has become known as

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.870
Martin Luther King's Letter
from a Birmingham Jail,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.860
which he wrote from a jail cell in 1963

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.020
after he and several of his associates

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.580
were arrested in Birmingham, Alabama

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.790
as they nonviolently
protested segregation there.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.810
And, I'm going to read an excerpt of it.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.300
I encourage you to read
it in its entirety.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.040
It is one of the most powerful documents,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.480
frankly, I have ever read.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.210
And Martin Luther King often gets

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.980
a lot of credit as an amazing speaker.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.537
People say, "Hey, he
could read the phone book,

00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:34.760
"and it would move people."

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.750
But this also speaks to what
an incredible writer he was.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.260
Not only is it moving, but it really gives

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.450
the philosophical underpinnings of the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.680
Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.500
And many people attribute
the Civil Rights Act of 1964

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.310
passed by Congress as
being heavily influenced

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.100
by Martin Luther King's letter.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.160
Now, what motivated Martin Luther King

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.270
to write this letter was a statement

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.680
made in the newspaper by
eight Alabama clergymen,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.270
which encouraged the protesters to wait

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.217
saying, "That, yes, we are
sympathetic to the injustices,

00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:07.867
"but they should be resolved in the courts

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.027
"and not through the type of protests,

00:01:10.027 --> 00:01:12.267
"the type of tension,
that Martin Luther King

00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:14.650
"and his fellow protesters were creating."

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.690
And so, here's just an excerpt of what

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.557
Martin Luther King wrote,

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:21.717
"You may well ask, 'Why direct action?

00:01:21.717 --> 00:01:24.546
"'Why sit ins, marches and so forth?

00:01:24.546 --> 00:01:27.097
"'Isn't negotiation a better path?'

00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:30.297
"You are quite right in
calling for negotiation.

00:01:30.297 --> 00:01:33.937
"Indeed, this is the very
purpose of direct action.

00:01:33.937 --> 00:01:37.167
"Nonviolent direct action seeks to create

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:40.047
"such a crisis and foster such a tension

00:01:40.047 --> 00:01:42.727
"that a community which
has constantly refused

00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:46.587
"to negotiate is forced
to confront the issue.

00:01:46.587 --> 00:01:48.927
"It seeks so to dramatize the issue

00:01:48.927 --> 00:01:51.357
"that it can no longer be ignored.

00:01:51.357 --> 00:01:53.427
"My citing the creation of tension

00:01:53.427 --> 00:01:56.107
"as part of the work of
the nonviolent resister

00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:58.367
"may sound rather shocking.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:00.247
"But I must confess that I am

00:02:00.247 --> 00:02:03.207
"not afraid of the word 'tension.'

00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:06.547
"I have earnestly opposed violent tension,

00:02:06.547 --> 00:02:08.797
"but there is a type of constructive,

00:02:08.797 --> 00:02:12.333
"nonviolent tension which
is necessary for growth.

00:02:13.557 --> 00:02:16.187
"Just as Socrates felt
that it was necessary

00:02:16.187 --> 00:02:18.277
"to create a tension in the mind so that

00:02:18.277 --> 00:02:20.857
"individuals could rise from the bondage

00:02:20.857 --> 00:02:23.917
"of myths and half truths
to the unfettered realm

00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:26.707
"of creative analysis
and objective appraisal,

00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:30.687
"so must we see the need
for nonviolent gadflies

00:02:30.687 --> 00:02:33.277
"to create the kind of tension in society

00:02:33.277 --> 00:02:36.097
"that will help men rise
from the dark depths

00:02:36.097 --> 00:02:39.317
"of prejudice and racism
to the majestic heights

00:02:39.317 --> 00:02:41.687
"of understanding and brotherhood.

00:02:41.687 --> 00:02:44.567
"The purpose of our direct action program

00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:47.707
"is to create a situation so crisis packed

00:02:47.707 --> 00:02:51.323
"that it will inevitably
open the door to negotiation.

00:02:52.347 --> 00:02:55.007
"I guess it is easy for
those who have never felt

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.557
"the stinging darts of
segregation to say 'wait.'

00:02:58.557 --> 00:03:00.427
"But when you have seen vicious mobs

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:02.627
"lynch your mothers and fathers at will

00:03:02.627 --> 00:03:05.567
"and drown your sister
and brothers at whim;

00:03:05.567 --> 00:03:07.597
"when you have seen hate-filled policemen

00:03:07.597 --> 00:03:09.957
"curse, kick, brutalize, and even kill

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:12.677
"your black brothers and
sisters with impunity;

00:03:12.677 --> 00:03:15.777
"when you see the vast
majority of your 20 million

00:03:15.777 --> 00:03:19.067
"Negro brothers smothering
in an airtight cage

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:22.387
"of poverty in the midst
of an affluent society;

00:03:22.387 --> 00:03:24.417
"when you suddenly find
your tongue twisted

00:03:24.417 --> 00:03:27.217
"and your speech stammering
as you seek to explain

00:03:27.217 --> 00:03:29.717
"to your six-year-old
daughter why she cannot go

00:03:29.717 --> 00:03:31.637
"to the public amusement park that has

00:03:31.637 --> 00:03:34.247
"just been advertised on television;

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:36.087
"when you take a cross-country drive

00:03:36.087 --> 00:03:38.747
"and find it necessary to
sleep night after night

00:03:38.747 --> 00:03:41.407
"in the uncomfortable
corners of your automobile

00:03:41.407 --> 00:03:43.857
"because no motel will accept you;

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:46.397
"when you are humiliated
day in and day out

00:03:46.397 --> 00:03:49.757
"by nagging signs reading
'white' and 'colored,'

00:03:49.757 --> 00:03:54.757
"then you will understand why
we find it difficult to wait."

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.430
I've read this many times,
but every time I read it,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.810
and this is just an
excerpt, as you can tell,

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.960
it's incredibly powerful.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.420
And I encourage you to
read it in its entirety,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.100
and think about why this was
such a powerful document,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.710
especially for catalyzing things

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.353
like the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
