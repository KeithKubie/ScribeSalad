say is certain people i incline that way

00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:29.900
say is certain people i incline that way

some people aren't one of the things I

mentioned the god gene earlier i think

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:36.500
mentioned the god gene earlier i think
 

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:40.609
mentioned the god gene earlier i think
the god gene actually minimizes the

00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:40.619
the god gene actually minimizes the
 

00:49:40.619 --> 00:49:43.339
the god gene actually minimizes the
perception of risk so you need less

00:49:43.339 --> 00:49:43.349
perception of risk so you need less
 

00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:45.620

courage to do something by making you a

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:45.630
courage to do something by making you a
 

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:48.829
courage to do something by making you a
little bit stupider about the real risks

00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839
little bit stupider about the real risks
 

00:49:48.839 --> 00:49:52.579
little bit stupider about the real risks
and i often say if i detect if i knew

00:49:52.579 --> 00:49:52.589
and i often say if i detect if i knew
 

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:55.609
and i often say if i detect if i knew
all the risks in a start-up before i

00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619
all the risks in a start-up before i
 

00:49:55.619 --> 00:49:58.880
all the risks in a start-up before i
started I'd mostly not started all right

00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:58.890
started I'd mostly not started all right
 

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:04.480
started I'd mostly not started all right
and so this sort of blissful ignorance

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:04.490
and so this sort of blissful ignorance
 

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:07.569
and so this sort of blissful ignorance
premature confidence arrogance all these

done it is i start in life not needing
much and i said so i have very little to

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:26.910
much and i said so i have very little to
 

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:30.230
much and i said so i have very little to
lose and a lot to gain because if you

and saying what is the risk you're

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:03.210
and saying what is the risk you're
 

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:06.950
and saying what is the risk you're
taking you might risk take a risk at a

major that was it ah and so you talked a

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:53.650
major that was it ah and so you talked a
 

00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:56.699
major that was it ah and so you talked a
lot about yeah not being certain and not

00:58:56.699 --> 00:58:56.709
lot about yeah not being certain and not
 

00:58:56.709 --> 00:58:59.309
lot about yeah not being certain and not
and knowing that we don't know that much

00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319
and knowing that we don't know that much
 

00:58:59.319 --> 00:59:01.019

what do you think in general about

00:59:01.019 --> 00:59:01.029
what do you think in general about
 

00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:03.660
what do you think in general about
having the control about future events

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:03.670
having the control about future events
 

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:06.870
having the control about future events
and is that even the notion that's like

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880
and is that even the notion that's like
 

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.819
and is that even the notion that's like
desirable having the control about what

00:59:08.819 --> 00:59:08.829
desirable having the control about what
 

00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:11.339
desirable having the control about what
happens yeah so the question i'll repeat

00:59:11.339 --> 00:59:11.349
happens yeah so the question i'll repeat
 

00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:13.920
happens yeah so the question i'll repeat
as I understood it is you have to

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:13.930
as I understood it is you have to
 

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:15.900
as I understood it is you have to
control future events what do I think

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:15.910
control future events what do I think
 

00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:18.689
control future events what do I think
about it obviously that's true at many

00:59:18.689 --> 00:59:18.699
about it obviously that's true at many
 

00:59:18.699 --> 00:59:24.420
about it obviously that's true at many
many levels the fundamental thing I

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:24.430
many levels the fundamental thing I
 

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:30.380
many levels the fundamental thing I
would say is we focus too much on

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:30.390
would say is we focus too much on
 

00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:34.170
would say is we focus too much on
providing reducing failure which means

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:34.180
providing reducing failure which means
 

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.949
providing reducing failure which means
increasing control and predictability

00:59:36.949 --> 00:59:36.959
increasing control and predictability
 

00:59:36.959 --> 00:59:40.589

there's another way to make failure more

00:59:40.589 --> 00:59:40.599
there's another way to make failure more
 

00:59:40.599 --> 00:59:44.130
there's another way to make failure more
acceptable and that's to reduce the

00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:44.140
acceptable and that's to reduce the
 

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:47.519
acceptable and that's to reduce the
consequences of a failure so let me give

00:59:47.519 --> 00:59:47.529
consequences of a failure so let me give
 

00:59:47.529 --> 00:59:50.459
consequences of a failure so let me give

we've done more of prevent failure stuff

01:00:13.859 --> 01:00:13.869
we've done more of prevent failure stuff
 

01:00:13.869 --> 01:00:16.859
we've done more of prevent failure stuff
and less of reduce the consequences of

01:00:16.859 --> 01:00:16.869
and less of reduce the consequences of
 

01:00:16.869 --> 01:00:19.400
and less of reduce the consequences of
failure so we can tolerate more failure

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:19.410
failure so we can tolerate more failure
 

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:23.160
failure so we can tolerate more failure
I think at the social level especially

I think at the social level especially
 

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:26.519
I think at the social level especially
at complex systems I think we should

01:00:26.519 --> 01:00:26.529
at complex systems I think we should

that's what I think to the extent
 

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:38.610
that's what I think to the extent
