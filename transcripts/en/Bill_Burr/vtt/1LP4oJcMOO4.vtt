1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.470
Alright. We're in San Jose. I mean, we're going to do the intro private,

2
00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:07.304
that donor thing, right?

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.160
<v 1>All right. I never read fucking donuts.</v>

4
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.870
What everybody was telling me a hundred this place was

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.340
try to go and get one of the smaller ones

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.990
like Brookville maple. All right, let's see here.

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.650
<v 0>Oh my God. Fucking delicious.</v>

8
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.623
<v 1>Steroids, donuts.</v>

9
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.570
<v 0>So where in the downtown? In the downtown area of San Jose.</v>

10
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.850
This is an area that a lot of people make fun of,

11
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.240
especially comedians because we come here, we don't know shit about San Jose.

12
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.040
We don't understand that this nicer areas.

13
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:48.420
There's all these great places to eat.

14
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.160
I'm going to try to show you some of them.

15
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.400
There's another one of those ugly apartment buildings that I see in every single

16
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.360
city. Now, man, that looks like some fucking eastern European shit.

17
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.150
Did that plane landed right there? Alaskan Airlines.

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.960
This is what's fucked up about San Jose's airport. Granted,

19
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:07.650
I don't know shit about aviation. I don't get, they have,

20
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.520
they have two runways. Usually they got one. One goes this way.

21
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:14.250
The other goes that way through the wind. You know. If the wind shifts,

22
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:16.530
you have options to take off. They have,

23
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.520
they have to two runways like parallel to each other,

24
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.440
like literally the exact same numbers,

25
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.050
like whatever's 23 and whatever the fuck that would be 23 moneys fucking 18

26
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:31.410
would be five 23 and five right. Whatever the fuck they are.

27
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.660
So I would think that,

28
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.090
I'm going to ask an instructor the question about that. Like, so what if the,

29
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.380
uh, what if the wind is coming too far? Why is it, I can't remember.

30
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.900
That's the funny thing about when you get your pilot's license,

31
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:49.890
the amount of Shit you forget is ridiculous. When you're in ground school,

32
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:51.900
you're on it, you know, whatever you think fucking meets.

33
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.960
Then after a while it's just like driving the car.

34
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:58.110
I can't 10 and two was it three and six? I don't know.

35
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.450
Just imagine thinking that shit except you're up there.

36
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.940
I just felt like Don Rickles said casino,

37
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.870
you know better than you know up there. I love that Uber, it,

38
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.900
that Vaudevillian background he had that he had to go like that. Like,

39
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:14.070
we didn't know what up there was by the way. Great outtakes in that building.

40
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.230
All right. This is the part of the cities that I liked.

41
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.260
You know you got auto body stuff over there.

42
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.540
You got a little restaurant over here.

43
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.980
This is the parts of the cities that I like where it's sort of industrial.

44
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:27.090
You can also, you know,

45
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.080
go get something to eat or maybe go play some drums.

46
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.330
Maybe there's a studio around there. Can you imagine that?

47
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.310
If Paul freckles got to play the drums for a minute.

48
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.773
<v 1>Oh</v>

49
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.070
<v 0>Andrew, I teed you up for that cut t job for it</v>

50
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.130
right here. We've got some railroad tracks.

51
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.240
Nobody takes the fucking train anymore. You know,

52
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.270
I'm always amazed at the lack of security again on a train.

53
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.790
Like if I was in Isis, like that's how I would get in.

54
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.100
I'd get on a train the airport, they check for everything. You get on a train.

55
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:13.870
You could literally have a box that said TNT, you know, I'll let you get on. Oh,

56
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.850
here's where the San Jose fucking shirts.

57
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.950
It's the shit.

58
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.730
They made it to the conference they made to the [inaudible] Cup finals last

59
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.280
year. So they got one more hurdle after all those years.

60
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:35.281
I used to always say San Jose sharks sharks were basically the San Diego charges

61
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:38.260
on skates cause they always fuck their fans over.

62
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.850
They have a great regular season and then they kicked shit the bed when it comes

63
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:46.420
to playoffs. But these, these aren't, these aren't your uncle's San Jose sharks.

64
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.300
I can't even say your grandfathers because they've been around so little.

65
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.500
Oh look at it's wells Fargo. Can you imagine? Look, they have one up here.

66
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.330
It's unbelievable. It's almost like we're down to just three different bags.

67
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.780
So now we're in the downtown San Jose area.

68
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.140
Bicycles that you can rent.

69
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.770
I can never get those fucking things out of there.

70
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.740
I could just put the money in. It never works.

71
00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:12.930
And I start fucking the fucking crazy shit. You know,

72
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.710
I was always some woman and when it's like some Hillary Clinton fucking

73
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.990
pantsuits staring at me waiting to get her bicycle,

74
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.710
of course she can figure it out, right? Cause she's relaxed.

75
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.620
I took a yoga class. I had a facial.

76
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.670
You like how I blame her in that story rather than the fact that I'm a complete

77
00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:30.504
psycho.

78
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.950
Why don't I ask the Hillary Clinton dress lady for a little bit of help?

79
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.940
I could do that. Oh look, it's chase. Jesus Christ. Can you imagine that?

80
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.990
It's almost as if we're down to two or three bags. What's left?

81
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.060
What's the one Sam Jackson does? What's in your wallet? Capital one.

82
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.740
Capital one. I like when he says what's in your wallet? I don't know Sam.

83
00:04:52.741 --> 00:04:53.730
I know what's in your wallet.

84
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.690
A bunch of fucking cash they show that got their commercial be 20 seconds.

85
00:04:57.691 --> 00:05:00.330
You know what good for him. Good for him.

86
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:02.820
He's probably not making any money off of pulp fiction at this point.

87
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.580
The way they adjust it down, you know,

88
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.180
after like the third showing on t and t probably gets checks for like a dollar

89
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:13.980
48. What I love about northern or mid California.

90
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.490
A lot of these, you know, smaller cities, even though it isn't exactly small,

91
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.600
is uh, you know, as much as they have the skyscrapers and stuff,

92
00:05:21.601 --> 00:05:24.390
you see a lot of the sort of like a lot of the original buildings,

93
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.900
what it looked like, you know, during that period where it was just like,

94
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:28.734
you know,

95
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.390
White Europeans and Latinos, you know,

96
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.300
all like facing off. I kind of meeting at a dog park, right.

97
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.010
Sniffing each other's asses, seeing what's going to go down. Right.

98
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:43.890
And then they just fucking go at it. Can I turn here? This is one thing.

99
00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:47.940
I can't turn it no problem. That's where the guy got shot.

100
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.780
I'm going to drive by that right with here.

101
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.560
Somebody literally got shot and killed right in front of the Improv.

102
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.351
They weren't at the show,

103
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:58.351
they just happened to be walking by and I felt bad because they took a picture

104
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:02.600
of the dead body under the sheet and it was right underneath the marquee and

105
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:05.780
then the name of the comedian was, was on the mark. He

106
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.950
was like, he wasn't at his show. He's just walking by.

107
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.380
Look at this soulless fucking place here.

108
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.240
I don't know if you can go right on red. That's just a cop.

109
00:06:18.241 --> 00:06:21.000
I'm so destined to get a ticket. Every time I go to make a fucking move,

110
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.600
there's a cop right there. Look at that place.

111
00:06:24.601 --> 00:06:28.080
That's when you're going in there for the meeting and you got those people you

112
00:06:28.081 --> 00:06:30.780
ride down on the elevator and they all have like their name tags on it.

113
00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:35.100
Something. I always feel bad from you cause it's always,

114
00:06:35.101 --> 00:06:38.400
I superimpose what I want under other people. Maybe they're happy.

115
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.370
Everybody all like wearing the same colored fucking izod.

116
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.930
You went down there to figure it to strategize on the next daughter.

117
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.670
Does that help deaf people that fucking sang. If I was deaf I would. Oh,

118
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:52.960
am I blind? I was gonna say,

119
00:06:52.961 --> 00:06:54.720
I don't think that'd be like darts going by my head.

120
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.940
Well that helps blind people. Sorry, I'm fucking idiot.

121
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.900
Why are you watching this? Because it makes you feel better about yourself,

122
00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:07.740
doesn't it? Yeah. Typical, typical. Do say something negative on Twitter now,

123
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.250
Huh? Does that fill you up? Does that feel like a hug from your dad?

124
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.410
And what's funny about San Jose,

125
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.480
it's this like nobody here a lot of the times and they got this fucking train

126
00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:22.440
that goes up and down and there's just like nobody on it. If you get on it,

127
00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:24.690
you're going to feel like you're in Jacob's ladder. You'd be like,

128
00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:27.840
did I get killed in Vietnam? Where is everybody?

129
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.500
It's always some old bag ladies staring at you for a head start spinning around.

130
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:37.030
No train truck. And there's always somebody yelling out here. You hear that?

131
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:45.120
And it's either a crazy homeless person. You know what yelling I like,

132
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.440
I like when you go into a Sushi restaurant and all the guys yell at you when you

133
00:07:49.441 --> 00:07:54.270
come walking in. I always feel like I'm in like Japanese cheers.

134
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.350
And I'm like, norm makes you feel welcome. So anyways,

135
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.670
I've been doing a bunch of shows out here trying to get my new hour together.

136
00:08:02.671 --> 00:08:07.170
And uh, this is one of my, like this Improv here in San Jose is great.

137
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.320
It's old. It has a history, you know? Of course.

138
00:08:10.321 --> 00:08:13.710
All the places have history though. It was built in like 19 oh something.

139
00:08:13.711 --> 00:08:15.180
Harry Houdini played here,

140
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.500
a Charlie Chaplin Fatty Arbuckle,

141
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.160
all fatty and now me right there.

142
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.020
Craig Proops is in a couple of weeks. Marlon Wayans two great acts.

143
00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:30.510
You should check out right about where that wet spot is.

144
00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:33.960
That's right where the person got killed or bastard and then they just had the

145
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.363
marquee.

146
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.330
I felt so bad for the comic. It's just like, dude, did I need that shit? I mean,

147
00:08:42.331 --> 00:08:46.850
it's hard enough to sell tickets after what the bank is did in 2008 you've got

148
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.920
to show a dead book. There was no reason to show the Improv name.

149
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.030
I know what it was was the photographer was getting a little antsy,

150
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.840
but it's what say a, it's basically a theater.

151
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.920
It's one of those ones that was when it was made,

152
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:05.820
was made like I think rebuilt after it burned down in the 19 hundreds and like

153
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.620
Harry Houdini was there. Charlie Chapter

154
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.993
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

155
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.740
<v 0>Well. Yeah, fatty Arbuckle is back when you,</v>

156
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.920
your nickname was just what you were, you know, fatty Arbuckle.

157
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.430
You could never call him that. No. What the fuck would they call them?

158
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.040
Probably calling his real name. Like Todd

159
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.850
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

160
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.590
<v 0>Carbuncle everybody, it's kind of fat, isn't it?</v>

161
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.690
Don't say that it hurt his feelings.

162
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

163
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.230
<v 0>Um, I don't know. If you listen to my podcast, I fucking hate museums.</v>

164
00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:49.750
I respect them. I respect all the smart people that go in there and like, Ooh,

165
00:09:49.751 --> 00:09:53.660
look at that fork that somebody used with Julius Caesar was still an office.

166
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.520
I'm just not into it.

167
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
They have here arguably the most boring museum you could ever have.

168
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.540
It's a museum. The Museum of Technology. I can't,

169
00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:10.430
I mean, I didn't hate museums so much. I go in there,

170
00:10:10.431 --> 00:10:13.640
I just can't imagine what they would have. All right. So evidently,

171
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.370
<v 1>okay.</v>

172
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.980
<v 0>The, the, the best part of the museum is the gift shop. Just</v>

173
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.381
what would you get? I mean,

174
00:10:21.381 --> 00:10:23.650
I just feel you're gonna walk in there and they're just gonna have like,

175
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.700
you know like they have like, you know,

176
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.460
whatever the fuck we were tadpoles all the way to be in men.

177
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.980
They probably have that with like calculators and everything.

178
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.330
But I felt all right, here it is.

179
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.120
Here it is right there and Museum of technology.

180
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.840
If you ever wanted to see the history in a laptop, there it is.

181
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.290
I actually respect that on some level. You know what I mean?

182
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.460
I just don't get a thrill out of that stuff. So as usual, if I don't like it,

183
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:53.820
I should all over it because of childhood. You see that now?

184
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:55.920
You know what it's like for my wife to watch TV with me.

185
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.580
Can't you just stop talking and just sit here and enjoy things with me?

186
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.720
Why do you have to make fun of everything? I Dunno cause it paid for the house.

187
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.020
I hate that one. Alright, now we're going to take a break from the tour.

188
00:11:15.021 --> 00:11:17.570
We're going to go get some tacos spread like red, like sorry.

189
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:19.790
We're going to get some tacos.

190
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.890
See what happens when you try to make the word Taco funny.

191
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:27.770
Now over the Stop Line here, you know this, this is, is it the end of the month?

192
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.800
It's the end of the month. That's when the Dudley do, right?

193
00:11:30.801 --> 00:11:35.801
Fucking cop comes up like actually free freemiums over the fucking [inaudible]

194
00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.540
and that's when you think about taking his gun kitty.

195
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:44.020
I look at that all gold building man and minds me of the radio station Vic Vic

196
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.820
Reynolds works at and F is for family,

197
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:51.940
which by the way is coming out the end of May for season two.

198
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.680
I just scared this lady. Sorry.

199
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.850
All right, here we go. All right, we're going to go to the original Joe's.

200
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.390
The weirdest name for Italian restaurant can be original Luis, right?

201
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:16.240
Oh fuck you was. Nothing drives me up the fucking wall.

202
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.030
Jesus Christ in one way. This is one way.

203
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.440
Where are your wipers on this? It's all in one.

204
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:28.330
Very efficient.

205
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.520
All right, so listen to this on my podcast.

206
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.670
You know that I fucked up my shoulder. I rotated cuff.

207
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.150
I've got like a pitcher's injury and I have no athletic abilities whatsoever.

208
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.420
And uh, sorry I was trying to work. Right. Um,

209
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.510
so I was trying to describe the exercise that somebody showed me that's really

210
00:12:48.511 --> 00:12:49.580
been helping me since this role,

211
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.340
you hold fucks out there like me can't afford any physical therapy cause you

212
00:12:53.341 --> 00:12:55.530
don't have health insurance, right? So here's the deal.

213
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.710
This is what you start with. You just like stir the paint, right?

214
00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:02.700
You just like this, right? Like you stare in small circles. It's like this.

215
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:04.630
Everybody's looking at me like what?

216
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.060
And then you just get right to the threshold of pain. Right fucking there

217
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.530
and then you just go the other way. Same thing. Just do that for like,

218
00:13:13.531 --> 00:13:16.200
I don't know, 30 seconds till it feels warmed up.

219
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.300
And then this is the exercise here, right? Cause you know rotator cuff,

220
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.480
it's that first 30 degrees. You're like ah fuck it. Just use the,

221
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:29.550
use your fingers here to take most of the weight of your arm and you just walk

222
00:13:29.971 --> 00:13:34.200
it up like this slowly cause this is where your fucking hurts.

223
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.580
You just walk it up the wall like that. I you

224
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:44.040
motherfucker and you get it all the way up here. You could stretch like that.

225
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.970
You walk up the lady, then I just do this. Inchworm my way down.

226
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:54.100
You do a set of three to five. Oh, you fucking cunt. Ah,

227
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.710
you see it works. You do a set of three to five.

228
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.960
Um, and it's improved my own bias. I, it feels like it's like an 80%,

229
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.000
although I just did those kinds of quickly,

230
00:14:06.001 --> 00:14:07.410
so I probably just fucked it up again.

231
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.350
All right, so now we're heading up to uh, whatever the fuck it is.

232
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:19.210
Santana something around the boulevard or Santana city. I don't know what it is.

233
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.630
This is where all the money is. All that silicone valley, all the shit that,

234
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:28.180
that, that you use the iPhone to the fucking robot you can have sex with.

235
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.510
This is where it gets made and we're going to go out there,

236
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.310
see what these people look like, see where they shop. They don't see biggie.

237
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.870
You know, that's one thing about those nerds that read them. Like,

238
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:43.900
just like wait for thin or just absolutely fed flux.

239
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:49.070
Everybody processes stress differently. All right, here we are Westfield Mall,

240
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.840
but the same old fucking stores that it may seize.

241
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.280
Probably a cheesecake factory that you gotta have champs scores.

242
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.210
The store someplace to get frozen yogurt, right?

243
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:11.180
Let a bunch of moms walking around trying to look fuckable competing with the

244
00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:14.440
daughters. That's a big, that's a big mall thing.

245
00:15:14.441 --> 00:15:18.790
Now we know that for 21 mentality. You're not,

246
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:23.730
you're 51 all right, 51 covered up. Okay sweetheart, it's over.

247
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.960
No one's looking at me. You had your time. Be like a retired athlete.

248
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:33.070
Just sit around and talk about the glory days that you suck in Dick back in the

249
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.190
70s so

250
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:44.803
sure.

251
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.990
Alright, well we're going to see some Gretchen was you look,

252
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.180
look it right there. It's a chase bag next to holy shit.

253
00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:57.560
Next to a bank of America.

254
00:15:57.561 --> 00:16:01.670
So we have at least three banks and then the one Sam Jackson does.

255
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.063
What's in your wallet

256
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.000
is another one. Macy's. That's what? Cheese cake factory. I called it,

257
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:15.610
I called it. Sorry. Fucking took out your card,

258
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.550
crate and barrel.

259
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.080
This is why I like the downtown area.

260
00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:26.070
They had all this fucking privately owned owned at these restaurants,

261
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:34.170
like people travel and they get excited. Oh, they have a cheesecake factory.

262
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.350
They go in and they order what the fuck they could have ordered right down the

263
00:16:37.351 --> 00:16:41.500
street from their fucking house. I just feel like for me,

264
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.340
traveling is trying different things. Sorry,

265
00:16:45.341 --> 00:16:48.210
my wife and watching all this fucking reality and that's all they say on it.

266
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.270
Everything gets so about them. They just go free me. I just feel like for me,

267
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.470
when I saw those starving children, I thought, you know, it's bad.

268
00:16:56.471 --> 00:16:59.680
It's bad as it is. I would love to have that waistline.

269
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:04.510
Do you know what he mean? Oh, here we go. Here's all the high end stores.

270
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.470
This is where the nerds all shop. Tesla,

271
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:12.940
Gucci to me, Tesla,

272
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:17.250
he go nearby car. Oh yeah, the wallet chain.

273
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:19.423
Wall chain, man.

274
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.100
This has to be one of the most solace places I've ever been to in my life.

275
00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:25.560
Why is it so bad?

276
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.510
You can tell even like the way that trees are, you can just tell, you know,

277
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.380
they just stuck it there. Okay. Right there.

278
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:37.200
That's where a bunch of people are making a bunch of money. You know,

279
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.820
all the nerds in there creating apps at the Splunk.

280
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.030
It say you had to just app,

281
00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.800
do you want to like track your chips and like see how much protein is in it?

282
00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.000
You're like conscious steps and uh,

283
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.960
the amount of Scarlet's that's coming out of your Dick. It's use millennials.

284
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:55.980
Love it. All right. Yes. That is why they all go to see movies out here.

285
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.670
All the nerds, you know, maybe that's a movie Hap, I dunno,

286
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.100
this is a, I'm going to do, you know,

287
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:04.770
I'm going to try to do it because I've been really negative up until this point.

288
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:05.910
I'm going to, I'm going to be,

289
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:10.050
I'm going to go down to Santana row and read nothing but positive. Okay.

290
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.790
I just facetime with my wife and she was like, oh, it looks fine.

291
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.350
So maybe it's me. I think of that up there. Look for that fits into that.

292
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.780
I mean, even though it was built two seconds ago,

293
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.570
they've literally just finished putting that paint up there.

294
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.470
It does look vaguely like European, doesn't it? Come on,

295
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.600
let's go for a walk.

296
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.900
This is literally one of these places. Thank God there's like nobody here.

297
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.920
I came here on the weekend. I would probably spontaneously just start crying.

298
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.570
Oh my God. What? I love this place right here.

299
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.490
So look down. Go. I like this place for kitchen shit. It means on the table.

300
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.720
It's like my joke from a HBO special, right? Put it on the table.

301
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.830
Would it filming something? Jesus fucking Christ. How are you sir?

302
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.190
Did you come out yet? All right, thank you. No worries. No worries.

303
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:18.110
Any interrupting and seated mean to diesel. People still wear that. Oh my God.

304
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.560
The flicks though. Nineties they were the ones that fucked up the whole jeans.

305
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.970
Everybody's jeans back in the day. Could were fucking Levi's dad jeans.

306
00:19:26.971 --> 00:19:29.580
Nobody gave a fuck. They were like 30 bucks.

307
00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.830
Considered American classics. This is what they're going for out here.

308
00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:39.740
That's the look, you know, stay on 600 yards.

309
00:19:39.741 --> 00:19:43.320
Stare at it. Fucking, she's kicked factory over the horizon. Okay.

310
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.830
The one positive thing that I will say about Santana row is it doesn't go on

311
00:19:46.831 --> 00:19:50.700
forever. It's only a couple of blocks and then it's over

312
00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:59.600
35 zero to 62.5 seconds.

313
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:04.840
That's like motorcycle fast. Let's be honest.

314
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.000
This is the only thing that I can't deal with here is this giant.

315
00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.030
Do you guys make something where you can just pull this down where I don't have

316
00:20:11.031 --> 00:20:14.810
to look at this the whole time. It's really distracting. Huh?

317
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.050
What year were you born? Yeah. So you guys grew up in this.

318
00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:25.310
You're going in 1994. You're going to be one that's 23 this year.

319
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.920
That's Friday. Fuck, I'm old. She's as priced.

320
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.430
It was 26. Well, um,

321
00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.440
no, that is insane.

322
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.740
But I mean I could easily have something,

323
00:20:47.741 --> 00:20:51.220
I can just buy some cardboard and I could just put, cause I don't need this,

324
00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:56.140
right. I just, I shouldn't use climate control radio

325
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.760
because it helps with navigation that the,

326
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.490
what do I look out that's my navigation?

327
00:21:03.491 --> 00:21:07.610
Like driving down the road like this can this thing drive itself? Yeah,

328
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:12.100
they have software still calibrating those. Is it like,

329
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:15.400
just like a button you can push to? That's so amazing.

330
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.280
So like if I went out and got hammered, I don't need to call Uber. Right.

331
00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:22.780
I just press a button and I, I just pass. I'm still liable. Yeah,

332
00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:27.070
but Tesla's not liable. Well, how are you going to prove that I was drunk?

333
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.880
We will show the backseat.

334
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.550
No, but I've learned you run away from the accident.

335
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:41.440
That's what this guy did for me. All right,

336
00:21:41.441 --> 00:21:46.370
cool. All right. There you go.

337
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.160
That was awesome. That was incredible.

338
00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:54.100
Zero to 62.5 seconds. I don't know that that's,

339
00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.340
that's the way the world's going to go yet. Has to go electric.

340
00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.590
The gas combustion engine can't compete with that.

341
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.160
I'm just going to miss that sound. You know what,

342
00:22:04.161 --> 00:22:07.990
there's probably going to be an app on a car in the future to make the sound of

343
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.680
like a fucking an old school, you know,

344
00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:16.790
muscle car engine. But, uh, all right. So the guy said,

345
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.640
I don't know if we have that in the video, but it was

346
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:25.880
140,000 bucks to get the top of the line. He said it was all about the battery.

347
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.730
I didn't get what he was saying, whatever,

348
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:32.120
140 grand to go to 0.5 seconds to zero to 60

349
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.800
other than that, it just looks like a piece of shit. Nissan Maxima.

350
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.830
That's what I can't get past. But it's a four door sedan.

351
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.320
I wonder after you put all the people in it, you know,

352
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.600
for people after they ate some burgers, if it goes up, I mean, it is way right?

353
00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.280
I don't know. That was worth the trip over here.
