00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.420
Jamir is training for a
race and is running

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.170
laps around a field.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.430
If the distance around the field
is 300 yards, how many

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:17.930
complete laps would he need to
do to run at least 2 miles?

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.272
So they tell us how far one lap
is, it's 300 yards, but we

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:24.310
need to figure out how many
laps to go 2 miles.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.460
So a good starting point would
be to get everything into the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.190
same units.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.020
We have distance here in terms
of miles, we have it here in

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.130
terms of yards.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.960
So let's just get everything
into yards.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.470
So he needs to run 2 miles.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.450
How do we convert
that to yards?

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.820
Well, I don't have it memorized
how many yards there

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.040
are per mile, but I do have it
memorized how many feet there

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.710
are per mile.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.060
And it's a good thing to have
in the back of your brain

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:55.040
someplace, that in general you
have 5,280 feet per mile.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.930
It's a good number to know.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.740
5,280 feet per mile.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.530
So if we want to convert, we can
first convert the miles to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.050
feet, and then we know that
there are 3 feet per yard, and

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.770
then we'll have 2 miles
in terms of yards.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.930
So 2 miles, if we want it
converted to feet, we want

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.650
miles in the denominator and we
want feet in the numerator.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.450
And the reason why I say that
is so that this miles will

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.850
cancel out with that
miles, and we'll

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.050
just have feet there.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:28.460
And I just wrote down, there's
5,280 feet per mile, or you

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.810
say 5,280 feet for
every 1 mile.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.390
You can write it either
way, but let's just

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.490
write it like that.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.770
And then we can multiply.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.460
So this is going to
give us what?

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.340
If we just multiply the
numbers 2 times 5,280.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.310
So what is that going to be?

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.820
Maybe I should get
a calculator out.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.130
Or we could do that
in our head.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.710
Let's think of it this way:
2 times 80 is 160.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.990
2 times 200 is 400.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.140
So it's going to be 400 plus
160 is going to be 560.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.940
And then 2 times 5,000
thousand is 10,000.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.140
So it's 10,560.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.590
And then the miles cancel
out, and we are

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.020
just left with feet.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.630
And let me actually
multiply it out.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.900
I did it in my head that time,
but that's not always useful.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.350
Let me verify for
you that 5,280

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.080
times 2 is indeed 10,560.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.010
So 2 times 0 is 0.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.400
2 times 8 is 16.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.500
Carry the 1.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.920
2 times 2 is 4, plus 1 is 5.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.840
2 times 5 is 10.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.190
10,560.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.670
So he needs to run
10,560 feet.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.070
Now, we want this in
terms of yards.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.320
So 10,560 feet.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.620
Let's convert this to yards.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.860
Well, we want it in yards.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.300
So we want yards in the
numerator, and we want feet in

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.900
the denominator, so that the
feet cancel out with that feet

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.210
right there.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.185
And we know that there are
3 feet for every 1 yard.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.450
Or another way to read this is
that you have 1/3 of a yard

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.730
for every foot.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.760
And now we can multiply.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.590
And it makes sense.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.330
If you're going from feet to
yards, the number should get

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.720
smaller because yards
is a bigger unit.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.970
You need fewer yards to go the
same distance as a certain

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.730
number of feet.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.770
So it makes sense that
we're dividing.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.740
Same thing: 2 miles is a ton of
feet, so it made sense that

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.760
we were multiplying
by a large number.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.720
Here it makes sense that
we're dividing.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.970
So let's do this.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.900
So this becomes 10,560
times 1 divided by 3.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.670
So it's 10,560/3.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.220
That's that and that part.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.570
And then the feet cancel
out, and we are

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.170
just left with yards.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.760
So 2 miles is 10,560
divided by 3.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.310
And let's figure out
what that is.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.090
So 3 goes into 10,560.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.460
It doesn't go into 1.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.280
It goes into 10 three times.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.140
3 times 3 is 9.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.589
And we subtract.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.630
We get 1.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.910
Bring down this 5.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.209
It becomes a 15.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.190
3 goes into 15 five times.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.380
5 times 3 is 15.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.890
We have no remainder, or 0.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.220
You bring down the 6.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.290
3 goes into 6 two times.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.980
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.740
2 times 3 is 6.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.590
Subtract.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.620
No remainder.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.430
Bring down this last 0.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.000
3 goes into 0 zero times.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.920
0 times 3 is 0.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.150
And we have no remainder.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:05:00.090
So 2 miles is the equivalent
to 3,520 yards.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.150
That's the total distance
he has to travel.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.680
That's the equivalent
of 2 miles.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.770
Now we want to figure out
how many laps there are.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.820
We want this in terms of laps,
not in terms of yards.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.070
So we want the yards
to cancel out.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.590
And we want laps in the
numerator, right?

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.690
Because when you multiply, the
yards will cancel out, and

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.630
we'll just be left with laps.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.910
Now, how many laps are there
per yard or yards per lap?

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.600
Well, they say the distance
around the field is 300 yards.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.530
So we have 300 yards
for every 1 lap.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.900
So now, multiply this
right here.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.400
The yards will cancel out,
and we will get 3,520.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.480
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.460
We will get 3,520, that right
there, times 1/300.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.020
When you multiply it times
1, it just becomes

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.860
3,520 divided by 300.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.550
And in terms of the units,
the yards canceled out.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.430
We're just left with the laps.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.820
So this is how many laps
he needs to run.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.700
So 3,520 divided by 300.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.450
Well, we can eyeball
this right here.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.170
What is 11 times 300?

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.830
Let's just approximate
this right here.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.100
So if we did 11 times
300, what is that

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.580
going to be equal to?

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.700
Well, 11 times 3 is 33, and then
we have two zeroes here.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.270
So this will be 3,300.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.250
So it's a little bit
smaller than that.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.850
If we have 12 times 300, what
is that going to be?

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.110
12 times 3 is 36, and then we
have these two zeroes, so it's

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.490
equal to 3,600.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.680
So this is going to be
11 point something.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.540
It's larger than 11, right?

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.130
3,520 is larger than 3,300.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.140
So when you divide by 300 you're
going to get something

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.740
larger than 11.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.280
But this number right here is
smaller than 3,600 so when you

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.110
divide it by 300, you're going
to get something a little bit

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.420
smaller than 12.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.800
So the exact number of laps is
going to be a little bit lower

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.570
than 12 laps.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.620
So 2 miles is a little bit
lower than 12 laps.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.820
But let's make sure we're
answering their question.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.170
How many complete laps would
he need to do to

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.560
run at least 2 miles?

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.190
So they're telling us that,
look, this might be, 11 point

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.870
something, something,
something laps.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.930
That would be the exact number
of laps to run 2 miles.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.170
But they say how many complete
laps does he have to run?

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.240
11 complete laps would
not be enough.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.820
He would have to run 12.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:41.470
So our answer here is
12 complete laps.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.980
That complete tells us
that they want a

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.310
whole number of laps.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.730
We can't just divide this.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.690
If we divide this, we're going
to get some 11 point

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.310
something, something.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.420
You can do with the calculator
or do it by hand if you're

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.070
interested.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.720
But we have to do at least 12
because that's the smallest

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.280
whole number of laps that will
get us to at least this

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.020
distance right here, or this
number of laps, or the

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.400
equivalent of 2 miles.
