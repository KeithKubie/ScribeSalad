00:00:00.414 --> 00:00:02.823
Hey Vsauce, Michael here today
with a very special video.

00:00:02.823 --> 00:00:06.183
I am joined today via Skype
with two members of Underbelly.

00:00:06.183 --> 00:00:08.153
They're in New Jersey;
I'm in New York.

00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:11.593
We're bridging the Hudson
with knowledge and information.

00:00:11.593 --> 00:00:12.773
Today they're going to school me on Pokémon.

00:00:12.773 --> 00:00:15.353
I'm Jiggly Puff. My name's Justin.

00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:18.173
This is Pollywhirl, but my name is Shawn.

00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:21.383
Right here I put together
if you guys remember the Pokedex

00:00:21.383 --> 00:00:24.623
from the original anime and the videogame.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:27.399
I came together and wrote the grimmest,

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.869
scariest Pokedex entries I could find.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.139
The Pokémon, or Pocket Monsters,

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:34.339
they're basically these animals that you capture
with the Pokeballs

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.779
and you keep them on you.
That's why they're called Pocket Monsters.

00:00:37.254 --> 00:00:39.129
Yeah, exactly,
except doesn't Pocket Monster

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.609
already sound way too inappropriate
for children?

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.959
- That's pretty darn scary.
- So right off the bat,

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:48.239
they're starting on a foundation of terror
and inappropriateness.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.349
Hey Michael, is that a monster in your pocket,

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:52.199
or are you just happy to see us?

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.559
- It's actually both.
- Oh!

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.809
But anyway, this is Hypno.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.879
It carries a pendulum-like device.

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.069
There once was an incident
in which it took away a child it hypnotized.

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.599
I'm really glad I didn't watch this show
so much as a kid.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:09.299
- I'd be more mess up than I am now.
- Yeah, all this stuff is in the game.

00:01:09.972 --> 00:01:11.619
Well, do we know
what happened to the kid,

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.679
or is it just this mysterious thing
in the Pokedex?

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.399
I'm going to say the child was eaten.
This one's even worse.

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.539
It's Haunter.
By licking, it saps the victim's life.

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.249
It causes shaking that won't stop
until the victim's demise.

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:27.379
I had a girlfriend like that once.

00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:32.089
Drifloon, which is basically a giant
hot air balloon kind of guy

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:33.569
if that makes sense.

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.339
It tugs on the hands of children
to steal them away.

00:01:36.858 --> 00:01:38.929
However, it gets pulled around instead.

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.029
So this Pokémon which looks like a balloon,
like a child's balloon,

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:45.899
parents think that the children
are just playing with a balloon,

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.839
but actually this Pokémon's
trying to steal them away,

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:49.449
kid nap the child.

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:51.919
But they're so light weight, they're just
getting pulled around like a balloon.

00:01:52.647 --> 00:01:54.609
- Oh.
- Yeah.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:57.919
These are some of the scariest things.
I don't even know if I can sleep tonight.

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.154
Spoink bounces around on its tail.

00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:02.724
The shock of its bouncing
makes its heart pump.

00:02:02.724 --> 00:02:05.704
As a result this Pokémon
cannot afford to stop bouncing.

00:02:05.704 --> 00:02:08.513
If it stops, its heart will stop.

00:02:08.513 --> 00:02:11.903
So it's like Tigger with a heart condition?

00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:16.263
I like that. Well, it's really nice.
Just keep moving kids.

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:21.253
Oh yeah, right. It's a lesson
in good exercise habits.

00:02:21.253 --> 00:02:24.243
- That's true.
- Did you guys see this thing

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:27.913
about how Pikachu, over the years,
has lost weight and gotten more fit?

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:29.753
Yeah, they thinned him up.
Kind of like Garfield

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:33.183
when he started out really big and then
they kept drawing him smaller.

00:02:33.183 --> 00:02:36.193
Even though he was this giant fat cat,
he really wasn't.

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:40.574
Kabutops, which is kind of like
this guy with big claws.

00:02:40.574 --> 00:02:44.074
With sharps claws, this ferocious
ancient Pokemon

00:02:44.074 --> 00:02:48.044
rips apart prey and sucks their body fluids.

00:02:48.044 --> 00:02:50.764
Sucks their body fluids?

00:02:50.764 --> 00:02:52.584
Their body fluids, not bodily—

00:02:52.584 --> 00:02:55.594
- Oh, I see what you did there.
- So not just blood but everything?

00:02:55.594 --> 00:02:56.894
- Everything.
- Yeah.

00:02:56.894 --> 00:02:58.904
Even some of those mysterious fluids

00:02:58.904 --> 00:03:01.934
that even I can't explain some mornings?
- Absolutely.

00:03:01.934 --> 00:03:04.904
There's a Pokémon called Cubone.
It basically has a skull on its head.

00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:09.204
Cubone wears the skull
of its deceased mother.

00:03:09.204 --> 00:03:12.234
Its cries echo inside the skull

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:14.714
and come out as a sad melody.

00:03:14.714 --> 00:03:16.724
And it's also fashionable.

00:03:16.724 --> 00:03:18.454
That's true.

00:03:18.454 --> 00:03:21.154
OK, guys, tell me where can I
find out more about Pokémon?

00:03:21.653 --> 00:03:24.514
If you want to find out more about Pokémon,
we have a Pokémon public service announcement

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:26.324
on our channel right now,

00:03:26.324 --> 00:03:29.554
and we actually went into the studio—
Michael was there.

00:03:29.554 --> 00:03:33.314
We brought in the voice actor
who played Professor Oak on the anime

00:03:33.314 --> 00:03:35.624
to voice our Pokémon public service announcement

00:03:35.624 --> 00:03:37.624
on tall grass, the dangers of going into tall grass.

00:03:37.624 --> 00:03:39.054
It's on our channel right now.

00:03:39.054 --> 00:03:42.444
And we've got all sorts of other things
out there in terms of video games.

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:44.754
It's Sonic, we're talking about Metal Gear,

00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:46.644
we're talking about 3D movies.

00:03:46.644 --> 00:03:47.984
I want to stop you there.
Speaking of 3D movies,

00:03:47.984 --> 00:03:49.864
look what I've got here.

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:56.584
It is a pack of Jaws 3D trading cards
from 1983.

00:03:56.584 --> 00:03:58.174
- Sweet.
- And you know what's in here?

00:03:58.174 --> 00:04:00.734
- No.
- Chewing gum. I'm going to eat it right now.

00:04:02.418 --> 00:04:04.077
- Do you think you should—
- No, no.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.627
This video is supposed to be grim,
not a vomitfest.

00:04:06.627 --> 00:04:10.337
This gum is older than me.

00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:11.887
- Let me see the cards.
- OK.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.847
Here's the gum.
I'm going to eat it.

00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:18.437
Sweet.

00:04:18.437 --> 00:04:20.917
- Wait. Did you just eat it?
- Yeah.

00:04:22.548 --> 00:04:25.537
- It's from like 1985.
- I put something in my mouth

00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:28.627
that's older than me. 1983.

00:04:28.627 --> 00:04:30.017
- Oh. 19—oh.

00:04:30.017 --> 00:04:32.387
That should be your new show motto.

00:04:33.557 --> 00:04:35.557
"We put things in out mouth
that are older than us."

00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:38.607
So as the guys put their masks back on,

00:04:38.607 --> 00:04:41.567
I'm going to have a little bit of coffee
from my Sun Your Buns mug

00:04:41.567 --> 00:04:44.387
and subscribe to Vsauce,
subscribe to Underbelly

00:04:44.387 --> 00:04:47.207
for more knowledge, and as always,
thanks for watching.

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.153
So Justin, is that gum holding together?
Is it just normal gum?

00:04:58.153 --> 00:05:00.313
I'm going to go to the hospital
in like ten minutes.

00:05:00.313 --> 00:05:02.263
- Yeah.
- Oh, one piece dropped off.

00:05:02.263 --> 00:05:05.263
No.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.643
It tastes like school chalk.
