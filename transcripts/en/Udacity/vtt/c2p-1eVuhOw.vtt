00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.220
So now that we introduced an additional criterion,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.290
let's have a quiz to see whether everybody

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.410
understood the concept of subsumption. We know that

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.490
branch coverage subsumes statement coverage, but what about condition

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.230
coverage? Does it subsume branch coverage? Is it

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.720
the case that all of the test which

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.980
satisfy condition coverage will also satisfy branch coverage?

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.160
Think about it, and answer either yes or no.
