00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.080
&gt;&gt; Here's your first quiz question. In a world

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.110
where A can go left or right and B can

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.860
go left or right. What are the values that you

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.500
would put in the cells of this matrix? Again, this

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.740
is zero sum. So, these values are from A's

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.690
point of view and implicitly, there's we know what the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.670
values are for B. So, we're just looking for the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.240
values from A. Okay? Do you understand the quiz, Michael?

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.940
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.670
&gt;&gt; Okay, so go.
