MICHAEL SHAYAN: We are going

[MUSIC - CAST OF "THE BAND'S
 VISIT," "WELCOME TO NOWHERE"]

00:02:45.614 --> 00:02:49.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:51.830
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
Thank you so much.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.955
Let's give it another hand.

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:57.003
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:59.212 --> 00:02:59.920
That was amazing.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.630
So before we jump in,
for those who don't know,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.460
please tell us a little
bit about the show,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.280
"The Band's Visit."

00:03:10.937 --> 00:03:12.020
ITAMAR MOSES: Yeah, I'll--

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.220
OK.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.740
So "The Band's Visit," which
is based on an Israeli film

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.410
from about 10 years
ago, of the same name,

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.409
is the story of an Egyptian
police orchestra that comes

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.575
to Israel to give a concert.

00:03:23.575 --> 00:03:28.120
But due to miscommunication
at the bus station,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.160
instead of going to
the city of Petah Tikva

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.660
that they're supposed
to go to, they

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.780
end up in a tiny
village in the middle

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.390
of nowhere with a similar name.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.950
And there's no
more transportation

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.230
for the rest of the night,
so they're stranded there

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.940
and they get taken
in by the locals.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.330
And the story is just
about what happens

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.920
over the course
of that one night.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.760
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Great.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.320
So it started as a film.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.000
What made you guys want to
adapt this into a musical?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.450
What was that process like?

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.270
DAVID YAZBEK: Well,
it was presented to us

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.910
by our producer,
Orin Wolf, who had

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.607
the kind of daunting
and maybe insane idea

00:04:07.607 --> 00:04:09.190
that the movie could
become a musical.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.900
And it took a while
to sort of see that.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.980
And then it just--

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.750
for me, at least, it clicked.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.910
Oh, this could really
be interesting.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.450
And then we were off
to the races slowly.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.010
DAVID CROMER: Orin was
saying it-- is this on?

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.310
DAVID YAZBEK: Yeah.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.820
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.400
DAVID CROMER: Orin was saying--

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.160
Orin Wolf, again, our lead
producer had had this idea,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.542
and went around to a
lot of people saying,

00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:35.000
I want to make this
into a musical.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.086
And people kept saying,
oh, I don't see it.

00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:37.710
I don't see it.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.334
I don't see it.

00:04:38.334 --> 00:04:40.490
And usually, if three people
tell you you're drunk,

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.570
you should lie down.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.760
But he didn't do that.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.270
And he kept-- and he went--

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.040
and so he eventually
found writers

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.630
who saw it, who could see
it, and had an idea for it.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.470
And it's just-- it's sort of
proof that a lot of things

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.480
might not immediately
seem like a good idea,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.920
but it's about what you see in
it, and it is about execution.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.230
You know, any idea's workable--

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.280
DAVID YAZBEK: Not killing
someone type of execution.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.420
DAVID CROMER: Yeah.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.210
DAVID YAZBEK: But
doing something.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.720
DAVID CROMER: Well, just
the execution of an idea.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.660
I thought that was--

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.220
I mean, I came in
relatively late,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.680
so I'm speaking about
what transpired before.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.832
But from the
outside, it appears--

00:05:17.832 --> 00:05:19.290
this is the composer,
David Yazbek.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.581
DAVID YAZBEK: I'm the composer.

00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:21.990
This is the writer,
Itamar Moses,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.073
and this is the director--

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:23.540
DAVID CROMER: And
I'm the director.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.748
DAVID YAZBEK: --David Cromer.

00:05:24.748 --> 00:05:25.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:26.720
DAVID CROMER: And so, yeah.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.280
So I just wanted
to make that point

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.270
that it seemed like it did
not immediately adapt itself

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.770
to a musical, and
these guys managed

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.876
to find a really beautiful way
to adapt it into a musical.

00:05:37.876 --> 00:05:38.750
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.500
Let's talk a little
bit about that vision.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.590
So when you were--
did you feel like you

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.040
had to stay true to the
film when you were writing

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.675
the book and the music?

00:05:47.675 --> 00:05:50.420
ITAMAR MOSES: I
mean, yes and no.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.750
Sometimes when something is
being adapted from source

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.120
material, if it's source
material that everybody knows--

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.174
some sort of beloved,
hugely famous movie--

00:05:58.174 --> 00:05:59.840
then there's fan
service you have to do.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.880
We didn't have to worry
about it in that sense

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.900
because the movie was sort of
an art house cult niche hit.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.360
Except in Israel, where
it's one of the biggest

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.889
hits of all time.

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.930
But everywhere else, it's
sort of like, oh, yeah,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.946
I heard about that movie.

00:06:13.946 --> 00:06:16.070
So we didn't have to stay
true to it in that sense.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.980
It was just because
we loved the spirit

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.400
of the movie and
the tone it created

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.920
and the characters
and the story.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.615
So we did want to
stay true to it.

00:06:29.615 --> 00:06:30.990
There are things
you have-- there

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.040
are things you have to take into
account when you move from film

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.760
to stage.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.770
You rely more on dialogue than
on images, stuff like that.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.965
But we always wanted to--

00:06:39.965 --> 00:06:41.840
we didn't want to do
one of those adaptations

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.339
where it was like,
well, why did you

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.230
even use that source material?

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.640
You know, it's sort of--

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.420
we wanted to see if we could
take the sort of flickering

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.350
candle flame of
this delicate story

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.500
and transfer it to this other
medium without it going out.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.840
So yeah, we wanted to, but
in a very non-cynical way.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.520
We felt bound to
the source material.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.160
DAVID CROMER: And I was always
happy to reference to the film.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.510
I never ran from it,
like, well, we've

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.900
got to do something
different than the film.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.000
I never, ever felt that.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.330
I wanted to-- it was a fantas--
it was a very rich vein

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.139
to draw from.

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.680
MICHAEL SHAYAN: I would love to
speak with the cast and see--

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.300
had any of you have
seen the film prior to--

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.337
yeah?

00:07:23.337 --> 00:07:24.170
Did you look to it--

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.880
I mean, I can imagine
that you would

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.980
want to create your
own interpretation

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.710
of the characters, so
what's that balance?

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.980
How do you approach that?

00:07:35.244 --> 00:07:36.327
JONATHAN RAVIV: All right.

00:07:36.327 --> 00:07:37.776
I'll go.

00:07:37.776 --> 00:07:41.090
So what's lovely
for me is my parents

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.940
are actually Israeli, so I
was familiar with the film.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.340
As Itamar said, it's
very popular in Israel.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.250
And my character
specifically was actually

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.900
more developed in this.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:08:00.470
I play Sammy, who has an affair
with Katrina's character, Dina.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.600
And that was
fleshed out more, so

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.662
that was exciting to
be able to do something

00:08:05.662 --> 00:08:07.370
with a character that
wasn't fleshed out.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.600
But to answer your question,
I mean, yes, the film

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.310
was really helpful to
watch and to take from,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.764
as Cromer suggested.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:19.930
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah, great.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.390
David, a question for you.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.940
When you were writing
the music, how

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.370
do you figure out what
songs you want to write,

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.395
where they're going to go?

00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:32.110
You obviously are
working with Itamar here,

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.240
but what's that process like?

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.289
And how do you--

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:36.490
I mean, I watched the film.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.409
I'm like, where's
the music, you know?

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.350
What's your process
for figuring that out?

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.470
DAVID YAZBEK: Well, it's
different for every show.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:49.060
This was my fourth show
that actually got completed.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:54.610
With this one, there
was a full script

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.587
that Itamar had
adapted from the movie,

00:08:58.587 --> 00:08:59.920
and I had only written one song.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.260
This was when we did
our first reading.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.280
After that script was done,
songs suggested themselves

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.890
from the story in the
script, some of the lines

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.390
in the script.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:12.950
Itamar and I did
a lot of talking

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:21.080
about what should be sung and
not sung, and a year later,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.954
changed 50% of that.

00:09:23.954 --> 00:09:25.370
That doesn't work,
this does work.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.700
Let's do this instead.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.550
You're reaching to
grab the mic from me?

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.107
ITAMAR MOSES: Yeah,
but it just seems

00:09:31.107 --> 00:09:32.690
like so much more
of a hostile gesture

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.960
than I meant it, just because
there's microphone scarcity.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.340
Yeah, no, a verb
that we use a lot--

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.810
--a verb that we use a lot
to describe that process

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.340
is cannibalize.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.740
You create-- the book writer
creates script material,

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.220
and then you want it to
suggest songs in such a way

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.970
that a composer can cannibalize
dialogue or monologues,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.430
or just story moments.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.110
DAVID YAZBEK: So
sometimes, I will say, oh,

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.580
that scene could become
a song, or that section

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.360
can become a song.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.414
And other times, I'll say--

00:10:08.414 --> 00:10:09.830
if there's nothing
to cannibalize,

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.830
but there's an idea for a
song, a lot of the time,

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:13.950
I'll say to--

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.040
I said to Itamar,
could you write

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.360
me something to cannibalize?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.040
Literally, a monologue or
a little scene or something

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.540
like that.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.420
Or just have long conversations
which were probably very

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.810
frustrating for him, where I
would just be, yeah, but what--

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:30.740
but why should they--

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.210
why would you want-- why?

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.190
And then maybe one sentence--

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.060
ITAMAR MOSES: My phone
would just be on speaker

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.180
and I'd be like, uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:36.560
DAVID YAZBEK: Yeah.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.860
Yeah, he'd be frying an egg.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.985
And one sentence would come out
and I'd be like, oh, I see now.

00:10:41.985 --> 00:10:43.610
ITAMAR MOSES: It's
interesting actually

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.450
because a lot of times--

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.650
and I've worked on a
couple of musicals also.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:53.180
This movie and the script
for the movie is very spare,

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:53.890
and a lot is--

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.720
there's very little-- I think
my first draft of the adaptation

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.034
was literally, I want to
say, 23 or 24 pages long.

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.450
If you actually put all the
dialogue in the film in order,

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.830
there's not much of it.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.130
And so what that
means-- one thing

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.880
that means is that a lot
of things are left unsaid,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.500
which is great, but it doesn't
give a lot for the composer

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.330
to springboard off of.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.069
So in another kind of a
script, there might already

00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:23.360
be a very explicit monologue,
where the character talks

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.818
about exactly what
they're feeling,

00:11:24.818 --> 00:11:26.750
and the composer turns
that into a song.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.332
In "Band's Visit,"
in my first draft,

00:11:28.332 --> 00:11:30.290
those speeches weren't
there because that's not

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.620
how these people talk, and
not the tone of this piece.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.530
DAVID YAZBEK: And that was
great for me, as a songwriter,

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:41.540
because the songs in this
show, a lot of them, are--

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.240
they don't feel like
they're assignments

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.540
imposed by a script, you know?

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.640
They come out of
character and they

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.800
come from a very deep
place because of that.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.200
So I'm able to sort of--

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.170
we'll talk about, what
does this character like?

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.010
What is he thinking?

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.990
The movie gives us hints.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:04.070
And I can actually write from
the heart in a much deeper way

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.590
than I've been able
to in other shows.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.195
So I enjoyed the process.

00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:10.070
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.611
I mean, the music
is really beautiful

00:12:11.611 --> 00:12:16.400
and there are, obviously,
Arabic undertones,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.400
Israeli, Egyptian undertones.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.009
Had you had experiences
with Arabic music before?

00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.800
DAVID YAZBEK: Yeah.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.500
There's a story
that, now that we're

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.560
in publicity mode for the
show, I've told a lot.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.350
But I like telling it.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:35.120
My tastes in music are very
eclectic and always have been.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.220
And my father is
Lebanese-American,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.440
first generation.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.150
But never-- you know, we had
"Kiss Me Kate" and "The Music

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.995
Man," you know?

00:12:46.995 --> 00:12:52.130
Our album collection was that
and classical stuff, basically.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.740
But he took me to Lebanon
to visit his father

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.270
when I was about seven.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.670
We were in the taxi
from the airport.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:03.800
The taxi driver had
music on the radio.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.004
And I have a sense memory of it.

00:13:06.004 --> 00:13:06.920
The windows were open.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.640
It was hot air
blasting in, and there

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.530
was this music on the radio.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.520
And I asked my father to ask
the cab driver in Arabic what

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.420
was playing.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.870
It turns out, it
was Umm Kulthum,

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.260
who's mentioned in a song
as sort of a central--

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.500
who was the Frank Sinatra of--

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.030
she was more
popular than Sinatra

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.840
at the time, Middle
Eastern singer.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.570
And the way the orchestra
sounded and this--

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.440
I didn't know it at the time,
but these weird microtones,

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.270
and the way she was singing.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.840
And it all was very--

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.600
made a big impression on me.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.752
So since then, I've
been open to it.

00:13:46.752 --> 00:13:48.710
I've been to a lot of
different kinds of music.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:53.240
Pretty much everything except
Peking opera, let's say.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.520
There's always something
that you just can't get.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.500
But it--

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.790
ITAMAR MOSES: You should
challenge yourself and make

00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.330
that your next project.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:13:59.870
DAVID YAZBEK: Well, I did.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.030
I went-- I was trying
to write a Bruce Lee

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.130
musical a few years ago.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.710
But-- no, I really was.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.125
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:10.000
ITAMAR MOSES: Everyone's
like, is that a bit?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.820
DAVID YAZBEK: No, it's
not a-- this isn't a bit.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.520
But anyway, so I was open to it.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.790
And then in the '80s, there
was kind of this world music,

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.021
this flourishing of
world music that--

00:14:22.021 --> 00:14:23.770
I guess the record
companies thought there

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:24.860
was a dollar to be made here.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.810
And a lot of that came from
Northern Africa or the Middle

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:27.310
East.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.860
And I sort of dove back into it.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.270
There's your answer.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:31.810
Thank you.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:31.930
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Thank you.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.178
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.470
I would love to
hear from the cast.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:40.180
Obviously, there's a very
diverse cast on stage with us.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.660
And I will ask you some
questions about representation,

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.920
because I think that's a really
important thing that the show

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.830
is bringing to Broadway.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.430
How did you all prepare for
your roles and prepare to--

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.980
I mean, you're obviously
speaking in accents, many

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.880
of you, that are not your own.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.810
You're working with a coach.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.310
What was the research
process like?

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:08.210
And then, how did you
get into those roles?

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.580
DAVID CROMER: Everyone's
answer is very different.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.570
SHARONE SAYEGH: Yeah.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.940
So like Jonathan, my
family is also Israeli

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.899
and I grew up speaking
Hebrew at home.

00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:17.690
And I also grew up
speaking a little Arabic

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.520
because my family
is Iraqi-Israeli.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.370
So firstly, when I
found out about this,

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.280
I was so excited because I
had never even auditioned

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.620
for an Israeli
musical, you know?

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.520
So I prepared a song in Hebrew,
which I was so excited to do,

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.730
for my audition.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.560
And specifically with my
character, I'm not this girl,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.580
but I very much know who
this girl in Israel is.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.632
And so I feel like
I've been doing

00:15:42.632 --> 00:15:44.840
the research for this girl
pretty much my whole life,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.830
I guess.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.520
But you know, I kind of
just tapped into my parents

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.580
accents, to be honest,
and my cousins' accents.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.950
And that's how I prepared
for the audition.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:55.450
Yeah.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.033
DAVID CROMER: If I
could just toss in,

00:15:57.033 --> 00:15:59.570
the show is interesting
in that, like in the film,

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.510
the Israelis tend
to speak Hebrew.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.870
The Egyptians speak Arabic.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.150
And then they all
communicate with each other,

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.277
struggling in English, which
is not anyone's first language.

00:16:08.277 --> 00:16:09.860
So it's all sort of
strangled English.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.457
You had pointed
out, at one point--

00:16:11.457 --> 00:16:13.040
you realized at one
point during tech,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.360
I speak no English in this show.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.210
I speak entirely Hebrew.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:15.590
SHARONE SAYEGH: Right.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.340
Which I actually didn't
realize until Bill

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.417
pointed it out to me.

00:16:18.417 --> 00:16:20.500
And I was like, oh, all
of my lines are in Hebrew.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.490
That's crazy.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:27.200
But it's very cool that I didn't
even realize that, actually.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.470
MICHAEL SHAYAN: George,
you are a violinist

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.770
and you play classical
Arabic music.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:33.650
GEORGE ABUD: Yeah.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.170
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
Tell me about that.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.530
GEORGE ABUD: Well, I grew
up playing with my family.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.170
We're all musicians
in my family.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.027
And I'm Lebanese, like Yazbek.

00:16:45.027 --> 00:16:46.460
Yay!

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.150
And we all played Arabic
music together growing up,

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.840
and it was--

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.780
we played for weddings and
parties and family events.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.939
And I have two older
brothers who also play,

00:16:55.939 --> 00:16:57.980
and we were kind of like
a little traveling band.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.290
And so when I saw about this--

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.870
and now I'm an
actor in the city.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.069
And when I saw about this
musical, about an Arabic band,

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.940
my head exploded.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.319
I was like, what the
hell are they going

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.250
to do about an Arabic band?

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.791
That thing's going
to close in a day.

00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:10.819
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.660
Proved me wrong.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.270
So I was like, I
got to get in that.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:19.579
And then just being part of this
group, where a lot of people

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.950
play and we get to
play music together,

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.805
and it comes out
of this man's mind.

00:17:23.805 --> 00:17:26.180
And to sidetrack-- because I
don't know what the hell I'm

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.346
saying about myself anymore.

00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:28.612
I'll just talk about Yazbek.

00:17:28.612 --> 00:17:30.070
DAVID YAZBEK: Always
a good policy.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.606
GEORGE ABUD: Yeah, I think so.

00:17:30.606 --> 00:17:31.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.812
What's wonderful about
Yazbek and his music

00:17:33.812 --> 00:17:35.270
is, now that I'm
thinking about it,

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.290
I think he really approaches
his composition like an actor.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.450
He's not just trying--

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.059
for this show,
it's not like, oh,

00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:44.600
did you listen to Arabic music
and then write an Arabic song?

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.183
It's like, he didn't just try
to write Arabic music or Klezmer

00:17:47.183 --> 00:17:47.810
music.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.200
These are all parts of his
eclectic taste and his history,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.840
and the rich experiences
that make him a very

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.090
unique and diverse individual.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.740
And through that,
I think he just

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.240
tried to become
these characters,

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.855
and what are they going to say?

00:18:02.855 --> 00:18:04.730
And then, how are they
going to talk and then

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:05.910
what's their circumstances?

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.930
And that's layered into
Arabic music coming out

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.890
or Arabic instrumentation coming
out, or Klezmer type stuff,

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.990
or a certain instrumentation
for a certain song.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.834
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.429
He's a wonderful guy and I
respect no one on this stage

00:18:21.429 --> 00:18:22.720
as much-- no, I'm just kidding.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.377
MICHAEL SHAYAN: You guys--

00:18:26.377 --> 00:18:27.710
GEORGE ABUD: But it's very true.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.624
He didn't-- because people are
like, oh, is the score Arabic?

00:18:30.624 --> 00:18:32.040
I'm like, the score
is not Arabic,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.570
but it's Yazbek and the
Arabic that he knows,

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.670
and the music that
he's opened himself

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.570
up to translated through him.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.040
And that's what makes it
a really awesome musical,

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.241
and not just trying to
copy an Umm Kulthum concert

00:18:46.241 --> 00:18:47.240
and putting it on stage.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.500
And then we're like, oh,
what's the show about?

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.210
Well, we just put some Umm
Kulthum songs together.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.450
It's like, that's
not interesting.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.408
It's interesting because
it's this man's score,

00:18:53.408 --> 00:18:54.658
and that's why it's authentic.

00:18:54.658 --> 00:18:55.491
DAVID CROMER: Right.

00:18:55.491 --> 00:18:56.750
One of the things the show--

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.333
one of the themes
this show deals with

00:18:58.333 --> 00:19:01.850
is how people can relate
through music, and how you can,

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.740
if you're stuck for
something to talk about,

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.270
music might be a
good conversation,

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.200
or listening to music
or talking about things.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.460
And the film touches on this.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.080
And then Itamar and Yazbek
really expanded on this.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:19.250
That in the show, they play
old American pop songs.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.690
They sing Gershwin.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.140
They sing-- you know,
the people are listening

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.700
to-- there's the Klezmer music.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:30.104
So it's music that people
have-- that everyone has heard.

00:19:30.104 --> 00:19:30.770
Does that make--

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.978
I'm not explaining that well.

00:19:31.978 --> 00:19:36.320
But there's influences
from all kinds of music

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.487
because this is a
generation of people

00:19:38.487 --> 00:19:40.820
who have managed to hear
little bits and pieces of music

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.380
from all over the world.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.747
So it's about a lot of things.

00:19:44.747 --> 00:19:46.580
DAVID YAZBEK: What are
the other songs we're

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.630
going to be performing today?

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:49.880
MICHAEL SHAYAN: "Umm Kulthum."

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.780
DAVID YAZBEK: And
what's the other one?

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:51.560
Oh, and "Answer Me."

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.220
MICHAEL SHAYAN: And "Answer Me."

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.230
Yeah.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.563
DAVID YAZBEK: I just wanted
to know, for segue purposes.

00:19:55.563 --> 00:19:56.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.430
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Smooth segues.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.791
And here's one right now.

00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:00.290
Katrina.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.750
So we talk a lot
about Umm Kulthum.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.170
Katrina, did you know
about Umm Kulthum

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.900
and was that part of
your research process?

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.420
KATRINA LENK: I had not
heard of Umm Kulthum before.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.970
And of course, one must know.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.270
So I thank God for the internet.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.055
There's a lot of
stuff you can find.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:23.180
DAVID CROMER: Did you use--

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.600
KATRINA LENK: There's a lot of
things you don't want to find.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.370
But I used--

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.990
DAVID CROMER: Did
you use Google?

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.281
What search engine did you use?

00:20:27.281 --> 00:20:28.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:30.770
KATRINA LENK: So I
have Google to thank

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:35.519
for my knowledge of Umm Kulthum.

00:20:35.519 --> 00:20:37.685
MICHAEL SHAYAN: David, can
you give her another $20?

00:20:37.685 --> 00:20:40.342
KATRINA LENK: Hey, I think you
guys should maybe give me $20?

00:20:40.342 --> 00:20:42.008
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Sergei
can give her $20.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:46.320
KATRINA LENK: But she--

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.960
and what am I saying?

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.710
So yes, there's recordings
available on the internet.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.990
But also, I learned things from
George Abud, who, like he said,

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.910
is really familiar
with Arabic music,

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.580
and helped me understand
what I was hearing.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.570
Because it's such a different
way of expressing musicality

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:09.140
than what we do in our Western--
and even in classical music,

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.820
what we consider
classical music.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.360
So that was really a
fascinating thing to learn,

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.450
and I'm still learning
about all of the differences

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:21.455
of Umm Kulthum's music.

00:21:21.455 --> 00:21:22.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.060
MICHAEL SHAYAN: And
you're actually,

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.893
I mean, in your last
show, "Indecent," which

00:21:26.893 --> 00:21:28.550
was on Broadway recently--

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:29.050
yes.

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.290
You were incredible.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.734
You were playing violin.

00:21:35.734 --> 00:21:36.942
KATRINA LENK: It was a viola.

00:21:36.942 --> 00:21:37.942
MICHAEL SHAYAN: A viola.

00:21:37.942 --> 00:21:40.130
I'm sorry.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.640
I'm sure that would kind
of help you as you're, I

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.890
mean, preparing for this role.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:48.080
And you guys actually did a song
recently together for Artists

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.080
For Peace.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:49.830
KATRINA LENK: Yes.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.900
MICHAEL SHAYAN: For world peace.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:51.399
Yes.

00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:53.470
And you played and
you sang beautifully.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.470
KATRINA LENK: Thank you.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.303
MICHAEL SHAYAN: And how
did that come about?

00:21:56.303 --> 00:21:57.620
KATRINA LENK: Well, George--

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:57.890
GEORGE ABUD: Well, it--

00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:58.556
KATRINA LENK: Well, Sharone--

00:21:58.556 --> 00:21:59.535
GEORGE ABUD: Well,
Sharone-- well.

00:21:59.535 --> 00:22:00.326
KATRINA LENK: Well.

00:22:00.326 --> 00:22:01.169
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.156
GEORGE ABUD: Sharone,
talk about the wonderful--

00:22:05.156 --> 00:22:05.947
SHARONE SAYEGH: OK.

00:22:05.947 --> 00:22:09.960
So I love this charity called
Artists for World Peace.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.760
They're wonderful.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.280
And I've been producing a
Broadway charity event for them

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.170
every year, and this
was our seventh year.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.155
And last year was
our first time we

00:22:17.155 --> 00:22:18.780
had some performers
from Broadway shows

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.940
sing in other languages.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.590
And I was like, oh, this is so
great because it's world peace.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.690
So this year, I
asked a lot of people

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.250
from "The Band's
Visit" to perform,

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.020
and George and Katrina said
they wanted to sing something

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:27.690
together in Arabic.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.939
And I said that would be
wonderful, that'd be perfect.

00:22:29.939 --> 00:22:30.710
So they did.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:31.460
GEORGE ABUD: Yeah.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:36.650
So we kind of joined forces
on this and really wanted to--

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:38.960
and I listen to lots and
lots of Arabic music.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.820
That's kind of all I
listen to-- and jazz.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:41.984
But I was listening--

00:22:41.984 --> 00:22:43.400
I heard this song,
where it's just

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.910
oud, which is the
predecessor of the guitar.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.960
It's the lute-like instrument.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.782
And it was just the
composer playing the oud,

00:22:50.782 --> 00:22:53.240
and he was teaching the singer
the songs, so they were kind

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.620
of just noodling through it.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.240
And I thought that was a
lovely little back-and-forth,

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.209
so I thought this would be
a good one to teach Katrina.

00:23:00.209 --> 00:23:02.750
We learned it together because
I didn't know the song either.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.666
DAVID YAZBEK: You'll be
doing yourself a favor

00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:08.840
to go on YouTube and look up
Katrina Lenk and George Abud

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.530
and WHAB--

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.750
W-H-A-B-- and you'll
get that link.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.360
And I've watched it
now eight or 10 times.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.110
It's so gorgeous.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.010
MICHAEL SHAYAN: It really is.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:17.426
DAVID YAZBEK: And
it has nothing--

00:23:17.426 --> 00:23:18.470
I didn't write the song.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:21.760
I mean, it's like
this combination--

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.420
I call it a talent avalanche.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.760
It's just, you could
watch it a million times.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.980
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Now they're
going to pass you $20.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:27.830
DAVID YAZBEK: I
would like that $20.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:28.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:29.702 --> 00:23:31.910
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Katrina
actually has a beautiful song

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.510
in the show about Umm
Kulthum and we are

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.610
going to hear it in a minute.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.110
DAVID CROMER: Well,
I was just going

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:45.980
to say that at sort of the
center point of the show, one

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.320
of the-- the Egyptian
band leader character

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.519
and Katrina's character,
who's an Israeli cafe owner

00:23:50.519 --> 00:23:52.310
are having kind of an
awkward conversation,

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.780
and trying to find their
way to conversation.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.730
And like in many
conversations in this show,

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:59.120
they're able to find their
way to it by he accidentally

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.020
mentions that he plays
classical Arab music.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.960
And she says, oh,
like Umm Kulthum?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.040
And he says, oh, yeah.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.370
And she goes, oh, I love that.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.580
And he says, no, come on.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.480
You don't-- he says
you're being polite.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.530
Don't-- you know, and she--

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.160
it actually accessed
something in her life

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.230
that she cared about
very, very deeply

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.290
and hadn't probably talked about
in a while-- hadn't had anyone

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.030
to talk about it within a while.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.700
And then this, I think,
this very beautiful song

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.644
comes out of it.

00:24:23.644 --> 00:24:24.560
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Great.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.330
DAVID CROMER: But
that's the context.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.705
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
So please give it

00:24:27.705 --> 00:24:30.890
up for Katrina Lenk, singing
"Umm Kulthum and Omar Sharif."

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.882
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:32.882 --> 00:24:39.854
[MUSIC - KATRINA LENK, "UMM
 KULTHUM AND OMAR SHARIF"]

00:27:43.278 --> 00:27:48.734
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.450
That was beautiful, and that
is one of my favorite songs

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.560
in the show.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.720
And before, we were
talking a little bit,

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.120
I learned that it
was actually cut.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.879
It was cut in an
earlier iteration.

00:28:07.879 --> 00:28:08.670
Tell me about that.

00:28:10.754 --> 00:28:13.170
DAVID YAZBEK: I don't know
what the fuck we were thinking.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:14.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:16.517 --> 00:28:17.100
You know what?

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.817
You have a better
memory than me.

00:28:18.817 --> 00:28:19.650
And you'll be funny.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.072
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:22.019 --> 00:28:23.727
ITAMAR MOSES: I begged
him not to cut it.

00:28:23.727 --> 00:28:25.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.590
No, musicals are very
difficult. And one

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.060
of the reasons
they're difficult is

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.890
that, with a play--
if I'm writing a play,

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.980
I can have five friends who
are good actors come over

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.500
to my apartment and read
it cold on my couch,

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.960
and basically have an
understanding of what I've got.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.010
In a musical, you can't
do that because to see

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.560
how all of the different pieces
of machinery work together,

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.954
you need a week for
everybody to learn the music,

00:28:48.954 --> 00:28:50.370
and you kind of
probably want them

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.920
on their feet a little bit.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.980
So to get the flow
of the whole thing,

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.890
you need tens of
thousands of dollars

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.960
and a week of rehearsal.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.710
All of which is to say when
you're developing a musical,

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:05.340
it'll be six months between
opportunities to do that.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.080
There's even union
rules about how often

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.320
you're allowed to do that.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.100
So you're around the
table, kind of hearing it,

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.190
and in that context, you can
be like, well, I don't know,

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.360
are we bored here?

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.080
Let's move on.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.970
Or actually, we don't
want a song from her,

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:20.370
we want a song from him
about what he's feeling.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:25.699
And in a way, there's a maybe
apocryphal story about--

00:29:25.699 --> 00:29:27.240
maybe it's Stanislavski
or something,

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.059
or some Russian
director who was asked,

00:29:29.059 --> 00:29:30.850
how long do you want
to rehearse this show?

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:31.950
And he said, two years.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:32.970
And they said, you
can't have two years.

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.136
And he said, then two weeks.

00:29:34.136 --> 00:29:35.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.350
The point being,
you don't want the--

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.290
it's possible to have enough
time to sort of mess something

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:40.899
up.

00:29:40.899 --> 00:29:42.982
DAVID YAZBEK: I imagine
that that's what happened.

00:29:42.982 --> 00:29:45.148
And let me just say one
quick thing, which is that--

00:29:45.148 --> 00:29:49.710
and this would be
a part of the talk

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:54.480
that Google might pay me $25,000
to give the same crowd about

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.160
collaboration at Google.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.450
This is just a suggestion.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.116
And my fee is a little
higher than that.

00:30:00.116 --> 00:30:05.850
But we have collaborated,
first, Itamar and I, then

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:08.340
the three of us, then all
of us have collaborated

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:11.130
beautifully and very closely.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.850
You want to listen
to the other people.

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.940
But there are times--

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.620
I'm not blaming what I'm about
to say on either of these guys.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.370
But there are times when--

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:22.920
because this happened a long
time ago in the process--

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:27.470
when we had a different
person involved.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:31.780
And you can be
over-collaborative.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.830
You can say, oh, yeah,
OK, we can cut that song.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.225
Sort of to prove
that you have it

00:30:37.225 --> 00:30:39.600
in you to cut a song-- to the
cut a beautiful-- you know,

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.440
your baby.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.680
Because that's what
it's all about.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.281
You have to be willing
to sacrifice your babies.

00:30:45.281 --> 00:30:45.780
OK.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.566
Let's cut it.

00:30:48.566 --> 00:30:50.950
Then David Cromer
comes onto the project

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.610
and he's like,
what is that song?

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:55.930
Why isn't it in the show?

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:56.890
Why did you cut it?

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.110
You idiots.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.860
And it's sort of like,
yeah, you're right.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.390
We are idiots.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:01.306
It's a beautiful song.

00:31:01.306 --> 00:31:02.890
She sings it beautifully.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.350
So that's a little
lesson in collaboration.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.031
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:07.780
DAVID CROMER: And the
specific facts of it

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:12.100
are it was thought, for a while,
that at that point in the show,

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.710
we should hear from Tewfiq, the
character Tewfiq, in the scene.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.810
And then it was realized
that we would hear from her.

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:23.180
And sometimes, something
like that's a coin flip.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:27.474
And we placed ourselves in the
path of a fortuitous accident.

00:31:27.474 --> 00:31:29.890
ITAMAR MOSES: Yeah, in a way,
a more practical and compact

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.950
answer to the question is that
Katrina's character Dina sings

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.260
four or five times over
the course of the show,

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.240
and Tewfiq sings almost never.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.130
So we were sort of
thinking, surely

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.579
we need to hear more from him.

00:31:41.579 --> 00:31:43.120
And not over and
over again from her.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.310
And it turns out, that's wrong.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.500
You do want to hear her
sing again and again.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.420
DAVID YAZBEK: Yeah,
and that surely

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.435
is the sound of the rule book.

00:31:52.435 --> 00:31:54.100
That to do a show
like this, you have

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.470
to be ripping up constantly,
constantly, constantly.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:01.390
And if you're working at
Google, if you're coding or--

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:01.890
sorry.

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:02.931
DAVID CROMER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:02.931 --> 00:32:04.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.812
MICHAEL SHAYAN: I
have $25,000 coming.

00:32:07.812 --> 00:32:09.270
I would love to
hear from the cast.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:13.510
So this show, before it hit
Broadway, was at the Atlantic.

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.000
And many of you were actually
involved with that Atlantic

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.940
iteration, right?

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.460
And who was not involved?

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.660
Who was not involved?

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.300
OK, cool.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:23.800
Right.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.360
Etai and Adam.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.840
So I would love to
hear from you guys.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.130
Just please introduce yourself,
the role that you're playing.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.980
What's it like interpreting
a role off-Broadway

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.070
and then taking it
onto a bigger stage?

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:42.902
How are you-- are you becoming
more aware of your movements?

00:32:42.902 --> 00:32:44.860
You're playing to a bigger
audience, obviously.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.260
What's that like for you?

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.520
RACHEL PRATHER: My name's
Rachel Prather and I play Julia.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.630
As an actor, that's
a dream situation,

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:57.860
especially in the time
frame that we were given.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.730
Because we got to do this show
in a very intimate setting

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.400
off-broadway, 200-seat theater.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.820
And a pretty long rehearsal
process with table

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.430
work and putting it on our feet.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.970
And then we took a break
for like nine months,

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.070
and then we found out we
were going to Broadway.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:19.790
And so you have all of that
time for your characters

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.360
to just sink in and do
more research on your own.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.839
And I loved having two
different iterations of the show

00:33:26.839 --> 00:33:28.130
and being part of both of them.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.730
It was really special.

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.830
JOHN CARIANI: I'm
John and I play Itzik.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.290
And when I found out we
were going to Broadway,

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.040
I said, oh, great.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.140
My Hebrew will be
good and my accent

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.710
won't be terrible because
when we were downtown,

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:40.940
my accent wasn't very good.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.240
So it was very exciting
to get to revisit it.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.120
But it was great because we had
Etai and Sharone and Jonathan

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.300
to help us.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.700
And it was also fun to
just do it in a big space

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.340
because the Atlantic
was really small.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.840
And I remember David came up
to me one day and he said, see,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.160
now you can lean
back on the couch

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.368
because we're in a big space.

00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:56.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.056
So that was really exciting.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.310
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Is it
hard to sing in an accent?

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:05.900
Is that challenging
for you guys?

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:06.995
JOHN CARIANI: You
should talk about that.

00:34:06.995 --> 00:34:07.870
ARI'EL STACHEL: Yeah.

00:34:09.674 --> 00:34:12.590
It is challenging.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:14.480
I think the most
challenging part about it,

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.199
though, is that we learn
through the process

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:20.120
that some things could
not be understood

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.530
if I was singing
it in the accent

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:22.613
that I was speaking it in.

00:34:22.613 --> 00:34:26.300
So we were literally
negotiating each and every vowel

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:26.989
and consonant.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:29.840
So this [ROLLING "R"] is a
[ROLLING "R"] and this one is

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.710
[HARD "R"],, and this
one we're tapping.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:36.199
And so that is, I
think, not even-- we're

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:37.909
not talking about
singing in an accent.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.034
That's a whole other thing.

00:34:39.034 --> 00:34:41.179
But it's a really
interesting negotiation

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:46.489
to speak in a dialect and then
figure out how, in song, you

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:48.800
can be understood and still
give sort of the flair

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.870
and essence of the dialect.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:52.130
Yeah, it's a lot of work.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.054
It took a lot of work.

00:34:54.054 --> 00:34:55.429
MICHAEL SHAYAN:
Yeah, and Andrew,

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.850
I learned that your
wife is actually

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.370
involved in the production
as a dialect coach

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.759
and I think you
said a dramaturg.

00:35:03.759 --> 00:35:04.550
ANDREW POLK: Right.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.790
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:06.600
What's it like working
with your wife?

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.540
ANDREW POLK: I live
with the dialect coach.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:11.715
So I got a lot of notes.

00:35:11.715 --> 00:35:13.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.061
And she's Israeli.

00:35:16.061 --> 00:35:16.560
I'm not.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.740
And so it was also
helpful, in terms

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.920
of the context of the play.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.410
I learned a lot from her.

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:25.310
Obviously, we all did.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.160
The Israelis, with our accents.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.300
But also, I have been
immersed in Israeli culture

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.460
by the marriage choice I made.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:37.364 --> 00:35:38.780
JOHN CARIANI: The
best was the way

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.360
she gave him dialect
notes and the way she gave

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.010
the rest of us dialect notes.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.020
She was so kind and polite
and cheerful with us

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.353
and she was kind of hard on him.

00:35:46.353 --> 00:35:47.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:47.780
ANDREW POLK: Yeah, she was.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.946
She was like-- she was, and
she'd come to me and say

00:35:49.946 --> 00:35:51.530
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.611
No, [NON-ENGLISH].

00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:54.110
All right.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.150
Better go home.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.595
So that's what happened.

00:35:59.595 --> 00:36:00.470
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Yeah.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:03.750
We're going to open it up to
questions from the audience.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.525
So please line up at
the mics on either side.

00:36:07.525 --> 00:36:08.900
And we have a
question over here.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.190
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thank you so much for coming,

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.760
and very impressive.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.200
If you didn't grow up
saying [INAUDIBLE],,

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.790
to be able to do it, I
give you a lot of credit.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:14.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.740
You guys all
collaborate beautifully,

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:21.460
but obviously, there's a lot
of underlying political tones

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.080
about the story and the message.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.990
I'm wondering what it meant to
some of you to be part of it,

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.790
especially if you grew
up Israeli or Lebanese,

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:33.170
and what it meant to
bring together onstage.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:34.440
Was it difficult?

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.090
How your families felt about it?

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.584
So just curious to
hear about that.

00:36:37.584 --> 00:36:39.750
ARI'EL STACHEL: I have a
lot of opinions about that.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.720
It's really, really,
really complicated.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.780
I mean, first, you asked
about representation.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.880
I mean, on the first
level, those of us

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.060
in the cast who come from
Middle Eastern backgrounds,

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.760
there was so much sort of
self-inflicted pressure

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.660
to get this job.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.570
Because this felt like our
ticket to have a thing.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.560
So there's that.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.004
But the other thing that's--

00:37:00.004 --> 00:37:01.920
DAVID YAZBEK: How many
times did you audition?

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.836
ARI'EL STACHEL: Seven.

00:37:02.836 --> 00:37:04.364
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:04.364 --> 00:37:06.030
ITAMAR MOSES: The
last three were just--

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.700
DAVID CROMER: That seventh
audition wasn't for real.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:07.910
ITAMAR MOSES: Yeah.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:08.560
We were just kidding.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.393
ARI'EL STACHEL: Seven
auditions for the kid.

00:37:10.393 --> 00:37:12.080
No, and I think--

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.880
but it's also really
interesting to sort of, I think,

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.860
understand ourselves
in this identity.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.010
Because I, for
example, am the son

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.760
of a Yemenite-Israeli father,
so I'm Jewish and Israeli,

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.870
but also my family practices
a lot of Arab traditions.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:30.212
And I've always
felt like, at least

00:37:30.212 --> 00:37:31.920
as I've entered the
business in New York,

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.150
like I have this birthright to
play Middle Eastern characters.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:39.060
But I think, as
we play this, I'm

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.310
starting to realize all of
the nuance that's needed.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:43.710
And I don't really know
what I'm saying anymore,

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.800
other than the fact
that it's lovely to take

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.864
on this other culture,
and I'm learning a lot.

00:37:48.864 --> 00:37:50.280
And there's this
beautiful drummer

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.490
in the cast named Ossama Farouk,
who's been extremely helpful,

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.200
who's Alexandrian.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.960
But I think it means a lot
to many of us, personally.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.740
It means a huge amount to me
to be able to play this role,

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.990
and it not really
being political at all.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.860
It allows me to understand
myself as a Yemenite-Israeli

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.470
Middle Eastern American
man differently,

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:15.360
and more confidently.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.420
ITAMAR MOSES: Yeah,
I mean, just--

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.740
yeah, and I definitely want
to hear more from you guys.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.957
Because we-- I don't know.

00:38:22.957 --> 00:38:25.290
I'm curious how it-- actually,
how it feels for you guys

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:26.570
after running it for so long.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.320
Because we had one
answer to this question

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.300
when we were rehearsing it,
but now it's been theirs.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.440
It's been entirely
in their hands,

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.510
dealing with meeting
people at the stage door

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.080
and how people are reacting.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.942
But I know that
us, going into it--

00:38:36.942 --> 00:38:38.400
and it's one of
the reasons I think

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.246
the movie is so successful.

00:38:42.246 --> 00:38:45.720
It's not that it's apolitical
or that it avoids politics.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.480
It makes this enormously
political statement

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:56.970
by demonstrating that when
you strip away the things

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:59.160
that we normally see in
headlines about the region--

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.380
rhetoric from leaders,
disputes over borders.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:06.570
This is one group of people
that needs food and a roof,

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:08.670
and another group of people
that has those things.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:11.460
And when everything
else is stripped away,

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:16.770
it's about those basic
human needs, and things

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:18.540
over which you can connect.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.002
So there's something--
it's not that it's not

00:39:21.002 --> 00:39:22.210
making a political statement.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:24.084
It's that the political
statement it's making

00:39:24.084 --> 00:39:27.360
is that there are elemental
human things beyond politics.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.250
And I think that's why it
was such a hit as a film when

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:33.840
it was released in
Israel, and I think

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.390
it's kind of how
it's operating here.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:39.000
But I want to hear
more from you guys.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.950
ETAI BENSON: I've heard
from so many people--

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.169
my family is also Israeli, and
a lot of Israeli Middle Eastern

00:39:44.169 --> 00:39:46.710
people at the stage door will
say that they were so refreshed

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.900
that it wasn't--

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.210
no politics were
sledgehammered down

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:54.090
the throats of the audience.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:57.420
It's a very human story
that could, honestly,

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.110
take place anywhere.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.200
It just-- we happen to
look at it through the lens

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:01.991
of the Middle East.

00:40:01.991 --> 00:40:03.560
There's a moment in the film--

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:07.200
Itamar, you've talked
about this a lot--

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.480
when the Egyptian
band arrives and they

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.100
sit at the cafe to eat.

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.150
There's a photograph
on the wall of a tank,

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:16.897
and possibly from
the Yom Kippur War.

00:40:16.897 --> 00:40:17.730
I'm not really sure.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:19.110
You just kind of get
a quick glimpse of it.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.150
And one of the band
members takes his hat off

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.280
and just hangs it
right over the photo,

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.690
and the photo is covered.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:27.240
And that kind of just
sets the tone for the film

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.030
and that's the tone
of our show, too.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.560
It's all underneath.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:35.450
All the political tensions that
we all know about are there,

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:40.980
but we're choosing, in our show,
to set those aside for now.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.090
And I think that sentiment
transfers beautifully

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:47.000
to the play from the film.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.460
SHARONE SAYEGH: And just also
from the actor's perspective,

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.930
being a Middle Eastern
actor in the city,

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:54.780
auditioning for
other shows and TV

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.540
shows and whatnot
up until this point,

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:01.071
it gets really exhausting
to play the same thing over

00:41:01.071 --> 00:41:01.570
and over.

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:04.297
It's just this very
stereotypical idea

00:41:04.297 --> 00:41:05.880
of what the region
is, and it's always

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.310
about politics and
war and terrorism.

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:12.095
And it's like, this
show is about people.

00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:13.470
It's just about
people who happen

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:14.610
to live in the Middle East.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.890
And these people are not
defined by the politics

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.450
of their government.

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:23.190
They have their own
ideas, their own stories.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.270
So the fact that it's a
Middle Eastern musical

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.230
and I wasn't auditioning for
terrorist wife number three

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.480
was really, really
refreshing and wonderful.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.034
So I feel very grateful to
be a part of this story.

00:41:33.034 --> 00:41:34.200
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:34.943
Your answers are beautiful.

00:41:34.943 --> 00:41:35.480
ADAM KANTOR: And I think what--

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:35.750
AUDIENCE: Oh, please.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.810
Sorry.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.670
ADAM KANTOR: I was just going to
say, what moves me as an Amer--

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:38.090
I'm not Israeli.

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.089
My family's not Israeli.

00:41:39.089 --> 00:41:45.920
But what moves me as an American
doing this piece, in America,

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.230
in an American
theater with Americans

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:51.680
is telling a story about
two groups of people

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.990
from very different backgrounds
with very different ideologies

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.659
coming together and just
being together for a night.

00:42:00.659 --> 00:42:02.950
MICHAEL SHAYAN: I was excited
to hear that a lot of you

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:06.520
actually took a trip
together to Israel.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.749
What was that like?

00:42:08.749 --> 00:42:09.540
ITAMAR MOSES: Yeah.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.877
I mean, I'd been there because
I have family there also,

00:42:12.877 --> 00:42:13.960
and I'd been there before.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.043
But yes, between the
off-Broadway and the Broadway

00:42:16.043 --> 00:42:19.530
productions, Yazbek and
Cromer and Katrina and Ari'el

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:22.230
was there and George was there.

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:25.230
We went for a few
days to Israel.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:27.430
And specifically, we
went to [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:30.750
which is the town in the
desert where Eran Kolirin

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.690
and the filmmaker
filmed the movie.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:34.590
So Bet Hatikva is
fictional, but it's

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:38.940
based on this little village
in the middle of nowhere.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:43.304
And it was sort of
profound to go there,

00:42:43.304 --> 00:42:45.720
not just to see the locations
from the movie that we knew.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:50.610
But to feel the isolation
and the vastness

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.640
of the desert around you
was really something.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.960
KATRINA LENK: Yeah.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.080
We stood outside in the desert
for what felt like hours,

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.791
just listening to the wind.

00:42:59.791 --> 00:43:01.790
And I'd be like, you guys,
can we go on the bus?

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:02.280
It's hot.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:02.779
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:02.779 --> 00:43:06.270
But that sound of
just wind coming from

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:07.530
someplace you can't explain.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.210
Because there's nothing for
it to bounce off-- like,

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:10.270
where's it coming from?

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.030
But it's like,
whah, in your ears.

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:14.310
And sun and the sky--

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:19.056
just getting to experience
that was really extraordinary.

00:43:19.056 --> 00:43:20.340
MICHAEL SHAYAN: Oh, wow.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:20.840
OK.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:24.060
We're going to close out with
a song, but before we do,

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:28.560
I want to play a quick game.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.050
So this is a parlor game.

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:34.532
It was popularized by
Marcel Proust in the 1880s.

00:43:34.532 --> 00:43:35.990
And the whole point
of it is to get

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:39.240
to know the answerers
on a deeper level.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.605
So you guys down for a game?

00:43:40.605 --> 00:43:41.480
SHARONE SAYEGH: Yeah.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.070

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:48.120
And we'll just popcorn, and feel
free to jump in when you want.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:48.620
OK.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.804

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.740
You guys know what jachnun is?

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.960
It's this-- it's
a breakfast food.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.120
It's basically layers
of dough and butter

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.920
rolled, baked in the oven
overnight for like 12 hours.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.700
And you eat it with crushed
tomatoes and a hard boiled egg.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.040
12 Chairs in the West Village
has incredible jachnun

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.442

grape leaves, which

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:14.380

say [NON-ENGLISH] a lot,

which is a curse
word probably from

to "Hamilton" for a year after--

00:46:10.917 --> 00:46:12.500
just because-- out
of envy, just sheer

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:13.760
envy of how successful it was.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.870
And then, once I listened
to it, I couldn't stop.

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.990
And I listened to
the entire album

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:19.940

every single time I--

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:23.780
