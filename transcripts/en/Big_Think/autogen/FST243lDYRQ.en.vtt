and he was devastated by this didn't

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060
and he was devastated by this didn't
 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.759
and he was devastated by this didn't
know how he was going to survive as a

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769
know how he was going to survive as a
 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.110
know how he was going to survive as a
writer or some person and after a while

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
writer or some person and after a while
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.619
writer or some person and after a while
it seemed to him that he was learning to

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629
it seemed to him that he was learning to
 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.559
it seemed to him that he was learning to
read again that he was awake recovering

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569
read again that he was awake recovering
 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.209
read again that he was awake recovering
but in fact when he was tested there was

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219
but in fact when he was tested there was
 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.910
but in fact when he was tested there was
no recovery of the visual Alexia and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920
no recovery of the visual Alexia and
 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.860
no recovery of the visual Alexia and
what was happening unconsciously

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
what was happening unconsciously
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.770
what was happening unconsciously
was that his tongue was copying the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780
was that his tongue was copying the
 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.119
was that his tongue was copying the
shapes of letters on his palate and

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129
shapes of letters on his palate and
 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.619
shapes of letters on his palate and
since the disease only affects the

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629
since the disease only affects the
 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.960
since the disease only affects the
visual basically he was reading with his

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970
visual basically he was reading with his
 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.619
visual basically he was reading with his
tongue so part of my work as a

Tourette syndrome can um can make life

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120
Tourette syndrome can um can make life
 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.349
Tourette syndrome can um can make life
very difficult for one but in a sense

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359
very difficult for one but in a sense

there's a sort of positive side to this

there's a sort of positive side to this
 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.039
there's a sort of positive side to this
in a way to it is a turned on state and

and perhaps if one sees someone with
 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.399
and perhaps if one sees someone with
something like Tourette syndrome it's

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409
something like Tourette syndrome it's
 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.210
something like Tourette syndrome it's
good to explore possible positive sides

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220
good to explore possible positive sides
 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.780
good to explore possible positive sides
of it and then the person will it's so I

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790
of it and then the person will it's so I
 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.599
of it and then the person will it's so I
don't say there's always a positive side

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609
don't say there's always a positive side
 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:09.949
don't say there's always a positive side
but about but I think it's very

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959
but about but I think it's very
 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.460
but about but I think it's very
important to to look and not just simply

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470
important to to look and not just simply
 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.830
important to to look and not just simply
to think in terms of defects and

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840
to think in terms of defects and
 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.740
to think in terms of defects and
problems but of different ways of doing

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750
problems but of different ways of doing
 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.360

things and different ways of functioning

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370
things and different ways of functioning
 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.730
things and different ways of functioning
and this has now become almost a

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740
and this has now become almost a
 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.920
and this has now become almost a
political thing so that say people with

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930
political thing so that say people with
 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.719
political thing so that say people with
autism will would you know like to UM

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729

of neurological differences and styles
 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.219
of neurological differences and styles
is is very important although although
