00:00:01.824 --> 00:00:03.490
MALE SPEAKER: A little
bit of background

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.280
about Carol and why someone from
the food team is hosting her.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.790
So Carol's initial book,
"The Responsible Business",

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.630
came out a little while back.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.820
And we adopted it
into the framework

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.680
within our global
food program strategy.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.890
And we've been using her
book and the strategy

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.070
behind that for
the last two years.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.740
And so I'm sure Carol will have
some juicy tidbits to share

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.460
about that.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.790
So it's super exciting to have
her back here in sunny Mountain

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.610
View.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.180
"The Responsible
Business" framework

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.400
really identifies five
windows through which

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.919
businesses view
their activities.

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:37.710
And this is something
that she'll speak to,

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.751
but it's really interesting
to kind of get it out

00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:41.440
there now to start
thinking about it.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.520
The five areas or
the five activities

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.530
are the customers
that you think about,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.932
the co-creators, which
she'll talk through,

00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:49.890
the Earth, around being
sustainable-- something

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.660
the Google is all about-- the
community in which we work

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.960
and live, and then the last one
via the investors, making sure

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.850
we're making money
and being profitable.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.660
So Carol has collaborated with
Fortune 100 and entrepreneur

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.820
CEOs for four decades in
building "The Responsible

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.890
Business"-- that is a
re-imagined idea of success

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.790
and how to get there with the
benefit to all stakeholders.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.870
Carol authored a
multi-award-winning book

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.310
by the same name, which
tells those stories.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.460
The new book, "The Responsible
Entrepreneur"-- in front of me,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.490
here-- just came on
July 7, this fall.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.690
She is the founder and faculty
at the Responsible Entrepreneur

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.250
Institute, intermittent lecturer
at MIT Sloan, Harvard Business,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.660
Michigan Ross, Toronto
Rotman, and the University

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.060
of [INAUDIBLE] for Innovation
and Entrepreneurship.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.770
She also blogs for
CNBC, Stanford Social,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.940
Innovation Review,
and many others.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.490
Carol plays with
making and sharing food

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.820
and thinking about
the business of food

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.680
and its place in communities
and where she lives.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.630
It is my pleasure to introduce
Carol Sanford, a member

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.929
of our Food Innovation Lab
and author of her latest

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.470
book, "The Responsible
Entrepreneur".

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.700
So with that, I give you Carol.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.310
CAROL SANFORD: Thank you.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.620
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.078
CAROL SANFORD:
Thank you very much.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.240
Thank you all for coming.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.110
I thought I would start
with a bit of a story

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.940
and see if you can
relate to the story.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.180
When I was very
young-- I can actually

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.160
remember, as early as four years
old-- having a thought about,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.400
I wonder how much I
could do with my life.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.460
Now, I didn't have
those words for it,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.940
but I remember feeling like
that there was something

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.040
if you set out to do it, you
could make a big difference.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.750
Now, at that point,
I have to tell you,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.560
what I was thinking about was
rescuing the dogs that the dog

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.270
catcher picked up.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.850
But as time went on, by the time
I was six or seven years old,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.499
I lived-- well, I
had made a decision

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.290
about the time I was
six or seven years old

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.987
that a lot of my work should
be about reversing racism.

00:02:48.987 --> 00:02:50.570
And part of that was
because I grew up

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.697
in the panhandle of Texas,
where it was rampant.

00:02:52.697 --> 00:02:54.030
And it was rampant in my family.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.830
So there are various paths
I've followed through my life

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.860
to try and do what
I can with my life.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.370
And I have, in that process,
become absolutely fascinated

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.100
with cultures that make
it possible for people

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.630
to make a really big
difference with their life,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.610
and for people who managed to
rise to unbelievable challenge

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.870
and accomplish great
things, even when

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.170
they don't have a culture
that supports them.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.650
How many of you felt
like when you were young

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.942
that you might want to do
something big with your life?

00:03:23.942 --> 00:03:25.399
Did anybody-- you
had that thought.

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:26.110
Yeah.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.070
So I find in many
cultures, you don't

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.060
have all the words for it,
but it's sort of there.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.590
I also-- having been here
hanging out with Googlers

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.900
for a couple of years now
through the Food Experience

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.240
Innovation Lab with Scott
and [? Michel ?] [? Bacher ?]

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.640
and, what, 100 other folks--
have come to realize what

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.780
a culture this is for people
being able to actually realize

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.270
and do something
amazing with their life.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.250
But the question I have for
you today and what this book is

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.640
about, this new book, is are you
fully taking advantage of it?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.990
And so today, instead
of me just lecturing

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.510
to you, which I
find really boring,

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.390
I'm going to offer
you some stories.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.950
And I'm going to
start with asking

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.380
a question I'd like for you to
use to think as we go along.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.320
And instead of you asking
me questions, like a Q&amp;A,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.770
I'm going to ask you questions.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.480
And I'm going to stop
and ask you to comment.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.130
Is that fair?

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.280
And if you absolutely say-- I'll
probably call on you anyway,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.000
but you can try that.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.554
Because it's much more fun
if we engage rather than just

00:04:28.554 --> 00:04:29.720
me telling you what I think.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.340
Because I don't think I'm
any bigger expert than you

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.000
are at this, I've just
lived it a little longer

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.930
and met a lot more people,
potentially, than you have.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.635
So I want to start
with this question.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.290
If you were to think
about the evolution

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.410
of a healthier society,
a healthier ecosystem,

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.990
and you were to say,
personally-- not

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.569
what Google says, not what
my unit or my work is about,

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:53.360
but, me personally.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.980
Where do I think
is the biggest--

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.360
and using Google language--
10x place to leverage?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.270
If I were just going
to take on something

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.020
and I were really going
to drive something

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.560
I thought would create a
much healthier ecosystem

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.690
and a healthier society,
what would I pick?

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.510
What would I say is like the
node or the point to intervene,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.710
that if I were going
to put my life energy

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.500
and I were going to
make a big difference,

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.800
that might be where
I would put it.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.110
Do you have thoughts
about the answer to that?

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.440
Anybody have a thought
about the answer to that?

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.280
AUDIENCE: People.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.155
CAROL SANFORD: Where?

00:05:31.522 --> 00:05:32.230
AUDIENCE: People.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.395
CAROL SANFORD: People.

00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:34.465
And any specific thing
you'd do with people?

00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:35.381
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:35.977 --> 00:05:36.810
CAROL SANFORD: Yeah.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.790
This is a test.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:38.780
I should have told you.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.530
AUDIENCE: Educating
the young ones, maybe?

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.196
CAROL SANFORD: Educating
the young ones.

00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:45.000
So you have a strong sense
that, like, when they get older,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.510
it's sometimes really hard to
change minds and grow people.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.030
But young.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.040
So I see several people
shaking their head.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.320
Where else do people have
a thought about here's

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.324
where I would start, or
here's where I might focus?

00:05:56.324 --> 00:05:57.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:59.624 --> 00:06:00.540
CAROL SANFORD: So why?

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.460
Say a little more and
what that would look like.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.120
You happen to be in a company
that knows a bit about that,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.095
right?

00:06:05.095 --> 00:06:05.720
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.511
CAROL SANFORD: But
where would you take it?

00:06:07.511 --> 00:06:09.703
Where would you focus, and why?

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:12.036
AUDIENCE: In addition to the
youngsters that need access

00:06:12.036 --> 00:06:16.670
to it, other people who
will get the message

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.495
through the [INAUDIBLE] need to
get the third-world countries

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:22.870
that currently can't get to it.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.390
CAROL SANFORD: So we've
got a lot of disparity

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.410
in the distribution of
knowledge, understanding,

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.490
capability.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.070
And if we could create an
access that leveled that playing

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.800
field, that could
make a big difference

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.010
not just for one
society at a time,

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.550
but more of a grander society.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.770
That makes sense.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.320
One more.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.760
Anybody else have a thought
about where they would start,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.051
where they would leverage from?

00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:48.610
AUDIENCE: I would
start from education.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.815
That's kind of a--

00:06:51.815 --> 00:06:53.940
CAROL SANFORD: And any
particular part of education

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.858
or topic, focus?

00:06:57.858 --> 00:07:05.328
AUDIENCE: Yes, just something
like a global [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:05.328 --> 00:07:06.324
global view.

00:07:06.324 --> 00:07:12.827
And [INAUDIBLE]
across [INAUDIBLE] you

00:07:12.827 --> 00:07:16.313
could promote
[INAUDIBLE] diversity

00:07:16.313 --> 00:07:20.546
and a multi-cultural
environment, and a global view.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.700
CAROL SANFORD: When you
move around the States,

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.440
it becomes very quickly
clear how many people in most

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.980
of the US have never
left the United States.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.950
Right?

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.760
They've not left it
mentally or physically.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.740
They've rarely read
books about it.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.210
And if they watch it as a
culture story, what they're

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.220
watching usually is a
war between two worlds.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.914
So your thought would be coming
to appreciate and understand

00:07:45.914 --> 00:07:47.080
could make a big difference.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.110
I got to work with Colgate
Palmolive in South Africa just

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.490
the two years before the
elections and the two years

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.330
afterwards.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:55.920
Oh my god.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.150
You cannot imagine
a time like that,

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.490
where the turn of
history is happening.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.290
And one of the things that
I thought while I was there

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.350
is I wanted to pick up every
black African in the United

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.530
States that was
under 16 years old

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.690
and have them come watch this
happen-- to see the power,

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.930
to see the transition,
to see what could happen.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.638
But I couldn't figure
out how to fund it.

00:08:17.638 --> 00:08:20.054
Actually, I should have also
taken all the white kids, now

00:08:20.054 --> 00:08:20.800
that I say that.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.560
Because they're the ones that
should have seen the power

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.800
that was happening, too.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.130
So I think these are
three great places

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.250
to start-- so education,
people, access to knowledge,

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.240
and a connection with diversity.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.669
So listen just a
bit as I talk, then,

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.575
to these stories from
what you would do.

00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:37.450
And even if you didn't
tell us what yours is,

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.610
or you're perfectly fine
stealing someone else's idea

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.409
if it feels right for you too.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.620
Let's look just a
little bit at why

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.420
I think entrepreneurs are
what are necessary to do this.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.320
And for me, the
word "entrepreneur"

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.970
has nothing to do necessarily
with going out and starting

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.470
a business.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.480
It has to do with a way
of seeing the world,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.700
a way of engaging the world.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.560
And it can happen in parenting.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.310
It can happen in
a not-for-profit.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.380
It can happen in your
own standalone business.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.370
Or it can happen as a leader
using someone else's platform,

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.610
like Google.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.430
So I'm going to give you
three ways that I think about

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.680
and see entrepreneurs
operating, which

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.087
is the foundation,
again, of this book.

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:15.670
This isn't in the
book, but it's a bit

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.980
about why I wrote the book.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.210
One of things that I think
is a characteristic that's

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.580
core to entrepreneurship,
or thinking of the world

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.960
entrepreneurially, is that
the person that's doing that

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.957
has a lot of personal agency.

00:09:27.957 --> 00:09:29.290
Do you know what I mean by that?

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.100
Nothing stops them.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.250
Needs doing?

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.800
I'm the one that's in there.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.220
I come up with the ideas
and I move the ideas.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.010
I get knocked down, I
bounce right back up.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.960
There is a strong sense of
internal locus of control.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.412
I'm not a victim.

00:09:44.412 --> 00:09:46.370
So that's one of things
I see in entrepreneurs,

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.570
is this strength
of personal agency.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.400
The second thing that I
see is that they're always

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.200
about making a difference.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.630
They're not very
interested in just doing

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.670
kind of better something
somebody else has done.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.010
They actually want
to break the mold.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.810
They want to do something
they could really

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.630
matter to as many
people as possible.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.370
I love the 10x that
Larry talks about.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.770
But every possibility we have,
we can make a difference.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.210
And entrepreneurs
think that way.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.450
The third thing
here is something

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.134
that people rarely
talk about, but I

00:10:19.134 --> 00:10:20.550
think it's really
important, which

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:25.610
is bringing your uniqueness
into it, your unique essence.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:29.660
So each of you are different
than any other person

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.230
in this room or any other
person on the planet.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.000
And I'm not just talking
about physically.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.650
I'm talking about kind of at
a being level-- who you are.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.170
When you were a child,
people would look at you

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.420
and they'd say, well,
I think he or she's

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.750
going to be a piano player.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.920
I'm looking at my three and
a half-year-old granddaughter

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.419
right now.

00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:50.330
And she just got her
costume for Halloween.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.230
And she is a knight
in shining armor.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.910
That's what she picked-- three
and a half-year-old girl.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.950
And we have pictures of
her standing with a sword,

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.080
and she says, I'm off
to save the world.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.350
So it just makes me wonder--
what is Sylvia going to be?

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.880
And each of us had
that version of us.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.234
And then the next time most
of us hear about it-- well,

00:11:10.234 --> 00:11:11.400
actually, you won't hear it.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.490
But it would be
your funeral, when

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.421
people talk about how
you were, who you are,

00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:16.920
why you were different
in the world.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.272
But that's in us all along,
and often it gets lost.

00:11:20.272 --> 00:11:22.230
And especially when you're
in a great business,

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.570
you can be swept into
other people's work.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.370
And so what I believe
is entrepreneurial

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.410
is bringing back who
you are and making sure

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.030
that you are embedding
who you are in the work.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.720
There is a new thing called
social entrepreneurs.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.870
You've probably heard or read
about social entrepreneurs--

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:45.570
a whole passel of folks
who find causes and issues

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.930
and then they form a
business around them.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.460
And they add one
thing-- they tend

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.610
to lose one thing that my base
entrepreneur doesn't have.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.010
But they add this thing
that my grandmother

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.510
called external considering.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.810
You might have guessed already
I didn't mind people very well,

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.710
and I didn't stay inside the
boundaries that I was given.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:05.960
And I was in trouble a lot.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.820
And my grandmother's
primary question to me

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.235
always was, didn't you consider
anybody else beside yourself?

00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:12.810
No.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.980
Not at that age when
she was asking me that.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.320
But as I've grow, I
now know that what

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.150
I want to do is
consider-- and when

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.390
I wrote the book "The
Responsible Business"

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.970
about the stakeholders,
what I was trying to do

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:29.100
is introduce this combination of
external considering, like what

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.580
is the life of your
customer or user like.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.270
And how many of you
have read the new

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.390
"How Google Works" that's out?

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.282
AUDIENCE: Not yet.

00:12:37.282 --> 00:12:39.240
CAROL SANFORD: I bought
it the minute I saw it.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.380
I had read it by the time I
landed in Denmark two weeks

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:41.927
ago.

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:42.760
You have to read it.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.230
You'll remember
why you are here.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:45.780
It's just amazing.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.150
But of course, the message
that is threaded all the way

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.830
through it is stand
in the user's shoes.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.674
And that's exactly
how you all think.

00:12:52.674 --> 00:12:54.590
I think that's one of
the reasons [? Michel ?]

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.840
got so excited about my book,
is that I was giving ways

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.700
to go be in the life of the
people that you were serving,

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.940
and then connect all
of the co-creators.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.640
And the co-creators
for me are everyone

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.980
who serves the customer or user.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.790
And that means the suppliers you
hire, the contractors you hire,

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.540
the people who are
called employees,

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.220
which is a really
weird word, but all

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.650
of those kind of people,
and that they do it in a way

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.440
that Earth is served
and made healthier,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.170
and that communities
grow and remain

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.130
unique, and the
investors who count on us

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.470
for an enduring return
get taken care of.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.110
So all of that to me is
external considering.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.960
And it actually has
to happen in sequence,

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.617
but that's in the last
book, and we're actually

00:13:35.617 --> 00:13:37.075
not going to talk
about that today.

00:13:37.075 --> 00:13:39.296
But if you get interested,
you can go find it.

00:13:39.296 --> 00:13:40.670
So that's one of
the first things

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.020
the social entrepreneur does.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:48.650
However, instead of driven
by making a big difference,

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.495
they tend to be driven by issues
of where something is broken.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:57.349
So they find something
that's not working well

00:13:57.349 --> 00:13:58.890
or a problem that
needs to be solved.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.800
And so like stoves
in South Africa--

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.790
I mean fires,
cutting down trees.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.376
What they'll do is create a
small little stove that people

00:14:06.376 --> 00:14:09.200
could use that doesn't pollute,
it doesn't cut down trees.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.700
Of course, it doesn't stop what
caused us having that problem.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.497
So that's why I say
it's like issue-based.

00:14:14.497 --> 00:14:16.330
It's not really working
on the whole system,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.247
which you'll see
in the next one.

00:14:18.247 --> 00:14:20.580
The other thing that happens
for the social entrepreneur

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.011
is they lose their unique
essence expression most

00:14:23.011 --> 00:14:23.510
of the time.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.650
And they become dedicated
to something else

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.240
they want to change.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.050
The sad part of that is
that then they get burnout.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.380
Because if you're not in
it, you don't get fuel back.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.930
You don't get nurtured back.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.530
So I want us to go
to this third level.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.310
And what this book
was about was creating

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.351
what I call "the responsible
entrepreneur," which

00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:45.230
is different than
social entrepreneur.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.980
Because their true businesses--
the social entrepreneurs

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.030
are often businesses that are
operating like not-for-profits.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.510
You know, they could have
been a not-for-profit,

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.580
but they're not
supposed to do that now.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.320
They're supposed
to make a business.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.600
The responsible entrepreneur
is a deep and abiding business

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.680
person.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.730
And they are creating a
business because they believe

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.650
that there are forms
of capitalism which

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.060
can make society work better.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.560
And it's a part of
entrepreneurship.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.900
So they have personal agencies.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.840
You can see all three of these
folks have personal agency.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.590
But there's one thing that I
introduce into businesses--

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.620
and it was really easy to
do in South Africa because

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.670
of the transition-- which
is something called promises

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.620
beyond ableness.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.150
Now, in Google
audiences, you can

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.710
guess what that
means very quickly.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:29.960
Most people say, what?

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.190
What do you mean
promises beyond ableness?

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:37.020
It means seeing something
you think could be done,

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.767
but you don't know how to do it.

00:15:38.767 --> 00:15:41.100
But you're willing to promise
to figure out how to do it

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.620
and you're willing
to put it in writing.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.600
You're willing to commit to it.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.725
You're willing to fight
for the resources to do it.

00:15:45.725 --> 00:15:48.690
You're willing to have
performance tied against it,

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.410
and you're willing to grow
yourself in order to get there.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:53.260
So I put those
into all companies

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.050
that I work with-- everybody.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.480
I don't care whether
you are an engineer

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:02.510
or whether you are person who
is keeping an operation clean.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.500
Whatever your role
is, how is it you

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.150
find your promise
beyond ableness?

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.180
Because to me,
that's core to you

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.210
getting to live your fullest
life and make a big difference.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.820
The external considering
then comes in that form.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.040
But there's one other thing--
besides that the unique essence

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.195
expression stays there-- which
is this idea of whole systems

00:16:22.195 --> 00:16:22.695
change.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.200
So you know I talked about how
a social entrepreneur works

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.441
on an issue.

00:16:29.441 --> 00:16:31.190
What the responsible
entrepreneur works on

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.740
is the system that
caused the issue.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.990
So they aren't
problem-solvers, they're

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.800
game-changers of systems.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.110
So they may change
judicial systems.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.860
One of the things that
the Google Innovation Food

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.000
Lab is doing-- Lab
for Food Experience--

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.950
is that they are working on
actually changing everyone

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.620
on the planet's
relationship to food.

00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:54.190
Everyone.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:01.580
Soil, nutrition, its affect on
climate-- speak of a promise

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.020
beyond ableness, right?

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.380
It's huge.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.190
But it also is working on
the system in every case--

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.550
how it is that we
grow food, how it

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.500
is we make choices about food.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.450
And so the movement
of the whole system

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.920
is what this
entrepreneur is about.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.780
So this book is full
of 15 stories of people

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.560
who go after the whole system,
make promises beyond ableness,

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.140
bring their uniqueness
and distinctiveness to it,

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.704
and make something
amazing happen.

00:17:26.704 --> 00:17:27.829
Doe that sound interesting?

00:17:28.989 --> 00:17:30.780
You're going to love
reading these stories.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.280
I'm glad.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.739
I hope you all read the book
in addition to just taking it.

00:17:33.739 --> 00:17:35.863
And most people tell me
they're reading all the way

00:17:35.863 --> 00:17:37.536
through it, which
is very exciting.

00:17:37.536 --> 00:17:39.160
So I want to tell
you a story about how

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.770
I came to the term archetypes.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.135
I am 1/16 Mohawk.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.242
I know I don't look like it.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.480
Whatever the bone structure
and stuff that I could have had

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.450
didn't get here.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.770
But the stories
from my grandfather

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.527
of my great, great,
great grandfather, who

00:17:59.527 --> 00:18:02.110
was a part of the Trail of Tears
that went across the Southern

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.400
US-- you're all too young.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.233
Do any of you know about
the Trail of Tears?

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.510
You know about it.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.300
So it was when they moved
Native Americans, Indians,

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.860
off of their natural
living places

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.880
and tried to move them--
well, did move them

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.730
all in to reservations mostly
in Oklahoma and New Mexico,

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.610
a little bit in Texas, but
all of those are gone now.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.660
And 90% of the people
who were moved died.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.990
So it wasn't a real
well-planned, well-executed--

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.480
and maybe nobody cared.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.140
But my great, great,
great grandfather

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.420
was one of those folks.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.600
And he was responsible, as
the chief of the tribe--

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.480
became chief along the way--
of regenerating a tribe

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.350
and regenerating a nation.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.610
And what they used
were four archetypes

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.950
which are necessary for
anything to be reborn.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.570
And again, you can see
this in any team you're in.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.960
And I've created modern
versions of these,

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.830
but here's what the terms
were that my grandfather used.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.850
So the warrior is not
the one who fights.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:06.490
He said they are the ones who
ask, what's worth fighting for?

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.646
And the clown is not the one
who just entertains and is

00:19:10.646 --> 00:19:13.814
the stand-up comic, but
they teach us something.

00:19:13.814 --> 00:19:15.480
They point out the
elephant in the room.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.854
And they do it with humor so
that we can be uncomfortable

00:19:17.854 --> 00:19:18.940
or we can feel it.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.210
We've extracted that out
of most of our things

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.246
and put it on a stage--
in an improv theater

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:25.760
or a stand-up comedian.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.380
The hunter is not the person
who just hunts, but makes

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.990
sure that everything stays
healthy-- the soil is healthy,

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.820
the people are healthy--
for next generations.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.140
And the headman or
headwoman is the one

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.470
who asked, how should we
think about this so we could

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.839
get better answers
than we got last time?

00:19:40.839 --> 00:19:42.380
That's what my
grandfather taught me.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.840
And I've been introducing
that into businesses

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.750
all these years, and tried to
bring an understanding that it

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.397
is not one of
these that you are,

00:19:51.397 --> 00:19:52.730
but you have to use all of them.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.757
So if you were going
to go out and you

00:19:54.757 --> 00:19:56.590
wanted to take on a
promise beyond ableness,

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.190
you probably will have to
use all four over time.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.336
You'll have to ask,
what's worth fighting for?

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:03.710
Where's the elephant
in the room?

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:04.919
How do we nourish everything?

00:20:04.919 --> 00:20:06.376
And how are we
going to think about

00:20:06.376 --> 00:20:08.410
so we get a better answer
than we did last time?

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.765
And if you don't feel like
you can don that mantle

00:20:10.765 --> 00:20:12.140
and play all of
them, then you've

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.647
got to go get some friends.

00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:15.230
My grandfather,
apparently, rounded up

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.410
a bunch of other folks,
and they rebuilt a nation.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.020
And I got to be a
part of that lineage.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:25.140
You'll notice when you-- if you
do-- go look at the dedication,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.110
it's to my grandfather,
and to my grandson, who

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.960
is named after him, and to
my mother, who recorded all

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.200
those stories and kept
them and passed them along,

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.750
and to Sylvia, the knight
in shining armor, who

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:39.160
is part Maya and part Mexican.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.270
So she has a tribal
heritage too.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.960
So that's what's
behind this book.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.970
I want to differentiate
one thing here, though.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.916
Because archetypes-- there's
too many words on that.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:50.790
Just let me tell you.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.620
Ignore that.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.911
There's too many words on that.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.120
What I'm trying to
differentiate here

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.880
is the difference between an
archetype and your essence.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.500
You are not an
archetype-- never will be.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.539
I do have a quiz.

00:21:04.539 --> 00:21:06.580
If you want to, for fun,
you can go to my website

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.150
at carolsanford.com.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.160
And you can take it.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.030
And it'll say, here's what
you default to all the time.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.620
You tend to always
be a warrior, or you

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.879
tend to always step
into hunter role

00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:18.920
and are worried about the
nourishment and keeping

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.628
everything going.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.210
But the idea is that you want
to learn to use all of them.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:27.350
But in every case, you
will do it your way.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.160
Essence is you,
as I said earlier.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.450
You will never be anyone else.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.560
So the archetypes are
like a patterned response.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.780
And the essence is who you,
are and no one can ever

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.320
take that away from you-- either
that, that or you're gone.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.430
So the thing that I would
like to share with you,

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.150
and then I want to go
back to interacting

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.066
with you a little bit.

00:21:48.066 --> 00:21:50.830
I want you to think
about the example

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.420
that you came up
with that you said

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.450
we should work on-- education,
information and access to it,

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.980
and understanding and
value in the diversity--

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.240
and ask which of these are
arenas-- because they can help

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.250
you know which archetype
to use-- which of these

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.229
would you have to work on?

00:22:06.229 --> 00:22:07.770
Now, maybe all of
them, and I do have

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.455
one story in the book of a
woman who worked on all four.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:15.790
But you will tend to need to
move one of these, maybe two.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.400
So everybody get back
in your mind something

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.560
you think you would work
on if you were really

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.465
going to improve
society and ecosystems.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.130
What I've found in
working with my clients

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:33.020
and the research that I've done
is that those archetypes now

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.310
work on four major
arenas they change.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.460
So the question is going
to be, which of these

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:38.300
would you take on?

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.750
The first is
changing an industry.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.570
I have stories in the
book-- and, by the way,

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:48.050
60% of the stories are
women, some women of color,

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.760
and 40% are men.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.440
Because I find it
that they're kind

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.840
of imbalanced, which
most books get written.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.850
And actually, I use four
icons at the beginning,

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:58.590
of which Larry Page is one.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.900
And it has been the
most reprinted--

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.450
more people have
asked to reprint

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.310
that story than any other.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.240
Number two is the
Costco story, which

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.667
they keep reprinting everywhere.

00:23:07.667 --> 00:23:10.250
So you'll enjoy the Larry Page
story, because there are pieces

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:13.120
there that I had to
dig like crazy to get.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.760
And I love that I have actually
Google-approved stories

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.550
in this book.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.520
[LAUGH] It's hard to get, right?

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.090
So industry is the first one.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.470
And that's what
the warrior does.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.100
They work on
changing industries.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.470
The clown works on
changing social systems.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.280
So what I mean by
a social system

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.650
would be something
like-- well, anything

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.290
that we as a society structure
to help us work together,

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.587
like the tax system.

00:23:36.587 --> 00:23:38.045
Anybody think it
could be improved?

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:43.450
Do you have a feeling it might
improve democracy or equality

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.440
or any other things if we
worked on the tax system?

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.779
Anybody think, yeah.

00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:48.570
I think that might.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.420
Well, I have one person--
the story's not in this book.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.460
But we had a
conversation, and I said,

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.340
what if the essence of
the IRS was actually

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.940
to improve wealth in the nation?

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.450
Just everybody
becoming wealthier?

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.060
If that were its purpose,
would it be run differently,

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.576
and would we have enough taxes?

00:24:10.576 --> 00:24:11.700
Would we have enough money?

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.846
So I have somebody who is
not far enough along for me

00:24:13.846 --> 00:24:15.679
to write their story
yet, but they're really

00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:18.670
working on that social
system and redefining,

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.940
re-imagining what it's about.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.636
The next one is to be able
to change cultural paradigms.

00:24:24.636 --> 00:24:26.010
Now, I think this
was part of-- I

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:27.259
don't know-- what's your name?

00:24:27.934 --> 00:24:28.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:29.974
CAROL SANFORD: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.200
I think that what you
were talking about,

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.460
how we culturally get locked
into our individual views

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.120
of a cultural group
or a cultural paradigm

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.290
or a culture way of
working, and then each of us

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.590
have our own narrow
little box about that.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.770
The challenge of this
particular archetype

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.665
is to actually change
what people believe.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.930
Whew.

00:24:54.245 --> 00:24:56.620
And there have been so many
books out recently saying you

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.640
cannot change what
people believe.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.914
Well, I know that's not true,
because I actually literally

00:25:01.914 --> 00:25:04.330
used to believe that I could
tell someone's race by taking

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.288
a blood test, because my
father taught me that.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.340
And it farmed an entire culture
around how I saw the world.

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.850
But it is possible
to change belief

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.650
by engaging, by information,
by engagement, particularly

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:18.840
with information.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.740
The information
alone didn't do it.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.770
But coming to know people, be
with people, live in a world

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.470
where you're more engaged
changed a cultural paradigm

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:27.200
for me.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.050
And I have two stories in the
book about people who are doing

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:34.049
that, one of which is Michael
[? Bacher. ?] [? Michel. ?] I

00:25:34.049 --> 00:25:34.840
can't say his name.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.691
Can you say that?

00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:36.815
[? MALE SPEAKER: Michel. ?]

00:25:36.815 --> 00:25:38.210
[? CAROL SANFORD: Michel. ?]
Right?

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.126
Anybody else say that?

00:25:40.381 --> 00:25:40.880
Yeah?

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.980
Do you all call him that, or
do you just call him Michael?

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:43.250
[? MALE SPEAKER: Michael. ?]

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.650
CAROL SANFORD: It's
just easier, right?

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:46.691
But I try to, and then I
mess it up all the time.

00:25:46.691 --> 00:25:48.730
But I feel like I had
good intentions, right?

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:54.110
[LAUGH] On the fourth
one here, the paradigm

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.800
of the headman or
headwoman is working

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.540
on governing agreements.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.520
And again, I have the story
of Google and Larry Page

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.010
here as just setting the
tone at the beginning

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:10.830
of the book about how it is
you can go public and actually

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.250
improve democracy
and capitalism.

00:26:13.497 --> 00:26:15.830
Do you tell that story when
you hire people or interview

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:16.329
people?

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.085
It's a phenomenal story about
how you decide to go public.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.280
Only 16 companies had actually
done the Dutch auction

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.260
in the US that Google
did before Google did it.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.764
Now that number is about
that number every year,

00:26:30.764 --> 00:26:32.180
but people are
still afraid of it.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.400
They don't understand
how it could work.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.752
So what happened
is that you take

00:26:36.752 --> 00:26:38.210
an agreement which
we already have.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.626
Larry didn't say, let's change
all the laws and the rules.

00:26:40.626 --> 00:26:42.360
He said, let's
use what we've got

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.240
and let's make it all change.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.800
The same thing happened
with the broadband,

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:52.130
with the analog, when Google bid
on something in order to-- I'm

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.860
told that the reason we
can keep our phone numbers

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.080
is because of what
Google did with the SEC.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.450
And that story is in the book.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.049
So you take the
governing agreements

00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:05.340
that already exist-- because
it's really hard to change

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.240
government, even through voting.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.485
We vote, and we
think, didn't we vote

00:27:10.485 --> 00:27:13.032
for different people who
would work on different stuff?

00:27:13.032 --> 00:27:14.240
And we don't always get them.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.140
So you have to learn to work
the governing agreement.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.630
So this book has stories of
people who are doing that.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:24.510
So I gave new names to these.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.650
So instead of warrior, clown,
hunter, headman, I said,

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.540
what are they working on?

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.420
And it turns out what the
warrior is working on is really

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.256
this seeing reality in a
way that we normally don't.

00:27:36.256 --> 00:27:37.880
And I've got a couple
of stories there.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.380
But the one story
I want to tell you

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.440
is the reconnection
entrepreneur.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.840
Kip Baratoff-- oh.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.020
Kip is quite an
amazing young man.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.700
And he decided that the social
system he wanted to change

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.000
was how economic
development happened along

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.790
the coast of Oregon,
where he lives.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.680
The fishermen were going out
of business left and right

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.324
who were there.

00:28:00.324 --> 00:28:02.490
All of the people that
supported them were going out

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:02.990
of business.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.450
They were creating
social systems

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.510
to give them money to
try and retrain them.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.930
Let's let you be something
else besides a fisherman.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.860
Let's let you be something else
besides a company that cans.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.180
Let's just move all of you
out of that and change it.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.194
And he said, but that
is a way to live.

00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:17.860
And on the coast,
it's really important.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.202
He created a cooperative.

00:28:21.202 --> 00:28:22.410
It's not a legal cooperative.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:28.740
Be but he brought together the
boat, the captain that fishes,

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.080
the fisher people who are
on the boat-- in fact,

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.640
the company's called Fish
People-- the people who can

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.940
and process, those
who distribute,

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.170
and those who sell
it, like Costco,

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:45.380
into an ongoing group that
meets together every other week

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.710
to look at the whole system.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.880
When you go to Costco,
you can actually

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.710
learn what they're doing with
any specific piece of fish.

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.400
Any of you shop at Costco ever?

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.496
So take your phone.

00:28:57.496 --> 00:28:59.120
It will look for Fish
People's package.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.480
You will see a QR code on it.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.420
It will you who the captain of
the boat was that caught that.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.910
It'll tell you who it
was that canned it.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.440
It'll tell you how
it was processed.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.090
It will even tell you what the
mercury and any other metals

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:12.720
content is in that piece of
fish you're about to buy.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.310
It has creating chaos in
Costco, because everybody

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:18.950
wants to know why is nobody else
doing what's happening here?

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.390
And it's rebuilding the
entire economic development

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:23.910
structure around the
fishing industry,

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.460
rather than trying to solve the
problem, which was retraining

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.605
them, giving them money
to get them through.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.410
And they're figuring out how
to do sustainable fishing.

00:29:33.787 --> 00:29:35.870
I don't think we have
Google buying from them yet,

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:38.357
but it just occurred to me,
we should talk about them.

00:29:38.357 --> 00:29:39.190
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.750
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.070
CAROL SANFORD: Yeah.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:41.810
And I actually was thinking
when we were in Austin

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.230
that I was going to have
Michael talking to him,

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:43.860
and that didn't work.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.568
So you and I will have
that conversation.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.410
So isn't that an
interesting story?

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:50.750
Now, this guy got
this idea while he

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:54.379
was living in a yurt in the
middle of winter in Yellowstone

00:29:54.379 --> 00:29:55.795
for nine months
to figure out what

00:29:55.795 --> 00:29:57.540
he wanted to do with his life.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:01.980
Because he had been a Goldman
Sachs, very successful,

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.042
analyst.

00:30:03.042 --> 00:30:04.750
And he said, I don't
have enough meaning.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.910
I still need to make money, but
I need to make meaning also.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.869
And he said, I think
I'm going to go find out

00:30:09.869 --> 00:30:11.160
how to do economic development.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.420
There's a long story
between it, and I

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.290
tell you a little bit
of it in the book.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.873
But that's the kind of stories
I'm talking about in this book.

00:30:16.873 --> 00:30:21.000
And then Michael, he
was sitting in Starwood

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.760
before he came here.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.520
And the stories
that I was really

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.260
touched by when I met
Michael were how much

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.370
he saw intelligence in
things that most people saw

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:31.260
as a problem.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.150
You may know this story.

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:38.521
When he was in Starwood,
many of the people

00:30:38.521 --> 00:30:40.020
were coming up from
the Middle East.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.160
And he also had responsibility
for the Middle East

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.800
and Europe for Starwood
Resorts for food.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.090
Many of those people who
were coming up obviously

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.800
did not speak the language
in the European Union

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.377
very well, wherever they were.

00:30:52.377 --> 00:30:53.960
Other people thought
they were stupid.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.590
Michael said, no, no.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.210
Language has nothing
to do-- you know,

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.270
speaking another language has
nothing do with intelligence.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:02.670
Give people work to do.

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.520
Find ways to put translators.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:10.190
And he rebuilt the entire
service system for Starwood

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:12.364
based on using
language as a leverage

00:31:12.364 --> 00:31:14.530
and giving people the ability
to learn the language.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.960
So he actually started thinking
about that kind of global ship

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.490
before he got here.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.110
He's an amazing human being,
and there's more of his stories

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.690
and even of his
childhood in this book.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:29.300
So what I would like to do
is ask a few of you who had--

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.130
and maybe the same
three who volunteered,

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.925
if you're willing--
to ask which industry

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:40.161
or which arena do you think
you might want to affect if you

00:31:40.161 --> 00:31:41.660
were going to work
on the diversity.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.080
Because if you
change an industry,

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.260
you have to go work on
getting the best product.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.150
Everybody sees you out
in front as the lead.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:52.015
And then you have to
use that platform.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.650
And if it's a social
system, you've

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:57.050
got to figure out how to
intervene, like Kip did,

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:59.520
in a way that goes and
works on a system, not just

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.940
a piece of something.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.860
And the education system is
deeply in need of somebody

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.520
figuring out how to intervene
in the education system.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.030
How would you, Brian, intervene?

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:10.775
Do you know how you'd
intervene for the access?

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:16.209
I'm going to go back so you
can see what those [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:16.209 --> 00:32:18.625
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] similar
to your thoughts [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:21.796
story where I had a meeting with
manufacturers maybe five or six

00:32:21.796 --> 00:32:27.360
years ago, and asked them if
they saw a pipeline directly

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.085
into factories, particularly
in China, where they could see

00:32:32.085 --> 00:32:34.750
what was being manufactured,
and at least [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.460
CAROL SANFORD: Wow.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:38.020
Yeah.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.266
AUDIENCE: They laughed
at me, because we're not

00:32:40.266 --> 00:32:41.993
anywhere close to
that point, but it

00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:43.076
sounds like a [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.460
CAROL SANFORD: Well,
other persons are.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.852
Industries are not.

00:32:47.852 --> 00:32:49.810
But, you know, I think
there is an opportunity.

00:32:50.992 --> 00:32:52.450
I don't know how
you'd play it out,

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:53.616
but I love that you can see.

00:32:53.616 --> 00:32:56.400
You can actually help shift
an industry just by talking--

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.700
and I think Google
does that, generally.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.224
So that's very good.

00:33:00.224 --> 00:33:01.640
Do you have any
thoughts about how

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.777
you'd intervene in
the education system

00:33:03.777 --> 00:33:04.860
to work with young people?

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.760
What would you do?

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.220
How would you up-end
that industry?

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.710
Because it is an
industry, right?

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.970
It's like producing widgets.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:12.920
Get the kids out.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.430
Give them a test.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.000
No Child Left Behind, but
all of them are left behind.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.083
CAROL SANFORD: Yeah.

00:33:19.702 --> 00:33:21.410
Do you think about it
off and on, though?

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:22.900
When I ask you
what would you work

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.770
on, that was one of the
thoughts you had, right?

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.200
Does anybody else think
about how would you

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:26.949
work on education?

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:30.750
Anybody know?

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:31.877
Where would you intervene?

00:33:31.877 --> 00:33:33.960
If you were going to be a
responsible entrepreneur

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.730
and you were going to
intervene and save us

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.760
from what we're
doing with education.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.176
AUDIENCE: Jamie
Oliver is probably

00:33:41.176 --> 00:33:42.632
a good example [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.732
Impacting the school
systems and trying

00:33:48.732 --> 00:33:51.904
to take that route to
make inroads, which

00:33:51.904 --> 00:33:53.368
seems from the
outside looking in,

00:33:53.368 --> 00:33:54.990
the easiest way to
do it, [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.080
CAROL SANFORD: And
what do you think

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.710
is the essence of
what Jamie's doing?

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:01.030
What is it that makes-- because
he is being very powerful,

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:04.330
along with Louis, helping
him make that happen.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:05.430
What is he doing--

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:06.971
AUDIENCE: He's
disrupting everything.

00:34:07.471 --> 00:34:09.350
CAROL SANFORD: He's
disrupting-- yeah.

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:12.200
He's making things also
very concrete and practical,

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:12.700
isn't he?

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.855
So kids learn while cooking--
and adults, families, learn.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:20.280
So I think there is a
piece of information

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.340
tied to practice that he does.

00:34:23.351 --> 00:34:25.100
So that would stay
with what you're doing.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:25.980
What else do you see?

00:34:28.235 --> 00:34:29.110
What else do you see?

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.480
How would you work?

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.139
What would you
work on if you were

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:33.500
working on improving diversity?

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.684
Because we're doing a terrible
job of that in the US overall.

00:34:38.825 --> 00:34:39.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:41.398 --> 00:34:52.695
[INAUDIBLE] program
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:52.695 --> 00:34:54.570
CAROL SANFORD: For all
schools, all children.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:55.195
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:56.235 --> 00:34:59.700
And even with technology
and [INAUDIBLE],

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.165
we can use this virtual system,
with the internet [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.115
I'm thinking like
an example, here.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.560
Like the US and China or India.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.530
You don't need to be in
the same physical location.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:20.985
[INAUDIBLE] system [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:24.787 --> 00:35:26.870
CAROL SANFORD: So the
exposure and the connection,

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.200
where people begin to feel
real, is one of the ways

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:29.920
we can move that.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.860
That's how that cultural
paradigm's going to move.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.710
I did something very
interesting in South Africa.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.110
Because one of the
constitutional mandates

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:42.370
was that the leadership of
the business, top management,

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:46.837
had to reflect the population,
which was 97% black Africans.

00:35:46.837 --> 00:35:48.670
And guess what the top
management of Colgate

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.860
looked like when we got there?

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:54.360
Of course it was
97% white Africans.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.250
But what we said to them is,
no one is going to lose a job.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.560
What we want to do is be able
to have you become resources,

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.650
and we want to be able to meet
that mandate in six months.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:08.040
We only lost one person
who didn't want to play,

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.400
because Staleo Sasos,
the leader of it,

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.860
said I want to build a
great country while we

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.510
build a great company.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.290
We did one other thing,
which is we looked

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.910
to ask each person about
their essence, what

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.660
they were attracted
to working on.

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:23.040
And instead of trying to do
diversity programs-- because

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.207
we had eight tribes in here.

00:36:26.207 --> 00:36:28.290
And believe it or not,
there was this much warring

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.890
between eight black African
tribes as there was here.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.190
But having each
person look at essence

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:37.122
got us, instead of looking at
classes or races of people,

00:36:37.122 --> 00:36:38.455
looking at each person uniquely.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.120
So we're running out of time.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.990
I am going to ask if you have
anything you want to ask me.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:45.920
I've been asking you
questions, and I'm

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.337
willing to answer one or
two, if you have something

00:36:48.337 --> 00:36:49.670
you think I could help you with.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.460
And by the way, I'm happy
to talk beyond this.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.970
If you guys take on these
things you just talked about,

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:58.150
I would love to talk with
you to support you doing it.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:59.945
Is there anything
people want to ask me?

00:36:59.945 --> 00:37:01.861
MALE SPEAKER: Obviously
after some of the work

00:37:01.861 --> 00:37:03.895
you've been doing with
the food [INAUDIBLE],

00:37:03.895 --> 00:37:05.770
I think there's so much
great stuff to share.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:08.590
And it's tough to do
within the 45-minute slot.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.615
But what's been some of
the most exciting things

00:37:11.615 --> 00:37:14.727
that you had the
opportunity to partner

00:37:14.727 --> 00:37:17.721
with Michael to [INAUDIBLE] some
of the game changing things?

00:37:17.721 --> 00:37:19.679
And I think it goes back
to the Innovation Lab.

00:37:19.679 --> 00:37:22.362
So what are some of the exciting
projects that you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:22.362 --> 00:37:24.570
CAROL SANFORD: Well, of
course the one I'm closest to

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.028
is the community
of practice that's

00:37:26.028 --> 00:37:32.170
related to ecosystems, with
Pie Ranch and the other ranches

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:33.500
which are becoming involved.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.940
But what I really love about
that is the mix of views.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:41.605
So we have people who are
looking at farm to table-- farm

00:37:41.605 --> 00:37:43.280
to family, I guess it is.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.290
We have people who are
looking at farm to table,

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.210
which is insight into Google.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:52.706
But the fun part is many of
those groups have now created--

00:37:52.706 --> 00:37:54.080
it's fun for me,
I think it's fun

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.260
for them-- have created
a person in a role,

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.430
like bon appetit, who
is calling himself

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.290
the responsible
business coordinator.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:02.780
So they're making
sure that people

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:06.150
are asking the questions,
do we keep the user in mind?

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.440
Are we really paying
attention to keeping everybody

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.432
who works here connected
to it, and feeling

00:38:10.432 --> 00:38:12.390
like their own uniqueness
can be brought to it?

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.860
And some of you, I'm sure,
are being affected by that.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.890
Obviously Google is
so paying attention

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:17.966
to regenerate the Earth.

00:38:17.966 --> 00:38:20.590
And, by the way, sustainability
isn't even close enough for me.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.790
If you read my other book,
I trash sustainability.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:23.900
Sorry.

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.330
Because it's all
about doing less bad,

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.870
and it's not really about-- I
mean, Earth has an agreement.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.480
And she would love for us,
every time we took resources,

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.710
to improve her
health and vitality,

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.120
not just do a little less harm.

00:38:36.979 --> 00:38:39.520
And we, of course, have Google
Maps who are involved in that.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.330
So we're actually
able to begin to see

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:44.140
how that's influencing
where we are.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.052
We went to Stockholm
and connected

00:38:46.052 --> 00:38:47.510
with people from
all over the world

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:49.630
to show them what
Google was doing--

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.920
information being spread.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.500
We had people from Asia as
well as all over Africa--

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.960
I don't think we had any
South Americans there.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.340
Watching that is very exciting.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.400
I do also enjoy the
people who are looking

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.230
at the eating environment
and how that influences

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.520
the choices we made, and how
do we improve people's choice.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.500
So I know there's so many good
things going on in that lab.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.070
And I don't know whether that's
how all innovation labs turn

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.220
out for Google, but
that one, I think,

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.650
is going to make a profound
difference-- a really

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:17.950
profound difference.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:19.332
Anything I should add to that?

00:39:19.332 --> 00:39:21.040
I'm so immersed in it
now, I've kind of--

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.218
AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:21.218 --> 00:39:22.480
I was just trying to get
your perspective on it,

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.021
because the lab's
only been happening

00:39:24.021 --> 00:39:25.550
for a few years [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:27.390
It's getting some great
momentum behind it.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.056
CAROL SANFORD: Are
you hearing about it?

00:39:29.056 --> 00:39:31.617
Are you hearing about the
lab, the innovation lab?

00:39:31.617 --> 00:39:32.116
No?

00:39:32.116 --> 00:39:32.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:32.880
CAROL SANFORD: OK.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.670
Well, there's a little bit
about it in the new book,

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:36.190
so you can read some of that.

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:38.220
And I think we're ramping
up some more stories.

00:39:39.311 --> 00:39:39.810
All right.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.780
So I feel like I should
say thank you to all of you

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.510
for coming.

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:45.286
I think you will
love this book, not

00:39:45.286 --> 00:39:47.660
just because I wrote it--
because you should know the way

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:48.820
I write books is
that I dictate them,

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.620
and I have brilliant
people who then

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:53.580
make it shorter sentences
and all that kind of stuff.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.600
But the people in
this book are amazing,

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.700
including [? Michael ?]
[? Bacher ?].

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.120
So thank you all for coming.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.570
And if you'd like for me to
sign your book, please stay

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.919
and I'm happy to do that for
another 15 minutes or so.

00:40:03.919 --> 00:40:05.210
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you, Carol.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:06.251
CAROL SANFORD: Thank you.

00:40:06.251 --> 00:40:07.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you.
