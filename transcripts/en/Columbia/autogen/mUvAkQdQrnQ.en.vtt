how does the idea of region then changes

01:37:57.090 --> 01:37:57.100
how does the idea of region then changes
 

01:37:57.100 --> 01:37:59.160
how does the idea of region then changes

just to give I guess one example I would

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:11.650
just to give I guess one example I would
 

01:38:11.650 --> 01:38:14.910
just to give I guess one example I would
have used the example of the

01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:14.920
have used the example of the

very section actually there is a
 

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:21.360

Smithson's replicated and their two
 

01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:36.090
Smithson's replicated and their two
sides so is seen as something which can

be replicated seven it becomes a pattern

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:37.690

and which I think one cannot you gives a

01:38:41.490 --> 01:38:41.500

very different idea of region is

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:42.760
very different idea of region is
 

01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:44.190
very different idea of region is
something a continuous transforming

01:38:44.190 --> 01:38:44.200
something a continuous transforming
 

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.980
something a continuous transforming
dynamic so I wonder in your examples how

01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:46.990
dynamic so I wonder in your examples how
 

01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:48.570
dynamic so I wonder in your examples how
would you characterize the

01:38:48.570 --> 01:38:48.580
would you characterize the
 

01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:50.850
would you characterize the
transformation in the conception of

01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520
 

01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:01.880
okay so in the case of Lisbon we don't

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:01.890
okay so in the case of Lisbon we don't
 

01:39:01.890 --> 01:39:05.840
okay so in the case of Lisbon we don't
have regions and we didn't have regions

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:05.850
have regions and we didn't have regions
 

01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:11.720
have regions and we didn't have regions
in 1967 or in 1940 which is an

01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:11.730
in 1967 or in 1940 which is an
 

01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:15.380
in 1967 or in 1940 which is an
interesting debate we have two levels of

01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:15.390
interesting debate we have two levels of
 

01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:17.240
interesting debate we have two levels of
government the national level and the

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:17.250
government the national level and the
 

01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:21.580
government the national level and the
municipal level and this tension is

01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:21.590
municipal level and this tension is
 

01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:24.290
municipal level and this tension is
really something to be a little bit

01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:24.300
really something to be a little bit
 

01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:29.810
really something to be a little bit
explored like I said the in 1964 we had

01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820
explored like I said the in 1964 we had
 

01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.660
explored like I said the in 1964 we had
the first regional plan it was called

01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:32.670
the first regional plan it was called
 

01:39:32.670 --> 01:39:35.000
the first regional plan it was called
like that plane delayed or delusion

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:35.010
like that plane delayed or delusion
 

01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:38.120
like that plane delayed or delusion
which were really the directive plan for

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:38.130
which were really the directive plan for
 

01:39:38.130 --> 01:39:39.590
which were really the directive plan for
the region of Lisbon they call it

01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600
the region of Lisbon they call it
 

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:42.560
the region of Lisbon they call it
breached reaching nowadays we call it a

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:42.570
breached reaching nowadays we call it a
 

01:39:42.570 --> 01:39:46.250
breached reaching nowadays we call it a
metropolitan area institutionalized by

01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260
metropolitan area institutionalized by
 

01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:48.380
metropolitan area institutionalized by
decree but with really very little

01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:48.390
decree but with really very little
 

01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:51.170
decree but with really very little
powers so there is no metropolitan level

01:39:51.170 --> 01:39:51.180
powers so there is no metropolitan level
 

01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:55.810
powers so there is no metropolitan level
or regional level of power but you are

01:39:55.810 --> 01:39:55.820
or regional level of power but you are
 

01:39:55.820 --> 01:40:01.190
or regional level of power but you are
making a distinction between how this

01:40:01.190 --> 01:40:01.200
making a distinction between how this
 

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:04.160
making a distinction between how this
regional approach could be into seen as

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:04.170
regional approach could be into seen as
 

01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:08.900
regional approach could be into seen as
a corrective for a more proactive form

01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:08.910
a corrective for a more proactive form
 

01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:12.410
a corrective for a more proactive form
of development of planning for instance

01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:12.420
of development of planning for instance

i would say that in the case of lisbon

01:40:15.110 --> 01:40:15.120
i would say that in the case of lisbon
 

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:20.890

corrective instrument to accommodate for
a very fast growing expansion of the

a very fast growing expansion of the

a very fast growing expansion of the

that almost almost like the Soviet

five-year planning but in this case

01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:01.800
five-year planning but in this case

industrialization so the region was

01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:15.750
industrialization so the region was
 

01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:20.870

national government and local
 

01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:26.870
national government and local
governments but without having really an

governments but without having really an
 

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:30.630
governments but without having really an
institutional level of authority so it

01:41:30.630 --> 01:41:30.640
institutional level of authority so it
 

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.950
institutional level of authority so it
was always something in between the

01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960
was always something in between the

in abilities to control development and
 

01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:44.220
in abilities to control development and
the local level which was very fable

01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:44.230
the local level which was very fable
 

01:41:44.230 --> 01:41:46.770
the local level which was very fable
which was very weak municipal power was

which was very weak municipal power was
very weak and it was met all much about
