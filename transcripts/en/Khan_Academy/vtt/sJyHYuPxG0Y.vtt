00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.570
- Well, we've actually trained athletes,

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.810
you can say on the, sort of,
academic side of training.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.040
You would not have necessarily imagined,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.050
and guess what, it improves
their performance on the field.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.970
Well, it's happening for a couple reasons.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.190
One reason is that
you're training a person

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.459
to be more alert, more on
the ball, more engaged,

00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:20.420
and then you're heavily
exercising machinery

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.875
in the brain that's controlling
its capacity to learn.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:26.160
It's an interesting thing
about athletic training.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.113
Focus is massively on the body.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.160
And that's sort of in the level
of professional athletics,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.190
that's sort of to the peak.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.520
I mean, how could you
improve a great athlete

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.600
on the professional level physically?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.540
But, they're all improvable cognitively.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.020
They're all improvable in here.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.250
Then you still have a ways
to go by training in here.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.470
How about smarter?

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.790
How about quicker in
their decision-making?

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.990
How about seeing more and
responding to it more accurately?

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.770
Logic, reasoning, and
the brain receiver itself

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.580
that's controlling
learning are all improving.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.530
Now, I'm gonna use my brain
for some other purpose,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.210
maybe some very different purpose.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.710
Maybe I'm gonna throw or catch a baseball.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.390
It matters.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.110
I now have a different machine than I had

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.823
before I spent all of
that time in the class.

00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:15.813
On the Kahn Academy class.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.240
You have a different and better brain

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.940
and it will matter to you.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.690
It will count on the positive
side for the point of view

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.370
of your neurological
capacities, of course.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.620
You have this resource.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.810
Every one of us has this resource.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.300
How effectively are you using it?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.540
And I wish every young person,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.900
I wish every adult could understand

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.480
that they're probably under
utilizing this resource, right?

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.200
And undervaluing it.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.050
Best way to throw away this asset

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.923
is just to accept the fact
that you have some dark fate,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.550
that means you have no real potential

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.052
because that's who you are.

00:01:52.052 --> 00:01:56.763
What a silly and scientifically
incorrect attitude that is.
