00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.970
My name is Robin Kelsey, and
I'm Dean of Arts and Humanities

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.300
and a professor in the History
of Art and Architecture

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.990
Department.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.870
And it is my great
pleasure to welcome you

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.310
all here this evening.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.330
Because we have two authors with
us, two books, much to discuss,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.120
I'm going to keep my opening
remarks and my introductions

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.540
of the speakers
very, very brief.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.270
I would just say
that in recent years

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.320
it has become clear that
one of the issues upon which

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.940
the humanities need to
train their attention

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.040
is on the very
issue of attention.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.330
As teachers, we are witnessing
a generational shift

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.590
in the conditions of
attention, a shift

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.950
riddled with societal anxiety
about failures of attention,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.100
about deficits and disorders.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.080
And at Harvard, we
have concentrations.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.520
But really, who can concentrate?

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.230
This evening, we will take some
time to talk about distraction.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.970
I think it's the perfect
end-of-semester topic.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.140
Those of you who have been good
enough to join us this evening

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.690
can hardly be asked to give your
full attention to this event.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.460
You should give whatever
fraction seems right to you.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.400
Hewing to the spirit
of this topic,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.040
our conversation
may wend and wander.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.130
It can dive a gate
down cul-de-sacs,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.250
or drift off into reverie.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.170
Very excited-- at least
part of me is anyway.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.990
So we have two wonderful
scholars with us this evening

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.310
to help us to come to terms
with our inconstant attentions.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.430
I'm going to
introduce them both,

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.470
and then each will
come up in turn

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.460
to talk about their
most recent book, which

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.870
is in one manner or another
addressing the topic at hand.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.490
So I'm going to start with
Marina Van Zuylen, who

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.160
joins us from Bard College.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.790
Marina is Professor of French
and Comparative Literature

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.040
at Bard, and also serves as
the national academic director

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.350
of the Clemente Course
in the Humanities,

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.900
a program with which some
of you may be familiar.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.290
It's an amazing program
that brings the humanities

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.070
to low-income adults.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.130
Barack Obama has already
thanked her personally

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.280
for this service.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.610
But I think we should add our
own gratitude on this occasion.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.240
She is the author of a lovely
new small volume entitled

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.580
The Plenitude of Distraction.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.040
And indeed there is a
plenitude of thinking in it,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.720
despite its very handy size.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.680
She is also the author of
two wonderful other books--

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.620
Difficulty as an
Aesthetic Principle--

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.340
Realism and Unreadability
in Stifter, Melville,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.910
and Flaubert; and a book
I particularly love--

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.000
Monomania-- the Flight
from Everyday Life

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.780
in Literature and Art.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.680
With us also is John Plotz, who
is the professor of Victorian

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.190
literature at
Brandeis University,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.000
author of a new book
entitled Semi-Detached--

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.095
the Aesthetics of Virtual
Experience Since Dickens.

00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:50.530
He is also the author of
two other wonderful books--

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.160
The Crowd-- British Literature
and Public Politics,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.140
and Portable Property--

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.550
Victorian Culture on the Move.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.580
And I understand he has also
written a young adult novel.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.470
Maybe we'll hear about that.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.050
Neither Marina nor John
is a stranger to Harvard.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.032
But I'd like to welcome
them back very warmly

00:04:12.032 --> 00:04:12.740
on this occasion.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.360
OK.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.099
Can you hear me?

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.640
Yeah, really?

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.870
Because I can't hear myself.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.630
Oh, yeah, OK.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.470
Very good.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.680
Thank you so much for coming.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.450
It's unbelievable
that you're all here.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.310
I wouldn't get out of
bed with this cold,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.120
but I'm glad you did.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.820
First of all, I
want to thank Robin.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.710
I want to thank Steve.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.310
I want to thank John also
for writing this book, which

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.090
is, you know, when I was
asked, I thought, whoa,

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.070
I wrote this tiny thing,
which I call my pamphlet.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.210
And he writes this.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.340
And I'm thinking, my
god, he's so lucky.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.270
He gets on later.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.600
But actually I love
every page of this book.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.720
So I really recommend it.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.590
And it reads a little bit like
a Victorian novel sometimes.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.090
All right.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.920
So let me begin.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.290
I'm going to just introduce
succinctly, I hope,

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.390
what my book is about.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.830
So I decided to write this
book after I taught a class

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.370
on promoting good idleness.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.680
And many of the
students in this class

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.650
confessed to me that
they were on Adderall,

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.760
and they were on Ritalin, and
they let me on to the fact

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.220
that their pills made them feel
overly focused, helping them

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.270
maybe get better results on
their papers, on their exams,

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.970
but robbing them
of the pleasures

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.110
and intellectual enrichment
of delayed gratification.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.160
They told me that they
missed the open time

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.460
that they thought
should be associated

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.010
with novels and poetry.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.840
The class turned out to be an
unexpected exercise in soul

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.490
searching about the connection
between success, media,

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.870
technology, and the
lost art of slowness.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.950
It also reminded me,
while I was enrolling

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.620
the students of this
class, it reminded me

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.920
of my first really hugely
traumatic experience,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.730
which happened many, many,
many years ago at Harvard

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:35.160
as a freshman when, after taking
some little test the first day,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.410
I was told that my reading
skills were particularly poor--

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.470
how great for the
self-esteem right away--

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.920
and that I would have to
enroll in Harvard's very

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.460
special speed-reading class.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.370
The first morning,
about a hundred of us,

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.540
looking very sheepish-- and
none of us told our families--

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.840
so we sat in this
huge amphitheater.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.730
It was the Science Center.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.760
And large chunks of text were
projected on a giant screen.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.720
The instructions were clear.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.300
We needed to distill
what we read,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.780
and answer pointed
questions in order

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.560
to indicate that we had
grasped the argument.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.200
There was an obnoxious person
next to me, this woman speed

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.340
reader who spoke so fast that I
couldn't imagine for one second

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.530
that she needed to
take this class.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.170
And she looked at me,
and she said, oh, I

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.170
understand that you're a
Russian literature major.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.290
Well, this class is going
to benefit you immensely,

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.530
because you will be able to
read The Brothers Karamazov

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.490
in a fraction of the time.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.150
I was, needless
to say, horrified.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.870
Who is this person?

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:53.990
And she came from Belgium.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.940
And, I mean, I came from
France, so there was already

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.470
this tension between us.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.290
So this horrible
experience was decades

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.990
before the various
slow movements

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.030
were encouraging
people to linger

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.000
over their foods
and their futures.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.700
We had no computers
back then, remember?

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.330
And we would never have dreamt
of something I hope never

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.870
have heard of, which is
Google's Popular Passages,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.300
a program that lets you
explore a book in 10 seconds,

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.130
pointing out what really
is important when we read.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.070
Naturally, no literature
lover could either

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.559
have designed either
Google program,

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:41.190
or that atrocious speed-reading
class, which actually

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.650
never helped me in the least.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.190
So Darwin, as you
will see, would

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.040
have been the first
objector to this kind

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.550
of traumatic
speed-reading experience.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:09:00.240
In this stunning entry from
his journal from May 1st, 1881,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:06.000
he bitterly concludes
that extreme focus

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.790
can be dangerous-- in fact,
more dangerous than distraction.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.390
His extreme focus on
evolution, he writes,

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:21.580
ended up shriveling his brain,
shutting out his favorite poets

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:27.460
and musicians, and impairing
for good his judgment of taste.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.040
I'm going to read
you a passage which

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.275
is really heartbreaking
and beautiful from Darwin's

00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:33.775
journal.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.400
"Up to the age of 30 or beyond
it, poetry of many kinds

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.360
gave me great pleasure,
and even as a schoolboy

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.450
I took intense delight
in Shakespeare.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:53.430
I have also said that formerly
pictures gave me considerable--

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.400
and music very great-- delight.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.610
I have tried lately
to read Shakespeare,

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:06.030
and found it so intolerably
dull that it nauseated me.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:11.280
"I have also almost lost my
taste for pictures or music.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.930
My mind--" then pay
attention to this,

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.810
because it's quite
heartbreaking--

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.640
"My mind seems to have
become a kind of machine

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:27.750
for grinding general laws out
of large collections of fact.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.470
But why this should have
caused the atrophy of that part

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:36.030
of the brain alone on which
the higher tastes depend,

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.910
I cannot conceive.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.730
"If I had to live
my life again, I

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.910
would have made a rule
to read some poetry

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.960
and listen to some music
at least once a week."

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.830
Once a week.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.800
That is really
pitiful, Mr. Darwin.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.176
Once an hour.

00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:56.550
Well, he hated
leaving his house.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.180
He did.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.470
That's true.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:04.800
"The loss of these tastes," he
adds, "is a loss of happiness,

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.790
and may possibly be
injurious to the intellect,

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.580
and more probably to
the moral character."

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.740
So if losing one's train of
thought is such a bad thing,

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.680
then why didn't
evolution fix it,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.240
providing us with a
steel-like concentration?

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.740
Could it be that destruction
grants us actually

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.940
a secret survivalist weapon?

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:39.510
Unlike our primate siblings,
with their fierce capacity

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.100
for fending off enemies,
finding food, securing shelter,

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.150
we are programmed, for
better or for worse,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.750
for making light
of our condition.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.290
As the great anthropologist
Albert Piette--

00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:00.000
P-I-E-T-T-E; he should be
world famous, and he's not--

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.750
as Albert Piette notes,
as opposed to gorillas

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.810
and chimpanzee,
being human means

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:11.640
to inhabit a presence
absence mode,

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.760
to practice detached
attentiveness,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.340
letting the minor and
major modes coexist.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.000
This minimalism, he
writes, allows us never

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.300
to get too deep
into things, dipping

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.690
as we are in
activities peripheral

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.390
to the situation at hand.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:37.590
So what can we learn from
the fact that only humans can

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.550
be simultaneously
absent and present,

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.930
detached and connected--

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.920
thank you-- active and passive.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.680
I think it is, because we
daydream, zone out, lose

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.490
our thread of a conversation,
that we can perhaps

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.760
stop ourselves from
being fanatics,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.690
forget the harshest
blows, and move on.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.020
Many of you surely
remember a comment

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.070
Primo Levi made in If This
is a Man, where he suggests

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:16.170
that the paradoxical view
that divided attention might

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.550
have done more good
than harm in Auschwitz.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.330
Despite his unthinkable
misery, Levi

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:29.820
felt grateful that at least
on one fateful day the wind

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.820
was not blowing too hard.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:39.210
So what do we make of the
fact that only Homo sapiens

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.560
is capable of the kind
of existential detachment

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.150
that tolerates an idea that
goes nowhere, a thought that

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.820
is never carried through?

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.920
The upside of this
is that we will

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.210
endure, far better
than primates,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:01.620
a weirdly constructive
cognitive blurriness.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.640
So what if we can concentrate
on our work all the time?

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.300
I know we're worried about that.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.990
We're worried every time
we look at our telephone.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.880
We're worried every time
we Google John Plotz.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.370
Oh, that's how I recognized
you-- because I googled you.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.600
So swaying between
crucial or less crucial

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:27.120
occurrences may well constitute
strength, and not weakness--

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.560
a very idiosyncratic type
of intellectual creativity,

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.240
one that feeds on
divided attention,

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.820
and helps us balance the
playful and the tragic.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.270
You all have read that
neurologists experimenting

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.480
on ways people
solve problems note

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.810
that our best chance of
getting something right,

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:56.350
getting a solution, is
to indulge in downtime.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:01.830
As you know, Nietzsche never had
an idea without perambulating.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.560
He needed to walk aimlessly.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.520
He needed to daydream
and to get lost in order

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.740
to have that thought
that was somewhere

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.110
in the back of its mind.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.900
Indeed, putting
the riddle at rest,

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.840
and storing it at the
back of our minds,

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.290
rather than focusing
on it ad nauseam

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:26.580
liberates the
circuitry of thinking.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:32.400
Hume's wonderful formula,
the storehouse of labor,

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.880
recalibrates perfectly
the dichotomy

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.320
between work and play,
attention and inattention.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.300
Thinking in a straight line,
monitoring our every thought,

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.040
is basically a losing battle
more and more, and we know it.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.980
Our innate way of relating
to our surroundings,

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.180
and to our own thinking
patterns, is non-directed.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:02.670
Trapped by competing sensory
and intellectual stimuli

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:07.560
we are, and it is,
essentially absent-minded.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.310
Tristram Shandy's meandering
account of his birth

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.420
is a case in point.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.200
The more Sterne's
protagonist attempts

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.730
to control the intricacies
of his own autobiography,

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:25.950
the more facts keep creeping in,
crowding his initial narrative,

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:30.120
until it loses its
shape altogether.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.810
But let's go back to
David Hume for a moment--

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.240
the wonderful David Hume.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:42.930
Hume cultivated an associative
random playful relationship

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:47.340
to things as part of
a desire to stray away

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.550
from this straight line,
and experience life

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:56.820
as a series of rich,
disconnected moments.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.990
To begin with, Hume's
resistance to single-mindedness

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:05.640
coincides with a
warm-blooded engagement

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.510
with worldly matters.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:12.210
While concentration seems to him
solipsistic and self-involved,

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:17.880
distraction, he muses provides
kinship and community.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.940
Let's think about that
when we're suicidally

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.670
looking at our text messages.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:28.170
This is what he writes, and
it's one of my favorite quotes.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:31.620
"I dine-- he writes
that when he was just

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.730
monomaniacally attempting
to disprove Descartes.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.800
And he just hated Descartes.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.489
But he got so
obsessed by Descartes

00:17:39.489 --> 00:17:41.280
that he thought, how
am I going to get away

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.160
from this French, crazy man?

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.650
I will play backgammon.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.470
I mean, maybe that's what we
should be doing right now.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:50.700
This is what he writes--

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.940
"I dine, I play a
game of backgammon,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.180
I converse, I merry
with my friends.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.570
And when, after the three
or four hours of amusement,

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.710
I would return to these
Cartesian speculations.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.450
They appear so cold, so
strained, ridiculous,

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:14.640
that I cannot find in my heart
to enter into them any farther.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.240
I still feel such remains
of my former disposition

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.940
that I am ready to
throw all my books

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.250
and papers into the fire"--

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.470
please don't do that,
you graduate students

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.690
with your dissertations--

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:31.890
"and resolve never more to
renounce the pleasure of life

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.400
for the sake of reasoning
and philosophy."

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.130
So, unlike many of us
beating ourselves up

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:44.010
for neglecting reasoning, and
overindulging in play or text

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:49.260
messages, Hume embraces
banter and backgammon

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.100
as therapies against
excessive focus.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.970
So, excessive focus is
worse than distraction.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.250
Take comfort in that.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.010
Excessive focus is the enemy.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.990
Playing devil's advocate to
Descartes's harsh critique

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.610
of impure reasoning,
ridiculing the propensity

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:16.030
to chase after
microcosmic dilemmas,

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:20.700
if philosophy promotes such
claustrophobic thinking,

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.290
then Hume would trade it
willfully and willingly

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.960
for an open conversation.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.400
It may be mildly amusing to
you to know that this small

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.840
pamphlet that I wrote--

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.080
I like calling it a pamphlet,
because really, I mean,

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.210
does this qualify as a book?

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.130
I don't think so.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.220
It's like bullion.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.170
It's like what?

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:42.910
Bullion.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:43.460
Oh, OK.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.700
All right.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:50.450
So this used to be 300
pages, and so boring.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.910
And I thought, really?

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:56.360
Am I going to torture
my friends who

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:02.450
are going to feel that they
have to read 300 pages of this?

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:06.000
And you did not make me bored.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.760
So maybe I should have
kept it at 300 pages.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.020
But I don't think so.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.680
But I decided to cut it down,
and to make it into something

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.990
that people may be
able to read while they

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.500
were sipping margarita.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.750
So one of the texts
that inspired me not

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:29.730
to bore my audience
is a wonderful quote

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.580
from Kierkegaard's Either/Or.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.680
This is Kierkegaard,
who is following

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.100
the vagaries of his
own mind, who is trying

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.070
to concentrate on a speaker.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.470
Just like you,
he's sitting there,

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:48.030
and he thinks he's just going
to die, or to fall asleep.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:52.530
And suddenly he is
jolted out of his slumber

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:56.430
by the least philosophical
part of the experience.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:01.800
He suddenly notices the
perspiration dripping down

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:06.000
this philosopher's
forehead and nose.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.770
I read to you.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.860
"There was a man
whose chatter I was

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.390
obliged to listen to because
of the circumstances."

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.850
God knows which circumstances.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.080
"On every occasion he was ready
with a little philosophical

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.920
lecture that was
extremely boring.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.770
"On the verge of
despair, I suddenly

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:33.720
discovered that the man
perspired exceptionally much

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.520
when he spoke.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.660
This perspiration now
absorbed my attention.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.800
I watched how the pearls
of perspiration collected

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:51.840
on his forehead, then united in
a rivulet, slid down his nose,

00:21:51.840 --> 00:22:00.150
and ended in a quivering
globula that remained suspended

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.820
at the end of his nose.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.630
From that moment on,
everything changed.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:10.710
I could even have the
delight of encourage

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.950
him to commence his
philosophical instructions

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:20.340
again, just in order to watch
the perspiration on his brow

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.620
and on his nose."

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.440
As he explains in the prologue
to this comical interlude,

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.400
Kierkegaard can be
fantastically funny.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.580
The secret of
pleasurable attention

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:37.170
is arbitrariness, often
the de-familiarized, even

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.390
inappropriate kind.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.090
Carried by playfulness
and irreverence,

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:46.540
Kierkegaard ended up
tolerating the trying

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:51.550
boredom of the situation.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.940
What the wonderful
Albert Piette saw

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.270
as our great hidden
strength, the ability

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:05.010
to be simultaneously
present and absent, Mister--

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:12.460
how could I call him;
brain-numbing and joy-killing--

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.400
Heidegger sees as our doom.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.490
Believe me, I love
Heidegger too, sometimes,

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:23.950
but boredom is something that to
him, as opposed to Kierkegaard,

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.080
is absolutely necessary.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.000
So let's not focus on
someone's perspiration

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.650
when we read Heidegger.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:37.480
In fact, Heidegger wants us
chained to our attention,

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.770
chained to our boredom,
advocating scrupulous

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:42.880
attentiveness.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.240
He berates his readers
for drifting off,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.390
for going after
short-term satisfaction.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:55.930
Focus must be redirected to
the delicate textures of moods.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.720
"Without boredom,"
warns Heidegger,

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.690
"we will go through
life like automata,

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.870
not experiencing
anything in depth.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:08.740
Time would be mindlessly
allowed to fly by, and be

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.330
frittered away.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.200
Only boredom, if fully
realized and grappled with,

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.180
will keep us
existentially alert."

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.080
We can debate this afterwards.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.430
I would like to finish, because
we only have a few minutes.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.860
I want to finish
with a marvelous

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.550
quote that my wonderful
niece, who just finished

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:36.180
her dissertation, and who
is doing a lot of googling,

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.700
I think, in her free time.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.280
She wrote to me and
said, for your lecture

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.360
you need to read this.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.710
And I have to confess, she
said, I got it off Wikipedia.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:53.370
So I am finishing this lecture
with a quote from Wikipedia.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.870
That's a pretty good
confession, right?

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.680
How often do we tell our
students that this is directly

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.340
from Wikipedia?

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.530
So "Adam Smith,
writes Wikipedia,

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:08.790
"was described by several of his
contemporaries and biographers

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.890
as comically absent-minded,
with peculiar habits of speech

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:20.400
and gait, and a smile of
inexpressible benignity.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.400
He was known to talk to
himself, a habit, that

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.010
began during his
childhood, and he

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:33.000
would smile in rapt conversation
with invisible companions.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.810
"According to one story,
Smith took one of his friends

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:40.590
on a tour of a tanning
factory, and while discussing

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:46.410
free trade, he walked into a
huge tanning pit, from which he

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:50.100
needed help to escape.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.280
He is also said to have
put bread and butter

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.300
into a teapot, drunk
the concoction,

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:03.390
and declared this is the worst
cup of tea I have ever had.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.930
According to another
account, Smith distractedly

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.420
went out walking
in his nightgown,

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.770
and ended up 15
miles outside of town

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:17.770
before nearby church bells
brought him back to reality."

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.640
So I just want to thank
you for being here.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.740
And if you don't
buy this book, do

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.560
try to get it on
Google's Popular Passage.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.000
Remember, it's a program that
will let you understand it

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.470
in 10 seconds.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.637
Thank you.

00:26:32.637 --> 00:26:36.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:38.741 --> 00:26:39.240
Sorry.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.370
So I'm going to hide behind
a PowerPoint a little bit.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.410
So, thank you so much,
Robin, for this event.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.720
And thanks to Sarah and to
Steve for organizing it.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.750
And Marina, thank you so much.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:52.810
It's great.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.950
I threatened that I was going
to read the Kierkegaard passage

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.330
from Marina's book
if she didn't.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.000
So it's like a Good Place
episode, or something.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.500
It's fantastic.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.306
So it is a really great
pleasure to be here tonight,

00:27:05.306 --> 00:27:06.930
and to take part in
what I look forward

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.110
to being just an open
conversation, and freewheeling.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.840
But like Marina, I'm going
to just talk a little bit

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.700
to set things up.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.310
So the way I would frame
it is that nowadays we

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:21.630
have diagnoses
like ADD, or ADHD,

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.960
and we have the account
of social media addiction,

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:29.820
or Google-itis, to anchor our
discussion of distraction.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.880
And so maybe we could think
about that amazing eyeball

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.570
as the figure for that.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.330
Though I have to
admit to me it has

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.240
kind of a Nordic Sauron vibe.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.190
It seems more hypervigilant
than distracted.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:46.350
But, you know, I
get it's the problem

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.540
of the skipping
eyeball, I guess.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.160
So we have that now in spades.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.920
But I mean, even when
I was growing up,

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.120
there were ways of
thinking about distraction

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.410
as a common problem.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:04.080
So I remember as a kid the Monty
Python sketch "Word Association

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.659
Football."

00:28:04.659 --> 00:28:06.450
I don't know how many
people remember this.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.300
But it's John Cleese telling
you-- it's very hard to do.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.160
I mean, I've never said
it out loud before,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.360
but I got the words.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.120
It's "Word association
football is a technique out

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:21.260
a living much used in the
practice makes perfect

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.630
of psychoanalysister
and brother,

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:29.190
and one that has occupied
piper the majority rule

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.520
of my attention squad by the
right number one, two, three,

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.920
four, the last five years."

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.300
So you get the idea.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.900
There, each word, or
even each syllable,

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.100
is kicking the distracted
brain or the distracted tongue

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.030
away down a fresh pathway
to some kind of fresh hell.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:52.350
So it's kind of like
language itself as clickbait,

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:56.340
that we're always capable of
being kicked sideways, even

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.160
in "technique out a living."

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.940
So in other words, there's
a very robust tradition

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.220
of understanding
distraction as kind

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.890
of free-range
mental peregrination

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.800
with, as Marina was
saying, with all its vices.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.110
So yes, new, Robin,
I totally agree.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.160
It is new.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.600
We have a new version of it.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.580
But then we also want
to think about how

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:23.220
much the new version of it is
akin to older versions of it.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:28.020
So those are recent diagnoses
that medicalize or burlesque

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:28.590
the state.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.170
But in the early
days of the church,

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:36.090
the desert fathers were
obsessed with acedia,

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:39.450
which sort of turns into
sloth or [? decedia ?]

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:43.650
in later ages as a deadly
sin, but originally is

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:46.170
the state of restlessness
and inability

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:47.850
either to work or to pray.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:50.310
So that's the
original noonday demon

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:54.150
is the demon that distracts you.

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:59.910
And later on here, in the
shadow of William James Hall,

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:03.690
it seems appropriate to recall
a line from his 1890 Principles

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.880
of Psychology, which
actually I have

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.280
to admit that I got not from
Wikipedia, but from Joshua

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.460
Cohen's new book,
called Attention.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.380
But maybe he got
it from Wikipedia.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.760
It's totally possible.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.740
"Attention is the
taking possession

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.920
of the mind in
clear and vivid form

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.120
of one out of what seems several
simultaneously possible objects

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.560
or trains of thought.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.820
It implies withdrawal from
some things in order to deal

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.210
effectively with others, and
is a condition which has a real

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:38.670
opposite in the confused,
dazed, scatterbrained state,

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.660
which in French is called--" and
I will just say it in English

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.500
"--distraction."

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:48.690
However, so there is
this account of attention

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:50.070
good, distraction bad.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:54.060
And clearly both of us here
are standing in front of you

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.770
to discuss ways--

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.420
other ways, maybe-- to
think about distraction,

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.080
and I think not
necessarily to praise it.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.470
I really don't want my teenagers
to see on Twitter that I'm

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.510
in favor of distraction.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.770
But at least not to bury it.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:12.450
So I thought the best
way to kick this off

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:16.410
is to take about 15
or maybe 20 minutes

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:20.100
to present the argument
of my book Semi-Detached.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.480
And Marina, in terms of the
amazing lapidary concision

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.110
of your book, I feel
like about my book

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.197
that there's I think
it's a Samuel Johnson

00:31:29.197 --> 00:31:31.530
line, I wrote a long letter,
because I did not have time

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:32.490
to write a short one.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:34.770
So I think you went ahead
and wrote the short one.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:38.040
But I kind of
wrote the long one.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:43.397
And it is about this
idea of semi-detachment.

00:31:43.397 --> 00:31:45.480
So I'm just going to talk
a little bit about that.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.300
When you half lose
yourself in a work of art,

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.330
what happens to the half
that is left behind?

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.570
The critical vocabulary
to describe that sensation

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:58.200
is lacking, but it's a
familiar feeling nonetheless.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.630
When most carried
away, audiences

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.550
of even the most
compelling artwork

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:06.570
remain somewhat aware of
their actual situation.

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:11.200
Ideas about this kind of
semi-detachment play a crucial,

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.830
and I think an
under-explored role,

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:17.100
in shaping a wide range
of modern artwork.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.220
So the argument of
the book is, yes, this

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.300
is a kind of phenomenological
account of this feeling.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.470
But what I want to
show is that there's

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:28.470
a lot of artworks
where the artist must

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.460
be thinking about this.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.710
I mean, this is an
intentionalist account.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.220
So Marina, you very
rightly pointed

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.000
to a key attribute of how we
think about distraction, which

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.040
is that the reader
should be free to pick up

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.410
what they want to pick.

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:44.160
That's the kind of
Roland Barthes account,

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.830
and pleasures of the
text, that the text

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.110
may be there because
the author put it there.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:53.100
But either reader can take
up or put down what I want.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.040
And I agree with that as an
important way of thinking

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.880
about what the conscious state
in front of a work of art

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.380
is, as it is in
front of the world.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.670
But my argument is that the
artworks I want to talk about

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:09.210
are ones where in the
inception of the artwork

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:11.910
you already see that the
person making the art

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:15.220
must have understood that kind
of doubleness as part of it.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.974
That isn't just a
readerly response

00:33:17.974 --> 00:33:19.890
that could be arbitrary,
it could be anything,

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.250
but it's also a response to
something that's really--

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.650
you can show it to be
present in the contours

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:27.210
of the artwork itself.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.647
So I'm saying that
this is modern.

00:33:29.647 --> 00:33:31.980
And for me, it's really the
last couple of hundred years

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.190
that I'm interested in.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.530
But it is definitely
there earlier.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:39.964
So in this 1595 amazing
painting by Caravaggio,

00:33:39.964 --> 00:33:41.880
for instance, which I
was sort of lucky enough

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:47.677
to see in Canada early
days of this project, what

00:33:47.677 --> 00:33:49.260
I'm going to say--
and I think I'm not

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.926
going to talk a ton
about this painting,

00:33:50.926 --> 00:33:53.634
but I'll come back to it.

00:33:53.634 --> 00:33:55.050
It's called The
Musicians, but I'm

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.000
interested in the
central musician.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.670
So his hand on the
strings, the music

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.620
that we can imagine
going through the air,

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:05.677
his gaze out at us, which is
the gaze of kind of attention

00:34:05.677 --> 00:34:08.010
and inattention at once,
because, of course, he's tuning

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:11.110
and he's listening, but
he's also looking out at us.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:14.580
But he's also not looking out
at us, because he's just canvas.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.400
He's just color on canvas,
so he's not really looking.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.386
But we kind of want
to catch his eye.

00:34:19.386 --> 00:34:20.760
But even if we
caught his eye, we

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.854
wouldn't really catch him
looking at us, because he's

00:34:23.854 --> 00:34:25.020
listening to his instrument.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.810
So this play, this kind
of back and forth where

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:31.830
we want to be drawn in, there's
a kind of claim of absorption.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:34.320
But then there's also
the reminder-- but wait,

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.960
it's more complicated than that.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.030
You're outside looking
in at the same time.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:42.150
So in such words,
in works like this,

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.460
the crux of an
aesthetic experience

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.489
is imagined, or
depicted, or understood

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:51.300
as residing neither in complete
absorption in an artwork,

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.920
nor in critical
detachment from it,

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.600
but in the odd fact of both
states existing simultaneously.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.407
So I'm not an art historian.

00:35:01.407 --> 00:35:03.240
I was going to say I'm
a fake art historian,

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.823
but I'm not even a
fake art historian.

00:35:04.823 --> 00:35:06.330
Not an art historian.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:08.512
But so let me just talk
about just a couple

00:35:08.512 --> 00:35:10.720
of literary passages that
I want to talk about today.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.820
And so this is probably the
most important one for me.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.490
In George Eliot's The
Mill on the Floss,

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.490
in the first chapter
moves from an account

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:21.480
of the young heroine--

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.630
Maggie Tulliver, you
may remember-- at play

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:29.610
to a description of the benumbed
arms of the narrator who

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:31.870
has been watching her.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.370
"It is time the
little playfellow--"

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:34.960
so the narrator is
speaking to us--

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.940
"It is time the little
playfellow went in,

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.060
I think; and there's a very
bright fire to tempt her;

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.520
the red light shines out
from under the deepening

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.690
gray of the sky.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.880
It is time, too,
for me to leave off

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:50.020
resting my arms on the
cold stone of this bridge."

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.700
Ellipsis-- Eliot's
ellipsis, not mine.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.930
"Ah, my arms are
really benumbed.

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.310
And I have been pressing
my elbows on the arms

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:00.790
of my chair--" like this kind
of chair "--and dreaming that I

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.520
was standing on the bridge in
front of Dorlcote Mill as it

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.330
looked one February
afternoon many years ago."

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:12.430
So Elliot has an image of
a doubled elbow rest here,

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:15.120
the bridge and the
chair arm both.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.290
And I think that
offers a way to think

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:19.420
about the reading
of the novel itself.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:25.270
Not only am I here reading,
I'm also there absorbed

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:26.890
into their world.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:28.930
The narrator turns
into a simulacrum

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:31.810
of the reader, whose dreamlike
entry into Maggie's world

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:35.590
is bodied forth in that
ellipsis-marked discovery

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.860
that the arms had been pressing
onto the bridge and the arm

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.660
chair simultaneously.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:43.330
So one April morning,
not very far from here,

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.210
biking over the Mass Pike,
listening to my iPod,

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:49.780
back when there were iPods,
with traffic noise in one ear,

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.120
and the Carter
family in the other,

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.110
I suddenly came to think
about that moment in James

00:36:56.110 --> 00:37:00.640
as a fact of life,
not just of art.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.440
Holding two things
in my head at once--

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.290
cabin in the pines, and
also the broken glass

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:07.750
that I'd have to dodge at
the end of the footbridge,

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:11.390
suddenly struck me less as
a quirk of George Eliot's

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:15.460
armchair doubling, or,
yeah, elbow doubling,

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.230
and more as a record
of something that

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:20.890
had been happening to me
all my life, only happening

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:24.460
in this evanescent and
unsatisfactory way,

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:26.860
happening and then vanishing
again because I lacked

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.690
the vocabulary to
make sense of it,

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.630
to give it a name
and some attributes,

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:35.110
and in that kind of scholarly
way, to try to historicize it.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:38.260
So the title of Sherry
Turkle's Jeremiah,

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.510
wonderful Jeremiah,
but Jeremiah,

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:44.260
about teenagers' over-networked
lives Alone Together,

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.210
began to strike me
less as an indictment

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:49.420
of our present social
condition than as a description

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.430
of our perennial
residence in a state

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:54.200
of mental quasi-abstraction.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.430
So I biked straight off that
bridge, and into the library--

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.060
in fact, Widener Library.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:03.130
And sometimes it seems
that I have not left since.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:06.370
So just because it
took me until the 2010s

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:09.657
to have this realization
did not mean, of course,

00:38:09.657 --> 00:38:11.740
that other people hadn't
been having it before me.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.531
And one of the joys
for me of Marina's book

00:38:13.531 --> 00:38:15.550
is to think about the
two of us discovering

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:17.620
different genealogies
of this way

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:21.760
that this is a thing that is
new now, and yet also keeps

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.700
on happening in earlier times.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.150
So just to read you a Ford
Maddox Ford quote, "It is,

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:31.240
I mean, perfectly possible
for a sensitized person,

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.450
be he poet or prose writer,
to have the sense, when

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:37.019
he's in one room,
that he is in another,

00:38:37.019 --> 00:38:38.560
or when he is speaking
to one person,

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.790
he may be so haunted
by the memory or desire

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:46.840
for another person that he may
be absent-minded or distraught.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.760
Indeed, I suppose
that impressionism

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.600
exists to render those
queer effects of real life

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.630
that are, like so many views,
seen through bright glass."

00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:00.460
So this is the double
image that he's setting up.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.760
"--seen through glass so
bright that whilst you perceive

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.540
through it a landscape or
backyard, you are aware that,

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.620
on its surface, it reflects a
face of a person behind you."

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.620
So do you guys get that?

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:12.430
It's like lens.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:16.210
It's pass-through and
lens, or mirror slash lens,

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.730
and also pass-through
at the same time.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:21.130
"For the whole of life
is really like that.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.160
We are almost always in
one place with our minds

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.880
somewhere quite another."

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.750
And here, not just under
the shadow of William James,

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:34.360
but also footsteps away
from 20 Quincy Street,

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.420
where William and Henry lived--
it was before the Harvard

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.350
Faculty Club was built on the
ruins of Henry's bedroom--

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:45.880
we might also give some
thought to Henry James.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.820
Here he is describing the
protagonist of the tragic muse.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:57.100
And he picks up distraction,
and twisted a different way

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.030
from William.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.760
So you remember William
talked about the-- let me get

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.480
the exact words--

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:06.040
William talked about
the "confused, dazed

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.330
scatterbrained state."

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.440
But what Henry says is, at this
moment when he has sort of met

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.010
this fetching new person he's
become interested in, "There

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:17.440
was a new infusion in
his consciousness--

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.410
an element in his life,
which altered the relations

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:24.850
of things--" a new "distraction"
in the French sense "--he could

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:29.170
recognize that as freely as
possible without being obliged

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:32.300
to classify the agreeable
resources as a new

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.420
entanglement."

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.600
So I take it there
that an entitlement

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.580
would be kind of like
what William James was

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.380
talking about with attention.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.380
An entitlement would kind of
anchor you to that person.

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.440
But this is the
agreeable possibility

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.050
of it being is a free relation.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.900
This infusion is kind
of a free infusion.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.540
And by the way, since
both the James brothers

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.980
talk about this
as being French, I

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.021
was like, OK, well, I'm
going to look at the OED.

00:40:57.021 --> 00:41:00.230
And in fact, if you
go to 1526, hard it

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:03.650
is to say one paternoster
without distraction of mind.

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.020
So in fact it's a
perfectly English--

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.879
I mean, it is a
long-term English phrase,

00:41:07.879 --> 00:41:09.920
that the fact that people
think of it as French--

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.795
I don't know, Marina.

00:41:10.795 --> 00:41:12.620
Maybe you have something
to say about that.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.250
They don't call it
Belgian, that's for sure.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:17.000
Yeah.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.160
But yeah.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.340
And that 16th
century usage of it,

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.530
you can see there that's a
sort of an acedia problem,

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.760
like when I pray, I find
my mind slipping away.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.200
So that's really a
classic distraction.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.080
OK.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:39.440
So we both came to this question
of how do we think about this.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.790
And I think for both of us,
what I wanted to emphasize--

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.050
and I'm not going to talk
a lot about the next slide.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:51.260
But there is a way to say we
live in this world of beeping,

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.234
and buzzing, and
tweeting, and chirping.

00:41:53.234 --> 00:41:55.400
I don't know if anyone's
seen the new Wreck-It Ralph

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.625
movie, about Ralph
entering the internet.

00:42:01.129 --> 00:42:01.670
I don't know.

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.400
I had not been able to imagine
how many different forms

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.560
of social mediation
you could discover kind

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.020
of swarming in on you at once.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.760
And Ralph sort of
experiences them all at once.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.340
And so you could
see the alternative,

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.490
like Patrick Leigh Fermor's
wonderful book about going

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:20.150
to a monastery, or this
interesting book by Kathleen

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:22.130
Norris called
Acedia and Me, where

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.920
she talks about taking
on the burdens of time

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.127
by going to the desert.

00:42:26.127 --> 00:42:27.710
There's this Georgia
O'Keeffe painting

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:32.960
I love to look at that has
that kind of desert serenity.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.660
But that's not the story,
I think, that either of us

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.480
wants to tell about
what the alternative is

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.780
to thinking about distraction
as just pure noise and babble.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.700
Instead, we really are
thinking about things

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.940
like this Caravaggio
painting, this notion

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:57.410
of the music that is there,
and is somehow kind of torquing

00:42:57.410 --> 00:43:01.310
that relationship we have to
the central musician figure.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:02.990
Maybe it's somewhat
different with a guy

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:04.970
looking out over his
shoulder with a sort

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:08.510
of more what I think of as a
Caravaggioesque come-hither

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:09.710
look.

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:12.440
But the difference
between those two faces

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:16.700
may be giving us some sense of
different ways of looking out

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.910
of a painting at
you calling you in.

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:22.070
And then I talk a little
bit-- though, again,

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:24.260
I feel very out of my
comfort zone here--

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.340
about this amazing poem which
I just covered at the MFA,

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.540
but painting-- interesting--

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.150
Hans Memling, Christ
Blessing, in which

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:35.270
really what I care
about here, which is not

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:38.060
easy to see on the reproduction,
but the way that the hand just

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:42.140
rests on this
seeming frame, which

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.210
is a little bit of
a trompe l'oeil,

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:45.826
but it isn't really
a trompe l'oeil

00:43:45.826 --> 00:43:47.450
that has meant to
have a gotcha effect.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.430
It's meant to more
just establish

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:53.930
that the Christ is with
and not with you, that he's

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:57.740
out there in that space, but
also somewhat potentially

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:01.070
present in your own space.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:06.890
And I do feel a little
bit more comfortable

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:10.670
talking not about paintings,
but about Buster Keaton movies.

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.400
So I'm going to show actually
a couple of short Buster Keaton

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.740
clips, if there's time.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.790
But, wait-- there's no time?

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:18.305
Am I out of time already?

00:44:18.305 --> 00:44:19.430
Ah!

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.930
Thank you.

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:20.940
OK.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:21.440
OK.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.190
Well, I'm going to be fast.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.580
You can show it.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:22.880
Really?

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.080
Can I show them
my Buster Keaton?

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:24.440
OK.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.210
And then I have a
little bit more to say.

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.990
But OK.

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:31.610
So with Buster Keaton, the
point I wanted to bring up here,

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:34.610
with Keaton sort
of in the 1920s,

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:37.940
I just love how Buster Keaton
is able to think about what

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.884
it means to kind of be
wrapped in your own world,

00:44:40.884 --> 00:44:42.425
and then suddenly
discover that there

00:44:42.425 --> 00:44:44.300
is a real world that intrudes.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.264
So we could talk a lot about the
comedy of Buster Keaton which

00:44:47.264 --> 00:44:48.680
unfolds in a lot
of different ways

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.280
in terms of his investment,
and kind of mechanical comedy.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.970
But the emphasis for me, like in
the context of semi-detachment,

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:59.630
the character, Buster, is
always moving through the world

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:04.790
alone, and then just coming to
realize things about that world

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:06.030
that he had not grasped.

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:08.810
It's almost like he's got kind
of a transcendentalist problem,

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:11.960
like I saw the tree was there,
but I just didn't realize it.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.750
So what I see in Buster
Keaton over and over

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:18.360
is that way that the world
kind of changes around him,

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.610
and then he has to come back
into consciousness of it.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.120
So in this case,
he is terribly shy.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.174
He really wants to
ask Mary to marry him.

00:45:28.174 --> 00:45:29.590
But he's never
been able to do it.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:34.500
So he decides to go off and
practice his proposal alone,

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.563
as he feels he is alone.

00:45:36.563 --> 00:45:41.000
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:06.143 --> 00:46:07.170
[END PLAYBACK]

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:07.762
OK.

00:46:07.762 --> 00:46:09.720
And by the way if you're
asking, did I actually

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.770
see a black-face character?

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:12.895
Yes, you saw black-face
character at the beginning.

00:46:12.895 --> 00:46:14.970
That's a whole different
discussion about Keaton.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:17.730
But I want to acknowledge
there is a black-faced gardener

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.154
at the beginning of that
clip, which I didn't really

00:46:20.154 --> 00:46:20.820
talk about here.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.190
But, yeah.

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:27.240
So that moment of kind of
coming out of yourself, where

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:31.170
the rehearsal becomes
real, for me, those

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:34.260
are really fruitful spaces
to think about the way

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.960
that this kind of
semi-distraction

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.910
or attentiveness,
but attentiveness

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:42.130
that lets your mind
be somewhere else,

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:44.970
that that's what Keaton is
talking about and thinking

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:45.480
about.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.850
And I don't know the
anthropologist you mentioned,

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:49.950
Marina, but I really
should, because that

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.260
question of detached
attentiveness,

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.380
I think that's a lot of this,
that Keaton is out of the world

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.920
and then back into it.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.880
So just quickly, I'm going to
maybe take five more minutes,

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.790
let's say.

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:05.490
All of these instances
here are cases

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:10.290
of the kind of being out
and then coming back in.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:13.564
And there's another
Henry James quote, which

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:14.730
I'm not going to talk about.

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:17.310
But I just will say quickly
about The Ambassadors.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:21.350
I think The Ambassadors is full
of this, that Henry James uses

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:24.790
free indirect discourse, great
creation of the 19th century

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:25.290
novel.

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.720
He uses free indirect
discourse to show people

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.420
thinking that they
are in the world,

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.610
and then discovering
that something is going

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:35.910
on right next to them
that they had not heard,

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:38.970
which in this case is expressed
"That indeed might be,

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:40.840
but meanwhile,
she was going on,"

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.770
which is a moment where we
realize that the character has

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:46.650
been talking to us as if
he knew what was going on,

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:49.410
but he's missed something
that the other character has

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:50.280
said to him.

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.110
So I think James
is really a master

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.030
at thinking about that
way that when you think

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:58.770
you're in and of this world, you
are actually also checked out

00:47:58.770 --> 00:47:59.670
of it.

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:03.990
And then I'm going to just show
one other Buster Keaton clip.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:06.150
This is from a short
film called The Boat.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:12.990
And the point here is what
he is doing is decorating

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:15.550
his cabin of the boat.

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:18.230
And he is completely right to
want to decorate the cabin,

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:20.730
because that's what one does
in a space that belongs to one.

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.670
You just put up a painting,
and then you feel at home.

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:26.730
But he's also completely
wrong, because he's in a boat,

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:28.890
and the cabin is underwater.

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:33.540
So the problem is double.

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:35.280
It's a cabin, and
it's also the ocean.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.020
And then it's
complicated by the fact

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.990
that the painting itself
is a painting of the ocean.

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:42.960
So that's the kind of wrinkle
that kind of tells you

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.490
the awareness of Keaton there.

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:45.618
So here we go.

00:48:45.618 --> 00:48:50.880
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.497
There he is, nailing
the painting.

00:48:56.153 --> 00:48:57.420
And then it starts leaking.

00:49:05.986 --> 00:49:06.980
[END PLAYBACK]

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:09.410
And then, yes, and
then he later creates

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:12.050
another hole in order to let
that water out, which is great,

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:13.580
which he then covers
with a pancake.

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:14.670
And it goes from there.

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:17.580
But I hope you guys caught the
most interesting moment here.

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:20.180
It's not so much, oh,
the wall is leaking,

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.220
or, oh, there's water
coming out from behind it.

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:26.740
It's that moment where
he touches the waves.

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.570
Because that's the
moment where he's like,

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:30.880
well, there is an
inexplicable water,

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.420
and there's painting of water.

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.570
So where am I here?

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.600
And that moment of
shifting registers,

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:42.250
like that location is, it's
really fascinating to me.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.740
I think that's the moment
where Keaton is thinking.

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.790
And in that Sherlock
Junior, if you guys

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:51.700
know that film, which is about
literally a projectionist who

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:56.800
jumps into his own film, that's
a film that ends explicitly

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.380
exploring this, because
the projectionist has

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:03.640
to look at the picture of
two people kissing in order

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.920
to understand that he
himself in his life,

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.200
he ought to be kissing
the girl next to him.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.260
So it's a moment which makes
very explicit that this

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.630
is about the shifting
of frames, and not

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:15.860
knowing whether we belong
in one frame or another,

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.370
but also discovering,
as Marina was saying,

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:21.230
we belong in both at once.

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:24.040
So I'm going to not talk
about William Morris.

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.540
This would be the
connection to talk

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:28.330
about my William Morris
children's book, which does not

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:30.040
look like this.

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:35.590
But I will just, yeah, I mean
I guess I'll basically stop.

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:37.280
The only thing I'll
say is I sort of

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.610
have a final question,
which is, after I

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:41.080
picked this incredibly--

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:45.220
I love this photo,
this 1895 photo,

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:48.940
which is a photo of the
photographer's daughter.

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.080
So a portrait of her--

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.320
a portrait of Aude in the field.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:55.660
And then, of course,
I realized, maybe

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:59.020
a year later, I realized, oh,
but it's echoing this Caspar

00:50:59.020 --> 00:50:59.860
David Friedrich.

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:03.250
So on the one hand, this is
this incredibly beautiful

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:06.020
enigmatic picture of my
daughter in the field.

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:10.080
It's sort of her imagining her
consciousness belonging to it.

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.800
And on the other
hand, it's this echo.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.570
It is kind of canonizing,
or putting her

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:18.260
into that larger world.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.430
So one thought I had
about distraction

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:24.190
is that we just live in
a world where there's

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:27.730
lots of horizontal
transfers, where you're here,

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:29.630
but there's a
resonant association.

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:31.910
There's something else
you're thinking of.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:34.340
And do we always want to
call that distraction?

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.750
I mean, that would seem like
a kind of depletion of the way

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.990
in which sometimes
reference in this way,

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:47.530
or sideways dislocation, or
mental wandering and return,

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:52.480
that seems like that is actually
part of what we call attention.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:56.200
If you're really good at
intertextually collating,

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.850
we call that a
form of attention.

00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:00.850
But it's also a skitter.

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:03.640
It's a jump away
from your present.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:07.810
So that quality of how the
jump away may be actually

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.031
like the higher
form of attention.

00:52:10.031 --> 00:52:10.530
OK.

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:12.238
So that's it.

00:52:12.238 --> 00:52:17.716
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:17.716 --> 00:52:19.517
Should I turn it off?

00:52:19.517 --> 00:52:20.350
You can leave it on.

00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:27.730
Well, thank you.

00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:32.110
Those were wonderful
introductions of the books

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:33.370
that you've produced.

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.890
And I think it was
clear that there's

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:42.070
a tremendous amount of
possible exchange between them.

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:47.890
I want to start out on something
I took from each of your talks,

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:53.020
which was the extent to
which you were underscoring

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:58.120
certain forms of continuity
with the past, with respect

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.370
to the issue of
distraction and attention,

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:02.590
which is really in
contradistinction

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:09.070
to many anxieties that are
currently being articulated

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:10.760
around distraction.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.600
And I thought I would play
devil's advocate a little bit

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.030
to test this.

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:19.030
And actually I'll start,
Marina, with your book,

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:21.010
because there's a
lot of ambivalence

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:24.940
in your book around
continuity and discontinuity,

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:27.400
and whether or not the
forms of distraction

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:32.830
that we find in our many
forms of electronic mediation

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:36.100
really are the same
as or different

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.580
from the forms of
distraction which

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:43.130
many of the authors
you cite are praising

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:45.580
in fascinating
and engaging ways.

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:50.050
So I wonder if also part of this
is a question of nomenclature.

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:53.020
I mean, when you make the
move from, say, distraction

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:58.240
to reverie, do you suddenly
have to discount certain things

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.370
that you would include
within distraction,

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:03.484
but would not
qualify as reverie.

00:54:03.484 --> 00:54:04.900
So I just wonder
if the two of you

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:09.910
could say a bit more about
these historical relations,

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:12.550
and the extent to
which we may be living

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:15.400
through certain
forms of rupture,

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.850
and whether there's
some question about what

00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:25.550
language is required to map
these historical relations.

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:28.338
John, you can answer
about my book.

00:54:28.338 --> 00:54:31.150
[LAUGHING]

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:32.620
I'm testing you.

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:33.610
It was so short.

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:36.242
I just want to make
sure you read it.

00:54:36.242 --> 00:54:41.020
[LAUGHING]

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:47.060
I mean, well, now I
feel like a freshman.

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.770
Can I take a speed-reading
class instead?

00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:49.270
You can.

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:50.260
You can.

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:53.470
Well, no, I mean, of
course there's something

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:57.490
very disingenuous about
my book, because I

00:54:57.490 --> 00:55:02.350
suffer immensely from the
fear of being distracted.

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:07.150
And I've always been a
very distracted person.

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:09.760
And I was going to tell
an anecdote, which is

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.400
so personal, and so unacademic.

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:12.910
Should I?

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:13.720
Yes, yes.

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.140
All right this is basically
shirking the question.

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:20.500
But about 10 years
ago, when I still

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:24.970
had use of the Harvard
University Health Services,

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.540
I had a bad headache.

00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:28.870
So I went, and I got an MRI.

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:31.180
And the doctor sat me
down, and he said, well,

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:32.950
I have very, very bad news.

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:36.451
There's a whole part of
your brain that is missing.

00:55:36.451 --> 00:55:39.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:44.110
I tottered out of the
doctor, and I thought, well,

00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:47.440
I'm going to think of
this in a different way.

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:51.310
All right, I have part of
my brain that's missing.

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:53.100
It's the speed-reading part.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.620
I don't know.

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:58.600
And I said, well, maybe that's
why I always have been felt

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.580
very close to certain topics.

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.740
So I've written about boredom.

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.150
I've written about idleness.

00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:07.120
I've written about laziness.

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:11.590
And I thought maybe my
impairment has enabled me.

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:15.610
I see people looking
aghast in the audience.

00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:17.910
The X-ray was wrong.

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:20.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:24.430
Basically there was a
whole part of the X-ray

00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:26.270
that didn't record.

00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:30.250
So about a month later, the
guy called me back, and said,

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:31.120
don't worry.

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.810
Everything's OK.

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:37.400
But in the meantime, I
thought about this a lot.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:41.755
And I thought, well, we
all have certain problems.

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:46.870
I've always been a
very distracted person.

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:52.450
I mean, I was a terrible
student in early years.

00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:56.020
And so I gravitated
towards those things

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:59.230
that were more of the reverie--

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:02.530
for example your question,
what happens when someone asked

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:04.840
me a question with
the word nomenclature,

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:07.480
my brain closes instantly.

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.730
So it was like the
X-ray was right,

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:13.360
because the word
"nomenclature" completely

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.310
makes my brain turn off.

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:18.940
But so what I'm trying
to talk about in the book

00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:22.780
is how there are
certain ways we have

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:26.860
to understand a weakness
that is actually a strength.

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:28.870
And I think what
John does in his book

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:32.860
that I felt very, very
close to is understanding

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:35.860
what does fiction do for us.

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:40.720
And we know that Don
Quixote is not real.

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:44.220
And you were quoting
Gallagher as saying,

00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:49.560
we don't love Don
Quixote because he's--

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:50.820
how does it go?

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:55.240
It's because it's a fiction
that we're drawn to it.

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.640
We're drawn to the unreal.

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:01.540
We're helped in
our world by a kind

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:04.900
of consciousness of unreality.

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:09.590
And to me, the way that I can't
quite think in a straight line,

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:13.450
I can't think about
a nomenclature ever,

00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:19.000
actually has helped me be very
receptive to other things,

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.260
and especially to fiction, and
especially to all the quotes

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:25.930
that you have from
the Victorian novel.

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:27.820
So that was a non-response.

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:31.120
But at least you know
about my brain, now.

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.690
I think that's personal.

00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:34.769
But it's kind of a great story.

00:58:34.769 --> 00:58:35.560
It's a great story.

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.550
It's a great story.

00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:38.100
So can I pick up
the history angle?

00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:38.910
Yeah, sure.

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:40.374
Thank God.

00:58:40.374 --> 00:58:42.790
So that phrase that you were
talking about from Gallagher,

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:46.180
I think it's believable stories
that do not command belief.

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:48.250
And so that's interesting
way of thinking

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:49.960
about something
that could be true,

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.290
but does not claim to be true.

00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:52.810
And I totally agree
with what you're

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:56.330
saying, that that is the
interesting gray space.

00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:59.200
But the fact that
you have fiction

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.080
doing that in the
18th century, the fact

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:05.350
that Florence Nightingale
spends a lot of time complaining

00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:07.670
about what a sketchy
age we live in.

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:09.520
We live in the
age of the sketch,

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.060
where nothing is
serious anymore.

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:12.070
Everything jumps around.

00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:15.880
That does kind of make
me feel that there's

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:19.470
a pattern of novelty that we can
trace back a really long way.

00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:22.360
And what the actual
novelty is is different.

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:26.780
But kind of the attack wave
of those cultural shifts,

00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:29.600
or technological shifts, I
think there is some similarity

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.140
in the attack wave.

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.950
But I totally take
the point, also,

00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:38.000
that the affordances of one
age, like the affordance

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.110
of the printing press, or
the performance of the radio,

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:45.080
or film, which obviously
was, in its day,

00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.630
seemed terribly
distracting to people.

00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:50.600
But the affordance is still
different from the affordance

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:51.440
of the internet.

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:57.050
Yeah, there's a wonderful piece
by Krakauer called "Boredom."

00:59:57.050 --> 01:00:02.510
And horrified, the idea
that all these neon signs

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:05.510
and the radio, all
these are taking us away

01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:12.080
from the kind of Pascalian space
of existential consciousness.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.230
And when I disparaged
Heidegger, it's

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:19.310
only because I spent so
many months of my life

01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:23.390
reading Heidegger, and
going into this kind

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:28.760
of masochistic
concentration tunnel,

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.230
and then getting out
of that and thinking,

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:34.550
why am I doing this to myself?

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:36.320
It's not really me.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.910
It's a kind of
nomenclature of something.

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:43.550
So I think, of course,
it's not a new thing.

01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:48.590
But we are in a moment of
extreme anxiety about our lack

01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:49.520
of concentration.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.169
But to take it even
closer to home,

01:00:52.169 --> 01:00:54.710
it'd be interesting to poll the
room and see if people agree.

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:57.890
But I was thinking about
the way the telephone worked

01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:58.700
as a technology.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:01.250
When we were kids it
drove our parents crazy,

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:03.510
because we're all supposed
to be here as a family,

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:06.390
and you have the telephone,
and it allows you, essentially,

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:07.400
to surf the web.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.200
By calling your
friend, you are surfing

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.310
the web of your friends.

01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:14.360
And now the telephone is
just this horrible old people

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.100
technology that people hate.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.290
Nobody wants to talk
on the phone anymore

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:19.130
below a certain age.

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:20.465
The parents are saying, why
don't you phone your friends

01:01:20.465 --> 01:01:20.965
anymore?

01:01:20.965 --> 01:01:23.499
Yeah, exactly, because phoning
would be a form of presence.

01:01:23.499 --> 01:01:25.040
And it would be real
and qualitative.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.440
But OK, but 35 years
ago, that's not

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.020
what people thought
the phone was.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.150
So I definitely think
we're in a new age.

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:38.020
I just wonder if it's
newly new, or if it's

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.650
just kind of oldly new.

01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:42.750
Yeah, I can certainly see that.

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:46.450
But I think that my
experience as a teacher

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:50.020
is that there have definitely
been changes in the way

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:55.390
that attention is mobilized
by students, or not mobilized.

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:58.120
And I had an interesting
experience a few years ago

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.610
when I was teaching
a tutorial, and we

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:03.250
read Bachelard's The
Poetics of Space.

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.080
And there's passages--
beautiful passages.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:09.890
You cite the book in
your book, Marina, where

01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:12.310
he's talking about boredom.

01:02:12.310 --> 01:02:16.060
And my three students
could not understand what

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.440
Bachelard was talking about.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.530
I mean, literally seemed like
they could not understand

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:22.180
what this experience was.

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:26.560
And for me, it was a
moment of, oh, your world

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.630
is quite different from
the one I grew up in,

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:30.730
in which it is very
easy for me to remember

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:34.720
boredom of a kind that resembles
what Bachelard describes,

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.410
right?

01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:38.620
So partly I'm less interested
in the anxiety about loss

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:41.620
of attention than I am
interested in the forms

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:44.740
that distraction takes,
the extent to which they're

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:48.610
commodified at a much
accelerated rate now.

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:51.550
I mean, I guess I'm thinking
of Jonathan Crary's 24/7

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:53.080
kind of thing.

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:56.860
And just, it's not a kind of
this has never happened before.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.740
But nonetheless,
just as Buster Keaton

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:03.310
is working with audiences
to get them to understand

01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:05.260
how to handle the
problems of attention

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:08.680
in the moment when film emerges,
that we are kind of looking

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.550
for models of how to handle
the forms of attention

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:14.035
and distraction
that are available

01:03:14.035 --> 01:03:16.540
or not available to us now.

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.250
I totally agree with that point.

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:20.350
I remember the first
time I saw people

01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:24.190
who do these poetic
experiments using, I think,

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:25.390
is it called Shockwave?

01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:27.666
Like Flash players
that you can't control.

01:03:27.666 --> 01:03:30.040
Where you go onto the internet,
and the poem just kind of

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.530
comes at you.

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:34.240
And I think of
that as an attempt

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.060
to cognitively
reckon with what does

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:40.300
it mean to be
immersed in this way,

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:43.887
and discover that turning on
and off might seem to be easy,

01:03:43.887 --> 01:03:45.220
but it's actually not that easy.

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.630
So, yeah.

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:47.530
I think that's right.

01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:48.030
Yeah.

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:54.190
Are we worried that we have
too much focus, really?

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:58.510
Because we're always
looking for something.

01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:00.070
We're expecting something.

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:05.800
We need the
adrenaline, the high.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.880
Even getting some stupid
text from someone we hate,

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.986
it's still some kind of high.

01:04:12.986 --> 01:04:14.860
You have a wonderful
expression in your book,

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:18.070
"Pavlovian creatures
of the internet."

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:19.120
Yeah, we are.

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:27.040
I mean, it kills me that
my students are so unhappy,

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.890
because on one level
they're on their Adderall,

01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:30.730
and their Ritalin.

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.140
And it does help them.

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.560
It makes them
write maybe faster.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:39.610
But they're feeling
they're mourning something

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:42.010
that they don't really
know what they're mourning,

01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:44.600
because it's not boredom.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.790
It's something else.

01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:48.220
I'm not sure what.

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:49.870
Can I put in a plug
for-- do you know

01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:54.170
this new book, My Year of
Rest and Relaxation, Moshfegh.

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:56.156
So I'm only halfway
through now, so it

01:04:56.156 --> 01:04:57.280
might turn out to be wrong.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.520
But it's about somebody
who cannot find that place

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.480
of solitude and downtime.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.140
And so she medicates
herself to achieve

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:07.480
it, which obviously
has all sorts

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.400
of counterproductive results.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.610
But it's this notion that,
what's the Conrad line?

01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:14.860
"In the destructive
element, immerse."

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:16.337
You can't go out.

01:05:16.337 --> 01:05:17.920
I mean, it would be
impossible for her

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.620
to imagine just, oh, I'll go
sit on a farm for a while.

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:25.540
But maybe I can pharmacopeize
my way back to that state.

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:26.780
It's fascinating.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:30.430
And that is a book that seems
to me to be encountering

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:33.858
the new qualitative situation.

01:05:33.858 --> 01:05:35.260
[INAUDIBLE]

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:38.240
My Year of Rest and Relaxation.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.460
Yeah.

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:44.640
I loved how in your book
there's some wonderful quotes.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:51.640
So John, for instance, contrasts
Lord Jim and Our Mutual Friend,

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.840
these two passages.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:56.920
And in Lord Jim, Lord
Jim is Conrad's character

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:01.630
is reading about these
sentimental novels

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:06.820
where characters save
heroically somebody else.

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:10.360
And he's so immersed in
this that when he actually

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.450
needs to come up on
deck and save someone,

01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:17.770
nobody's home, because he's
just completely focused,

01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:21.220
concentrated on that moment.

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:26.830
Whereas in Our Mutual Friend,
Lizzie Hexam manages--

01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:28.790
she sees a man drowning.

01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:32.560
And I was thinking of Camus's
The Fall, the famous beginning

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.960
of the book.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.170
But she sees someone
drowning, and she

01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:42.190
manages to have two things
happening at the same time,

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:44.980
two emotions-- fear
but this courage.

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.895
It's "I don't know
this person, but I'm

01:06:46.895 --> 01:06:48.020
going to save this person."

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:51.430
And as she's praying,
she's praying,

01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:53.560
she's hoping that
this is not happening,

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:57.480
she goes and dives in the water
and actually saves the person.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.010
And for me this was
a wonderful example

01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:04.750
of how we can do
many things at once.

01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:12.520
And thank god we can have this
presence/absence gift, really.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.860
Because, as Hume would
say, if we're just

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:17.860
thinking about Descartes,
or if we're just

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.920
doing what Heidegger would
like us to do, and plunge

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:25.030
into this kind of
important boredom,

01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:31.270
we're not going to be able
to cull the kind of magic

01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:35.170
of the detailed
magic of the things

01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:37.040
that don't seem to matter.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.780
I always think of Mrs.
Ramsay in To the Lighthouse.

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:44.230
You look at her life,
and it's a series of kind

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:46.870
of not very important events.

01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:51.220
But those events make
her that full person,

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.770
that person who's
capable of loving,

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.470
of noticing, of nurturing.

01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:59.620
And Mr. Ramsay, who
wants to go from A to Z,

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:01.660
and to understand
all philosophy,

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:04.720
is incapable of
being with anybody.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.650
So it's because of Mrs.
Ramsay's inattention

01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:15.710
that she's actually so
receptive to her fellow humans.

01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:21.080
And speaking of being
receptive to fellow humans,

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.229
I think it's a good opportunity
to open the conversation up

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:25.220
to everybody here.

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.670
So there's a couple of my mics.

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:27.920
No nomenclature, please.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.460
No.

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:30.830
No nomenclature.

01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:36.649
And you can share your MRI, but
only if the story ends well.

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:37.380
There are mics.

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:40.108
So I see two hands
up in the center.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:47.069
Samantha, why don't you
go first, and then Martin?

01:08:47.069 --> 01:08:50.529
Thank you both for
just really rich topic.

01:08:50.529 --> 01:08:54.300
So as a philosopher,
I'm going to ask

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:56.350
a philosophical question.

01:08:56.350 --> 01:09:00.640
So let's suppose distraction
is a kind of good.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.939
There's a question of
what kind of good is it.

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:06.000
So there is these certain
instances of I'm Hume,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.520
and I'm trying to
bring down Descartes,

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.979
and so going down to
the pub with my friends

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.770
is a nice kind of distraction.

01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:16.620
So then I can come back, and I
can really show why he's wrong.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:20.819
So that's an instrumental view
of the goodness of distraction.

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:22.560
But then it's
interesting to then think

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.250
about the case of art, right?

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:26.880
And so what has Darwin
lost, or the examples, John,

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.290
that you were talking about.

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:30.779
When we are in this
distracted mode.

01:09:30.779 --> 01:09:34.081
It's less clear that that just
has this instrumental value

01:09:34.081 --> 01:09:34.580
there.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:39.180
It seems distraction is more
of an intrinsically good state

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:39.840
to be in.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.210
So I just want to invite
you to say a little bit more

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:45.120
about if you have thoughts about
what kind of a good distraction

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:45.620
is.

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.979
Is it an instrumental good?

01:09:46.979 --> 01:09:50.084
Is it an intrinsic good?

01:09:50.084 --> 01:09:51.000
Can I take that first?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:51.479
Yeah.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:52.500
I'm really glad
you mentioned that,

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.300
because when you were,
Marina, when you were talking

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:56.008
about Darwin, I was
thinking that there's

01:09:56.008 --> 01:09:57.552
another 19th century
example, which

01:09:57.552 --> 01:09:59.010
I'm sure you were
thinking of, too,

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:03.090
which is John Stuart Mill has
this mental breakdown, in which

01:10:03.090 --> 01:10:06.550
he recuperates from
by way of Coleridge.

01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:10.830
And he really does kind of
try to unpack that problem,

01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:13.500
whether what he
needed was simply

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:17.080
to be able to turn off
the utilitarian brain.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.420
That would be the account that
Bentham is good, but just not

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:22.350
all the time.

01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:25.590
You need some commercials,
too, or something.

01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:28.920
But he ends up coming
down more on the notion

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.264
that there is this other thing.

01:10:30.264 --> 01:10:32.430
Which I'm not sure if he
uses the word "experience"?

01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:34.140
I have to go back to
Martin Jay's book.

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:36.330
But I mean I feel
like the point there

01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:39.900
is that he's trying to get at
something where what he likes

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.760
about Coleridge's
poetry as distinct

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.560
from other romantic
poetry is that it

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.600
fuses thought and feeling.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.840
So by Mills's account
there is this other thing,

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.110
which is that it
makes you grapple

01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:55.915
with the difficulty of the fact
that though I'm in my mind,

01:10:55.915 --> 01:10:57.540
having this one
thought and experience,

01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:01.110
somebody else out there is
experiencing differently.

01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:03.720
And I can, yes,
somewhat apprehend it,

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.020
because poetry somewhat
brings me into their world.

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:11.460
But imagination doesn't
take me all the way.

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.710
So I think, if I'm understanding
your question right,

01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:17.580
I think what I'm saying is not
just that imagination becomes

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:20.609
like a cure-all
panacea, like when

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:21.900
we have an artistic experience.

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:28.142
It has this great utility of it
gives us a secret passageway.

01:11:28.142 --> 01:11:29.850
It's actually more
complicated than that.

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:33.330
It's that the
aesthetic experience,

01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:37.830
like trying to catch the eye
of that Caravaggio character,

01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:40.910
is at once a payoff.

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:42.260
There's some sensual beauty.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.520
There's some apprehension.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:44.990
There's something you get.

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:47.360
And there's also a sense
of distance as well.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:50.120
So I think to me that's--
do you know what I'm saying?

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.540
The utility in a way is that
it's a qualitatively different

01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:54.757
kind of utility.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.530
Marina, do you want
to weigh in on this?

01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:01.980
Because you talk about
that paradox in your book.

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:02.520
Yeah.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:06.360
I mean, the presence
absence thing, I

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.010
mean I was mentioning
briefly Nietzsche,

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:12.360
and how he would say, I
can only really produce

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.480
these thoughts when
I'm losing myself,

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.330
when I'm not going
in a straight line.

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:22.590
And so again, I always
feel a little bit

01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:26.640
disingenuous with this whole
topic, because of course I

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:35.190
want to have the richest, most
intense philosophical life

01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:39.180
possible, despite or
because of the distraction.

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:43.440
And actually, I
mean, I don't know

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.080
how to put it, that
the presence/absence,

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.620
that this anthropologist
who tells us

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:54.210
said we couldn't live
if we lived simply

01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:56.540
in the mode of presence.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:01.200
And so we have to absent
ourselves from depth in order

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.530
to get to a greater depth.

01:13:04.530 --> 01:13:07.710
And it's hard to
explain, but I really

01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:12.150
understand that,
how sometimes, I

01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:14.430
mean, when you're
talking with someone,

01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:16.830
and you hear someone
else's conversation,

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:20.490
and you kind of are dying
to listen to that other day

01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:22.350
dichotic listening it's called.

01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:24.720
And we're all guilty of that.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:30.600
But it happens also when we're
watching, say, Breaking Bad.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:31.860
I don't know how many people--

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:33.780
everyone has watched Breaking.

01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:37.050
I never feel guilty when
I'm watching Breaking Bad,

01:13:37.050 --> 01:13:42.210
because I'm actually completely
ensconced in a fictional world.

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:49.820
I feel guilty when I feel that
I am basically I'm not together.

01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:52.390
I'm pressing this one button.

01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:54.990
I'm half-looking at one thing.

01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:58.860
So for the philosopher,
I think the philosopher

01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:05.640
wants a certain amount of
lost time in order to find

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:09.210
the time that will be
the time that will allow

01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:11.980
them to write or to create.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.440
So I think it has a
connection to creativity.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.790
I don't know.

01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:19.670
Martin.

01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:24.220
So I may be totally wrong, but
I'd like to know what this is.

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:28.650
I think Robin, in your
question, this was distraction.

01:14:28.650 --> 01:14:30.770
I'm asking you a question,
but at the same time,

01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:31.870
I'm looking something up.

01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:34.480
And no one can pay
attention anymore

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.690
because they're so distracted.

01:14:36.690 --> 01:14:40.150
Marina, I felt like for you,
this was not distraction,

01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:41.440
but total absorption.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.090
I'm looking at it, and
I forget where I am.

01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:45.760
And I'm looking at it only.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.950
So I would like to
know which it is.

01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:51.079
And since there is
this discrepancy here,

01:14:51.079 --> 01:14:53.370
maybe, I think John is right,
and it's semi-detachment.

01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:55.700
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:58.180
But I am glad you asked
that, because something

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:01.640
in John's book, I think it's the
only thing I disagreed with--

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.140
Oh, good.

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:08.710
--is you talk about this
person who is in a cafe,

01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:11.890
and I forget who
it is, in a cafe,

01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:15.040
and basically is
feeling terribly guilty,

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:18.610
because instead of partaking
into the conversation,

01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:21.760
he's actually doing stuff that
we know when our students are

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.290
pretending to scratch their--

01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:27.700
I see what you're doing.

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:28.750
You're not listening.

01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:30.680
You're actually
looking at your iPhone,

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.950
which is hiding in your shoe.

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:37.600
And so in your book,
and I have it somewhere,

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.180
he defends himself, or you,
John, defend him by saying,

01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:46.960
well, actually he has access to
the in-between at that moment.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.910
But I actually don't
think it's true.

01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:54.390
I think the in-between
comes when we float,

01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:58.150
we daydream, we get lost.

01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:02.020
But the phone for me
is total absorption.

01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:07.270
And I have to say what I'm
looking in my shoe as well--

01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:09.420
I've done it, too--

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:12.020
I'm lost to the
rest of the world.

01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.510
And that's what I hate.

01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:16.730
I hate that I'm no
longer receptive.

01:16:16.730 --> 01:16:20.260
I'm actually
absolutely directed.

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:24.010
So for me, that little
thing is the direction

01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:25.090
that I don't want.

01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:27.800
I don't want to be like that.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:32.740
I want to be able to
half-understand maybe

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:35.680
a conversation, but
not completely be

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:40.480
able to turn into a
monk of the iPhone.

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.372
That's our desert, there.

01:16:43.372 --> 01:16:45.870
Marina, have you ever seen that
movie Pillow Talk, the Rock

01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:46.370
Hudson--

01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:48.060
Of course, with
the feet, and the--

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.120
Yeah.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.850
Because that seems
like it's about that,

01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:54.340
the phone having that quality.

01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:56.530
So in my role as
splitting, as being

01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:59.170
the synthesis, or Aufhebung.

01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:01.540
I think the word
I would go back to

01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:06.440
is the word affordance there,
meaning that cognitively

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:08.440
there's just all sorts
of tools and technologies

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.020
that hit the human species.

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:13.660
And they each allow
different capacities.

01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:15.880
And Marina, I think
you're right in saying

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:19.214
that for you the affordance
is allowing you the window in.

01:17:19.214 --> 01:17:21.130
But Robin, I think you're
also right in saying

01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:25.390
that you watch people get
glimmers and distraction.

01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:27.940
And that's my experience of
how my teens use their iPhones.

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:30.960
It's terrifying to me.

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.710
They put down books
and picked up iPhones.

01:17:32.710 --> 01:17:35.160
And that's what they do.

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:37.780
So Martin, I mean, that's
an unsatisfying answer.

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:39.950
But it's a tool like any other.

01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:42.700
And it's a tool
that can kick you

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:43.910
in a bunch of different ways.

01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:46.150
And I think what I was
trying to argue at the end,

01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:47.680
but it's not a
fully-formed thought,

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.560
is that I was making
the case that sometimes

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:54.340
what one man's distraction
is another man's attention

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:55.390
kind of thing.

01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:57.730
It actually depends on
the angle we pick up

01:17:57.730 --> 01:18:00.780
before we can say
definitively that that is.

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.170
Yeah.

01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:04.360
And maybe the
philosophers can actually

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.770
finish my thought here.

01:18:05.770 --> 01:18:12.680
But one of Deleuze's
most wonderful pieces

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.460
is when he talks
about monads, and when

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:16.450
he talks about Leibniz.

01:18:16.450 --> 01:18:22.150
And Deleuze actually uses
that to talk about Proust,

01:18:22.150 --> 01:18:25.000
and says that--

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.860
I actually have
the passage here,

01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:31.890
but I've lost my glasses
because I'm distracted.

01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:33.200
So I probably can't read it.

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.660
But it's an end here.

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:40.350
So just maybe you
read "For Leibniz"?

01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:42.910
"For Leibniz the upper
floor is the soul,

01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:47.440
or what we might call following
Guattari, the corporeal aspect

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.880
of subjectivity.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.220
As Deleuze remarks
in an interview,

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:54.460
'Leibniz's most famous
proposition is that every soul

01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:55.270
or subject--

01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:59.020
monad-- is completely closed,
windowless, and doorless,

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:02.950
and contains the whole world in
its darkest depths, while also

01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:05.410
illuminating some little
portion of that world,

01:19:05.410 --> 01:19:07.670
each monad a different portion.

01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:11.680
So the world is enfolded in
each soul, but differently,

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:14.530
because each illuminates
only one little aspect

01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:16.120
of the overall folding.'"

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:22.500
So I love that passage so
much, because we are monads.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:27.030
And so in some
ways our propensity

01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:30.030
is to turn the world inside.

01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:33.180
It comforts us in
some strange way

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:36.690
to have that little telephone.

01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:40.410
It's a form of not
wanting to leave your bed.

01:19:40.410 --> 01:19:42.210
And I love not leaving my bed.

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:45.040
So I understand that desire.

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:49.860
And so if we are monads, there
are certain moments where,

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:55.230
thanks to Caravaggio, thanks
to a Proust, a window opens,

01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:58.800
and a window opens
to a part of us

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.030
that suddenly we didn't
even know was there.

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:04.080
And I think so many
of your examples

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:06.120
is about this double life.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.060
We live a double
life all the time.

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:12.010
Our double life is
the life of our past.

01:20:12.010 --> 01:20:15.380
We have so many moments of
our past that we suppress,

01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:16.860
we put in a corner.

01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:18.630
And then suddenly it happens.

01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:19.440
It's there.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:22.890
And that part of our life is
just as much a part of us.

01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:26.080
But actually we don't
always access it.

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:30.210
So we are distracted
because we're only always

01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:33.360
a tiny fraction of who we are.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:39.000
And in fact, we're this
hugely complex machine

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.280
that just gets revealed by
chance, by conversations.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:52.170
So I feel that our little phone
there tries to get us to buy,

01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:54.720
get us to focus, gets us to--

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.220
it's a commodity.

01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:58.740
It's those things that
are not commodities

01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:03.630
that makes the little monad that
we are into something plural.

01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:04.345
Yeah.

01:21:04.345 --> 01:21:05.740
[INAUDIBLE]

01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:08.991
Could you take the mic,
just this because this--

01:21:08.991 --> 01:21:09.490
yeah.

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:10.280
Thanks.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:10.780
Yeah.

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:13.090
I also wonder whether
it has anything

01:21:13.090 --> 01:21:18.530
to do with lapsing
from cognition,

01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:20.990
or from the vocabulary
of cognition,

01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:24.740
into, I don't know whether
to call it affect, or drives,

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:28.240
or do you see what I'm saying?

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.940
The opening of the windows.

01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:32.650
Getting out of the monad.

01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:35.800
Yeah, just.

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.580
I guess.

01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:38.650
I don't know.

01:21:38.650 --> 01:21:41.470
What do you think?

01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:45.220
Well, can I circle
and come back to that?

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:45.806
I mean.

01:21:45.806 --> 01:21:47.680
Because to follow up on
what you were saying,

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:51.400
Marina, about that notion
of the multiplicity

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:54.340
of available things
sort of in the self,

01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:57.310
and how we figure out which are
the things that are actually

01:21:57.310 --> 01:22:00.520
part of the order of
our lives, I really

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.710
love the point you made
about Tristram Shandy, about

01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:06.110
the piling up of stuff, the way
that there's all these episodes

01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:07.570
that just kind of go.

01:22:07.570 --> 01:22:10.250
And I think one of
the things I try

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:13.030
to argue in the
book about the novel

01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:18.430
is that what defines it, the
novel, is that it is episodic,

01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:21.460
meaning there's a bunch
of things that happen.

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:23.680
And then the order, like
the narrative sequence

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.452
that pulls it together,
that looks like one thing

01:22:26.452 --> 01:22:27.160
at the beginning.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:30.830
But then later, after a bunch
of other episodes have occurred,

01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:33.700
it may turn out that
other of those things

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:35.090
were more important.

01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:37.930
So in other words, things
that look like distractions,

01:22:37.930 --> 01:22:41.590
detours, like
off-ramps on your life,

01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:42.730
when you look back at them.

01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:44.771
I feel like Middlemarch
is constructed of nothing

01:22:44.771 --> 01:22:45.850
but off-ramps.

01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:48.280
And then in retrospect
it turns out, oh,

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.430
that thing that happened
to Mr. Bulstrode

01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:53.102
20 years before the novel
began, that's actually

01:22:53.102 --> 01:22:54.310
a crucial aspect of his life.

01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:59.780
So in other words, I
think, the artist part

01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:02.360
of narrative artistry is
to say the things that

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.870
look like they might just
have been kind of out there,

01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:08.240
and had nothing to do
with anything else,

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:10.239
in retrospect there
is an order to them.

01:23:10.239 --> 01:23:11.780
So again, that goes
back to the point

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:15.200
where things that look
like distraction or detour

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:18.190
actually turn out to be
part of the mainstream.

01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:18.690
I'm sorry.

01:23:18.690 --> 01:23:20.120
That's not a good
answer to your question.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:20.840
I apologize.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:23.470
I thought it was
going to connect back.

01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:26.460
The nomenclature of your
question was complex.

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.910
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:30.380
Other questions?

01:23:40.190 --> 01:23:41.050
Thank you.

01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:43.650
So I have two quick questions.

01:23:43.650 --> 01:23:46.850
One of them is just
about have any of you

01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:49.850
thought about how
contemporary novels try

01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:53.810
to respond to these kind
of distractions, especially

01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:55.070
the internet?

01:23:55.070 --> 01:24:01.340
And the second question is
I guess more in your field.

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:02.840
It's about that
sort of weird thing

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:05.060
where people get accused
in the 19th century

01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:08.060
of basically
falling into novels,

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.460
being totally
consumed by novels.

01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:13.110
And that's really dangerous.

01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:15.420
So I just sort of
wonder about that,

01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:18.500
especially because it kind of
becomes gendered and stuff.

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.180
John will answer
your second question,

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:23.870
because he talks about
that a huge amount.

01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:28.160
The first question, there are
many contemporary novels now

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.630
that use links.

01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:32.810
So you can read them
on the internet.

01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:37.160
I mean, you can read
them on your machine,

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.180
or you can read them.

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:42.560
And it's two utterly
different experiences.

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:46.700
There's a Paul La Farge novel
which I forget the title of it.

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:50.150
But it's all about
following links.

01:24:50.150 --> 01:24:52.880
And I listened to it on Audible.

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:56.240
So I missed it completely.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.470
He teaches with me.

01:24:57.470 --> 01:25:00.020
And I said I really
liked your book.

01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:03.154
And he said, so, what did you
think of all the references

01:25:03.154 --> 01:25:03.945
to our distraction?

01:25:03.945 --> 01:25:07.360
And it's, of course, I
didn't get any of that.

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:14.210
And John talks
about the whole idea

01:25:14.210 --> 01:25:17.720
of free and direct
discourse, which in some ways

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:20.180
could be a pathology right now.

01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:24.380
We are free indirect
discourse, right?

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:28.160
Yeah, but the second question,
I think the immersion

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.520
and the danger of fiction.

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.020
Right.

01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:31.760
But I also take it,
Danielle, you're

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.530
talking about quixotism, right?

01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:36.890
I mean that is the way in
which, sort of Madam Bovary,

01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:39.860
like that quality of--
or the female quixote,

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.970
is an interesting
18th century example

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:46.250
of that, where people to
whom the world of books

01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:47.510
becomes like real life.

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:50.510
I mean, I just think, OK, I
will mention Wreck-It Ralph

01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:51.740
for the second time tonight.

01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:54.410
I mean, I think that
so many modern art

01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:56.090
forms are dealing
with that notion

01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:57.920
that we're living
in game spaces.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.855
I mean, so Wreck-It Ralph
literally lives inside a game.

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:02.480
But I think one of
the reasons it works

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.970
is the same reason that
Ready Player One works

01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:07.790
for us, which is that
we are constantly

01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:09.830
thinking about the fact
that we have avatars.

01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:12.320
We have a kind of
fully developed

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.680
internet mediated personality.

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.610
Maybe our being isn't there, but
our personality is out there.

01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:20.900
We're doing work out there.

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:23.240
People fall in love
on the internet.

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.560
And so fine.

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.010
So Second Life itself is kind
of dead as an experiment.

01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:33.830
But the notion that those
kind of virtual worlding,

01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:37.610
that, I mean, I think that
there's so many art works now

01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:42.260
that are responding to
that way in which ourself

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.670
is kind of partially out there.

01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:51.230
What you said reminded me of
a really wonderful experience.

01:26:51.230 --> 01:26:54.980
So I taught this Don
Quixote tutorial,

01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:57.510
and Bard students
are impossible.

01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:59.300
They do theater until midnight.

01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:03.440
So sometimes our tutorial
was from 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM,

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.390
because those were
the only times

01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:07.400
we could all find together.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:12.140
And we were talking
about Madame Bovary,

01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:15.050
and the dangers of fiction.

01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:18.380
And one of the
students said to me,

01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:22.220
we are Don Quixotes,
because we inhabit

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:24.590
the world of virtual reality.

01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:28.250
My brothers and I had
a terrible childhood.

01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:31.040
Our parents were abusive.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:37.860
The only place where we actually
had a life was in these games.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:38.480
What are they?

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.394
I mean, games, and--

01:27:40.394 --> 01:27:41.810
Well, they're
called [INAUDIBLE]..

01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:42.643
Something like that.

01:27:42.643 --> 01:27:44.900
I don't even know
the terminology.

01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:47.630
But it made me
stop in my tracks,

01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:49.530
because I'm so old-fashioned.

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:51.720
It's just reading
is the only thing.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:54.530
And I actually, no.

01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:58.100
They had this beautiful,
these memories.

01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:02.824
Their memories were
memories of passing,

01:28:02.824 --> 01:28:06.290
doing some dangerous
things that were virtual,

01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:07.490
that were not real.

01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:09.460
Their reality was miserable.

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:12.200
Their virtual
reality was something

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.110
that they could share,
something they will remember.

01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:18.050
Remember, when he told me.

01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:21.960
He talks to his brother
about this as his childhood.

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:25.280
So this is such an
incredible thing.

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:27.320
I was blown away by that.

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:30.080
And it made me feel
I am so prejudiced.

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:33.860
These kids have-- you
guys, the youngsters--

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:37.590
have such rich lives
compared to stodgy me.

01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:38.900
We just had the telephone.

01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:40.541
We just had the telephone.

01:28:40.541 --> 01:28:41.040
Although--

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.430
And you could ask, you could
do the thought experiment,

01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:50.270
if movies had come
after games, what

01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:52.260
would the cultural
reaction to the movies be,

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:54.470
where it's just like
you're being broadcast at,

01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:56.640
like you're being
brought into that world

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.000
and given that world,
whereas in the game space

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.550
you're playing with it,
and interacting with it?

01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:04.790
And so maybe that would be
the culturally valorized form,

01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:05.590
rather than--

01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:08.830
But of course when
Don Quixote sees

01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:11.450
a puppet show, and he
thinks they're real,

01:29:11.450 --> 01:29:13.550
and he destroys them.

01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:16.760
And then Orson Welles
makes the Don Quixote movie

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:18.750
which is so great.

01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:22.880
And Orson Welles makes it
as Don Quixote and Sancho

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.260
at the movies.

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:28.640
And when Don Quixote sees
these characters galloping

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:32.750
on the screen, he gets up and
destroys the screen-- totally

01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:34.680
destroys the screen.

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:37.490
And so I don't know.

01:29:37.490 --> 01:29:41.010
Do we live as intensely, and
is it so terrible to live?

01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:42.680
But can I just
answer that question

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.800
in a slightly
different way, too,

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:44.780
Danielle, which
is that I do think

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.090
there's a ton of novels
nowadays that actually

01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:50.090
do bifurcate the
internet persona

01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:51.420
and the lived experience.

01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:54.110
In other words, there
is a kind of old person

01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:57.660
account of, oh, 19-year-olds
are on Facebook all the time.

01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:00.890
Therefore all their
whole being is bound up

01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:03.710
in their social transactions,
and their badges,

01:30:03.710 --> 01:30:05.060
and all these other things.

01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:09.260
And for example, Sally Rooney,
I really love both Conversations

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:11.210
with Friends and Normal People.

01:30:11.210 --> 01:30:13.910
And both of those are about
the difference between what

01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:16.970
you appear like in
that persona that's

01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:19.820
out there electronically,
versus the kind of depth

01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:22.580
that you yourself possess, which
is inarticulate and struggling,

01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:25.850
because it's
personal, and it's not

01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:28.732
personality, which is what
gets played out out there.

01:30:28.732 --> 01:30:30.440
In other words, I
think there's probably,

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:32.023
just like in every
generation, there's

01:30:32.023 --> 01:30:34.040
a range of artistic responses.

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:37.430
And one of them is to say, well,
there is that electronic space

01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:40.850
there, but then the real me
is kind of hidden down here,

01:30:40.850 --> 01:30:43.550
and likes to be alone.

01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:45.167
Just take a couple
more questions.

01:30:45.167 --> 01:30:45.666
Yeah.

01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:49.880
Thank you so much.

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:55.890
I would like to explore the
possibility of meditation,

01:30:55.890 --> 01:31:00.130
and granted the reality
and multiple manifestations

01:31:00.130 --> 01:31:02.080
of distraction.

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:06.610
Now especially preserved with
technology and media, media

01:31:06.610 --> 01:31:11.020
as medium and communication,
but what is also the practice

01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.846
and calling of meditation.

01:31:12.846 --> 01:31:17.860
It is in this context your
reflection on presence/absence.

01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:21.160
Now the presence/absence
can be uncultivated,

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.170
or it can be cultivated.

01:31:23.170 --> 01:31:26.710
So what is the pathways
of cultivation of presence

01:31:26.710 --> 01:31:30.160
and absence, and in the
terms of more a reckoning,

01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:32.980
and therefore, whether
it also requires

01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:38.000
a fundamental critique of some
of the assumptions, like monad.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.970
Now the idea of the
monad is related

01:31:39.970 --> 01:31:42.190
to monotheism in some ways.

01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:47.290
So therefore, how do we embrace
a cross-cultural perspective?

01:31:47.290 --> 01:31:50.630
And looking at the individual,
though [? with windows, ?]

01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:54.190
but not necessarily as monad,
a different configuration

01:31:54.190 --> 01:31:58.420
of the one and the many,
and therefore Heidegger--

01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:02.440
Heidegger's notion of not only
monad, but being in the world--

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.960
despite all problems
with Heidegger,

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:07.630
how do we cultivate
that modality

01:32:07.630 --> 01:32:10.000
of being with the world?

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.550
Well, of course,
through boredom.

01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:15.880
I mean, the three
stages of boredom

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:20.920
in his concept of metaphysics,
there's a real training.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:25.330
I mean, if one takes Heidegger
seriously about boredom--

01:32:25.330 --> 01:32:30.970
and I did another crazy tutorial
just about boredom for a year.

01:32:30.970 --> 01:32:34.480
We were never
bored, but it really

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:40.600
is he takes us through the
steps of being able to,

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:46.720
first of all, understand why
we can't tolerate, for example,

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:53.290
missing the train, having no
phone, no clock, no timetable.

01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:56.570
We don't know when the
next train is happening.

01:32:56.570 --> 01:33:00.610
How do we actually get
out of that predicament,

01:33:00.610 --> 01:33:05.350
and meditate rather than
have an anxiety attack?

01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:10.340
And so you have to read those
150 pages to get the answer.

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:14.320
And I recommend it deeply,
even though the consequences

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:18.410
can be medically severe.

01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:28.240
But I think boredom is, profound
boredom, conscious boredom

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.620
would be our answer
to meditation.

01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:36.550
It's one way of
looking at meditation.

01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:42.010
I don't meditate, but I
try to accept my boredom.

01:33:42.010 --> 01:33:44.740
And I have a tiny, short
answer, but I really

01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:47.140
want Theo Davis to give
it, rather than me,

01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.930
even though I know she won't,
because it's about Thoreau,

01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:52.030
which is just to say
that for me Thoreau

01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:55.000
is the way of thinking about
that moment of awareness

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:55.750
of presence.

01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:57.680
And just I think so
many of his essays,

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:00.940
including the one "Walking,"
that I quoted briefly there,

01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:05.110
really try to grapple
with a conscious encounter

01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:06.860
with Eastern religions
that he was having.

01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:11.260
But that, right, I
mean, just there's

01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:14.560
so many different ways to
think about what the presence

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:18.820
of a self that is a non-monadic
self in a natural environment,

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:21.820
I find those essays
incredibly though provoking.

01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:24.160
Thank you.

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:26.680
Thank you very much
for both your talks.

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:30.520
I have to confess that I was
so intrigued by the Frenchness

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.240
attributed to this
distraction-- distraction--

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.250
that while you were
speaking I went down

01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:41.230
an etymological rabbit hole
on my distraction presence

01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:44.800
object to look up
distraction, the [FRENCH]..

01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:53.151
And I learned that it has to
do with separation, or tearing

01:34:53.151 --> 01:34:53.650
away.

01:34:53.650 --> 01:34:55.990
And I thought, oh, well,
you know, distraction, how

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:57.520
does that work with extraction?

01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:01.030
Because extraction
seems like the function

01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:04.280
or the result of attention, or
the opposite of distraction.

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:06.930
If you are really attentive, and
you are extracting something--

01:35:06.930 --> 01:35:07.930
[? Like an oar, yeah. ?]

01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:12.190
--an object, which is also
about separation and detachment

01:35:12.190 --> 01:35:13.270
and removal.

01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:15.490
So that was very kind
of perturbing to me,

01:35:15.490 --> 01:35:18.340
because I thought, well, if
you're present and inattentive,

01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:21.370
and that puts you in
a dynamic of removal,

01:35:21.370 --> 01:35:24.160
or if you're distracted,
and that still puts you

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:30.030
in the state of removal,
is attachment possible?

01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:31.040
There's no there, there.

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:31.540
Yeah.

01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:35.090
Or are we just doomed to a
state of either being removed

01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:36.830
from the world,
or always removing

01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:38.200
a part of the world from itself?

01:35:41.770 --> 01:35:43.360
That's a beautiful question.

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.750
I am kind of speechless,
because of course there's

01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:49.510
no answer to that.

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:50.920
But there's a despair.

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:52.900
There's always been
a despair about it.

01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:56.140
I mean, I think I write
about this in my book.

01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:58.720
I read yours, but I
didn't re-read mine.

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:03.220
But Jonathan Edwards
doing a real training

01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:07.630
program in order to
not be distracted,

01:36:07.630 --> 01:36:10.900
and how he couldn't
manage to do it.

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:14.230
I mean, it's like St.
Augustine trying not to eat,

01:36:14.230 --> 01:36:16.090
and the less he
eats the more he's

01:36:16.090 --> 01:36:21.070
obsessed about food,
that there's really,

01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:25.570
if you want this perfect
attentivity, attention,

01:36:25.570 --> 01:36:28.300
you're thinking about
something you desire.

01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:33.290
And you're not actually in
that space of meditation.

01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:37.090
You're actually in
a disembodied moment

01:36:37.090 --> 01:36:41.070
when you're focusing
on the attempt.

01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:44.050
And the etymology
that you're presenting

01:36:44.050 --> 01:36:46.060
is incredibly compelling.

01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:47.740
And the only thought
I have to add

01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:51.160
to that is that from what
I understand about acedia

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:52.930
in the early days of
the church, that's

01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:54.370
really a form of the problem.

01:36:54.370 --> 01:36:57.450
Because the point
is that the acedia

01:36:57.450 --> 01:37:00.730
comes to monks who
are committed to kind

01:37:00.730 --> 01:37:02.950
of meditating, and
being with the divine,

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:04.090
or considering the divine.

01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:06.490
They're not doing
intellectual work.

01:37:06.490 --> 01:37:07.481
They're doing work.

01:37:07.481 --> 01:37:09.730
I mean, they're doing thinking
in the orientian sense.

01:37:09.730 --> 01:37:13.000
They're just trying to
think the thinking that

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.380
ravels and unravels.

01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:16.220
And the danger is
that when you do that,

01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:20.590
you might attain something close
to a divine, but demons come.

01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:22.690
I mean, the problem of
acedia is demons coming.

01:37:22.690 --> 01:37:24.800
And the demons are
really beautiful.

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:27.460
So the problem is
that you actually

01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:31.180
have succeeded in conjuring
up something which

01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:35.110
you want to be a divine,
but might be demoniac,

01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:36.610
because you've gone astray.

01:37:36.610 --> 01:37:39.110
And they couldn't get out that.

01:37:39.110 --> 01:37:41.500
And I think, as I understand
it, Augustine's solution

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:44.050
is basically
[? consentobitism. ?]

01:37:44.050 --> 01:37:47.080
In other words, you can't
be monadic as a monk.

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:48.520
You have to be cenobitic.

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:52.330
So he has these injunctions
about going and eating meals

01:37:52.330 --> 01:37:53.100
together.

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:54.933
Like that's how you
solve the noonday demon,

01:37:54.933 --> 01:37:56.746
basically, is that
you have lunch.

01:37:56.746 --> 01:37:58.284
Yeah, you can't be alone.

01:37:58.284 --> 01:37:59.950
But you give something
up by doing that,

01:37:59.950 --> 01:38:04.090
because you give up the
possibility of extracting.

01:38:04.090 --> 01:38:06.640
Because the revelation
you have might actually

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:09.522
be a grounded revelation,
but it's too dangerous,

01:38:09.522 --> 01:38:10.730
because it could be demoniac.

01:38:10.730 --> 01:38:11.725
And it's ecstatic.

01:38:11.725 --> 01:38:16.580
Ecstasy is dangerous, as
we all know all the time.

01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:17.500
Lunch is safe.

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:22.090
So the mention of lunch,
and Augustine and hunger,

01:38:22.090 --> 01:38:23.290
is making me hungry.

01:38:23.290 --> 01:38:25.760
So before the
beautiful demons come,

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.510
I want to thank our two
wonderful authors, Marina

01:38:28.510 --> 01:38:30.730
and John, for a
fabulous conversation.

01:38:30.730 --> 01:38:34.680
[APPLAUSE]
