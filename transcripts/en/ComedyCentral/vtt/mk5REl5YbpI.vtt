Hey, kid!

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:05.271
Stop it.

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:06.706 align:start size:47% position:53%
Na-na na-na-na!

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:08.841 align:start position:0%
You can't shoot me!

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:10.977
- I'm underage!
- Dazzle, come in.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.279
Bike theft in progress
in the southwest alley.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:17.116
Put your clammy hands together
for Moonbeam City's

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:20.620
top sky dancer,
Odyssey!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.889
[cheering]

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:27.160
Cool rave, chill buzz,
dirty beats.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.062
The only thing that could
ruin this vibe

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:31.431
is if I start questioning it.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.932
Uh-oh, I just questioned it.

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:35.435
What if I had a panic attack
right now?

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:36.636
That could happen.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:39.505
Okay, just breathe, relax.

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:40.740
Oh, God.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:42.708
I need some air!

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.911 align:start size:78% position:22%
Society made me this way!

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:47.447 align:end position:100%
I'm the product
of a broken fam--ah!

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.615
I'm not high, I swear.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:50.850
Please don't call the cops.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:53.219
- Arrest him, Dazzle.
- Whew!

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:55.855 align:start position:0%
You're under arrest
for 13 counts

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:57.390 align:start position:0%
of whatever you did.

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
Mama Mia.

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:02.962
That's some spicy justice.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.332
Welcome to<i> Crimezappers.</i>

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.968
I'm retired Police Sergeant
Vex Mullery.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:13.739
Join me as I go waist-deep into
the seedy underbelly of crime

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:16.075
in Moonbeam City.

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.577
[overlapping chatter]

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.845
Shut your damn mouths!

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.746
Vex Mullery is talking!

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:24.250 line:0%
It's every family's worst
nightmare: getting murdered.

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:26.919
But here's the story
of one family pooch

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:31.124
that would be doggoned to see
her masters stabbed to death.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:34.127
July 17th, 10:30 P.M.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.761
The Petersen family doesn't
know it,

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:38.131
but a desperate stranger lurks.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.704
Luckily, the family mutt Shasta
has a bone to pick

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.939
with this boneheaded killer.

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:48.174
[dog snarls]
Ow!

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:50.476
(Vex)
In the end,
the dogged tenacity

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.945
of this mangy bitch
saved the day.

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:55.114
[applause]

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:58.050
We could learn a lot
from Shasta.

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:00.153
You're doggone right we could.

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:01.888
Ah!
Vex Mullery!

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:03.422 align:end position:100%
<i> Crimezappers</i>
is my favorite show!

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:05.057 align:end position:100%
Didn't you ever get
my fan letters

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.659 align:end position:100%
or the death threats
after you didn't respond

00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:08.127 align:start size:56% position:44%
to my fan letters?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.630
Thank you, son,
but I'm not here for you.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.833
I'm here for him.

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:15.101 align:start position:0%
Would you let us reenact
the bust

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:17.703 align:start position:0%
of that bicycle-thieving punk
for our program?

00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:19.071 align:start size:66% position:34%
Oh, that was nothing.

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:20.840 align:end position:100%
We're all heroes
when you think about it.

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:23.576 align:end position:100%
But yes, my answer's yes,
and yes, I will gladly serve

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.345 align:end position:100%
as your on-set
technical consultant, yes.

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:27.580
Or you don't have to come
at all.

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:29.982 align:end position:100%
No, I insist.
Just send a car for me.

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:31.484
I was involved
in the arrest too.

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:34.020 size:75% position:38%
Yeah, that's cute, Legs,
but it's Dazzle we want.
