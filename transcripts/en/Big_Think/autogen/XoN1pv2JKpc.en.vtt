00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.930
Dr. Southwick and I, Steve Southwick, my co-author,
we're psychiatrists and we over many years,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.820
over about three decades working together,
we have been trying to understand what causes

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.800
serious forms of depression both biologically
and psychologically, serious forms of post

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.590
traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety
disorders, developing new treatments.&nbsp;

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:32.090
And then at one point about 15 years ago we
decided to study resilience and that is individuals

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.070
who, despite having been seriously traumatized
in their life, whether it was combat or rape

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.930
or physical abuse or facing a serious illness,
they were able to rise above it.&nbsp;

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.050
They were able to bounce back, in other words,
be resilient.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.780
We thought if we could understand resilience
we could help our patients discover new treatments

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.210
and help people in general because everybody
at some point in their life faces tough challenges.&nbsp;

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.200
So we started 15 years ago to identify people
that we thought are resilient.&nbsp;

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.550
We interviewed 30 or more prisoners of war
from Vietnam, and the reason for that is that

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.039
we had found out that the POWs from Vietnam
who had been held for six to eight years in

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:27.649
prison, heavily tortured in solitary confinement
for years, many of them had done well when

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.009
they got out.&nbsp;

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.119
The most famous example is John McCain.&nbsp;

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.169
And through that process over many years,
we started hearing the same thing over and

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:43.209
over again about what enabled people to get
through tough times and that ultimately led

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:52.380
to this book that discusses ten ways, ten
factors that relate to resilience, and we

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.119
also became convinced that you can essentially
train yourself to be a more resilient person

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.109
and we hope the book enables you to come up
with some ideas to do that.&nbsp;

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:09.579
One of the ten factors is optimism, having
a positive attitude.&nbsp;

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:16.549
We found, and research in general has found,
that optimism in part is genetic.&nbsp;

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:22.739
I'm sure many of you know people that just
seem to see the glass half full.&nbsp;

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.040
They have the confidence that they think they
can get through tough times.&nbsp;

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.110
They're optimistic.&nbsp;

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.650
So genetics is part of it, but genes are not
destiny, and in some cases you can help people

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.849
become more optimistic.&nbsp;

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:43.370
In fact, there is a form of therapy for depression
and anxiety problems called Cognitive Behavioral

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.189
Therapy and that can enable you to become
a more positive person.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.680
&nbsp;
Now, but the kind of optimism that is important

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.330
is not Pollyanna optimism, optimism that doesn't
fully take into account the challenge that

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.330
you face.&nbsp;

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.489
There is a term called the Stockdale Paradox.&nbsp;

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:15.790
Jim Stockdale was a heroic POW, and the Stockdale
Paradox really defines the optimism that is

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.700
most important in becoming a resilient person
and that is, when you're faced with a challenge

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.329
or a trauma, you look at that challenge objectively.&nbsp;

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.969
You might make the assessment, “I'm in really
big trouble.”&nbsp;

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:34.629
You have a realistic assessment of what you're
facing.&nbsp;

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.659
On the other hand, you have the attitude and
the confidence to say, "But I will prevail.&nbsp;

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.590
I'm in a tough spot, but I will prevail."&nbsp;

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.959
That is the optimism that relates to resilience.&nbsp;

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:54.170
Having strong social support is a very important
ingredient toward becoming resilient, and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:03.030
one of the analogies that we use relates to
the POWs that we studied.&nbsp;

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:11.329
The POWs from Vietnam had developed a tap
code that enabled them to communicate through

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:17.609
the wall to an individual, another POW in
the cell next to them.&nbsp;

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.370
They weren't allowed to talk, but they developed
a tap code, and the tap code involved tapping

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.810
on the wall and it involved five letters in
five rows.&nbsp;

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.680
If you tapped once that meant row one and
then three times would be the third letter

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.949
in that row, so the first row was A, B, C,
D, E.&nbsp; They tapped once, row one, three times

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.419
and it's letter C, and so they developed that
kind of tap code.

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.310
They told me that if they didn't have a tap
code to communicate with somebody they couldn't

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.860
even see for years they wouldn't have been
able to have gotten through that experience

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.250
and stayed sane.&nbsp;

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.780
They developed friendships for life through
the tap code from one cell to another.&nbsp;

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.950
So our analogy is, everybody needs a tap code.&nbsp;

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.240
Everybody needs a set of individuals in their
life that they can count on, that they can

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:21.840
share their feelings with, that they can ask
for advice in terms of facing a trauma.&nbsp;

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.930
Social support is very important.&nbsp;

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.930
Very few people can go through it alone.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.240
So search with your friends and your family
members to develop a network of friends that

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.029
you can really communicate with. &nbsp;
