JOE SALISBURY: OK,
so you have an app.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.910
Now, how can make the
right decisions to ensure

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.840
it's successful and has a
sustainable business model?

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.320
Hi, I'm Joe Salisbury,
Product Specialist for AdMob.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.305
I make sure developers'
feedback gets heard.

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:15.910
And I work closely with our
product and engineering teams

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.440
to buildout new features and
get developers, like you,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.400
onboard to beta test those,
and get them to market quicker.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.280
We're excited to share
this series of videos

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.100
to help you better
understand the ads

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.230
ecosystem, the different
business models for mobile,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.420
and how you can make the
most revenue from your app.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.620
To get things started,
in this first video,

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.970
we'll be looking at the
big picture-- focusing

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.250
on making the right
decisions early on to ensure

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.100
that your app is successful.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.240
To be successful on
mobile, you first

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.280
need to determine what
goals are important to you

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.664
and understand what key
performance indicators you

00:00:48.664 --> 00:00:50.330
should be looking at
to make sure you're

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.890
building a sustainable
business model.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.330
This involves understanding
user behavior through feedback

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.950
in analytics, knowing how
to get your app discovered,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.960
and connecting with
global audiences

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.860
through localization
of your app.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.930
Let's start with user behavior.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.470
It's critical to focus
on user experience

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.360
to keep your users engaged,
and constantly improving

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.820
your app by measuring
your user's behavior

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.900
and listening to their
feedback over time.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.750
Your users will be
happy and they'll

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.600
keep returning to your app.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.630
To get there, you'll
need to pay attention

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.630
to how people are using
your app and where

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.240
you might be losing them.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.580
There are a few ways
you can do this.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.010
Keep a close eye on feedback
and your apps ranking.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.900
Are you meeting expectations
and your users needs?

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.790
Understand user behavior
through analytics.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.090
We'll discuss this more in a
detailed video about Google

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.710
Analytics and AdMob.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.640
Understand different
types of users and segment

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.690
accordingly to their behavior.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.190
For example, if
you have a gaming

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.680
app, and a user is stuck
on the first level.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.660
You might want to
provide tips on how they

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.290
can beat that and keep playing.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.060
Next, you need to know how to
acquire new users for your app.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.100
How do you get discovered by
users and what key metrics

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.990
should you keep an eye on?

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.570
Start by looking at
distribution channels.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.670
Think multi-platform.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.090
You'll need to be available
in multiple distribution

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.010
platforms, the big
ones, Android and iOS.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.560
Once you're in the store,
how do you maximize your apps

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.290
discoverability?

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.520
Spend some time carefully
crafting your app store

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.420
listing.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.120
Focus on making those
first two lines impactful.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.120
High-quality screenshots and
videos will go a long way.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.050
Also, as small as it may seem,
the quality of your app icon

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.950
makes a huge impression.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.710
An icon is a graphic that takes
up a small portion of screen

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.960
real estate and provides
quick intuitive representation

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.870
of an action, a
status, or an app.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.080
Your app may be installed
on a variety of devices.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.200
And make sure your icon looks
great on all those devices

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.660
by providing
multiple icon sizes.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.320
Next, it's important to
think global and act local.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.370
The key is to deliver your
tailored, localized versions

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.190
of your app so you can connect
with users all over the world.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.080
Why?

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.370
According to a survey,
53% of Chinese respondents

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.980
and more than one third of
Japanese and South Korean users

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.910
felt apps they were using were
poorly adapted to their needs.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.750
And 25% to 30% of
users discounted

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.730
app usage because of it.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.620
And according to 10% of
users in China and Japan,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.930
even if the app was great,
they would stop using it

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.180
if it wasn't
adequately localized.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.890
So adjuster your user
interface, and make

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.070
sure you're
culturally sensitive.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.090
You can use Google's
easy-to-use translation tools

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.660
to adjust the
language of your app

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.590
to meet those needs
of those users.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.730
List your app in the Play
Store in translated versions,

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.770
and localize the graphic
assets, so those users

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.610
can see what their app will
look like in their language.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.640
You also need to keep in
mind reviews and ratings

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.900
when considering
user acquisition.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.120
This user feedback
is an important part

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.320
of your product listing and goes
a long way in attracting users.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.050
The key rule is to
improve your ratings is

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.490
to make every attempt so
that unhappy users can

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.210
reach you and express their
concerns directly to you.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.920
And so that happy users
can easily leave a review

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.390
on the app store.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.780
You'll need to listen to
what your users are saying

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.510
and answer them as
fast as possible,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.540
to thank them for
writing you, and to let

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.980
them know you're working,
or will be working,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.410
on resolving those issues
they have with your app.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.620
Don't ask for reviews too soon.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.520
Do it at the right
time, and to users who

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.280
seem to be enjoying your app.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.262
For example, if they
just want to game

00:04:39.262 --> 00:04:40.970
against three of their
friends, give them

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.470
the chance to
share their victory

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.790
and love your app
on social media.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.070
Or, if they just
leveled up in your game,

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.990
encourage them to rate you
then, when they're feeling good.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.680
Another thing to
pay attention to,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.760
where are your
users coming from?

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.900
Analyze your traffic
sources and use

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.020
that data to make
decisions about where

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.610
to put your resources
for the most impact.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.240
Really want to get noticed?

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.220
Invest in advertising
your app and see

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.240
how well different
acquisition channels perform.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.120
Then, adjust your
strategy accordingly.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.430
We'll go into more detail on
ads later in the video series.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.010
So now you have a
good idea of what

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.450
it takes to build a solid
user base of engaged fans.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.250
But let's take a step
back for a moment,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.850
and think about your
strategy for making money.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.710
How will you get
the money to invest

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.470
in building that audience?

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.740
It's definitely a bit of a
chicken and egg problem, right?

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.630
But if you build
and launch an app

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.860
without a clear profit
plan from the beginning,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.360
your chances of
success are slim.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.055
Don't worry though,
we'll get exactly

00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:44.840
into how you can monetize
your app later on.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.450
Combining different
revenue streams will likely

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.430
maximize your overall revenue.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.740
We'll devote an entire section
to this a little bit later.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.190
There, we'll talk about
freemium, premium,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.920
and other business models.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.670
Thanks for watching
these videos and enjoy

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.720
the rest of the topics.
