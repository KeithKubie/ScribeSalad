what we're hoping is that the by

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510
what we're hoping is that the by
 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.670
what we're hoping is that the by
understanding the genetic basis of the

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680
understanding the genetic basis of the
 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.100
understanding the genetic basis of the
disease that we begin to understand the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110
disease that we begin to understand the
 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.800
disease that we begin to understand the
fundamental biology understanding the

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810
fundamental biology understanding the
 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.339
fundamental biology understanding the
disease so by exploring and

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349
disease so by exploring and
 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.920
disease so by exploring and
understanding which genes might

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930
understanding which genes might
 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.269
understanding which genes might
contribute to the development of

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279
contribute to the development of
 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.240
contribute to the development of
schizophrenia for example what we are

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250
schizophrenia for example what we are
 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.310
schizophrenia for example what we are
interested in finding is does this tell

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320
interested in finding is does this tell
 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.229
interested in finding is does this tell
us anything about the biology and the

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239
us anything about the biology and the
 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.570
us anything about the biology and the
pathways underline that and as a result

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580
pathways underline that and as a result
 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.030
pathways underline that and as a result
of that we may be able to find a target

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040
of that we may be able to find a target
 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.380
of that we may be able to find a target
so we may be able to find a maybe a

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390
so we may be able to find a maybe a
 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.110
so we may be able to find a maybe a
receptor or some kind of a protein that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120
receptor or some kind of a protein that
 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.790
receptor or some kind of a protein that
we would be able to target with some

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800
we would be able to target with some
 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.670
we would be able to target with some
kind of pharmacology and then we're

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680
kind of pharmacology and then we're
 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.389
kind of pharmacology and then we're
hoping that because that has targeted

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399
hoping that because that has targeted
 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.690
hoping that because that has targeted
targeted us in on the fundamental basis

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700
targeted us in on the fundamental basis
 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.360
targeted us in on the fundamental basis
of the disease and that we've developed

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370
of the disease and that we've developed
 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.950
of the disease and that we've developed
some pharmacology against that

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960
some pharmacology against that
 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.529
some pharmacology against that
underlying basis of disease that our

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539
underlying basis of disease that our
 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:06.820
underlying basis of disease that our
drugs are more likely to be more

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830
drugs are more likely to be more
 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.130
drugs are more likely to be more
effective in patients with those

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140
effective in patients with those
 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.160
effective in patients with those
diseases it also may translate we hope

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170
diseases it also may translate we hope
 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.109
diseases it also may translate we hope
in the future and to be able to

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119
in the future and to be able to
 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.539
in the future and to be able to
targeting specific treatments towards

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549
targeting specific treatments towards
 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.370
targeting specific treatments towards
specific patient groups so-called

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380
specific patient groups so-called
 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.590
specific patient groups so-called
personalized medicine so helping to

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600
personalized medicine so helping to
 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.749
personalized medicine so helping to
understand that action fact by doing

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759
understand that action fact by doing
 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.380
understand that action fact by doing
this we may be able to find specific

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390
this we may be able to find specific
 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.090
this we may be able to find specific
patient groups who are going to respond

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100
patient groups who are going to respond
 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.429
patient groups who are going to respond
even particularly well to the drugs that

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439
even particularly well to the drugs that
 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.910
even particularly well to the drugs that
we develop

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920
we develop
 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.080
we develop
the concept of personalized medicine

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
the concept of personalized medicine
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.649
the concept of personalized medicine
ideally would be the right drug in the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659
ideally would be the right drug in the
 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.960
ideally would be the right drug in the
right dose at the right time for the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970
right dose at the right time for the
 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.630
right dose at the right time for the
right patient so in other words a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
right patient so in other words a
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.420
right patient so in other words a
patient comes in to a doctor and a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430
patient comes in to a doctor and a
 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.580
patient comes in to a doctor and a
doctor is able to do some kind of

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590
doctor is able to do some kind of
 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.149
doctor is able to do some kind of
specific screen is able to identify the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159
specific screen is able to identify the
 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.460
specific screen is able to identify the
components that contribute to that

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470
components that contribute to that
 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.520
components that contribute to that
person's disease be it environmental

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530
person's disease be it environmental
 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.529
person's disease be it environmental
biet genetic or be another kind of

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539
biet genetic or be another kind of
 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.200
biet genetic or be another kind of
biological parameter in an ideal world

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210
biological parameter in an ideal world
 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.150
biological parameter in an ideal world
that would translate into one sort of

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160
that would translate into one sort of
 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.759
that would translate into one sort of
simple diagnostic that a doctor would be

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769
simple diagnostic that a doctor would be
 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.800
simple diagnostic that a doctor would be
able to do on the spot so-called point

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810
able to do on the spot so-called point
 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.530
able to do on the spot so-called point
of care diagnostics and by doing that a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540
of care diagnostics and by doing that a
 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.830
of care diagnostics and by doing that a
doctor would be able to say for you with

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840
doctor would be able to say for you with
 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.630
doctor would be able to say for you with
this disorder this is the right

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640
this disorder this is the right
 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.789
this disorder this is the right
treatment for you you're really going to

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799
treatment for you you're really going to
 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.860
treatment for you you're really going to
respond to this this treatment and

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
respond to this this treatment and
 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.270
respond to this this treatment and
you're not going to have any side

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
you're not going to have any side
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.530
you're not going to have any side
effects that's the ideal scenario that's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540
effects that's the ideal scenario that's
 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.050
effects that's the ideal scenario that's
quite a long way off what we are doing

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060
quite a long way off what we are doing
 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.880
quite a long way off what we are doing
those were making a lot of progress in

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890
those were making a lot of progress in
 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.030
those were making a lot of progress in
beginning to understand particularly in

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040
beginning to understand particularly in
 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.440
beginning to understand particularly in
areas like oncology on cancer treatments

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450
areas like oncology on cancer treatments
 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.780
areas like oncology on cancer treatments
which of the characteristics for example

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790
which of the characteristics for example
 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.449
which of the characteristics for example
of the tumors that would make them more

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459
of the tumors that would make them more
 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.430
of the tumors that would make them more
susceptible to particular treatment so

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440
susceptible to particular treatment so
 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.949
susceptible to particular treatment so
we're now able to be better a targeting

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959
we're now able to be better a targeting
 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.080
we're now able to be better a targeting
or and many of our treatments in the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
or and many of our treatments in the
 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.650
or and many of our treatments in the
cancer arena to patients based on the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660
cancer arena to patients based on the
 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.300
cancer arena to patients based on the
makeup of the tumors which we've

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310
makeup of the tumors which we've
 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.310
makeup of the tumors which we've
identified via genetic or genomic

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320
identified via genetic or genomic
 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.009
identified via genetic or genomic
signature and we can say you're more

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019
signature and we can say you're more
 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.229
signature and we can say you're more
likely to respond to this drug you're

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239
likely to respond to this drug you're
 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.390
likely to respond to this drug you're
less likely to have side effects and so

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400
less likely to have side effects and so
 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.849
less likely to have side effects and so
on and in an ideal world as we move out

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859
on and in an ideal world as we move out
 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.400
on and in an ideal world as we move out
into the future maybe everybody will

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410
into the future maybe everybody will
 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.680
into the future maybe everybody will
have their whole genome sequence so when

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690
have their whole genome sequence so when
 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.420
have their whole genome sequence so when
they come into the doctor the doctor can

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430
they come into the doctor the doctor can
 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.729
they come into the doctor the doctor can
read out their genome sequence and be

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739
read out their genome sequence and be
 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.680
read out their genome sequence and be
able to sort of say I can identify that

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690
able to sort of say I can identify that
 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.420
able to sort of say I can identify that
drug for you and be able to prescribe

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430
drug for you and be able to prescribe
 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.530
drug for you and be able to prescribe
the right drug for them

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540
the right drug for them
 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.830
the right drug for them
for the individual at the moment our

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840
for the individual at the moment our
 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.899
for the individual at the moment our
ability to translate that genetic

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909
ability to translate that genetic
 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.869
ability to translate that genetic
information at the moment into

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879
information at the moment into
 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.270
information at the moment into
individual risk prediction for in other

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280
individual risk prediction for in other
 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.770
individual risk prediction for in other
words to say that you will get a

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780
words to say that you will get a
 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.660
words to say that you will get a
particular disease based on this variant

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670
particular disease based on this variant
 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.660
particular disease based on this variant
is still very limited at the moment so

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670
is still very limited at the moment so
 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.509
is still very limited at the moment so
the technology is significantly advanced

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519
the technology is significantly advanced
 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.640
the technology is significantly advanced
you can do these you can provide these

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650
you can do these you can provide these
 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.800
you can do these you can provide these
genome snips the technology for

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810
genome snips the technology for
 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.179
genome snips the technology for
sequencing is rapidly advancing I think

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189
sequencing is rapidly advancing I think
 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.490
sequencing is rapidly advancing I think
their estimates up now that the cost of

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500
their estimates up now that the cost of
 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.460
their estimates up now that the cost of
sequencing of fully human genome can be

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470
sequencing of fully human genome can be
 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.530
sequencing of fully human genome can be
done for somewhere between maybe five

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540
done for somewhere between maybe five
 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.270
done for somewhere between maybe five
and ten thousand dollars or something

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280
and ten thousand dollars or something
 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.309
and ten thousand dollars or something
like that at the moment that cost is

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319
like that at the moment that cost is
 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.679
like that at the moment that cost is
going to come down and come down but at

some stage in the future we probably
will be able to crunch to a large degree

of disease or risk of progression of
 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.490
of disease or risk of progression of
disease but we're still quite a bit of a

disease but we're still quite a bit of a
 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.170
disease but we're still quite a bit of a
bit of away from that and that's kind of

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180
bit of away from that and that's kind of
 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.120

would say this is where genetics kind of

would say this is where genetics kind of

let's look at this gene and see whether
 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.140
let's look at this gene and see whether
this gene is involved and that's a very

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150
this gene is involved and that's a very
 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.160
this gene is involved and that's a very
labor-intensive and it's often not been

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170
