BRAD TEMPLETON: Welcome
to Authors at Google.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.790
I'm Brad Templeton.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.440
We're here today with Mez Naam,
who has written a new

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.200
book called Nexus, nothing
to do with Google.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.070
Yet his talk is going to be
about Google and your brain.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.550
Mez used to be at Microsoft,
where he was a product manager

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.180
for Microsoft Outlook.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.870
How many people remember
Microsoft Outlook?

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.890
And also instrumental on
Internet Explorer.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.830
But of late he's become a light
in the transhumanist

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.290
field, writing books about
what happens when new

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.060
technologies actually change
what it means to be human.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.670
He has three books coming
out this year.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.830
One of them is a science-- two
of them, actually, are science

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.960
fiction novels, Nexus being the
science fiction novel as

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.520
well as a nonfiction novel.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.940
He's here to tell us about it
and some of the ideas that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.500
he's been promoting
in this field.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.510
He also is a guest lecturer at
Singularity University, where

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.440
I'm also present, and has been
working on changing the world

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.320
for a long time now.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.482
Mez.

00:00:57.482 --> 00:00:57.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.140
RAMEZ NAAM: Awesome.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.530
All right, thank you, Brad.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.770
Thanks Matt Cutts as well, for
you guys for setting this up.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.570
Yeah, so I have a book
out called Nexus.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.720
I hear that a company, a
technology company in the

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.760
Valley has a similar product
or a product

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.010
with the same name.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.860
I'm waiting for the co-marketing
dollars.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.600
So just contact me if you're
watching this.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.610
This is a science fiction novel
set in the near future,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.725
2040, which sounds like
a ways in the future.

00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:29.630
But it's as far ahead of us
as 1985 was behind us.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.920
That's how close it is.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.610
The premise is that there is a
drug that you can take that's

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.910
packaged as a drug.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.150
But it's actually a set of
nanodevices that attach to

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.800
your brain and transmit
wirelessly what

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.950
your brain is doing.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.280
And so if two or more people
have this, their brains sort

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.140
of sync up.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.840
And you get weak telepathy,
is what Corey Doctorow

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.870
described it as.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.230
And my protagonists are working
on enhancing this.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.620
They live in San Francisco.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.910
And there are various battles
between a US government agency

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.980
that wants it illegal and a
foreign power that may or may

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.520
not be using it for
mind control.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.130
So it's a thriller.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.450
it's really fun.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.310
The science in it is as
real as I can make it.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.870
Most of the science in it I
researched for a book I wrote

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.620
in 2005 called More Than Human
about the actual science of

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.210
augmenting our minds
and bodies.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.470
Now of course, we've seen this
idea of getting data in and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.880
out of the brain in science
fiction for a long time.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.990
We've seen in the Borg in Star
Trek, for instance, where

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.770
connectivity of the brain makes
a super-organism that's

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.180
very homogeneous.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.550
We've seen it in The Nexus,
where the great American

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.940
philosopher, Keanu Reeves, gets
to say I know Kung Fu.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.320
BRAD TEMPLETON: That was
actually called The Matrix.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.240
They haven't renamed it.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.490
RAMEZ NAAM: Oh, sorry.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.620
This film with this guy.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.510
But we've also seen some people
talking about it in

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.570
other contexts.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.820
For instance, a certain
technologist here in Silicon

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.980
Valley said you can imagine
your brain being

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.720
augmented by Google.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.650
You'd think about the question
and Google would whisper an

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.890
answer into your ear.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.500
Or maybe Google could
just implant the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.300
answer in your brain.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.350
Sergey has said we'd like to
think about Google being the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.850
third half of your brain.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.590
So I kind of like that idea
of having 1.5 brains.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.340
You could have a bumper sticker
on your car that says

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.790
"my other brain is a data
center." As we all know,

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.640
Sergey is well on his
way to being an

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.950
augmented transhuman already.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.250
So this leads to the question
of, could you have Google in

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.690
your brain?

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.000
Well I'm a program manager.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.590
So I think about, what the
requirements for this product

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.640
if we want to build it?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.480
Well, you want to have
five things, I think.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.700
Data input, you've got to get
data into your brain.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.660
Data output, you've got to get
data out of your brain and

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.530
into the machine or the cloud
or other people's brains.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.660
We're going to have to do some
encoding and decoding work,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.270
because the format for this data
is probably not the same

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.510
between our machines and
our brains currently.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.590
So we're going to have some
converters in there, some

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.200
protocol shifting.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.750
You want multiple data types,
at minimum, text, audio, and

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.970
video, and hopefully some other
data types as well.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.630
And of course it has to be safe,
secure, and deployable,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.170
private as well, which might
actually turn out to be the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.630
largest challenges of
this technology.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.730
So of course that sounds
like science fiction.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.670
But what I'm going to tell you
is that very, very, very early

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.360
versions of this are possible
now, that we have low

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.310
bandwidth, low fidelity
transport of various data

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.540
types in and out of the human
brain right now, and that it

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.870
is getting better very,
very quickly.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.800
Now why is it getting better.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.820
Who's investing in this?

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.910
Is this a Google X project?

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.200
Mostly it's not.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.260
It's really being developed
for medical reasons.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.200
There's a large number of deaf
people in the world, 20

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.000
million in the US who are
hearing impaired.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.230
Two million of them can't be
helped by normal hearing aids.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.400
They have what's called
sensorineural deafness.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.990
That means the inner ear hair
cells are damaged or

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.160
completely gone.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.470
And so they cannot turn sound
waves, vibrations in the air,

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.440
into nerve impulses.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.360
There's 1.3 million blind
people in the US.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.870
There's two million paralyzed
people in the US alone.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.500
1 and 1/2 million people with
Parkinson's disease, which is

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.330
essentially not exactly
untreatable, but

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
uncurable right now.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.510
5 and 1/2 million people
with a traumatic brain

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.790
injury of some sort.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.000
This is a scan of the brain of
Phineas Gage, a very famous

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.360
patient you had a
railroad spike

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.300
launched through his head.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.250
He lived through the process but
came out a very different

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.160
guy with a different
personality, and modifications

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.690
to his attention and
memory and so on,

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.760
and not for the better.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.800
So at least 10 million people
in the US who are candidates

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.530
for this technology, and really
probably close to a

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.320
quarter billion people in the
world who suffer from these

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.480
problems as well.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.090
So that's the motive.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.440
So how does this work?

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.500
Well, there's a long history
of this technology.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.980
It goes back to 1870 when two
German physicians had this

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.630
crazy idea of an experiment to
show that the nervous system

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.690
was electrical.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.810
It was so crazy that the
university, the University of

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.140
Berlin, , wouldn't allow
them to perform it.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.790
So instead they used Hitzig's
dining room table.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.930
They put a dog to sleep
with anesthesia.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.880
And then they electrically
stimulated parts of its brain

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.110
and found that they
could cause its

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.590
paws to move on demand.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.990
So that was the first indication
that the nervous

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.060
system is electrical.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.430
We really got the first proof
that it's not just muscle

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.670
motion but actual cognition is
electrochemical in the 1950s

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.590
thanks to this man,
Wilder Penfield.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.290
He was a neurosurgeon who worked
on a number of things.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.070
But among them was surgery
for epileptics.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.930
Back in that day, and continuing
to today, one of

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.540
the techniques used for epilepsy
was called oblation.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.660
What that meant was you did
brain surgery, found the part

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.280
| the brain that was sending
out these incorrect signals

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.420
leading to epilepsy,
and you cut it out.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.160
Now Penfield wanted
to minimize the

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.780
damage to his patients.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.610
So he would electrically
probe the brain

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.020
while they were awake.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.270
When he'd find the part of the
brain that was responsible for

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.100
the seizures, they would
have a seizure.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.860
So then he would know
to cut out just that

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.290
spot and nothing else.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.050
But when he simulated other
parts of the brain, he'd find

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.200
that people would suddenly have
a waking dream, a vivid

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.420
smell, a vivid insight,
some emotion.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.230
So that was the first conclusive
demonstration that

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.910
thinking and feeling and your
senses are electrical as well.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.020
From there the story
gets very weird.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.110
In the 1960s, two scientists,
Jose Delgado and Robert Heath,

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.830
one of them, in fact, funded by
the CIA, did a variety of

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.220
experiments on animals and then
on humans to show that

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.090
they could control behavior
through electrical

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:51.730
stimulation.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.130
With electrodes implanted in
the brain, they could put

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.930
animals to sleep or
wake them up.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.880
They could make an animal hungry
or satiated, aggressive

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.250
or fearful.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.600
With one experiment in a troop
of monkeys, they could change

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.385
which monkey was the alpha
male of the troop by

00:08:07.385 --> 00:08:09.280
stimulating the right
parts of the brain.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.100
Delgado, a Spanish scientist,
was quite a showman.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.105
So he repeatedly did
this experiment.

00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:18.330
This is him in a bull
ring in Cordoba.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.640
Delgado is the guy
on the right.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.260
He's got a cape.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.930
And you could just barely see
he's got something with an

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.100
antenna here.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.510
The bull has been worked up
by someone else before.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.070
So the bull starts
to lean forward.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.020
It's getting aggressive.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.070
You could see more clearly, A,
there's something on the

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.590
bull's head, and B, this black
box with a long antenna.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.510
The bull starts to charge him.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:42.289
Delgado drops the cape and hits
the button on this radio

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:43.659
device that he has.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:47.220
And the bull skids to a halt
because it's now terrified of

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.750
him, because he has remotely
stimulated an input of

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.600
electricity to its fear
centers in its brain.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.540
I'm going to show you
a video of this.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.010
This video is from the French
documentary in the 1960s.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.500
So it's in French.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.800
It's not exactly HD.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.220
Delgado is the guy in
white who appears a

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.140
little bit into it.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.975
And watch how the bull reacts
to him at various times.

00:09:11.975 --> 00:09:18.180
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.880
RAMEZ NAAM: That's the bull
running away from him.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.310
He hits the button.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.400
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.590
RAMEZ NAAM: So Delgado went
on to write a book called

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.020
Physical Control of the Mind,
Towards a Psychocivilized

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.140
Society, where he posited that
we could improve society

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.810
dramatically by fitting
criminals with brain implants

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.860
that would cut off their
criminal urges, so on and so

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.240
on and so forth.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.560
The medical community and
scientific community's

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.960
response to this
was that it was

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.200
extremely, extremely creepy.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.360
And can we please stop all
that and head on to some

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.330
medical applications of this
tech, which they did.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.170
There's a TV show called House
with a doctor called House

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.390
that solves all sorts of
crimes-- or all sorts of

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.840
medical riddles, I think.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.960
Well the original Dr. House,
Dr. William House, was the

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.540
first person to find a real
medical use for this

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.370
technology.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.120
He invented the cochlear
implant.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.840
It looks like a hearing aid, but
it's for those people that

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.270
have no hair cells
in the inner ear.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.570
So no hearing aid
can help them.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.170
Instead what it does is it
picks up sound of the

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.150
microphone.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.510
It has a small compute that
does a re-encoding, if you

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:39.470
will, from vibrations
into nerve impulses.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:44.090
And then it electrically
stimulates the nerves of the

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.780
inner ear, the auditory
nerve fiber.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.920
And that causes people
to hear.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.080
The auditory nerve has 30,000
neurons in it on each side.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.710
And the first cochlear implant
had one electrode.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.610
The best ones implanted in
people today have 23.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.270
So you wouldn't think it
could work at all.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.010
But it actually produces hearing
that is not as good as

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:08.050
a normal person's, but is enough
that they can read--

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.260
can hear what people are
saying and interpret it

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.930
without reading lips.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.800
And it has been life changing.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.550
About 200,000 people around
the world have this today.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.600
This is the picture an
eight-year-old girl hearing

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.540
for the first time.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.380
And I'm going to show you a
video of an eight-month-old

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.470
boy who has just had his
cochlear implant

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.210
implanted and activated.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:28.706
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:28.706 --> 00:11:30.690
-Here we go, turn it back on.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.162
And he's back on again.

00:11:34.162 --> 00:11:36.146
See how he turned?

00:11:36.146 --> 00:11:39.618
-Hi Jonathan.

00:11:39.618 --> 00:11:41.106
Hi.

00:11:41.106 --> 00:11:44.578
Can you hear that?

00:11:44.578 --> 00:11:47.580
Hi sweetie.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.355
Could you hear that?

00:11:50.355 --> 00:11:52.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.800
-Hi.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.780
Hi.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.260
-You've got that, Deb, right?

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.510
-Hi Jonathan.

00:12:07.165 --> 00:12:09.840
Hi.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.200
-We call that a late
Christmas present.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.140
RAMEZ NAAM: So this is a life
changing technology.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.720
Like I said, 200,000 people
around the world have it now.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:18.960
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.200
RAMEZ NAAM: This little boy
turned five in December and

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.700
he's still doing great.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.860
Now I told you along the
requirements, we need to have

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.870
data input into the brain.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.710
So I've just shown you proof of
principal of data input of

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.540
one data type, audio.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.670
Now we all care about
our hearing.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.980
It's very important to us.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.810
Another sense we care about
a fair bit is sight.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.770
So let's see data
input for sight.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.300
This man, Jens Naumann, this
picture was on the cover of

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.660
Wired magazine in 2002.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.750
Jens, when he was 18 years
old, worked on a railway.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.400
And one day with his
pick he struck

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.700
something he got was rock.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.760
It was steel.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.370
A little fragment came up and
destroyed one of his eyes.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.510
Lives in Canada, very active
fellow, refused to compromise

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.680
about his lifestyle.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.350
The next year he was
out snowmobiling.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.320
And part of the clutch had a
problem and threw a fragment

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.970
of metal that destroyed
his other eye.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.030
And he was rendered blind
in both eyes.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:18.820
He was blind for 20 years, until
2002 when this happened.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.630
So what he's wearing is a CCD
camera, not that different

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.020
from any digital camera today.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.950
The cable here goes to a small
computer that he wore on his

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.440
hip, actually it was about
this big back then.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.050
And now it's probably the
size of a quarter.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.260
And from there the signal is
translated from the format of

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.660
the camera to one that his
brain can understand.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.780
And it travels back up into a
jack in the back of his head,

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.860
Matrix style.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:52.860
Jens has this system which has
256 electrodes, as opposed to

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:58.160
the many billions of neurons in
his primary visual cortex.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.210
So again, there's a huge
mismatch in the size of the

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.430
pipe to the size of the
system, if you will.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.400
You wouldn't think it
could possibly work.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.770
But if produces what they call
limited mobility vision.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.480
What does limited mobility
vision mean?

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.950
Well, here's Jens.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:13.330
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:18.510
-I was able to very carefully
drive and look from my left

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.190
side of my right side, making
sure I was between the row of

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.010
trees on the right and the
building on the left.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.660
And when I got near any
obstruction in the front, I

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.010
would see that there
was an obstruction.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.280
I would also see the lack
of obstructions.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.680
And went I backed up, I would
be able to inspect for

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.290
instructions there.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.855
It was really a nice feeling.

00:14:39.855 --> 00:14:40.110
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.180
RAMEZ NAAM: It was really
a nice feeling.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.070
So that's a guy who was blind
for 20 years driving a Mustang

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.400
convertible.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.280
Now Jens has terrible vision.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.140
It's really, really atrocious.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.350
I wasn't in that parking lot
with him and you probably

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.790
wouldn't want to be.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.580
But it's a big step up from
zero vision whatsoever.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.190
So that's data input.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:14:59.780
And throughout--

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.340
in the novel, you see examples
of people getting video and

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.330
audio going straight
to their brain.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:05.520
But what about data output?

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.470
Can we get output out of
the brain to control

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.570
systems or send data?

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.730
Well we can and we have.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.870
So this is a doctor named Phil
Kennedy and a patient name

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:16.840
Johnny Ray.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.540
Johnny Ray was 52 years old,
a Vietnam vet, drywall

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.710
contractor, played
blues guitar.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.780
One day he had a
massive stroke.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.370
He woke up in the VA hospital
in Atlanta, paralyzed

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.070
from his neck down.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.060
And to save his life they
had to do an emergency

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:32.910
tracheotomy.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.410
So he couldn't speak either.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:38.070
His only way to communicate was
to blink his eyes once for

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.480
a no and twice for yes.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.740
That was it.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.930
This guy Kennedy had been
working in monkeys and had

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:47.060
demonstrated that he could put
a single electrode in a

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.350
monkey's motor cortex, the
part of their brain

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.690
responsible for motion, and
train them to move a cursor

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.830
around on a screen.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.500
He applied to the FDA for
permission to do it in a human

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.870
patient for the first time.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.500
They said yes, with
some conditions.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.310
One of their conditions was
that he had to seal

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.320
the skull back up.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.730
They didn't want wires running
in and out of the skull and

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.180
having a risk of an infection
getting into the brain.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.470
So they made the system
wireless.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.740
It actually sits inside
of his brain.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.470
It gets power and data from a
cap that he wears, or from the

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.710
equipment near his
hospital bed.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:23.070
Now this is the most extreme
case of this mismatch.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.320
Because it's literally one
electrode in Jonny Ray's

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:30.020
brain, but more than a million
neurons in his motor cortex.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.930
But that gave him enough control
to be able to type out

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.820
messages on an on-screen
keyboard, which is a dramatic

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.520
step up from just being able
to blink at people.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.860
And this technology has gotten
better and better, and is in

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.760
more serious human trials now.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.220
And in fact, a video came out
just a couple months ago of a

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.910
woman using this to do something
tat was very, very,

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.940
very important to her,
which was to

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.200
have her morning coffee.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.120
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.490
-You're watching the most
advanced brain machine

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.360
interface in action.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.540
Kathy Hutchinson is paralyzed
and unable to speak.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.369
But just by thinking, she's able
to control the movements

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:12.140
of this robotic arm, and drink
her morning coffee.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.720
She's part of a pioneering study
run by researchers at

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.030
Brown University in the US.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.930
-People who are paralyzed have
their brain disconnected from

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:21.510
their body.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.720
So they're not able to--

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.619
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:27.310
RAMEZ NAAM: So we've seen data
input now of video and audio.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.650
We've seen data output
of motion.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.120
And now in primates they have
data input as well.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.760
They have systems like this that
also sent touch data back

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.610
into the brain.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.280
There's one other domain that I
want to talk about, which is

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.120
Parkinson's, that I mentioned
early on.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.900
All Parkinson's drugs
fail over time.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.550
They just stop working
eventually.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.160
But now we're finding that with
something called a deep

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.140
brain stimulator, a single
electrode run very deep into

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.970
the brain, you can keep a
Parkinson's patient healthy

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.110
and functional for
quite a while.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.460
And there's 80,000 of
these that have been

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.640
implanted so far.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.560
But interestingly enough,
they found some side

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.570
effects with these.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.540
In some patients who got a deep
brain simulator who had

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.650
previously untreatable
depression, that wouldn't

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.900
respond to any drugs, they
suddenly had normal mood.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.970
In some patients that had
previously untreatable OCD,

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.740
they found that suddenly they
had normal behavioral control.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.150
And so now there are clinical
trials going on of using this

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:26.290
deep brain simulation for
depression and for OCD, both

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.880
of which seem to come
from very deep, old

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.330
portions of our brain.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.090
Which, if you think about it,
is sort of the same sort of

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:38.300
work that Jose Delgado was doing
in his animal control,

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:43.800
but in a much more benign,
therapeutic sort of context.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.740
So that's what's happening
so far in humans.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.130
But what are the
opportunities?

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.260
And I did talk about this being
the science behind a

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.210
science fiction novel.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.360
So it's not going to stop at
just this sort of thing.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.440
The opportunities are really
in the higher functions, if

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.130
you will, memory, attention,
learning, the things that make

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.290
us really human.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.070
In the film Memento,
Guy Pierce played

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.220
the character Lenny.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.100
And Lenny can't form any
new long-term memories.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.090
He will see something.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:12.640
He'll learn it.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.640
He understands it.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.110
But within a few minutes, it's
gone from his memory.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.360
This is an extreme case, but
cases like this and many, many

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.440
milder cases of this sort
exist in people who have

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.530
damage to part of their brain
called the hippocampus.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.000
If your hippocampus is damaged,
you can't form these

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.030
new memories.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:32.640
So working on this, scientists
have been trying to create an

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.560
artificial hippocampus, a
hippocampus chip that is

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.020
structured like the tissue in
the hippocampus, and that you

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.380
can shunt in.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.780
So in a rat experiments, they
actually take a rat that has a

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.180
damaged hippocampus, this
area, and they put in

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:50.460
bypasses, arrays of electrodes
basically, that put in place

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.230
the hippocampus chip as a
replacement for the damaged

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.690
brain tissue.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:58.660
And they found that they can
restore these rats' ability to

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.160
learn new things, restore
their memory, which is

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.770
awesome, has great application
for humans.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.120
But they went farther
than that.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.820
And they've show that they can
improve these rats' memories.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.960
They can improve the speed
at which they learn.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.110
They can keep the memories
around indefinitely because

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:16.910
there's no need for the memory
in a chip to decay.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.180
And they can reactivate
that memory at will.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.020
They can put the rat back in a
maze that it's learned and

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.330
reactivate the memory of that
maze's layout and have it have

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.940
perfect recall what was going
on inside of that and how to

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.860
find the water table or the
water platform at the end.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:37.210
So that's the early glimmers
of work that would actually

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.980
potentially repair, and
maybe even improve,

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.760
human higher functions.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.200
We've also gone into what
we would think of as

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.240
intelligence.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.820
So in rhesus monkeys, people
have been working on a chip

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:54.020
that goes into the frontal
cortex, the most executive

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.960
part of your brain that
controls attention and

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.000
thoughts and juggling various
different things are going on.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.200
So they take these
rhesus monkeys.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.450
They put this implant in
their frontal cortex.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.403
And they give them a monkey
IQ test, if you will.

00:21:08.403 --> 00:21:10.330
It's called a pick and match
test where they have to learn

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.550
to match up certain
things together.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.890
And while this is happening, the
implant learns the pattern

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.160
of what goes on in the neurons
of their frontal cortex when

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.900
they get it right and when
they get it wrong.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.160
So then they take these monkeys
and they impair them

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.400
to get them to have a lower
score on the test.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.400
They impair them by giving them
large doses of cocaine.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.970
So the monkeys aren't
complaining.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.440
They're pretty happy with the
experiment, I think, but their

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.550
scores actually do go down.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:41.090
Then in half the monkeys, they
put the implant into an active

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:45.000
mode to see if it can
restore their skill.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.210
And it can.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.440
But it also goes farther
than that.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:52.910
The average score of the group
that was not impaired or

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.230
enhanced was 75.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.790
The group that had the implant
put into in active mode scored

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.550
on average an 85.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.430
So they're actually using this
implant to improve the

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:08.520
monkey's skill on this monkey IQ
test, if you will, which of

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.740
course will lead to the cyborg
planet of the apes.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.240
But the real frontier, I
think, isn't so much in

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.240
enhancing individual
capabilities, though that is

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.780
something that we will
actually look at.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.300
It's really in communication.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.210
Once upon a time, computers
were about solo work.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.960
You had a computer because it
was a fancy word processor,

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.770
which really meant it was
a fancy typewriter.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:36.230
It was a fancy spreadsheet
machine, which really meant

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.880
that it was a very fancy abacus,
in a certain sense.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.210
But that's not what
actually changed

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.310
the world with computers.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.880
What's changed the world has
been their ability to

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.620
communicate things between us,
and with the cloud overall.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.200
And that's the direction that I
think is most exciting about

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.500
this sort of technology and the
direction that we really

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.320
go into in the novel.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.510
There is some work happening
on that today.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.420
DARPA is very interested in
all sorts of things that

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.340
improve human performance.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.180
And they have a particular
program called the Enhanced

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.310
Battlefield Communication
Program.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.820
And that program gave a grant
that funded this study.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.060
This study had two monkeys
in different rooms, with

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.700
soundproofing between them,
wired together via implants in

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.650
their auditory cortices, so the

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.730
auditory part of the brain.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:28.740
They would play a sound
for monkey one.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.230
And what they found as they
hoped was that monkey two

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.490
could hear that sound and could
identify it, could say

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:36.620
what it was.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.140
And DARPA's dream is to build
implants for soldiers where

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.720
the soldiers all have intuitive
knowledge of what's

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.010
happening to the other soldiers
in their squad and

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.320
the battlefield more broadly.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:51.090
Real science happening,
not yet in humans.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.540
We've also recently--

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.380
so now we've got motion
out of the brain.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.780
We've got audio out
of the brain.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.850
This is video out
of the brain.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.150
In humans--

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:03.040
this study was done last year.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.940
They put subjects in an fMRI
machine, a brain scanner.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.070
It showed them a clip
from video.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.550
And then an algorithm tried to
match that clip to what they

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:15.670
were actually seeing.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:19.010
So tried to match their brain
activity to what they were

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.750
actually seeing.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.220
Because it's techies here,
I can talk about it

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.210
a little bit more.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:26.020
What they actually did was the
algorithm had a library of

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.500
fuzzed out video frames that it
could access, and a machine

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.690
learning model that learned
how to-- or was trained to

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:36.170
match up different patterns of
brain activity with the most

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:40.700
likely clip from its
video library.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.120
And let's see how
it actually did.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.155
Now this is very, very
early technology.

00:24:47.155 --> 00:24:49.860
But you can see that just seeing
what's happening in the

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.920
patient's brain from the
outside, it gets some vague

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.020
idea of what it is that
they're looking at.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.490
Which is exactly what
we'd expect.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:16.040
In general in the brain, the
same neurons fire, the same

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.480
activity happens, when you're
seeing something, when you're

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.130
imagining that thing, and when
you're remembering that thing.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:23.800
There's some difference in
higher order bits of the

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.870
brain, but in the primary visual
areas or the primary

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.210
auditory areas, it's the
same sort of thing.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.380
All of this, by the way,
happened with brain scanners

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.350
on the outside.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.050
And those are very, very
limited in how high the

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:36.640
resolution they can get
is of what's going

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.640
on inside the brain.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.240
With actual electrodes in the
brain, this quality would

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.420
probably much, much higher.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:48.380
And now the team funded by DARPA
that did the hippocampus

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.230
improvement for the rats is
looking at linking the

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:55.760
hippocampi of two rats together
and seeing what could

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.510
happen, seeing if one rat who's
been trained to run the

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.660
maze can convey that information
directly to

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.050
another rat that's never
seen the same maze.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:06.830
Now like all experiments, the
first ones of this will almost

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.460
certainly fail, but we will
eventually get there.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.390
That's the kind of thing that
people are working on now.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.130
Then that leads, of course,
to Keanu Reeves

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.900
saying, I know kung fu.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.040
Now let's talk practicality.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.080
I've been spinning out what this
sci-fi world could look

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.460
like and it's really fun to play
with, but there are some

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.030
real limitations.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.050
The first limitation
is quality.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.550
Can any of you say what this
image is on the right?

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.110
If you've seen this example
before, please don't say.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.820
Anybody who hasn't seen it,
can you pick this out?

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:37.600
Is it Jesus?

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.960
Is it the Statue of Liberty?

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.660
It could be both.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.210
AUDIENCE: Woman with a hat.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.300
RAMEZ NAAM: Woman with a hat.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.400
Very good.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.320
That's awesome.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] put a hat
on the Statue of Liberty.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:46.620
RAMEZ NAAM: On Jesus.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.060
So Jens Naumann, the blind guy,
he has 256 electrodes.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.330
He has a 16 by 16 pixel
display essentially.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.220
This is the quality
of his vision.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.140
So you can see why nobody wanted
to be in that parking

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.500
lot when he was driving
in the car.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.320
He can basically see large
obstructions and not

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.080
much more than that.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.250
So quality is a big
limitation.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:06.360
And indeed, if you look at the
most sophisticated brain

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.090
computer interface we've ever
implanted in someone, has this

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.350
256 electrode situation
right now.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.240
And that's largely because the
people who have been doing

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.570
this have been neurologists and
neuroscientists and not

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:18.790
electrical engineers.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:21.320
That's not who've been
doing it so far.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.780
But they are starting
to get into it.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.620
And now you see labs devoted
entirely to developing the

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.560
hardware that's being used
in these experiments.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.970
University of Michigan has 1,000
electrode wireless chip.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.790
And a German company called
Infineon has a 16,000

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.170
electrode wireless chip
that's coming on the

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.180
market right now.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.360
So we will see that
bandwidth go up.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.180
And there's huge room
to improve.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.530
The chip in my laptop has about
a billion transistors in

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:50.090
it in a size not much different
than some of these

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.010
interfaces.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.470
Of course, these things are very
hot, but we don't have to

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:54.630
run them at gigahertz.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:58.010
If you run them at 100 Hertz,
your going to pretty much

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.550
match what the brain can do.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.860
So it's quite possible with
advanced technologies that we

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:06.590
already have in other domains
to dramatically increase the

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.580
bandwidth coming in and
out of the human

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.320
brain in these systems.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.080
And we don't have to go far for
it to suddenly look pretty

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.670
functional in terms of restoring
functionality for

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:17.850
someone who's been impaired.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.770
At 5,000 pixels, this is what
you see, which is a dramatic,

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:24.320
dramatic step up from 256.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:29.610
And 5,000 pixels is still
dramatically smaller than the

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:35.760
type of technology that we use
in electronics traditionally.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.190
The other very big limitation
is this is your brain we're

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:39.780
talking about.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.870
Very few of us are going to
voluntarily have brain

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:47.710
surgery, certainly not to get
256 pixel vision, or even the

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:49.850
5,000 pixel vision.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.190
So this is a very big hurdle.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.040
In the book, I get around
this by saying, hey,

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.510
you swallow the drug.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.820
The nanoparticles go through
your blood-brain barrier and

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.120
self assemble around
your neurons.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.990
It's all great.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:03.410
But that's not the technology
that we have today.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.020
Of course there have been other
cases where we've gone

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.810
from something being so unsafe
and so impractical to being

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:12.030
very practical.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.520
They used to say that
eye surgery would

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.860
never really take off.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.290
Our eyes are pretty
precious to us.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.650
Not quite as much as our brain,
but we don't trivially

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.050
mess with them.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:23.250
But the excimer laser that made
Lasik possible changed

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.920
that game tremendously.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.650
Before the excemer laser, there
were less than 20,000

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.090
eye surgeries done per
year in the US.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.320
Now we're over two
million per year.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.840
And the cost has gone down from
10s of thousands in the

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.150
distant past to a few hundred
dollars per eye right now,

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.700
depending on whether or not you
go with the very lowest

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.150
bidder on this.

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:47.860
Now is there an excimer laser
for brain surgery?

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.830
I don't think there's anything
quite that dramatic, but there

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.360
are technologies on the horizon
that are dramatically

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.800
simplifying and speeding
up brain surgery.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.620
And the ones that I think
about are neurovascular

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.010
stereotactic surgery.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.090
So what does that mean?

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.630
Neurovascular means they don't
cut open your skull, and

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.470
instead they get to the brain
via the bloodstream.

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:11.380
So they insert something into
normally the femoral artery,

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.720
and they can work this up.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.790
This is actually a diagram
for heart surgery.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.800
They could work it all the
way up into your brain.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.280
And they've been doing this
for aneurysms for the last

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.450
several years.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.630
It has dramatically reduced
the length of surgery, the

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:27.040
hospital stays, the cost,
and the risk.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.830
Because cutting open your skull
is serious business.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.560
The other part of this is what
we call stereotactic surgery,

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.920
which means that the probe is
being guided by magnets.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.030
So it happens in a fancy-looking
operating room

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.950
like this, probably not quite
as clean and perfect,

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.380
hopefully with some doctors
in it as well.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:47.020
But the doctors actually sit
at a terminal and use a

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.470
joystick to move the probe.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:52.140
The probe itself has a camera
on it so they can see.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.130
There's an imager that shows
them where it is on a

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.180
cross-section of the body.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.530
And then the large device around
this person is using a

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.910
shifting magnetic field to pull
the probe along in the

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:05.020
direction the doctor wants to
go with the joystick, rather

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:10.120
than this clunky old cutting
and so on and so forth.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.080
One of the real luminaries in
neuroscience, a guy by the

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.790
name of Rodolfo Llinas, who's
the editor of a journal called

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.990
Neuron, has proposed that we
could use this to build a very

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:21.720
advanced brain-computer
interface.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:26.610
What he points out is that
nanotubes are essentially

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.780
excellent wires, and are
very, very, very small.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:30.925
These aren't even nanotubes.

00:31:30.925 --> 00:31:33.810
These are nanowires that are
much bigger than a nanotube,

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.000
but they're still very,
very, very small.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.200
In fact, each of these is
about a quarter of the

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.140
diameter of the wavelength
of visible light.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.130
Visible light is about 400-ish
nanometers, and these are

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.280
about 50 nanometers across.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.950
These are so small that a bundle
of a million of them

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:52.100
would take up only about 1% of
the cross sectional area of

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.730
the smallest capillary
in your body.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.020
So Llinas says, hey, let's stick
in a bundle of a million

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.730
of these, work it up into your
brain, and then use the

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.460
magnets to make it spread out
and touch a million different

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.600
neurons in your brain
all at once.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.530
And he is starting to do animal
studies investigating

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:08.610
this technology.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:12.520
And we'll see if that's a viable
path to dramatically

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.830
increase the bandwidth in
and out of the brain.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.560
And this gets closer to the
technology of Nexis.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.390
So those are the hardware
issues.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.720
But let's talk about software.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.730
Some of us work on
software, right?

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:28.310
We all know that software is
absolutely perfect, especially

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.950
Microsoft software.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.380
I'll point at myself
a little bit here.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.730
I've never seen this
screen myself.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.590
I don't know, it's
a myth, I think.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:37.880
But what does it mean if the
software running in your

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.720
brain, or even just the software
your brain is talking

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.140
to, suddenly crashes?

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:49.480
What does that mean if you
get malware or a virus?

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.150
That could be a little bit
more serious when it's

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.460
something running inside
your brain.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.330
And in fact some of this
has been shown.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:59.560
Anyone know who this is?

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.000
This is a fellow named
Barnaby Jack.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.220
He's famous mostly for this hack
he did on the stage at

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.880
Black Hat I think in 2010, where
from across the stage,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.430
he made this ATM just start
spewing out bills.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.870
But lately Barnaby's been
interested in medical devices

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:19.580
and the security around them.

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.360
So in 2011 he did this hack.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.750
What he's got in his hand is
a custom-built antenna,

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:26.590
essentially.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:31.420
And what he's figured out that
he can do is that wirelessly,

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:35.850
he can discover any insulin pump
by Medtronic, the number

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:39.920
one manufacturer, within several
blocks of himself, can

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.350
sniff out their IDs, get root
access, and make them do

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:47.720
whatever he wants, including
pump out all 300 units of

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.620
insulin that they have inside of
them, which for a diabetic

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.570
would be lethal.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:54.030
That was 2011.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:59.430
In 2012, he did another hack
with a leading pacemaker model

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:02.095
where he demonstrated that in a
smaller range, within about

00:34:02.095 --> 00:34:07.270
50 feet, he could cause it to
drop a 730-volt discharge into

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.690
the person wearing it, which
would also be lethal.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.380
And in fact, do any of
you watch Homeland?

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.540
I'm going to give a spoiler, so
go la, la, la if you don't

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.610
want to hear this.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:16.639
In a recent--

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:18.469
I don't watch the show, but
I'm told that in a recent

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:23.280
episode, they assassinated the
vice president by remotely

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.679
turning off his pacemaker.

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:26.560
And if you recall, Dick Cheney,
when he was vice

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.070
president, for quite a
while, had no pulse.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:32.830
He was in continuous cardiac
failure and instead he had an

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:35.760
implanted pump that moved
his blood around.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.250
I don't know what
APIs that had.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:42.800
But science fiction sounds more
and more like real life.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.170
So security is a very
big challenge.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.100
That's one of the things that
the book gets into a little

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.929
bit, is what happens when people
can reroute your brain

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:52.290
or somebody else's.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:54.699
But the biggest question I think
of all of the stuff, as

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:57.500
it comes to pass, as I think it
will, is what's the impact

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.980
on society?

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.540
So the printing press is very
old information technology and

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.630
it's had marvelous effects.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.140
Let's talk about two effects.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.990
It supercharged innovation.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:10.200
By allowing ideas to spread from
person to person, it just

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.465
accelerated the rate of
invention, the rate of

00:35:12.465 --> 00:35:13.530
knowledge dissemination.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.580
And it didn't start
the Renaissance.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.450
Some other things did.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.580
But it really powered through,
and the scientific

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.180
revolution, and so on.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:24.600
It also was a great tool of
anti-authoritarianism.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.320
So it's famous, the first thing
printed on the printing

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.250
press was the Gutenberg Bible.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.450
Definitely a tool of authority,
if you will.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:37.270
One of the later things printed
on it was Martin

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:40.780
Luther's list of complaints
about the Catholic Church, his

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.060
pamphlets which he then nailed
to the doors of churches and

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:45.890
led to the creation of the
Protestant Church and the

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:47.910
erosion of power of the
Catholic Church.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:51.550
It was also used to print the
Revolutionary pamphlets in the

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:54.740
late 1700s of the founding
fathers of this country.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.560
So overall, information
technology has been a very

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.370
anti-authoritarian thing
in this context.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.150
But it wasn't always so.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:05.140
The very first information
technologies created by the

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.280
Sumerians and Egyptians
were in the hands

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.080
of a very few people.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.850
And they more allowed for the
creation of empire and the

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:17.150
clamping down on the freedoms
of the individual than the

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:20.430
other way around, again, because
only a small minority

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:24.190
had access to and control over
and the ability to use this

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:25.610
technology.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:27.440
So today we have that
conflict about

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.650
information tech currently.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:34.200
During the Arab Spring, this
picture made its way around, I

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.450
think taken from a
place in Egypt.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:39.840
Revolution tools, no longer
the AK-47, no longer the

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.610
machete, now Twitter
and Facebook.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:45.380
And to a certain extent,
this is true.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.470
Wael Ghonim, who was one of
the people behind the Arab

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.980
Spring, talks about how one of
the things that started this

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:57.070
was a video taken of police
beating up a student in

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:01.290
Alexandria, which was then
posted to YouTube and then

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:03.100
made its way onto Facebook.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.880
And the first Arab
Spring protest--

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.430
in Egypt, anyway.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:06.480
It was the second country.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.440
But the first ones there were
organized as a protest about

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.920
this kid's beating, and it
was a Facebook event.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.580
On the other hand, people will
tell you that in Iran, the

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:20.030
authorities have used Twitter
and Facebook to track down

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.190
people who are saying
anti-authoritarian things.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.425
So we still have this big
question of to what extent and

00:37:26.425 --> 00:37:30.020
in what situations will
information technology be used

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.780
as a tool of liberation versus
a tool of building

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.180
something like 1984.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.570
And that's the question I think
I try to most get that

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.430
in hopefully a fun
way in the novel.

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:40.690
And I am an optimist.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:44.140
I think that by and large, this
sort of technology, a

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.030
more intimate means of
communicating than ever

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.360
before, will be a hugely
positive thing for society.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.900
But we have to be on the lookout
for and guard against

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.210
its possible abuses as well.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:56.880
So that's it.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.130
Thank you very much.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.520
I think we have time
for questions.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.060
And there's some books
outside that I'm

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.550
happy to sign for people.

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:09.950
AUDIENCE: I've read that one
of the problems with the

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.700
electrode connections is that
they degrade over time.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.360
Has that gotten better
in recent years?

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.390
RAMEZ NAAM: Yeah, so it's
a very big question.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:19.710
In some ways, we don't know.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.600
So the brain doesn't like the
intrusion of electrodes.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.960
It treats them as a
foreign object.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.010
It tries to guard
against them.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.060
It builds scar tissue.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.140
So there's two frontiers
on that.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.000
One is making electrodes
smaller

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.330
and smaller and smaller.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:37.030
So the newest technologies of
nano probes are about 100

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.610
times smaller than
the current ones.

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:41.030
The other is what they call
bio-compatible materials that

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.450
won't break down.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:45.230
And there's whole labs dedicated
to just that.

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:48.522
We're still not there yet,
partially because no one has

00:38:48.522 --> 00:38:51.520
worn one of these things for
a very, very long time.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.840
So in some ways, we don't see
what all the effects will be

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.720
after you've had one
for 20 or 30 years.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.080
AUDIENCE: Would you like to make
some predictions for us?

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.500
RAMEZ NAAM: Oh my gosh,
predictions.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.470
I'll make a couple
predictions.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:11.410
By 10 years from now, the first
people with bionic eyes

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:11.860
will be here.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.710
In fact, it's probably
closer than that.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:16.280
You're looking at about five
years for approval of the

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.680
retinal prosthesis.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.680
And within 10 years, I'd say
there will be at least 100,000

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.420
people that have them.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:27.380
In the next 10 years, the FDA
will start acquiring threat

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:31.660
modeling and security validation
of the software and

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:35.260
protocols on your devices.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:39.310
There will be in the next 10
years the growth of a kind of

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:43.820
DIY hacking movement that wants
to hack their retinal

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:48.510
prostheses and their cochlear
implants and so on.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:51.530
Those are a few.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:55.375
AUDIENCE: Have people done stuff
outside the spectrum

00:39:55.375 --> 00:39:58.350
that we normally see or hear?

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:03.270
RAMEZ NAAM: Not exactly, but it
is possible to do sort of

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:04.560
translation or shifting.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.090
So it's totally possible to take
one sensory domain and

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:08.850
shift it to another.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:12.500
So we could take infrared with
a rental prosthesis, pick it

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:15.990
up, and compress it into a very
bright red, for instance,

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.450
on the screen.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.740
There's no obstacle to
that, really, at all.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:19.850
And you can see that.

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.110
There's a brand new retinal
prosthesis that's being

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.370
experimented with that does

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:26.180
something very funky, actually.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:30.890
So normally, the connections in
the retina aren't numerous

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:33.580
enough to give you the ability
to read, really.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.630
So this does something else.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:35.620
It picks up sight.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.420
It spots Braille.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:41.580
It sees Braille, and it
massively zooms the Braille,

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:45.130
effectively, and feeds that in
so that blind people can take

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.760
all of the books they already
have and actually look at them

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.040
and learn to read that way.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.100
So there's all sorts of
domain shifting that

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.180
you can imagine doing.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:54.520
AUDIENCE: One last question.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.320
When do you think we'll
beat the bandwidth of

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.250
our eyes and ears?

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.480
RAMEZ NAAM: That's a really
good question.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.576
When do we think we'll
be the bandwidth of

00:41:01.576 --> 00:41:01.970
our eyes and ears.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:03.180
I think it'll be a while,
to be honest.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.520
As much as I write about this
and so on, progress on the

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.760
electronics goes very, very
fast, but you're always more

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.230
conservative when you're
doing trials on

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:12.690
humans or even on animals.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:16.170
So I think it'll be on the
outside of that 10-year

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:19.110
spectrum, but probably not 20.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.610
BRAD TEMPLETON: There's a friend
of mine who made a

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:24.280
smartphone app that remaps
the colors just

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.070
in the visual spectrum.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.370
It doesn't go outside of the
visual spectrum, but it remaps

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.770
them so that they match more the
colorblind person's eyes.

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:33.215
So the colorblind people can
look through this and they can

00:41:33.215 --> 00:41:35.530
now tell the difference between
the red and the green

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:36.990
in the way they can't tell
with their own eyes.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:38.920
They can just hold up
their phone and say,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.750
oh, now I see that.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.320
That's kind of cool.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.610
Any more questions?

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.760
Yeah,

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:50.170
AUDIENCE: So I have a question
about these neural implants

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:50.950
and learning.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:53.350
I think in the book people
pick it up almost

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:54.270
instantaneously.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:58.250
But what do you think about
learning or the ability for

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:03.070
somebody who's in their
50s to learn--

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.530
just to pick these things
up quickly.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:05.860
Do you have to be young, old?

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:06.650
Is there any--

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:07.740
RAMEZ NAAM: It's a
good question.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.000
It probably will be the
case that being

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.550
younger will be an advantage.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:13.930
But we're also getting better
on the algorithm side.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:17.470
And we're in that feedback
is vastly important.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.900
So the first monkey experiments,
the monkey

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.330
couldn't actually see the
robot arm moving.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:24.530
And it never occurred to them
this was very important.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.850
So this was actually a very
famous monkey experiment where

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:30.375
the monkey sends its brain
signals over the internet to

00:42:30.375 --> 00:42:33.040
robot arms 600 miles away, which
was a great gimmick, but

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.740
it couldn't see the
thing moving.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:38.240
So it turns out that in most of
these systems, the learning

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.970
happens in both directions.

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:42.740
The system has to adapt.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:43.890
It has to be calibrated,
usually

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:45.430
intentionally, for the person.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:49.560
When they put in the brain
visual implant for Jens, they

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.250
spend time calibrating, like
learning what each pixel is,

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:53.580
effectively, on the grid.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:54.520
And they just--

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.890
it goes into the software.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:57.180
But it's also the case
that the brain

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.140
adapts to these things.

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.120
And it can adapt pretty
darn quickly.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.260
And now Johnny Ray, the
paralyzed guy, it took them

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.000
about six months to train
him to use his

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.410
one electrode system.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:10.140
Now they can get people working
pretty well in a

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.940
matter of several minutes.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.000
It's fast enough-- they've done
some studies where they

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.670
have a brain implant for people
who are either testing

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:19.840
it or people who are having
surgery for other reasons,

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.500
usually epileptics having
oblation done.

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.060
They ask their permission
to do this, and

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.180
the people sign off.

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:27.460
They'll put the thing on the
surface of their brain during

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.820
the surgery, and they're have
them playing Pong with it now

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.900
within 15 minutes before taking
it off, in large part

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.130
because the algorithms that
are interpreting what's

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:37.890
happening have gotten
a lot better.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:40.120
Which really means we've gotten
better understanding of

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.620
what the encoding is of these
data types, if you will,

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.780
inside the brain.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.592
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:43:46.592 --> 00:43:47.842
RAMEZ NAAM: Yeah.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.760
AUDIENCE: --books from, I don't
know, the '70s, '80s?

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.300
He was writing about people who
had brain implants that

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.380
stimulated their pleasure
centers, since they turn into

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:03.100
wire heads and sat and basically
had a cocaine high

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:06.080
continuously forever.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.290
What do you see--

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.290
I mean obviously this could be
applied to mood and a variety

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.590
of things other than
just information.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:13.670
What do you see happening
there and

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:14.700
how would it be regulated?

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:15.650
RAMEZ NAAM: Absolutely.

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:18.000
So in one of the early
experiments, those creepy

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.810
guys, Delgado and Heath,
they did some

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:21.160
very, very creepy things.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.540
One of the things they did was

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:23.850
simulation of pleasure centers.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.610
They used it in a couple ways.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.900
They tried to switch a guy
from gay to straight.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.975
By in a psych ward, they
put something in

00:44:29.975 --> 00:44:30.800
his pleasure center.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.680
They brought in a female
prostitute and then repeatedly

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.960
stimulated his pleasure
center.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.900
It didn't work, but they
were thinking that way.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.000
They gave another guy the
control over his pleasure

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.640
center, and found at some times
he would hit the button

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.530
1,500 times an hour,
which means about

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.850
once every two seconds.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.710
But the ultimate control is--

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:49.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
slow or something?

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.000
RAMEZ NAAM: I think maybe he got
really blissed out for a

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.730
second and then he'd come
to and be like, oh yeah.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:57.350
So the ultimate control is,
don't do the surgery to

00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:59.890
implant the electrode there.

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:04.290
And I think that that will be
the medical ethical norm in

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:05.200
most of these cases.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.760
But there are certainly
potentials for abuse.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.200
And actually in the sequel to
Nexus, I show a character that

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.050
has a very serious problem
that's developed as a result

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:17.480
of maybe not having the implants
avoid certain areas.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.030
AUDIENCE: I think--

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.930
I heard a technology called
transcranial magnetic

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:26.800
stimulation.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:30.390
So that seems a little bit
safer, maybe, because it's

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:31.890
completely external.

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.500
So do you have any--

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.790
RAMEZ NAAM: With transcranial
magnetic stimulation, and now

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:39.530
with direct current cranial
stimulation, they've done some

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:40.330
interesting things.

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:42.810
With the magnetic stuff,
a lot of it has been--

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:48.030
well one group can make at
least some people have a

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:50.430
religious experience or
something like that by

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:52.230
stimulating the right areas.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:55.540
And then with the electrical
stuff, they can also,

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:59.330
apparently, at least they're
claiming make people somewhat

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:01.750
autistic and have almost
savant-like

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:03.210
abilities appear in some.

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.600
It's kind of very early days.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.240
You're not sure how much
you trust the research.

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.860
You want to see 5 or 10 papers
on something first.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:10.810
With the direct current
simulation, something that

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.010
does look fairly repeatable
is that they can

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:14.270
speed learning time.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:16.450
So they can maybe cut your
learning time on certain

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:20.950
things by 20% by running a very,
very mild current across

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:23.350
the top of your skull while
you're learning something.

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:24.880
So that looks pretty neat.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.700
But it's not a technology that's
going to get you to

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:30.090
have, like video in or video
out or something like that.

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:31.550
BRAD TEMPLETON: The direct
current simulation actually

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:32.920
makes you more trusting, too.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:33.760
You're more--

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.170
so I wanted, when I go into
negotiations now, I say, would

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:39.170
you mind wearing this hat
while we have this

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:40.710
negotiation?

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:41.960
Nobody wants to wear the hat.

00:46:45.331 --> 00:46:48.440
Are we mostly done with
audience questions?

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.520
Matt has a question.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:49.760
RAMEZ NAAM: Oh.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.540
AUDIENCE: So what do we know
about the encoding?

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:55.310
With pixels, it's a linear
kind of thing.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:56.720
In the brain, is
it logarithmic?

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.240
Is it linear?

00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.250
How does that all?

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.380
RAMEZ NAAM: So it differs
by sense.

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.340
And the senses are going to be
a lot easier than the higher

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.980
functions because we can
kind of understand

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:06.910
what the coding means.

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:11.940
So in vision it is pretty much
spatial, in V1, the visual

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.260
area in the back of your head.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.860
But it's spatial with
some caveats.

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.870
Things are not entirely
spatial.

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:18.580
It's kind of more spatial
if you took the grid and

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:19.230
flattened it.

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:20.440
But then your arms, of course,
are all kind of

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:21.430
squiggly and so on.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:24.160
And then some neurons, they
are more including certain

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:26.910
colors, and more encoding
motion, so with those caveats.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:27.845
And we kind of--

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:30.910
I wouldn't say there's a
formalism of that encoding.

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:32.540
It's just that we've gotten
better and better at having

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:35.520
code that can actually
translate that.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.990
In audio, we think that
the encoding is

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:40.090
the frequency domain.

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:42.700
So as you shift from one region
to another, it gets

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.470
more and more towards
representation of higher and

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.290
higher frequencies.

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:48.940
In motion, it's more
complex than that.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.560
But one thing that's nice in all
of these, like a general

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.510
characteristic we're finding
is that we can get good

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:56.520
results with very sparse
connections.

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:57.820
In any given region,
we're sampling a

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.790
very, very tiny bit.

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:02.960
So it's not a very
fragile protocol.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.290
It's a very robust protocol
that just gets higher and

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:08.760
higher resolution as you
have access to more of

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.260
what's going on.

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.490
And there's other stuff we know
in the higher domains

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.500
even, we know some various
different things.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:19.870
Like in parts of your brain, you
can trace the recognition

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.240
of different animals
through one

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.310
particular area of the brain.

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:27.460
And you can find very reliably
that the cat versus dog areas

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.620
are kind of separate and in
the same relationship

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:33.040
physically in different
people's brains.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.760
And there's even weird studies
with taking monkeys, having

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.960
them look at pictures of a
cat, stimulating the dog

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.360
center, and getting them to
recognize it as a dog instead.

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:46.060
So there is very, very, very
funky stuff out there.

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:47.450
BRAD TEMPLETON: So there's a
physical difference between

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:49.690
cat people and dog
people then.

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:51.750
RAMEZ NAAM: I've never seen a
correlation of is that area

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:53.420
enlarged in one or the other,
but that would be a great

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:53.560
study, Brad.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.660
Let's put in a grant.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:55.470
BRAD TEMPLETON: That's right.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:58.500
I want to ask about mind
control, because you love mind

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:02.020
control and it plays
a role in the book.

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.190
And not just, though, in forced
mind control, but the

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:08.640
concept of voluntary mind
control, people wanting to

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.260
change their attitudes,
people wanting to--

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.200
or socially pressured
to do so.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.160
For example, there's a hormone
that makes some animals more

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.330
monogamous.

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:19.330
If that applied-- or a gene
therapy like that applied in

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:21.900
humans, you could see it being
part of the wedding vows.

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:25.150
Why won't you take this
treatment that makes you love

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:26.460
me forever, darling?

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:29.180
You love me, right?

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:31.710
What do you think about the
potential for mind control

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:32.910
from these?

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:33.930
RAMEZ NAAM: That's
the vasopressin

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:35.550
receptor gene, right?

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:38.870
Naked voles are one of the only
annals we found that's

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:40.810
really monogamous.

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:43.250
Yeah, I think people
will do it.

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:45.200
There was a time in my life
that I would have-- that I

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.400
felt like I was not very
outgoing or not very

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.170
adventurous.

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:50.860
And if I had an option to
change my dopamine DDR2

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:54.580
receptor and suddenly want to
go skydiving all the time, I

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:55.830
probably would have done it.

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:57.400
I might now.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:01.380
So I think people will
voluntarily engage in

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.000
technologies that will allow
them to change their own

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.690
personalities all the time.

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:07.510
Or for that matter, I want
something that's going to get

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:11.460
me out of bed and to the
gym reliably every day.

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:12.360
It's better than a
workout buddy.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.550
You've got a little app on your
brain that's like, up,

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:15.800
here we go.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.970
AUDIENCE: So question
on that vein.

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:23.240
It's already bewildering
difficult to keep track of the

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.130
options we have in life, with
the internet and so forth.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:29.480
So this is a future where
everybody has to understand

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.130
how the brain works and
what their options are

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:32.710
for changing it.

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:34.970
RAMEZ NAAM: Not necessarily.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.540
I would say most people who use
apps and their phone don't

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:38.750
understand how their
phone works.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.690
They have to have some
understanding of some

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:42.460
abstractions about the phone.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.680
But they don't have to be
neuroscientists of the phone.

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.340
They don't have to be EEs
to know, like, oh, I

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:48.520
really like this app.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.830
Or no, this kind of thing is
possible, they have to figure

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:51.400
out some things.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.110
Like, eventually people really
need to understand, is the

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:55.610
data in the cloud or
on their machine?

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.150
Because someday they might
not have signal.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:01.510
So they have to learn some
things about what's going on.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.590
But they don't have to learn
all the deep details.

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:07.410
But I agree that the future gets
more and more bewildering

00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:09.360
and that's a challenge.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:13.930
AUDIENCE: I wonder if we know
anything about memory.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:15.290
Like is there some way--

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:18.640
is any research into, like,
adding a hard drive to your

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:19.230
brain, basically?

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:21.130
Because you've talked a
lot about processors.

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:22.400
RAMEZ NAAM: That's what
people want to do.

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.300
I think it's going
to be tough.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:26.100
We don't understand
a whole lot.

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:30.040
But just like with vision and
sound and motion, the way that

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:34.100
we've actually made progress on
the encoding is trying to

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:37.020
repair these things in people
that have some sort of damage.

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.520
So that's the most encouraging
thing about the rat study and

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:43.450
so on, is that doing the work to
try to fix the damage will

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:47.220
functionally teach us more and
more about the encoding.

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.070
But today I'd say we
know relatively

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:50.566
little, to be honest.

00:51:50.566 --> 00:51:52.350
BRAD TEMPLETON: We used to
know more yesterday.

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:53.670
RAMEZ NAAM: It's possible,
some of us.

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:59.030
AUDIENCE: How does this change
your ideas about death?

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:01.720
And what do you--

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.870
let's say we build AI machines
in the future.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:07.380
How do we deal with the problem
that our biological

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.360
bodies are going to die?

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.060
RAMEZ NAAM: Well it's not really
exactly in this domain.

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:14.280
But I guess it's a large
extension of it, is I believe

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.890
uploading is possible.

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:18.690
Everything we know says that if
you had a complete map of

00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:21.040
your brain down to the molecular
level, at least, and

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.420
we could simulate it,
we'd have a copy of

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:24.610
your thoughts running.

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:26.580
We don't know how technically
difficult it is.

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:27.580
You can make a guess.

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.800
You can say, oh, if we get it
at the level of neurons and

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.340
synapses, that's probably
good enough.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:32.960
We don't know.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.440
We won't know until we get
there and try it, to be

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.700
totally honest.

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:37.130
So I think eventually
technology

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:38.320
will make that possible.

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.420
Ray Kurzweil thinks it's going
to be 30 years from now.

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:42.560
It might be 100 years
from now.

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.260
It might be 1,000 years now.

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:48.730
But the brain is just another
information processor, a very

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:50.330
messy one, a very
interesting one.

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:52.920
And it's really, the pattern
of information is you, to a

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.510
certain extent.

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:56.250
So we can eventually
decouple those.

00:52:56.250 --> 00:53:01.406
Just exactly when is still
a very open questions.

00:53:01.406 --> 00:53:03.900
AUDIENCE: Would you feel
like that was you?

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.170
RAMEZ NAAM: That copy of me
would feel that it was me.

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:10.080
That copy of me would remember
it being me right here

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.780
answering this question, and be
like, oh, I feel like me.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.620
And the other copy of me would
eventually be dead.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.950
So now, what if that copy
made 1,000 more copies?

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:19.700
Would they all feel like me?

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:20.430
Yes.

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:23.320
We will have to-- here's the
philosophical thing I'll say.

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:28.350
Right now, if I'll use computer
lingo a little bit,

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:30.610
we don't differentiate, when we
talk about me, between the

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:33.180
class and the instance
of the class.

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:37.500
So eventually our conception
of personhood will change.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.330
And we'll see, like, do you
believe that all other objects

00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:42.390
that are of your class
are the same as you?

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:44.012
In some ways, yes.

00:53:44.012 --> 00:53:46.820
And we'll start to make
that differentiation.

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:48.340
But we're not ready
for that yet.

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:51.250
Most philosophers don't have an
object-oriented programming

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:55.270
background, so we're not
quite ready for that.

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:56.510
BRAD TEMPLETON: Well thanks
a lot, Mez, for coming in.

00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.825
RAMEZ NAAM: Awesome.

00:53:56.825 --> 00:53:58.075
Thank you all.
