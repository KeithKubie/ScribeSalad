(logo whooshing)

00:00:01.132 --> 00:00:03.715
(bright music)

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.883
(dramatic music)

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.270
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.480
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.970
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.080
Our guest today is Samuel
Bowles, who is Research Professor

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.080
and chairman of the program
in Behavioral Sciences

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.750
at the Santa Fe Institute
in Santa Fe New Mexico.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.610
He's a prolific writer,
having published articles

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.220
in many magazines and journals

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.500
and his most recent book is

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.340
The Moral Economy:

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.340
Why Good Laws are no
Substitute for Good Citizens.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.440
Sam, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.850
- It's great to be here, Harry.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.690
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.410
- Well I was born in
New Haven, Connecticut

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.580
but I was raised pretty
much all over the place

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.580
because my parents lived
different parts of the country,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.070
Washington D.C. during
the Second World War,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.830
spent a lot of time in India
as a kid, going to school there

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.270
and other parts of the world.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.440
- Your father was U.S.
Ambassador to India.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.440
Before we talk about that,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.080
tell me what what you
learned from your parents

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.420
and how they informed your
perspective on the world.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.930
- Well I would say, Harry,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.108
that my mom and my dad
were Liberal Democrats.

00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:57.890
They were secular, they
were not religious people

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.900
but they had very strong values

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.790
about how we ought to
interact with each other.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.400
And they passed those values
on to me very strongly.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.070
- And was there a lot of
discussion about politics

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.570
and world affairs around the dinner table

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.010
as it moved from place to place?

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.170
- Well I think you could say

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.403
that you couldn't really
talk about anything else.

00:02:20.403 --> 00:02:21.425
(both laughing)

00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:25.320
Even from a young age that's
what got you airtime is

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.780
to have an opinion about something

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.890
and so I've been doing that
ever since I was pretty young.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.360
- And how old were you

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.270
when your father was
U.S. Ambassador to India?

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.460
- I was 11 when I went to
India and 13 when I came back.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.424
I missed junior high school,
that wasn't a bad to miss.

00:02:42.424 --> 00:02:44.350
(both laughing)

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.203
- Especially if you were
prepared for the new economy.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.780
And how did the experience
in India affect you?

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.220
- Well, you can imagine.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.500
I came from a small town
in eastern Connecticut.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.193
I went to an elementary
school that had four rooms.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.000
I was starting off in a high school

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.060
that had never sent anyone
to an Ivy League college

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.560
despite the fact that we were right next

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.943
to Yale and Brown and Harvard and so on.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.823
When I went to India,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.430
it was obviously shocking to me.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.080
I saw people literally
in the process of dying

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.430
because of their adverse circumstances

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.370
and lack of material support

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.010
and that isn't something I knew about.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.900
I mean in my hometown there
were exactly two poor families

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.460
and everybody knew why they were poor,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.780
one had an alcohol problem,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.483
one had some mental difficulties.

00:03:47.874 --> 00:03:49.980
We knew all that, because
we went to school together.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.670
And then all of a sudden you go to India

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.370
and it seems like everybody's poor

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.763
or the vast majority of people are poor.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.280
That had a huge impact on me.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.600
But also I didn't have
any American friends there

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.340
because I went to a school in which

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.010
my two sisters and I were the
only non-Indian kids there.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.740
And so you know what
11 year olds are like.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.240
They make friends pretty easily

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.090
and you know I was pretty
scared the first day

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.440
I went to school because I thought,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.520
well this is a little strange.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.000
But it wasn't strange at all

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.750
and as soon as I learned
that a football was round

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.440
and instead of being like
a football in America

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.450
and then you know got
over some of the things,

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.100
you know, I made a lot of friends.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.440
And having close friendships,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.410
your only friendships be with people

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.650
from a different culture is,

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.530
obviously I didn't think
about that at the time.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.580
These were just my friends.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.200
But thinking that way about people

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.930
who actually are quite different from you

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.230
in some ways really, really helped a lot

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.260
to open my eyes to the world.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.710
And after, and I lived a
lot of time in Africa too,

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.710
in West Africa and I think just growing up

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.940
with people who were
of a different religion

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.500
or different point of view just
made a big difference to me.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.380
- Yeah, given what your father was doing

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.020
there must have been a lot of interaction

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.830
even though what you
were one with notables

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.600
both in the Kennedy administration
and in Indian politics.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.839
- The first time he was
ambassador there was under Truman

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.070
and yes, he

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.760
and my mom did become friends

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.030
with a number of notable Indians

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.240
and I remember very well going to tea

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.350
at Jawaharlal Nehru's was home,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.810
he was prime minister at the time.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.560
And of course even at age
11 he was one of my heroes.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.260
I'd read all about him.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.940
And I was so amazed when
he asked my sister and I,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.000
wouldn't we have a look around the house.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.580
We're having tea in the garden

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.370
and he took us even to his bedroom

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.800
and on the table next to his bed

00:05:57.898 --> 00:06:01.120
was a picture of a poem

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.640
and the poem was Robert Frost's

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.290
and it was with the final passage,

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.010
and I have promises to keep

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.380
and miles to go before I sleep.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.030
And, of course, coming from New England

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.580
which was where Robert Frost was from,

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.030
I was so struck by that,

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.373
that this guy from India,
who was a very erudite man,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.210
chose to put that on his bedside table.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.430
And when my dad, my late
father, wrote his memoirs

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.520
the title of the book is Promises to Keep

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.740
which actually, I reminded him

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.740
that Nehru had that on his bedside table.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.540
And my dad was a big New
Englander so he liked it a lot.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.020
- And your father was also in
the Kennedy administration.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.755
Did he go back to India then?

00:06:43.755 --> 00:06:44.588
- [Samuel] Yeah.

00:06:44.588 --> 00:06:46.066
- But you were already
off to school by then.

00:06:46.066 --> 00:06:48.913
- Yeah, yes I was in college at the time.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.000
I was actually in grad school at the time.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.323
- So this is an indicator of,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.820
in a way of your future research,

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.200
because your research

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.060
and your writings are very much embedded

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.560
in a multicultural perspective.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.950
You really emphasize what we have to learn

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.150
from other places in the world.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.130
- Yeah, well I mean,
I'm an example of that.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.940
I learned a tremendous
amount both in Nigeria,

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.340
I also spent a good amount of time

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.550
in the Soviet Union under communism

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.290
and yeah it became part of what I knew

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.380
and what I knew how to do in the world.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.193
But the thing I think
which affected me most was,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.810
imagine like I'm going to this school,

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.620
the school by the way doesn't
have a single building.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.090
It's just old army surplus
tents and there's 2,000 kids.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.174
- And this is where now in India?

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.007
- In India, in India.
- In India, yeah.

00:07:47.007 --> 00:07:48.190
- It's called the Delhi Public School.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.210
It's now a famous school.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.260
At the time it didn't have any buildings.

00:07:52.333 --> 00:07:55.970
And I pretty quickly understood

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.540
that I was actually pretty average

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.660
and I was average in sports

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.480
and I was maybe not even average

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.060
in some of the academic
subjects because as I say

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.577
where I'd gone to school
was not a great school

00:08:12.577 --> 00:08:15.323
in my hometown.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.960
And I mean I'd been interested
in other things really

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.570
but I what I found is I was kind of okay.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:28.090
And then it struck me
that when I went to school

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.073
and came home on my bike what
I saw was abject poverty.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.943
And one day I went to my
mom and I said listen,

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:42.910
I'm doing okay in school I'm
okay, but I'm really not.

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.560
I can't do anything really better

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.170
than most of the Indian kids

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.900
and how come the Indian people are so poor

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.023
if we're just the same as them.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.270
And now that's a question
that's, you know,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.360
it's kind of an interesting
question from an 11-year-old

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.390
but of course there it was.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.300
It was staring me in the face.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.050
I was average but they were,

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.900
I mean let's get the facts straight.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.330
Americans at the time were 20 times richer

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.940
on average than Indians.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.090
So what could make up that difference?

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.720
My mom, who was a former social worker,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.250
and never lost an opportunity
to teach me a lesson or two,

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.360
she said something about colonialism.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.030
I don't recall exactly the answer.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.430
I don't remember thinking it
really explained very much.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.630
Today I think it might explain
a lot more than I did then.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.740
But that question stuck with me.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.590
I kept asking it in various
ways, asking other people

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.390
and after, I mean after a long time,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.390
that is after I graduated
from undergraduate college,

00:09:45.173 --> 00:09:46.006
- [Harry] And you went to Yale.

00:09:46.006 --> 00:09:47.870
- I went to Yale

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.800
I didn't go to grad school after that

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.690
because I was thinking of going into law

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.810
but I wasn't sure that was for me.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.810
So I took a job teaching school
in a remote part of Nigeria,

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.060
the far northeastern part of Nigeria

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.360
on the edge of the desert.

00:10:04.596 --> 00:10:09.240
And when I was there I, of
course, was once again confronted

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.010
by the vast poverty and
deprivation of people

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.730
who, I mean there I was a
teacher, and the students

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.930
in my classes were
extremely talented people.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:25.930
And so once again I asked
myself, what's going on here?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.110
And one night I remember
exactly when it was,

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.740
I decided I'm not gonna be a lawyer

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.220
I'm gonna be a teacher.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.900
I didn't decide to be an economist,

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.490
I decided that I wanted to teach

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.090
'cause I was really enjoying
the classroom a lot.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.400
And I had not a good experience

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.850
with economics as an undergrad.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.850
I'd taken one course in it
and it had been more or less

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.723
like an immunization shot.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.900
I got a little sick because of that course

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.300
but I knew I'd never come
down with the disease.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.040
So I was essentially immune to economics.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.700
But my experiences as a young man

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.790
in my early 20s convinced me

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.590
that I'd better study up on economics

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.470
because it was pretty important.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.790
And I also thought at the time,

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.650
the kind of questions I wanted
to answer were the questions

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.870
that had been asked by Karl Marx.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.910
And I understood he was kind
of an economist of some kind

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.320
so I'd better read up on economics

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.060
and see if I could understand the world.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.940
So that's how I got into economics.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.090
- And you went to Harvard
to do your graduate work

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:38.090
and have the sense that you
saw the importance of economics

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.600
but also of the institutions that surround

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:49.850
the focus on economic institutions.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.640
- Well that's putting it mildly.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.640
After my, well into my first
year, I was very disappointed

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:57.903
because I had gone there

00:11:57.903 --> 00:12:00.050
'cause I wanted to understand
the way the world worked

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.570
in terms of the inequalities
and the kinds of deprivations

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.923
that that people had.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.723
And I wasn't getting any of that.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.790
And I decided that I wanted
to study something else

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.150
and I was so busy as a grad student

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.970
I wasn't very well prepared,

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.730
that I didn't really have time to apply

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.910
to any other programs.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.230
I did go over to the anthropology
department at Harvard.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.870
I was very strongly discouraged

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.500
from even taking a course or two there.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.890
- [Harry] By the economics people.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.000
- By the economics people, yeah.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.500
They didn't think this
was really a very wise way

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.813
to spend my time.
- be corrupted.

00:12:38.813 --> 00:12:43.813
- And so you know then I
just kind of stuck it out

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:48.290
out of inertia and so
I became an economist.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.590
I got a degree and I was
fortunate to get a job at Harvard.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.893
And so at that point I was more able

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:02.290
to chart my own course and
actually teach my own courses.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:06.050
I was allowed to teach
a course on inequality

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.070
over some opposition of my colleagues

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.023
who initially said it wasn't economics.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.693
So then I was off and running.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.720
- At Harvard were there any mentors,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.540
either in economics or
outside of economics,

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.430
that were congruent with the
kind of the bug that you had?

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.263
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:13:27.263 --> 00:13:28.430
- There absolutely were.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.423
And the first person I taught
with was Wassily Leontief,

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.560
a Russian, an inventor

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.580
of what's called input-output analysis

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.980
in economics, a mathematical technique

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.263
which I had used in my dissertation.

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:52.076
A second was Alexander
Gerschenkron, an economic historian.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.450
And these were, these
people were guiding me,

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.310
supporting me, particularly Gerschenkron.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.473
I was very interested in economic history.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.620
Another person who I learned
a tremendous amount from was

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.090
Simon Kuznets considered to
be an economic historian.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.270
Now the amazing coincidence is all three

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:17.020
of them are Russians and they
were great intellectuals.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.300
They were the people who
I thought really were

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.280
what I imagined it would
be like to be a scholar

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.810
and I wasn't that impressed

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.730
with the other members of the faculty

00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:32.023
but I learned a lot there.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.313
But I after having such a good start,

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:42.490
I almost left economics because I realized

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.410
that most of my colleagues
we're not addressing problems

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.260
that I thought were what
economists should be addressing.

00:14:51.934 --> 00:14:55.077
And by that time it's late 60s, 68,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.013
I'm concerned about how
schools are organized.

00:15:01.013 --> 00:15:04.100
Why they essentially do so little

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.880
to enhance people's ability
to lead a flourishing life

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.110
and often it seemed to be so repressive

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.810
to the students and for
the teachers involved.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.740
I was very concerned about war,

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.593
of course the Vietnam War
was going on at the time,

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.360
and always about inequality.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.208
And the thing that happened to me

00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:28.300
that both almost drove me out of economics

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.550
but in the end really put me back was

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.060
I had known Dr. Martin Luther King

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.580
because I'd been part of
an organizing campaign

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.500
against the Vietnam War.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.000
And we had asked Dr. King
along with Benjamin Spock

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.623
to come and sort of kick off
our drive, the baby doctor,

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.010
and we had them going down the street,

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.490
knocking on doors and so on.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:58.270
And during that time I
was taking Dr. King around

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:03.010
and so he knew that there were
some economists at Harvard

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.580
that were interested in the
kind of issues he was raising.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.730
You know, Harry, towards
the end of his life

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.560
he was organizing the Poor People's March

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.100
and he was shifting not
from just civil rights

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.543
but to economic rights.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.920
And so he wrote or his
staff wrote and asked

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.490
if I could answer a bunch of
questions about the economy

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.690
as kind of background papers for the March

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.340
and I was thrilled.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.700
Imagine, can you imagine,

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.360
Dr. King's and I ask you to do something

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.780
about this you know to provide
some scholarly background.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.380
That's why I studied economics.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.370
And finally I was gonna get to do it.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.230
So I got the letter and I opened it up

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.540
and I was feeling quite proud of myself

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.240
that I was gonna get to do this
until I read the questions.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.720
And I read them and they
were damn good questions,

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.553
that's the good news.

00:16:54.553 --> 00:16:56.410
The bad news was I didn't have a clue

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:57.990
about how to answer them.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.130
I was incapable.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.913
I didn't even know where to look.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:07.240
Nothing in my economics training
had given me the background

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.700
that would say okay, here's
where you'll find that out

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.720
and here's how you might
approach that problem.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.040
And I was teaching courses

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.030
which were very heavy in mathematics.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.863
I mean be called mathematical
economics, I guess.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.400
And I remember being very ashamed.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.400
And I thought, well you know
this isn't what I wanted to be

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.740
and then I said, well wait,
I've got a lot of friends,

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.210
a lot of grad students working with me,

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.030
a couple young faculty members.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.460
Let's put a group together
and see if we can respond.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.293
And we did.

00:17:43.293 --> 00:17:45.400
We did almost nothing else for 10 days

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.573
and we wrote a bunch of background papers.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.440
I remember I wrote one about education

00:17:51.327 --> 00:17:53.730
and what could be done
to serve the interests

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.970
of less well-off and working-class people

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.063
in the school system.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.070
And that really did it for me.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.170
I thought, oh wow I can
do this as an economist

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:06.830
and then I just never
turned back, that was it.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.610
- And give us an example
of one of the questions

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.120
that King was asking.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.150
- Well, one of the questions
was about education,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.360
how to pursue the objective of equality

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.993
of educational opportunity,
what that might mean.

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:25.343
And another question
was about reparations,

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.410
that is what would be
the appropriate magnitude

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.530
of reparations to people
of color in America

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.103
particularly former slaves.

00:18:36.268 --> 00:18:40.650
And then interestingly he
asked what are other examples

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.790
in which there have been major subsidies

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.630
or handouts to particular groups

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.258
and what would the magnitude of those.

00:18:47.258 --> 00:18:48.360
And so we looked at all kinds

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.413
of massive payment subsidies
to railroads and so on.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:58.650
Another had to do with
the the white flight

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.450
from the central part of the city

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.733
and the suburbanization of jobs.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.120
And I forget the others.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.923
But it was, I mean I
learned more in that 10 days

00:19:08.923 --> 00:19:11.040
then I think I learned in grad school.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.500
- Looking at your career
I think it's fair to say

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:18.055
that you are a reformist within economics.

00:19:18.055 --> 00:19:23.055
You want to get, you want
to be a practicing economist

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.340
but you want to think about the problems

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.600
that are not being addressed.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.370
And so what the story you're
telling provides a link

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.420
because both your background obviously

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:43.420
but also that did an activist,
a brilliant activist,

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:50.290
Dr. King was asking you
questions that came out

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.460
of his activism and you were saying

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.430
or you were finding economics
couldn't give you the answers.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.263
- Yeah.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:05.730
I think reformist is, I'm
not exactly sure it's right

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:10.840
because certainly in the
70s I decided that this,

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.910
I mean I was teaching

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.620
what's called the advanced
microeconomics course

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.600
for grad students.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.530
And that's kind of this citadel

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.700
of the conventional wisdom in economics.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.700
And I remember when I had a sabbatical

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.880
and I decided I would go

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.380
to the Economics Institute in
Havana to teach a course there

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.520
on economic planning,

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.150
mathematical methods
for economic planning.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.770
I remember quite triumphantly

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.460
I went to the chair of the department,

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.560
he was a very kind gentleman.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.630
And I said and I'd been teaching
this course for some years

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.470
and it had been regarded
as quite successful

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.280
'cause I'd actually engage the students

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.140
in some difficult mathematical tool making

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.880
and tool building for them.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.070
And I said well that's the end,

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.447
I'm not gonna teach any more of that

00:21:01.447 --> 00:21:02.930
and I used a profane word.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.580
I'm not teaching any more of that

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.830
and I'm gonna do something else.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.193
And in a way that actually happened.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.330
When I came back I started
teaching courses on inequality

00:21:16.177 --> 00:21:20.540
and I had, so I'd made a turn

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.050
but I really did reject
the standard models

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.033
that I had been teaching that
were part of the discipline.

00:21:28.877 --> 00:21:32.620
I taught a lot about Marxian economics,

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.450
partly as a process whereby
I could learn a lot more

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.393
about the insights of Marx.

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:43.053
And I looked at other ways of
developing economic reasoning.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.530
And now I think that what's
happened is not so much

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.030
that I reformed economics

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.180
but I think economics reformed itself.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:59.080
So that I'm now a lot closer
to the conventional economics

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.570
of today than I was then

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.503
because economics itself
has changed so much.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.763
- I like to ask my guests often,

00:22:08.597 --> 00:22:13.597
what their suggestions are about
how students should prepare

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.770
to do the kind of work that you do.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:22.360
And let's talk about that

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.320
because when you look at your work

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.320
it's really interdisciplinary,
it's cross-cultural,

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.870
it's increasingly
dealing with experiments.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:39.930
Talk little about how that
evolved in your career

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:44.530
and what advice then that
leads you to give to students.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.220
- Well talking to economic students about,

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.883
which I know the most,

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.890
I often am asked by people

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.990
who want to be engaged with the world.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.040
And by the way, I think the vast majority

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.660
of economics grad students
come to grad school

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.120
with some kind of a passion,

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.510
some kind of curiosity about something

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.753
and wanting to better the world.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.170
So I think the, and then
the question is well,

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.200
how do you do that and how do you do that

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.373
and do good research.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.022
Well the first thing
that you have to learn

00:23:19.022 --> 00:23:22.140
as a young researcher is,

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.440
a piece of research is gonna
be published in a good journal.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.490
It isn't going to deal
with the whole problem.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.070
It's gonna deal with a little piece of it

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.800
and there's nothing wrong with that.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.580
And I would never criticize
the journals for requiring us

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.720
in publishing our papers
to do a very careful job,

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.063
sometimes on very narrow topics.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.700
The problem when you're that age is

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.250
that the thing you'd really like

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:47.720
to be doing is writing a book.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.270
A book which lays out some
kind of argument and so on

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.170
and the time will come for that.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:54.350
You can do it.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.980
I did it long before I had tenure.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.350
But that was at a time when
the job market was really good

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:04.220
and people weren't as scared
about what you're doing.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.100
But learning some good research tools,

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.040
learning how to define a research problem,

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.070
that's something which people
think it's somehow too narrow.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.220
Well, I'm sorry, it's not too narrow.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.220
You're part of a whole
process and it accumulates

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.740
and it's fantastic what's happened

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.140
in the last 30 or 40 years in economics

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.230
because a lot of just
hard work, paper by paper,

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.190
it didn't look like it added up too much

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.320
but then when you look at 30 years,

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.080
the whole profession has changed.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.900
And in terms of how it sees the basics,

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.600
like what are we like as people,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.120
how do we describe us, how
do we interact in society,

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.900
these are all things
that have changed now,

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.020
in how economics is done.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.590
Unfortunately the public
perception of economics is still

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.700
it's basically about supply and demand

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.060
and money and that kind of thing.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.340
But we've really moved on.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:58.340
- And is interdisciplinary
work the key to the changes

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.640
that are going on within economics itself?

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.810
- No, it's interesting, Harry,

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.210
what I think happened was in economics

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:13.210
some changes took place for,
I don't mean any disrespect,

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.470
but for rather nerdy reasons.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.520
I mean people were just
pursuing their research

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.790
and it turned out that
things didn't fit right

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:21.470
and so we had to make these adjustments.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.590
I'll explain what I mean
about that in a minute.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.370
But the changes in economics led

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:30.130
to a description of the
economy which was incomplete

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.730
without interdisciplinary input.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.530
So the interdisciplinarity
was a consequence

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.820
of the changes in economics
not a cause of it.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.490
Now, here's an example.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.700
One of the things that
economists now recognize is that

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.750
if you and I have a contract for example,

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.460
suppose you employ me to do a job.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.280
Well, you can require that I come on time,

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.250
you can even require that
I obey your instructions.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:56.710
But there's no way in the world

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.670
that you can write a
contract about exactly

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.700
what I'm supposed to do unless I happen

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.060
to be doing a very routine job.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.003
But if I'm, for example,
caring for your kids

00:26:07.003 --> 00:26:10.320
or doing scientific research
or waiting on tables

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.300
in your restaurant or just about any other

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.850
of the massive number of
jobs in the service economy,

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.960
you can't write down
what I'm supposed to do.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.230
You've got to get me to
do it some other way.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.050
Now our description of that

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.100
in economics is the
contract is incomplete.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.600
It's incomplete because you have to pay me

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.800
and I have to show up.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.940
That's not what's going
to make profits for you.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.648
What's gonna make profits for
you is me doing something.

00:26:34.648 --> 00:26:38.920
Now why does that get
interdisciplinarity on the table?

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.160
Well if the contract was complete,

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.210
if you had essentially
written down exactly

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.670
what I had to do if I didn't do it,

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:45.670
you wouldn't pay me.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.330
And so there's or if you had paid me

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:52.930
you could even get my wages back

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.690
by going to court.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:59.690
Now if the contract's incomplete,
what do you have to hope?

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.350
You have to hope one of two things.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.750
One is that I have a work
ethic which leads me to

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.730
as a matter of pride or commitment

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.120
or my obligation to you to do a good job.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.520
So my morality, my social
norms become important to you

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.630
because you can't get
me to work otherwise,

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.700
'cause you can't force me to do it.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.570
The only other thing that
matters is your power over me

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.460
which you may have because actually

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.360
it's a pretty good job you gave me

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.760
and if you fire me I'm out of luck,

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.130
I'm on the street.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.940
And unlike the models of supply and demand

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.430
where the curves always cross

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.240
that what that means the curves cross is

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.860
it means supply equals demand.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.160
What that means to me, who you just fired,

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.280
is I can walk across the
street and get a job,

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.300
equivalent job somewhere else.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.450
Now if I can do that, make my day.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.000
I don't care Harry, fire me,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.160
I'm going across the street.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.660
Right, so you get the problem.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.900
Now, so how can you avoid that?

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.830
You better pay me more than
I can get on my next job

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.410
or there'd better be some unemployment

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:04.673
so maybe I won't get
another job for a while.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.400
That means you're gonna
have some power over me

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.020
and the only way you
get me to work is either

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.720
if I want to do it for moral reasons

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.210
or if I'm scared of getting fired

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:15.970
or some combination of the two.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.450
Immediately you get on
the table social norms

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.850
which means sociology,

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.930
you get the exercise in power
which means political science.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.620
So you immediately get
Durkheim on the table

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.600
and you get the great political scientists

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.930
who have studied power like Robert Dahl,

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.980
they're included now.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.830
And notice this is not interdisciplinarity

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:41.400
because I'm interested in
something that sociologists study,

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.320
it's not 'cause I think
we should be broader

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.370
and I should be studying things

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.660
that other disciplines study.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.800
What I'm saying is that if you
want to be a good economist

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.900
you'd better learn some sociology
and some political science

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.260
because modern economic,
micro economic theory,

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:02.120
as taught in grad schools is
about strategic interactions

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.020
in which social norms and
the exercise of power is

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.423
an intrinsic part of the story.

00:29:07.423 --> 00:29:12.423
- In philosophy of theory let's say,

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.420
you propose a theory that simplifies,

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.410
that make certain assumptions

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:25.340
that clarifies a particular
part of the universe

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.016
and what you're suggesting now is that

00:29:29.016 --> 00:29:32.560
as the economy changes

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:36.570
that economics has had to adapt

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:41.390
because the power of its
theory is being reduced.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.070
Is that a fair restatement?

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.630
- I think that's right.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.160
But I don't think that economics changed

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.823
because the economy changed.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.480
I think the economics that we had really

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.670
from the most of the past century,

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.700
the microeconomics was simply,

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.890
I mean people criticize
it 'cause it's too simple

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.120
and they criticize it 'cause
it's too mathematical.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.180
I don't agree with either of those things.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.420
I criticize it 'cause it was wrong.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:15.150
That is it was the wrong
benchmark, the wrong abstractions,

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.530
the wrong simplifications
that lead us away

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:18.483
from understanding things.

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:20.900
Because of the assumption, for example,

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.870
the supply always equals demand

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:25.000
because of the assumption
that you can get me to work

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.220
just by writing a contract and so on.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.500
Those are fundamentally wrong assumptions

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.470
about how markets work.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:36.470
Now, of course, the economy is changing

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.930
and it's a good thing that
economics has also changed

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:43.580
because the old models
they might have worked okay

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.830
in factories where you
could regulate my speed

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.420
by the speed of the assembly
line or something like that.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.220
But they don't work at all in the examples

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.540
that I gave whereby the quality

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.410
of the job well done
is very hard to define.

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:59.070
For example, if I'm caring for your kids

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.130
or if I'm an elementary
school teacher and so on.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.960
So, true, the economy is changing

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.030
and fortunately I think
economics is going to keep up

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.430
because it's changing too in terms

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.140
of the way we see our
microeconomic theory.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.610
- Your book The Moral Economy,

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.320
which I can show to our audience,

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.870
in reading it that's what led me

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.560
to find a word to describe you

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:28.560
because you are grappling
with some of the concepts

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.730
and showing as you just did
with regard to contracts

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.690
that they are inadequate

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:42.690
in helping us understand the
richness of the environment

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:47.630
in which the economy operates.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:48.800
- Yeah, that's right.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.800
- And so what also emerges
in this book is a sort

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:58.510
of a dual way of looking at the world.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.210
One in terms of incentives

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:04.390
which fits the traditional model

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:09.167
and for which there are
well-developed concepts in economics

00:32:09.167 --> 00:32:13.670
but on the other hand other factors,

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.390
particularly social norms,

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:21.240
that focus on things like equality,

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.320
reciprocity, altruism, and so on.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.780
Talk a little about that

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:30.300
because what you're saying
is we economists assumed

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.620
that incentives dealt with it all.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.540
But in fact what this book shows is

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:40.715
that there is a crowding
out of these other virtues.

00:32:40.715 --> 00:32:44.539
- That's right or in many cases
there is that crowding out.

00:32:44.539 --> 00:32:45.372
- [Harry] Yeah.

00:32:45.372 --> 00:32:47.010
- I want to tell you a
story about that book

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:48.756
because I know you're interested in

00:32:48.756 --> 00:32:51.340
how people do their work.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.380
I started that book in 1989.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.610
I must have started it before then

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:00.860
because the first paper I
gave summarizing the content

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.710
of this book was in 1989.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.990
I remember very well it was
in the philosophy department

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.330
in the University College London

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.630
and at the time the
paper was well received.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:12.920
But I wasn't happy with it.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.070
I didn't think it was very convincing.

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:20.070
And so in the intervening
decades I engaged

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.760
in doing some experiments
on human behavior

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.930
and a lot of other people much better

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:27.060
at experiments than I, did the same.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.780
And so there was an
accumulation of evidence

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.360
and at the same time I decided that some

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.630
of the philosophical
foundations I that had used

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.960
in the paper weren't really very adequate.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.630
And so I, for example, I
intensively read Machiavelli

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.620
from whom I learned a great deal.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.060
I was able to read him in Italian

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:49.853
'cause I was at the
time teaching in Italy.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:55.400
So that process just
went on for a long time

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.940
until I was finally happy
with the the outcome.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.510
But an important intervening
step was the following

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:07.090
and I'd like to convey
this again to those of you

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.263
who are listening who are
students or young researchers.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:16.120
I didn't know what tools I
would need to write that book.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.300
I knew I had a question
and the question is

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.110
how do our preferences and values change

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:25.170
as a result of the economic environment

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:26.220
in which we function.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:32.230
Now shortly after I had that
kind of false start in London,

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:35.540
I started to think well who
could help me with that?

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.020
And the first idea I
had was, well you know,

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.930
I think our values are a
little bit like our accents.

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:45.380
There are things we acquire at a young age

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.960
but like our accents if we work at it

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.330
we can change them too.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:51.453
But we probably don't that much.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:55.930
And I knew that their
study of language use was

00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:58.090
very highly advanced and quantitative.

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:03.060
So I reached out to a bunch of
scholars in sociolinguistics

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.810
to see what I could learn from them.

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:09.500
And the other thing I
thought was I wondered

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:14.500
if there wasn't an analogy
to a biological evolution

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.640
that is the way particular
traits are favored

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.330
through higher fitness.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:22.420
I wondered if there wasn't
a cultural analogy to that

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:26.040
and so I reached out, these
are people I didn't know,

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.180
I just wrote letters,

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.500
that's back in the days
where we wrote letters.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.340
I wrote letters to some biologists

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.440
in the field of population genetics

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.930
and some others who were applying

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.573
those models in anthropology.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.290
Now notice I didn't ask a single economist

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.410
because I didn't think there
was an answer in economics

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.690
'cause I knew the field pretty well.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:48.740
But I did think I might
find answer elsewhere

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.950
and sure enough it worked out.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:54.280
The socio linguistics part
didn't pan out very well

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.730
but the biology part of
the anthropology became

00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:00.633
really important in my
being able to establish,

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.283
I think a basic understanding
of the following.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.610
It's possible and I think likely

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:12.110
that humans beings evolved
not simply culturally

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:15.000
but also genetically with a predisposition

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.540
to be altruistic towards others.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.380
Now that's a shocking statement

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.240
'cause among biologists it
was thought to be impossible

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.390
because of course the
survival of the fittest means

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:29.210
the survival of the selfish
according to most biologists.

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:31.620
So I had to do some hard work in biology

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.200
and I spent a decade and a 1/2
learning population genetics,

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.750
studying natural selection,
developing mathematical models

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.780
of the process and developing a way

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.720
of understanding natural selection

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.010
in which it's quite likely,

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:47.860
and I think given the evidence probable

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.360
that humans developed a genetic
predisposition towards that,

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.743
I say, generous ethical
and altruistic behavior.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.410
Now that brings me back to this book.

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:01.960
Once I had done that I
did most of that work

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.943
with Herbert Gintis but also
with other collaborators,

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.030
I asked myself, well
if that's really true,

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.503
shouldn't we go back
and rethink economics?

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:16.780
And there's a field in economics
called behavioral economics

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:21.780
which has demonstrated
using behavioral experiments

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:24.800
that people have probably
really are generous

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.820
and when it comes to dividing
up real money and so on.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.870
And it's kind of a boutique
field if you know what I mean.

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:34.490
It's ghettoized and students
can take it if they want

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:38.310
and it's kind of, it's cool,
but it's not really central.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:40.340
And I thought now wait a minute,

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.350
if that's really what people are like

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.720
then economics has got to change a lot

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.590
and not just some field
over there on the side.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:52.300
A paradigm into social sciences
has to answer questions

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.340
about what are we like,
what is society like,

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.400
how do we interact?

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.830
You know different disciplines
will do it differently

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.800
but if something fundamental

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.470
about how what we're like has changed

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.840
well then it probably has ramifications.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.310
And so then I decided what I would do

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:10.143
as I've already said,

00:38:10.143 --> 00:38:13.000
I don't think I'm that great
a behavioral economist.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.100
I'm not very good at designing experiments

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:19.090
but what I thought I might do is see,

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.160
well suppose those results were true

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.260
and taken on board how would
economics look different?

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:27.670
How would ordinary
microeconomics, public economics,

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:29.420
labor economics, international trade,

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.420
history, philosophy and economics

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:32.810
how would all of that change?

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.290
So that's basically the
last couple of decades

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.880
that's been what what I have done

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.440
with a rather large research team

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.540
of very talented collaborators.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.640
And this book is an example
of that trying to say,

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.810
okay, let's think again about incentives

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:53.410
and what we show in the
book is that incentives are

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.540
of course essential to
running a modern economy

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.810
but in many circumstances
they don't work very well.

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.430
And the reason why they don't work well is

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.180
if, imagine you've got a problem

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.280
and you want people to do the right thing.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:14.670
Say, for example, that
parents are coming late

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:17.270
to pick up their kids at a daycare center.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:20.880
And now you could jawbone them

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.330
and say well come on you ought to show up

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:28.360
and or you could fine them if
they don't show up on time.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.160
And so a lot of things you could do.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.470
Now interestingly a couple of economists

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:40.470
who tried an experiment in Haifa, Israel,

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:43.870
in which parents were coming
late to pick up their kids

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:47.260
it was a chain of daycares,
there were 13 of them.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.360
And they so they decided
what they would do is

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.560
they would impose a fine

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.330
and because this would be an experiment

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:57.610
they imposed a fine in
half of the schools,

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:59.450
half the daycare centers
and not on the others.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:01.530
So that others would be the control group.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:03.100
And what they found is really, I mean,

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.330
they just put a notice on the door

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:09.220
and said as of tomorrow if you come late

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.440
you're gonna be fined a certain amount.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.140
And no explanation was given

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.140
but I guess the parents understood.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.390
And then they'd recorded how
many people are coming late

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:19.300
at all these daycare centers

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.570
and they imposed this fine

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:22.520
and then they recorded what happened.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.900
Well, I mean, I wouldn't
be telling you this

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.050
if what happened is what
they thought would happen

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.030
which is they'd stop coming late.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:32.520
In the daycare centers in
which the fine was imposed,

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.953
the number of people coming late doubled.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:37.777
Where the fine was imposed

00:40:37.777 --> 00:40:40.220
the number of people coming late doubled.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:43.430
In the other in the control
group nothing happened.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:45.770
So how do you interpret that?

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:48.850
Why did the fine make people come later?

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:51.640
Well there are a lot of
possible ways to interpret this

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.500
but the most parsimonious
I think is very simple

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.630
which is if you put a price
on something people say,

00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:02.030
oh I can buy it, lateness
is a commodity I can buy.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:05.750
I'll step right up and buy
some if it's convenient for me.

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:08.250
Now of course you may think, well, okay,

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:10.580
if they charge $100 for coming late

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.790
they probably would have come on time.

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:13.870
Of course they would have

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:15.580
but that's beside the point.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.440
There's of course some fine
that will get them to shape up.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.890
But a fine of a normal amount,
of the type that they did,

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:23.020
actually had the effect

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:26.290
of changing the type of problem it was.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.910
It was no longer a problem like shopping

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.660
in which it's perfectly okay
to try to get a good deal.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:34.710
I mean it was no longer a problem

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:36.520
like dealing with your
neighbor or your family

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.000
in which there's some
moral or ethical reason

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.460
that goes into you should try
to be respectful and so on.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.480
It turned it into, by
putting a price on it,

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.890
it turned it into a shopping problem.

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:47.630
Do the best you can according

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.760
to the dollars and cents dimension.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.520
And for some people it
was worth it to come late.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.740
But every night I know some people

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:58.030
neither you nor I would ever do this

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:00.280
but I know people who
routinely park illegally

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.310
and they say, hey, it's only $25.

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:05.470
So that's the price of parking illegally

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.510
and that once it's seen as a price

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:08.820
you have no moral obligation

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.690
as long as you're willing
to pay the ticket.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:15.110
- One of the things I wanted
to point out in your book

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.220
which relates to what
you're talking about is that

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.850
you go through the history
of economic thinking

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:22.710
in defining incentives.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:26.960
And what again and again you
show is there was a nugget

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.940
of truth in what the great thinker said

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.260
and then it was ignored basically.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:40.250
And so in the book you were taking

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.650
these assumptions, for example,
what you just discussed,

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:48.150
separability, the notion
that you could separate

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:52.140
or you're just doing
this to use incentives

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:55.428
and it doesn't affect the moral issues.

00:42:55.428 --> 00:43:00.283
So it's really challenging
traditional theory

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:06.500
and informing it with careful thinking

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.360
about what the implications are

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.670
of particular pieces of a theory.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:16.840
- That's right, and you
look at the great economists

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.570
and you think now wait a minute.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:21.400
Did they really get it that wrong?

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.400
Were they really so stupid as to think

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.410
that we respond to incentives

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:29.463
but there are not other kinds
of reasons for our behavior?

00:43:31.215 --> 00:43:33.700
No, of course they were not that stupid.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.700
Adam Smith is well known to have written,

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.370
The Wealth of Nations, but he also wrote,

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:39.003
The Theory of Moral Sentiments.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.410
Machiavelli, who's often quoted

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:48.410
as if people are just selfish
and wicked as he called them,

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.270
goes on and on about the
essential role of social norms

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:53.953
and values in good governance.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:58.570
So if you read carefully
what they're saying,

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:01.830
these are wise, wise people who understand

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.550
that incentive play an important role

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.230
but also social norms

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:08.230
and we have to think of
the two of them together.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.200
What they missed was the fact

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.960
that you can't separate the two

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.180
as if you can you have a dial over here

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.420
and you can crank up the
incentives a little bit

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.400
and then you might also
have religion over here

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.640
and crank up people's
social norms and so on.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.460
It's as if the two dials aren't connected

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.420
but it turns out if you
turn this dial up too much

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.320
you're gonna diminish
some of the importance

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.900
of the social preferences

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.490
and ethical reasoning in some cases.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:35.330
Now I want to say, there's
a whole lot of jobs

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:37.270
in the modern economy that only work

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:38.920
'cause people are paid well to do them

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:43.270
because people have no
reason to do them otherwise.

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:44.870
That's unfortunate, it's too bad

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:46.840
that our economy has a lot of jobs

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.170
which people don't have
an engagement with.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:52.290
But I don't mean to suggest
that we shouldn't use incentives

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.370
where we can dispense with them.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:55.020
Of course we cannot.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.720
But we should understand
that when incentives are used

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.850
in a way that either dominates
a person or exploits them,

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:03.330
you're gonna get a negative reaction

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.840
if the person has some freedom
to choose a negative reaction

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.770
and we see that in the experiments

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.570
and we see it in real life.

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:15.200
- You are involved in
helping to lead a project

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:19.693
which is trying to transform economics

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.830
with a new curriculum

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:25.723
which is available online universally.

00:45:27.365 --> 00:45:28.890
Talk a little about that.

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:32.150
- Well this is a project that started,

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:35.800
it's probably influenced by
the 2008 financial crisis

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.740
but it had been brewing in the minds

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.170
of a lot of us for a while.

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:45.170
And it was the, someone
initially called it, the project,

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:49.923
economics as if the last
30 years had happened.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.760
Now it wasn't just the last
30 years of the economy

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.713
it was the last 30 years of economics.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.830
We began to to notice
that what was going on

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:06.510
in the intro classrooms in you
know EC10, had nothing to do

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.600
with what we were
teaching our grad students

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.820
and it had nothing to do with

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.450
how we were talking amongst
each other researchers

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:15.543
about the kind of economics
that we do and think about.

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.390
So the intro courses were teaching

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.870
extraordinarily out of date,

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.513
not up to the frontiers of
economics kind of reasoning.

00:46:27.254 --> 00:46:30.350
And this happens from time to time.

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:33.470
The great physicist Feynman in the 60s

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.850
when he was teaching at Caltech
he had the same realization

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:40.700
which is that the physics students then

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:45.700
they wanted to learn about
things about nuclear energy,

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:50.290
they wanted to learn about
the frontiers of physics

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:54.350
and what were they getting,
levers and incline planes

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:56.220
and all kinds of stuff like that.

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.140
And maybe at the end of a course

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.220
or at the late in your major
you might get something

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.430
about modern physics.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.410
Well what Feynman decided to do is,

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:06.580
let's put the new stuff
in the front of the book

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.783
instead of the back of the book

00:47:08.783 --> 00:47:11.770
and we thought, yeah,
why don't we do that.

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:14.210
Why don't we give the undergrads,

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:17.630
obviously a much simplified
introductory version

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.103
to what we now teach our PhD students.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:26.370
And so that was our first
idea that we should do that.

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:30.420
And the second thing is
the economics of today

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:34.240
in the intro classroom appears
to have almost nothing to do

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.820
with why the students are
there in the first place.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.170
Listen to this.

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.340
Around the world, we're
a global organization.

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:43.440
Around the world we have
done over and over again

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.000
we go to a classroom of people

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.390
who it's their first course in economics

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:51.740
and before anything,
before we say anything,

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.910
we say please take out a piece of paper

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:57.750
and write on the paper what do
you think economists should,

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:00.250
what issues should economists
be addressing today.

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.531
I should have brought it here, Harry,

00:48:03.531 --> 00:48:04.840
because we make word clouds of these.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.140
And the size of the font is indicating

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:08.753
how common the word is used.

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:13.250
Well the first time we
did this we were amazed.

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:15.890
It was at University College in London

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:17.790
and these were as they
say first year students,

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:19.690
never heard about economics

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:24.280
and the word inequality is
this big in the word cloud.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.780
And then there is climate change

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:32.190
and then there's other
words like instability.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:33.990
Interestingly, this is in 2016,

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:41.260
this big was the word Donald
Trump who the students,

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.500
the beginning students thought
was an economic problem

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.690
that would have to be addressed.

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:47.990
When we did it later the students there

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:51.100
in UK would write Brexit
as a really big one.

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.560
But around the world inequality is giant

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:55.530
in these word clouds.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:58.233
And it's very, very
similar wherever you go.

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.470
Now when we mentioned this to some people

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:04.410
they said well, yeah, a bunch
of left-of-center students

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:05.990
that's what you got there.

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:08.920
So we tried it once at
the Bank of England.

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:12.893
The head of this project, Wendy
Carlin, a professor at UCL,

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.470
regularly goes to the Bank of England.

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.350
She's an adviser to parts
of the British government

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:21.470
and so she was going to give a talk

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:22.880
to the incoming recruits.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:23.980
They're almost a hundred of them,

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.690
almost all of them successful
economics graduates

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:29.100
who decided to go on in finance.

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.470
So she did the same thing with them

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:33.200
and if I showed you that word cloud

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.250
you would not be able to pick it out.

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:38.843
Same thing inequality this
big, climate change and so on.

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:43.070
We did it at the Central Bank and Treasury

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:44.430
in Wellington, New Zealand.

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:47.700
We got the same answer with
a 120 professional economists

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.680
in the business of finance.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.800
That's what people think
economics should be doing.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.720
Do you find that in the textbooks?

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:58.040
Well maybe in chapter 34
which you never get to.

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.800
They say it's good reading for the beach.

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.630
So in our book we start with,

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:06.740
here's what's going on in the world

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:10.950
and we look at what we call
the capitalist revolution,

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:12.980
this extraordinary thing that happened

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:16.460
when capitalism occurred
which is income per capita

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.050
in the world had been
going along like this

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:21.910
for almost a thousand
years in which we have data

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:24.770
and it went almost vertical.

00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:27.380
It looks vertical on a graph in the UK

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:30.100
after that some other places Japan,

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.650
finally belatedly, India and China.

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:34.290
We call that the capitalist revolution.

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:36.190
And we think that's associated

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:38.960
with these countries
essentially experiencing

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.960
what we call the capitalist revolution

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.110
but that's also what made
the world highly unequal

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:45.696
between the countries
that were rich and poor

00:50:45.696 --> 00:50:47.780
and also that's what,

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.040
and we present evidence on climate change.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.390
That's what now imperils
the entire entire humanity

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:56.860
because of climate change.

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.670
That's what they get in the first chapter.

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:00.270
Now notice what's gonna happen.

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:03.200
If you put that stuff
in the first chapter,

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.390
you're gonna have to
change the rest of the book

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:08.190
because you can't just be
teaching them supply and demand

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.550
and then expect that
they're gonna understand

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:13.640
why capitalism took off, why
our climate is endangered,

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.440
why the world is so unequal and so on.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:21.397
- So let's give our audience the URL,

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:27.527
core-econ, E-C-O-C, .org.

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:32.920
And there's an online
textbook, there's a curriculum

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.820
and there seems to be a lively discussion

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:41.820
about issues emerging in
newspaper articles and so on.

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:47.950
So this seems to suggest

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:51.393
that the young people,

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:56.290
maybe people in general are more attuned

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:58.730
to the problems we need to confront

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:03.730
but the institution of
economics departments,

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:07.270
not necessarily individual,
are not adapting

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:11.740
and the new technology provides a way

00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:15.390
to put something out there
that everybody can reach

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:18.180
that can help address this problem.

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.013
- Yeah, that's right.

00:52:19.013 --> 00:52:21.780
I mean it's been extraordinary
how this thing has taken off.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.270
I mean, I wish I had my phone on me,

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:27.000
I would just show you that
you can get it on your phone,

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.230
you can get it on any device

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.220
and people are doing it
all around the world.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.210
And we're getting, I mean,
just recent, just two days ago,

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:37.550
a person from Georgia wants
to translate it into Georgian,

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:39.270
it's being translated into Farsi

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:41.730
and you name the language it's happening.

00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:46.260
And because it's online, it's digital,

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.667
you can do adaptations.

00:52:48.667 --> 00:52:52.100
Now what absolutely shocked us was that

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.890
this new intro course

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:58.030
almost immediately displaced
the standard intro course

00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:00.250
at the top economics
departments in Europe,

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:02.170
at the University College London,

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:06.390
at the Toulouse School of
Economics at Sciences Po in Paris,

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:08.190
Humboldt University in Berlin.

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:09.810
They went over almost instantly.

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:13.370
We weren't even ready, they
were just using a beta version

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:16.060
that was online and they went for it

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:19.953
and that suggests that
economics is ready to change.

00:53:22.335 --> 00:53:24.430
And it's also, I think a lot of the,

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:26.880
I mean one of the reasons
why we've been successful is

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:30.463
that this is a very unusual organization.

00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:34.360
It's a global collaboration of researchers

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.040
from all over the world

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.470
who contributed content.

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:40.520
A small editorial group
has given it a common voice

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.373
and nobody's been paid.

00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:47.920
None of the content
providers have been paid,

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:51.750
it's a collaborative, it's
a cooperative organization.

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:55.050
Obviously we had to pay to
build a good platform for it.

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:57.393
Check it out, it's an
outstanding platform.

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:02.200
And we had help from
designers in Bangalore,

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.340
the platform was developed

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:05.910
in a very outstanding group in Cape Town

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.300
and we have a very small staff,

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.540
one full-time member of the staff

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.950
and it's a huge volunteer organization.

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:16.370
So there's a lesson there.

00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:20.420
What it means is as we move
into the modern economy

00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:22.980
of knowledge, creation and distribution,

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:26.380
maybe we should think about different ways

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.050
of organizing our production.

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:31.190
That is that's what we teach
in part of the curriculum.

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:33.450
There are different ways of
organizing how we do things

00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:36.540
and it occurred to us,
well, we're an example.

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.760
We're an example because we have no,

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:43.160
that is, we have this
available free online.

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:46.240
It's a Creative Commons license
because we don't believe

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.223
that knowledge should be a commodity.

00:54:50.273 --> 00:54:54.390
And so we're actually,
we belatedly realized,

00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:57.600
oh we're doing the economics
that we're teaching.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.030
- One final question
requiring a very short answer

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:02.370
because our time is out.

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:07.000
So that middle schooler
in India asking his mother

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.130
what's the difference
here, why aren't you know,

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:11.580
why is there so much poverty?

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.360
One element of your journey,

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:19.960
your intellectual journey
that stands out to you

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:24.960
for answering that question,
over time, in your own way.

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.910
- Well I think I've been
fortunate in having teachers

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:31.060
who were interested in history

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:35.230
and taught me the
importance of institutions.

00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:37.660
It's an important part of
modern economics today,

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:41.703
it has roots in the economics
of Karl Marx and Adam Smith.

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:45.650
Those are the people who
have given me the tools

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:48.470
to understand now a little better

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.910
why India was then so
poor compared to America

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:54.730
and why India is rapidly changing now

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:57.740
along with China, Vietnam
and some other countries.

00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:00.440
So I've been very fortunate
to live in this period of time

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.540
and to have teachers who
allowed me to take that route.

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:07.190
And I can't say I have a good answer

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:09.340
but I have a better
answer than my mom had.

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:13.890
- Well on that note, Sam, I
want to thank you very much

00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:15.830
for coming to the campus

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:19.680
delivering the Weinstock lecture
and being on our program.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.830
- Thank you very much, Harry.

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:23.216
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:56:23.216 --> 00:56:26.183
for this Conversation with History.

00:56:26.183 --> 00:56:29.016
