Congratulations on building
the mobile version of the site.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.740
You've started to apply the basic
concepts of responsive design.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.970
&gt;&gt; In the next lesson,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.830
you'll learn the key techniques that
you'll need including media queries and

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.330
break points, in order to build a site
that responds to different screen sizes.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sounds great.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.010
We'll see you then.
