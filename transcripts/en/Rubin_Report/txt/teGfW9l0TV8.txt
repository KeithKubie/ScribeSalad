Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:05          All right, so let's do this. I want to do gun one on one with you. All the things that we should know about nuns and then I want to do the most common misconceptions about guns because I think part of the issue right now is every time something happens, every time there's a shooting, half the people don't know anything about guns. On one hand, half the people then give you all of those misconceptions. It gets it confusing for everybody. And even the people who I generally trust, I sense don't know exactly what they're saying. So I want to do a video with you right now. Every time one of these incidences happen and someone starts asking me this, asking me that I want to go, I've got the thing that I can point to with the answers. So let's do gun. What on one? What do we need to know about guns?

Speaker 2:          00:48          All right. First and foremost, ar does not stand for assault rifle. So when I say ar 15 that's not assault rifle does not mean assault rifle. And the assault rifle is a gun that is fully automatic, right? That means I pulled the trigger, I hold it back and an expense, all of the ammunition into a magazine. So that's, that's Jesse Ventura in Predator. Boom. Okay, that's a great guy. Love that guy. I can argue about, not going to say, I wouldn't mind owning again. Um, so okay, so that's automatic yet just hold it down and down. It will fire every round, uh, subsequently until it's completely out. Okay. Right. And does so at a very high rate of speed. Okay. Generally speaking, somebody automatic so that there's been this thing where people conflate this or use somebody automatic as a kind of a hyperbolic way of characterizing guns as death killing machines.

Speaker 2:          01:35          Right? Virtually every modern gun is semiautomatic. And what that means is one press of the sugar, you get one bullet versus holding the trigger down once and getting all of the bullets. Okay. So that's a great distinction right there. Cause often when this happens, you see people saying, we have to band semiautomatics semiautomatic. That's virtually every month. Yeah. He's just so it's not because all that, the only difference between that and uh, what I guess it's fully automatic stuff. Well, what's one that you're just loading one bullet in the that. Okay. So that would be a bolt action, right? So there's fully automatic semi automatic and bolt actions, right? Bolt action more. Uh, it was more aligned to like, like hunting, right, or high purpose, high precision shooting. And it's a bolt because it allows you to build the gun up in such a way where you [inaudible] at the tighter constraints within a gun and it allows you to be more accurate without certain mechanism moving back and forth, causing, throwing off the accuracy of the shot.

Speaker 2:          02:30          So you would say then that when, when all of these people come out and say we have to ban semiautomatics, that they are actually just flat out confused or intentionally conflating or a obfuscating what the truth is related to them? Yes, absolutely. And so it's either they're ignorant or they're doing a purpose for like you just stated. Okay. So what is the, so let's do some NRA stuff while we're, while we're doing this, what does the NRA stance on automatics just being able to hold and, and shoot. I mean the, it's currently regulated is the way it stands. Like right now there's this like in order to get an automatic gun, there's a certain process you have to go through in order to get them and that and that. It's been that way for a very long time now. And that's been that it exists as it does now.

Speaker 2:          03:15          Um, and that's essentially war where the stance is that fully automatic guns, what are people using fully automatic guns for? So, um, cause I think this is where you'll hear people go, well no one needs an automatic to huh. We'll see. Here's the thing though, it's the idea of putting it under the guise of a needing, right, their name another right. Where we use that same standard, you know, begs the question. It's so it's like, okay, you haven't fully automatic gun and you have semiautomatic gun shot, bolt action. There are different reasons why you would want each of these guns. Now I can delve into that. But then that starts getting into the very nerdy side of firearm ownership where they're enthusiasts aspect of that comes into it. It's understanding tactically why you would want certain things. And so for me, I'm not personally, I don't have a problem with people on a fully automatic gun.

Speaker 2:          04:03          Personally. I, I just don't see that as a significant danger above and beyond say owning a nuclear suitcase. Right? So if people tried to make that absurd argument to me before, it's like, well then walled true real other than, well that's because there's a, there's a cost benefit ratio that doesn't make any sense, right? The, that you just, that's inherently self destruction. So how was, how is that protecting you in any way from the very thing that you're supposed to be taking yourself against? Do you think there should be a higher threshold to be able to get an automatic than some of the other records you're talking about? Me Personally? Threshold in what respect? Like in terms of either hire back, graded background, Chang's or references. So let's, so let's talk about background checks for a minute. So there's this identity [inaudible] notion that we don't have background checks for guns.

Speaker 2:          04:49          We do. And the funny thing is we in the gun community, because I've become a victim of technology, and what I mean by that is people think that just because I can go into a guns if I really wanted to, I can go on gun store right now by gun within two minutes. Just like that. You can, yeah, because you've done all of the background stuff. See, that's the thing though. I'm still going under. I'm undergoing the same processes. So I go into a store, I find the gun, I like this gun. I said I want to buy this gun. I fill out the 40 four's a form 44 73 which asked me a series of questions. Then they take that information and they submit it to the FBI database and they do a background check. But it happens instantly because technology, right people, it's interesting because there's a lot of people who feel like I should undergo some type of CIA investigation before I buy a gun.

Speaker 2:          05:38          The same people who also hate the government. Exactly. Right. So when they, the instant aspect of the background check causes people who don't know very much about the process to think that there isn't one. Right. Just because I can buy the gun easily doesn't mean it was done thoroughly. You know what I'm saying? I underwent the background check. There's a system there, they checked it against the system. I don't have any felonies or anything that prevents me from owning a firearm. I'm allowed to buy the gun. Okay. So when people say there are, there are no background checks are background checks aren't tight enough or however you want to extrapolate that, is there any credence to any of that that that you can, so now let's talk. So I think what you're, what you're kind of going into is the universal background checks, right? So when they say universal back now they do conflate these terminologies.

Speaker 2:          06:23          There's universal background check is a very specific statement. It's not like saying coke, right? Cause people here universal background checks on all the, here's the background check part. That universal means something. And what that means is it's a requirement that on every single transaction you have to undergo a background check, even private transactions. Right? So right now in California, if I had a gun, right, I can bring a gun into California. Just can't carry it. But you were like, hey, you know what kinds I liked that gun you have, right? I want to buy from you in California. I can't sell it to you right now. What? Here's what I can do. I can say, all right, cool. When I get back to Texas, I'll transfer the gun to a gun store here in California, if it's on the specific list that allows you to actually own that gun. Right? Cause Cause California has a designated or exactly I stuff. Yeah. And then you would have to go to the gun store and then buy it right now let's say I decided to give you the gun anyway,

Speaker 2:          07:22          privately right now in this room. No one else is here. But you went on and I saw the, the gun. Let me shut the cameras, Huh? Yeah. Yeah. I don't have any plans on going to jail. But, and I sell you the gun, you and then let's say you have the gun, what is there to check against what databases that are check against to determine whether or not you got a background check for that gun now just completed two issues right now. Yeah, so, well if we did it on the DL there, there's no, there's no way. And that's what the whole concept of the universal background check is. It is to require a background check for every private transaction. Now, legally, right now I can't do it, but like in Texas I can sell a gun to a friend and as long as I know he's not a prohibited person and I know he's not a felon, I can sell him that gun.

Speaker 2:          08:07          No problems. That's completely illegal. What the universal background check idea s suggested I should have, I should be required to undergo a background check before I can sell in that gun. And that would mean you, he and I would have to go to a gun store and undergo a background check. Then he can go and buy the gun from me. So is the problem with the way it is, Carly say in Texas, the way you're describing that you just would not know potentially enough information about the person you were selling it to? Yes. That's a potential. Absolutely. And so the reason why I'm against the universal background check is because there is no other way to enforce it. But for a national gun registry, because otherwise you have nothing to check it against. Right. To say if a cop walks on the street and you have a gun, he was like, do you get a background check for that gun?

Speaker 2:          08:51          Yeah. How's it going to prove otherwise? Unless there's a national registry and then as I was, okay, fine, well then let's have a national registry. No, because we've seen time and time again that when the governments have a national registry for firearms, they subsequently use it to confiscate guns. Now the problem is when you say that they try to put the tin foil hat on you, right. Except because what they, what they envision is, you know, roaring truck, black military trucks coming down the street pulling guns from people's houses. No, that's not what happens or how they do it. It's a constructive. And then when you have potential presidential candidates like Hillary Clinton's suggesting we should take apart, we should take up the Australia model, which did that very thing. They use the national, they use a national gun registration to tell people to say, you know what, you need to turn in your guns.

Speaker 2:          09:41          It's a voluntary buyback. No, it's an NGO. It's a, it's a mandatory buyback. Right. So, and if you don't sell your guns back, guess what? You go to jail. That's a confiscation. Yeah, it's a constructive confiscation, but a compensation nonetheless. Just because they didn't roll the military trucks down the street and pull them out of your house doesn't mean it isn't confiscation. And so that's why I'm, I'm adamantly against universal background checks. Unless you can demonstrate away from me for it to be applied in such a way that would now require gun registry. Because I do not trust my government not to exploit that registry in their favor. Yeah. So how much of this then, cause we've talked about it, you said to me right before we started, you're sort of a libertarian I think is exactly what he said. I don't want to put words in your mouth.

Speaker 2:          10:27          How much of this does go back to that states should be able to make the decisions that they see fit. I mean I suspect you probably wouldn't be that thrilled living in California. So that's in the weather. I, I'm here in California. Whether the women the food. Yeah. But yeah, it's pretty good food in Texas. Yeah, we do. Yeah. I'm not complaining about that. Um, so see that's just it too. It's like, well how far those stay towards go from the standpoint of violating my second amendment. Right. Right. I believe in states' right. Try them to a point. You start violating my constitutional ones. And so when you have places like California, which I think, I think I'm being currently violated now, the fact that I can't carry my gun, what is the difference I can take? I can take my car with my Texas license and drive it right into California.

Speaker 2:          11:14          No one has a problem with that. I can drive up and down these roads and as fast as I want, as recklessly as I want. Yeah. That might be illegal, but I still do it. Does that potentially do it? But yet I can't carry the thing that I carry to protect my life with the same license. That doesn't make no sense to me like I am I any in any less danger here than I would be in Texas. If anything, I can make the argument that I'm more, I, there's more danger from me here in that I don't know the area very well. So in a weird way, you're actually making a non states' rights argument here, right? Because if you're saying you want the same thing everywhere, that's, that's not a states' rights argument. It's not that. But that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Because, but that's under guise of meat feeling like me not being able to carry as a violation of my constitutional right.

Speaker 2:          11:58          Right. Because states rights, it doesn't allow them to violate those constitutional rights. And that's, that's the argument I'm making now. It's difficult because then you start talking about the idea of having a uniform, like concealed carry platform, right? Um, where one license allows you to carry a gun everywhere, right? Then you start getting into the weeds of, okay, well that's violating state's rights, but that's only if you don't see my ability to carry a firearm as a, as a, um, sorry, uh, my ability to carry a firearm as a violation of my constitutional rights. It's an interesting philosophical place to talk because it's like, it just depends where you start. Yeah. Because even though I'm definitely a states' rights guy, I, I hear what you say there. And then on the other hand, as a state's rights guy, to me, if a state wants to have stricter laws and you are a big gun guy, then you actually are allowed to leave.

Speaker 2:          12:44          It's kind of it as, I would say for virtually every other situation, it's kind of shitty. It doesn't feel great to have to leave a place that you want to be at. But if they're doing things as part of their state experiment that you don't like, well it's on, it's on you to get gold. Yeah. But if that, if that same state creates a law that violates my right to privacy, right. Well we have constitutional rights that supersede. So I get, I get the trailer. Are we missing anything else on the technical front? Cause we did that pretty calm, uh, from a mechanical standpoint just for them and the mechanical standpoint or, or just any of the language that we use related to this. Okay. Okay. So yeah. So then of course there's some people can say it's trivial, some people say it's not. So the magazine versus clip, it's general terms.

Speaker 2:          13:28          It's actually, it's called a magazine, a clip as an actual thing. It's just different from a magazine that, that that's kind of slightly trivial, but it does typically kind of exposed people who don't really know much about guns. When you say clip versus magazine, cause the proper terminology would be magazine. Um, as far as any other mechanical components, well, what do I need to know about the magazine though? Well, that's just terminology. This is semantics, right? I don't always go about correcting people because I feel like it just creates it. It kind of makes me look like an ass to a degree, but that's why we're doing this. I want to clean up. The biggest thing is just the assault weapon thing, right? Because the Ar 15 is this a villian weapon? It's, it's designated as the biggest difference between an ar 15 and an assault rifle is that the assault rifles, fully automatic and they are 15 isn't, that's the biggest distinction between the two.

Speaker 2:          14:27          Now of course, then you could make the argument, well that's some very minor distinction. You know, there's a lot of people who make that argument, but I don't look at the Ar 15 any differently than I look at the handgun in that sense. So every time when one of these happens and we hear the Ar 15 is a weapon of war and Solo handguns, you would basically put their 15 in the handgun in the same category. Yes. As pulling ones. Yeah. She even once, yeah. So that would not be categorized as a, as a weapon of war. We'll see that steam, that estimation, that terminology is designed to, to manipulate the emotions of people who don't know anything about guns. So when you hear, if you don't know anything about firearms and you here, he used a weapon of war, technically speaking all guns or weapons before, right?

Speaker 2:          15:15          So words can be weapons of war. Exactly. Yeah. So, but what that does mentally, like they understand language very well and I tell you, they, they liked turned like 90 human. But in terms of the, I call it the anti gun side of it, of things they understand the use of language very well. And um, and they confuse it purposely. So when you hear someone who doesn't know anything about firearms, think about it. Like if, if I'm already kind of how I'm a little scared of firearms and enter here, he used a weapon of war. What image comes up in your mind? It's, it's Rambo, you know, just running down. They're just going crazy and that's exactly what he's doing. He could do the same thing with the handgun. And so the, the, the biggest thing that I like to, when I'm having these conversations with people, you're going to walk away with, we gonna walk away with two with two points of two trains of thoughts.

Speaker 2:          16:04          I'm either going to get you to admit you just want to ban all guns or you can see my perspective because if you're, if you're willing to say, you know what, we need to get rid of all this salt weapons as they, as they understand them to be, which is essentially ar fifteens but now it's actually become even more broader. Like we to get rid of all semiautomatic weapons, right? That's virtually every modern gun. So let's say that they want a band aid off fifteens air 15th rifles aren't even used. Like the, the, the percentage that rifles are used in actual shootings is so low and marginal. It's, it's unreal. So then why are we focusing on that? But okay, so then what are emotions are hand guns. Yeah. Right? So if you get rid of that, and we got rid of Ar 15 and then we have another shooting happened because the are most deadliest school mass shooting was Virginia Tech and he used the hangar.

Speaker 2:          16:58          So then what happens if that happens again? So now what are you going to ban you in the band handgun? And that's when you're stuck having to confront the fact that okay, either you really just want to ban all guns or you understand that the distinction is irrelevant, right? With God to get to the absolute point of issue in why these things are happening and focusing on gun is doing a disservice to the conversation. It sounds like I'm just utilizing, I'm using the bigger issue as a scapegoat, but in reality, if you really sit down and think about it, right? We have over 300 close to 400 million guns in this country and not going anywhere and understanding that you've got to then sit down and say to yourself, all right, if we're going to try to fix this issue of gun violence or just violence in general, we've got to get to the root of issue of why people are doing it.

Speaker 2:          17:48          And then understanding that staying within the context of reality, we've got to understand well in the process, I still have to protect myself and because people are still stupid, still gonna be able to get their hands on guns, whether illegal or not, and and use them to commit crimes in the Brighton people's lives. I've got to be put in a situation to defend against that so you can bend all the Ar 15 what does it mean? It's going to stop somebody from getting one on a black market. So now, yes, I don't run from the fact that the ar 15 is a more powerful platform that I agree with and I don't think I, I don't run from that. They're going to be people on there who are going to be mad at me for saying that. But the reason why it'll rough on me just because that's the very reason why I want an ar 15 when it comes to defending my life. I don't want it to be a fair fight.

Speaker 3:          18:31          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          18:33          Period. I don't want to have to confront someone with an ar 15 with a hand gun if I don't have to. If you come in my house, I'm not grabbing a handgun. I'm grabbing in the office.

Speaker 4:          18:41          Okay, let's see. We have this strange thing. It's like when people will say, I'm okay. Well the, the Second Amendment says the right to bear arms and then they'll put up a picture of, you know, the type of arms that existed way back when and, and it's like, well then we should be have the right to that. Cause that's what they were talking about it. It's like this is so disingenuine very disingenuous. It's like they were also talking about why you should be able to form a militia. And it's like the thing that we'd be fighting against now has a lot more power. And it doesn't mean that just cause you have some guns, you're gonna be able to stop the guys in the black trucks as you talked about earlier. But maybe you could defend yourself a little bit longer. And who knows what happens with a little bit of time.

Speaker 2:          19:17          I mean fruit and be real with it. They're still fighting in Afghanistan and those guys over there just use an AK 47 huh? You get what I'm saying? So like we can't just because we're going to lose anything that you just lie down and do it, you know? And the whole notion of like, um, ah man, I just lost the train of thought. This idea of owning firearms to combat the government. It's in and they think it's preposterous. But I'm like, ask the people in Venezuela

Speaker 4:          19:48          what's going on? And again, these are now the people, at least in this current moment, people who say that the government is run by Orange Hitler. Exactly, man. It's it really well. Well this is a good spot to I think change to mind. And as I said to you before we sat down, I've never considered myself a gun person per se. Uh, I'm interested in, I'm always interested in talking about these things, but I do find myself now more pro gun. It's probably not even the right phrase to say, yeah, then I've ever been in my life and I, but that had for me, it has more to do with that. I really understanding what rights are in a much clearer way and what I want the government to do and not do. And once you understand that, then you know, it's tough. It's tough to take other positions. It is. So is there anything to you that when they always say sensible gun control and I'll always see the pro gun, people will say, well the people that always say that just don't know what they're talking about. And I sense you're probably in that spot cause that you were just saying what they do with language. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          20:48          So sensible gun control. Most of the time when people say that they actually advocate things we already have. So bad background checks, things of that nature. Right. And then you like, and you have other language like the, the loop, uh, the gun show, the gun, the gun show loophole. Yeah, let's talk about that. That's not a loophole. All the, all that is, is a private transaction. That's all that is. And it's just happening, happening and just so happened to happen at a gun show. If you bought a gun from an actual dealer at a gun show, you still have to undergo a background check. So the, when they say loophole with a loose saying is that if you are at a gun show, you're not a dealer, you can actually sell that gun at the, if you are, if one the person's not a prohibited possessor, you are from the same state, then yes.

Speaker 2:          21:34          If they, if there's nothing that precludes them from owning a firearm, legally I can sell them a gun at a gun show. Right. So the only slippery part of that is what we talked about earlier, which is you just may not know all the information. Exactly. Cause there is a, there is, I guess there's a little bit of a gray area and that one, is that a fair in terms of the yeah, that you're sort of taking somebody's word for it at that point. [inaudible] meets somebody that day and they're like, I want to buy that gun. And you say to them, you ask them all the appropriate questions, they could be lying to you. Absolutely. But that's just, yeah. But then that sold in the way the response that they have to that is the universal background check. But as I pointed out, how do you, how do you enforce it without a national registry?

Speaker 2:          22:15          And then with that national registry, even with the national registry, it doesn't stop anything. Right? We, we, we, we tend to go down this road of just wanting to do things to make ourselves feel better. But in reality, namely one mass shooting that would've been prevented with the universal background check. Now one, because even the people who had gone to aren't supposed to have them, they got them illegally. Right. It wasn't because there wasn't a universal background check that stopped him from getting it. No, it wasn't. So I have to, I have to ask the question, I go then why are we doing this other than just to make ourselves feel better cause it's literally doing nothing. Nothing. And so that's why like the person who who bought and sold a gun privately at a, at a gun show could have done that in the parking lot of the gun show, could have done it at their house before going to the gun show.

Speaker 2:          23:08          You get what I'm saying? But what it does is when you frame it within the context of the gun show loophole, it makes it seem like it's this bizarre where everyone comes there together and sells illegal guns. Right, right. That's the image that's created in the mind. Like it's barter town. Exactly. Like they feed on, they feed on the ignorance of people. Right. Because like they're not, everybody knows that much about guns. It's like, it's one of those things, it's like, I don't know. I don't know a lot about a lot of other things that people may know a lot about. Right. So if you tell me something and I'm not really researched and schooled on that issue, you can give me the beliefs from pretty kooky stuff. Yeah. And that's what I'm talking to you. I mean, that's what you consistently see every time we talk about this and you know, there's this other piece of it where it's like every time a shooting happens, you know, there's this pile on where it would not now we should talk about it.

Speaker 2:          23:54          Yeah. And then there's this other part of us where it's because we go from one crisis to another. Yeah. That there's never re, it seems to me at this point, we never really have time to really ever fully unpack any of these things. I think. I think there's moments like this, but on a national level, we're, we're not particularly good at these conversations because then what it does is just turns into a political sparring match. Yeah. I mean right after the last shooting and when, when, uh, Dana Lotion and Rubio are on that CNN town hall. I mean it was made them, I mean the gladiatorial fest, it was a disaster. I mean it was everything I hate about cable news. It was everything I hate about just the quick bites and of all of this and flashiness and just who can we take out right now?

Speaker 2:          24:33          It was a disaster. And then, and I sat in, I pointed this out, how can we have a real honest conversation when they try to paint program people as crazy when we say no, the ultimate goal is to band dones. But then I can watch CNN live town hall where we will suggest you do realize banding all somebody automatic guns is essentially banning all guns and the entire stadium erupts in applause and cheers. Yeah. So then it goes, Yo Rubio said exactly what you said. He may started cheering even even when confronted with the core because Rubio said, look, you want to bet on somebody might have guns here, let me educate you really quickly and tell you that virtually all guns. So even when he corrected them so it wasn't, they can't, they can't, they can't claim they were ignorant on it cause he just explained to them that means manning virtually all guns and they rocked it so it goes, okay, so now you have all those programs are like, we just going to go back to our clients.

Speaker 2:          25:37          There's no discussion because while, while we're trying to be fair, you're ultimate goal is to try to ban them all. Yeah. There was that moment. I'm sure you remember this after the Parkland shooting when they had the big rally and one of the survivors got up there and said, we're going to come. What was the line? Do you remember the exact line where she said basically we're going to come for the semiautomatics now, but we're going to come for everything later or something. Something to that effect. I'm slightly butcher, but I thought, wow, now, now you're flat out saying and you're just giving, you're telling them now. So I could see why. You know, I, I see this with all my frustrations with the left all the time. It's like I know they're never gonna stop. I've seen it so consistently and that's why I'm staking out some positions.

Speaker 2:          26:20          But sometimes it's, it's kind of sucky to have to just be like, well the people that I'm fighting against, so to speak, they're not dealing in the same world that I'm dealing in. And I, and that makes it more important for me to stake out a position. But the thing that's most frustrating about it is the way they'll color it in the mainstream media is that were unreasonable. We don't want to move on inch. We've dug her heels in. All we want is we don't care about anything. And really what it is is no, I let you into my house and now you're trying to take my house from me. So get out. Cause that's essentially what they're saying is all right. So they'll say, well, common sense. That's why we hate that word common sense because it cause it's disingenuous. It's like, well we need common sense measures after a shooting.

Speaker 2:          27:08          All right, then another shooting happens. We need more common sense measures in another shooting happened. We need even more common sense measures. Windows common sense measures stopped being common sense and just intruding on my rights and I can see the, you know, you know my thing for guns to use, free speech to me and it's like I can see this coming with that. If these guys took control, you'd start seeing, well we can have free speech but we need some common sense controls around actually. So I, so I do understand that position. Like I tell people all the time, I'm like, there are over 300 federal gun laws in this country. I think we've been reasonable. I think we were really truly being unreasonable. We wouldn't have over 300 federal gun laws and I can't begin to tell you how many we have on a state level, right?

Speaker 2:          27:52          So it's incredibly disingenuous to think that we're just being hard, hard assets who don't want to move one inch on the issue. Right? No one's saying it should be a free for all, where we're just handing out guns to everyone like Oprah, right? I don't think anybody has a problem inherently with background checks. Now we start talking about universal background checks. That's a different thing. But since nobody, since they never want to make that distinction, right? No one ever knows that you can't, you can't. Exactly. And then the idea of like, you know, we can talk about gun free zones, right? And it begs the questions like what does that, what does that sticker on when they're going to do for me? So now I have to make like people don't really like to sympathize with gun owners in a sense of like, we all want the same result, right?

Speaker 2:          28:35          We want the killing the stock. We want the violence to stop. Notice I said violence and killing, not just gun violence. Right? Because we can't just focus on gun violence because violence is violence. However you die, you die and it's bad. All the way around. But when I have to make a decision about whether or not I potentially break a law to go into an establishment that may or may not cause me to need my gun at some point, man, that's messed up. And I know that there are a lot of people who don't see it that way because they don't see value in the second amendment because they're not firearm owners. Right? There are a lot of people who look at the second amendment is useless because they don't own firearms. But when you have a group of people who understand the importance of it and how it fits into their lives, and they understand that at the end of the day, when something happens, the only person who's gonna be there to stop it is you.

Speaker 2:          29:26          That's a big deal. So it's not just me trying to protect a piece of metal because I just want to have fun with my guns. No, it's much bigger than that. It's this idea that I have to rely on myself. You can tell me all day long, police are going to be there, the police are going to be there, but they're not going to be, they're just not. And then you can you name or at Parkland. Exactly right. So then you can you add kids, family into the mix that ratchets it up to a whole nother level. So that, what about the piece of this that just sort of optics. So you know, every now and again you'll see a picture of like three dudes with big ass guns at Aaa. You know, like an open car. Now I know if I was, if I walked into Napoleon, three guys came in with big ass guns on their back.

Speaker 2:          30:13          Yeah. Pro Notice. Well I would take notes and I probably leave. I probably would, I would just be like, you know, and again, I'm here, I'm here in California where that would be so, so out of the norm. But for the person that's living in Texas, right, you can do this. If I was in AAA, right, and it's three guys walking in, I probably would leave no one. Everything that you just said there, knowing that these guys are probably NRA members and and as far as I know, no NRA member has ever done a a mass shooting. Right. Okay. So you know, cause you see this all the time, these celebrities, Michael, Ian Black like that on the show who's on this rampage telling everyone that you guys are terrorists. I mean really that you're, you're part of a terrorist organization and saw all the other 5 million members.

Speaker 2:          30:54          But I think there is certainly about some of the optics of that. You know what I mean? Like I would be nervous now. I get your point would be, well those guys are going to protect you when the other guy walks in or whatever. Then some of that may be feelings over facts right there, but it just, it just is the interesting thing about it that is a big debate within the gun, the gun community as a whole. The idea of open carry versus concealed carry. I don't ever open carry except for maybe if I'm out hunting or I'm on the range or something like that. But that's, that's a personal decision. I'm choosing my own for various reasons. One, sometimes I, I, I'd rather not have the attention. And tactically I liked the advantage of having the element of surprise. You don't know I have a gun on me, so if I had to use it, I'm going to be reacting.

Speaker 2:          31:37          Right? I'm not going into a place to shoot it up. If somebody decides to come into a place where she could about, I'm going to be reacting to that. So I need all the advantages I get from my personal perspective. So I want the element of surprise. There are some people who think only alternative, they feel like just the mere presence of that gun is a deterrent from anyone who wants to come in and do some bad. So for guys casing out a couple of stores and then he sees there are certain citizens in there with long guns and some that have a hand guns on the side of your hip, then that's a deterrent. Right? Um, I understand the alarm that people who don't necessarily engage in interact with fire arms get when they see people walking around with rifles. Right. Even I've, I've, I've ever been, I've seen a couple of people in Texas do it and initially my gut reaction and I'll admit was like what's going on here?

Speaker 2:          32:24          Um, now I'm very versed firearms and I have a gun too. So at that point I actually almost welcome it. And the reason why is because if you're going to do something, I now get to see you attempt to do it. You get what I'm saying? It does a telegraph. They were in a unique case on this one. Yes. But I'm speaking from purely a place, a personal preference, right? Yeah. And not to be getting on the whole for anyone else or anything like that. Me Personally, I would rather like to know you have it right. If I can see it, cause then I know where to focus my attention versus me kind of being alone to a state of complacency because of its absence. And then all of a sudden somebody stands up and decides he wants to shoot the place up and then I have to react to that.

Speaker 2:          33:06          Um, but again, that's tactics, right? That, that's just personal preference in that regard. However, I do understand the alarm that somebody who would have seen you three guys walking into AAA with the, with rifles, because it seems seemingly, especially to them, they seems like that's a bit excessive. I'm, I allowed to you. If I can conceal carry a rifle, I would because it's better at defending me than a handgun was the only reason. The only reason I have a handgun, it was because of small enough for me to conceal. It allows me to live my life in an uninterrupted, otherwise I'd walk around with a rifle. Okay. So we can't end without doing sort of what I think would be the big question for everything we've talked about here. And for someone that works with the NRA and your show is on NRA TV and all that.

Speaker 2:          33:45          So what is going on in America right now that seems to be unique to our society? We do have more shootings here than I, and I think virtually all other western nations combined. Um, so, okay. I forget to fact check me on that if I that one. But it does seem it's, and even if I'm slightly, oh no, no, you're good. You're good. It seems that there is something uniquely happening here now I would argue then there's all sorts of mental health issues and probably a prescription drugs and maybe nonprescription drugs and all sorts of other stuff. So there's a couple of things. So I'll try to, I'll try to keep this as concise as possible because we are going to get into weeds for a split second here. So first of all, let's talk about mass shootings, right? Our school school, Mexican silver instance.

Speaker 2:          34:29          I recently just read a study from Northwestern university, I'm not too long ago, which talked about comparing the number of school shootings back in the 90s versus the versus today. And what they concluded essentially was the perception is that it's happening more frequently, but it's not, it's actually on par or even less now than it was then. Now you can, people who are going to seem like, oh my God, how could you possibly say that? Google it. It's a Northwestern university, uh, research. Uh, I can't remember the actual title of their actual research, but we're going to grab it from you after this and [inaudible] link to it. And absolutely. So that being said, mass shootings account for a very, very, very marginal percentage of shootings in this country. Let's start off with the overall. So 35, 35 to 36,000 people each year die from guns, right?

Speaker 2:          35:22          I didn't specify gun violence, but just guns. Cause they don't do that. They'll just say gun violence. Right? So 60 about 60 to 65% of those, that 35,000 as suicides. Now when I'm not saying is we don't care about suicides. We do. However, when it comes to the idea and the issue of somebody shooting at me, that's a, that's not, it's not Jermaine. Yeah. But then even still, if you want to make the argument, well, if we had less guns, we'd have less suicides. That's also not true because our suicide rate is on par with every other major country. So if it was a case that the more guns you have, the more suicides we'd be leading the charge. We don't they where there's a will, there's a way. Exactly. Right. Even tomorrow, the more more famous suicides we've had, they didn't use guns. So we sat there number side, which is a huge number, 65% it's huge number out of 35 36,000 so then you have about one to 3% which are justifiable homicides.

Speaker 2:          36:16          That self defense, that's including police shooting criminals who are shooting at them. Right? And people who use guns in self defense. Right. You've got to set that aside because that's not the issue we're trying to address. So set that number side and then you have about 5% which are accidental. Right? Kid gets fined to gun pull triggers. Unfortunate. Extremely unfortunate. However, I believe personally half of that can easily be addressed with more education. So if we took the energy that we took that we placed, now I'm trying to vilified guns and have national campaigns teaching people about gun safety, that we'll cut that number in half because a lot of these accidents easily preventable. But they're just people who have come to just don't know. And so if we spent time educating those people, do we know what percentage of that subset is getting those guns legally or illegally?

Speaker 2:          37:10          Cause I would imagine that a lot of it's probably illegal, which is why they don't know how to use the gun in the first. I'm not going to assume I have that answer because I don't have that hard number. Um, but, and I would, I'm, I do feel comfortable assuming that as well. Right. Um, and so if we take that, the accidents to set that aside, purely homicides, we're looking at around seven to 10,000 every year. Right now that's a different looking number, right. When will be accounted for the, all of the, the con, the con, the context here with those, those other shootings. Now, the vast majority, I'd say close to 80% that I've read in a couple of articles of those homicides are happening in the inner cities of our country. All right? So then reason goes. All right, so let's look at those inner cities and let's look at the dynamics there, right?

Speaker 2:          38:08          You have low jobs, lack of economic opportunity, um, destroyed households and a narco economy that warrants that warrants but creates the necessity for this type of violence. So if we dealt with the socioeconomic aspects of what's going on in those areas too, we really have a gun problem, okay? Just think about it. I know, I know other communities filled with black people, they have guns, they don't have the same level of violence. Cause I only say black people because most people associate the inner city with, with black people, right? But the reason why we had that high level of concentration of violence, it's because of the conditions in those environments. And then even within those communities, there are tough. The vast majority of people in those committees are good people. And it's a very minor group of people who are creating a large number of the violence, right? So there's something to be said, do we really have a gun problem or do we have a socioeconomic suicide problem in this country? Because at the end of the day, there's 35 to 36,000 that people assuming is all gun violence by way of homicides, people shooting at other people to kill them. It's not the case. We're looking at closer to the seven to 10,000 if that. And so if you take those numbers and you comparing them other countries, then how does it look

Speaker 4:          39:36          to be continued? Yeah. Well, I'm so glad that we finally did this and we will definitely do this again because I absolutely, this story and everything we've talked about here is just going to continue. I mean, these are the battles that we're now fighting on many fronts related to the constitution and free speech and free expression and your ability to, to own your life and all that stuff. And that's all we ask is that this is this, let me and

Speaker 2:          39:59          well, I'll say one last thing. Yeah. There are a lot of people who was like, why do you feel the need to carry a gun? Why? Like like the chances of you needing to use that gun to protect yourself 1% and the answer I have for that is this, you may be right. Sansomeana need to care to actually use my gun to defend myself. Maybe really slim, maybe 1% but if that 1% happens, it's 100% of everything. The consequences are 100% and that's why it's so important. Yeah. All right,

Speaker 4:          40:29          well that's how you, and to show you, you know, you, maybe we'll do this next time. Maybe we'll bring you on with someone on some of the absolute side of the issues on this and we'll tell him we'll have that conversation. Sounds like a plan. All right.
