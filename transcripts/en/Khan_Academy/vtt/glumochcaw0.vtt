00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.160
Problem 23.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.700
Mario drives 1,500 miles
every month.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.930
Which line plot correctly
represents Mario's total miles

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.590
driven over a period
of 6 months?

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.810
So it's 1,500 miles
every month.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.660
So this is per month.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.880
So every month-- after 1 month
he should drive 1,500 hundred

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.630
miles, and that looks
pretty good there.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.120
So after another month, it
should be another 1,500.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.680
Which goes to 3,000.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.880
Right?

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.000
After 2 months, he should
drive 3,000 miles.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.670
So far, choice A looks
pretty good.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.170
So I'm just going
to circle that.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.760
Now let's just verify
that the other ones

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.890
aren't describing this.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.500
So in choice C, it takes him
6 months to go 1,500 miles.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.380
That's not what they
said, they said

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.940
1,500 miles every month.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.200
After 1 month here, he only
went-- I don't know.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.570
He only went 250 miles
or 5-- so this is

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.210
definitely not the case.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.860
Choice B shows he started off
having traveled 1,500 miles

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.710
and it never changes.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.940
So he doesn't travel anymore.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.840
So it's definitely
not choice B.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.660
And then choice D, after 1 month
he travels 9,000 miles.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.980
Which is completely wrong.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.730
They set it up per month
he travels 1,500 miles.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.920
Definitely not choice D.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.840
So choice A we can
feel good about.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.090
Let's go to the next page.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.470
All right.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.600
We have problem 24.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.990
The temperature on a mountain
peak was 7 degrees Fahrenheit

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.660
at 6:00 PM.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.700
By 8:00 PM, so 2 hours later,
the temperature had dropped to

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.800
0 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.290
If the temperature continued
to drop at the same rate,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.400
which is the best estimate of
the temperature at 11:00 PM?

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.030
So what happened?

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.230
We went from 6:00
PM to 8:00 PM.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.650
That was 2 hours, right?

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.080
And our temperature went from
7 degrees to 0 degrees

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.230
Fahrenheit.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.750
So over 2 hours, we
dropped 7 degrees.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.870
Or you could say the rate of
droppage of our temperature,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.270
if you want to say it that
way, so you could say 7

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.700
degrees-- let me write
it this way.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.110
7 degrees for every 2 hours.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.070
Or you could say minus 7 degrees
for every 2 hours,

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.030
we're dropping.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.170
Or that's the same thing as
saying we're going minus 3.5

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.710
degrees per hour.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.590
That's the rate at which
it dropped from

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.090
6:00 PM to 8:00 PM.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.720
Minus 3.5 degrees per hour.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.120
So they say, what is the
best estimate of the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.030
temperature at 11:00 PM?

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.930
Well, 11:00 PM is going to be
another 3 hours after 8:00 PM.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.220
And if we're dropping at minus
3.5 degrees per hour, and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.180
we're going to do that
for 3 hours, we just

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.830
multiply the two.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.270
So you have-- do it over here.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:02.950
You have minus 3.5 degrees per
hour, and then times 3 hours.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.210
Right?

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.880
That's how long we're going to
go from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.170
The hours cancel out, if
you want to make sure

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.120
your units work out.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.970
But what's minus 3.5 times 3?

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.360
Well, let's just write it out.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.570
So 3.5 times 3.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.560
I could put a minus there.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.000
We'll worry about
it in a second.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.460
5 times 3 is 15.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.160
3 times 3 is 9, plus 1 is 10.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.510
We have exactly 1 number behind
the decimal point.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.680
We have no decimals here.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.570
We have 1 number behind the
decimal point in our answer,

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.330
and then we have a negative
times a positive, which is

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.890
going to be a negative.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.610
So from 8:00 PM to 11:00
PM, we're going to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.070
drop by 10.5 degrees.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.410
Now, they say that the
temperature was 0 at 8:00 PM.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.870
So if we drop 10.5 degrees from
that, we're going to be

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.610
approximately at minus 10
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.010
They say, what is the
best estimate?

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.270
If they said exactly, we would
say, oh, minus 10.5 degrees.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.060
If you wanted to do this-- you
could have done this in your

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.020
head if you like, but I think
it's nice to say, oh, we're

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.180
dropping 3.5 degrees per hour, 3
hours later it's going to be

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.650
a little over 10 degrees, or
10.5 degrees, that we dropped

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.560
from the 0 degrees at 8:00 PM.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.839
Problem 25.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.860
Do it in-- maybe orange.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.900
Brad bought a $6 binder and
several packs of paper that

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.760
cost $0.60 each.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.790
If his total was $13.20,
how many packs of

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.830
paper did Brad buy?

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.150
All right.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.160
Let's say he bought
p packs of paper.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.170
So how much did he spend?

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:46.740
He bought a $6 binder, so he
spent $6, plus $0.60 per pack

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.050
times the number of
packs he bought.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.410
Right?

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.490
So this is the total. $6 for the
binder plus $0.60 for each

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.130
of the packs.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.660
If you bought 10 packs, we can
do 10 times $0.60 per pack,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.040
but we don't know what it is,
so we just leave it as p.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.090
And the total cost was $13.20.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.750
So we just have to
solve for p.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.382
How many packs of paper
did Brad buy?

00:05:10.382 --> 00:05:14.590
So if we subtract 6 from both
sides of this equation-- do it

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.210
in blue-- just subtract this
6 from both sides.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.740
You get 0.6p-- maybe I'll
write it like this.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.880
Minus 6, plus there, and then
minus 6 right there.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.806
Just to show you I'm doing the
same thing to both sides of

00:05:27.806 --> 00:05:28.840
this equation.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.150
This minus 6 and that positive
6 cancel out, and so you're

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.660
just left with a 0.6p on
the left-hand side.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.060
Is going to be equal to 13.2,
or $13.20 minus $6.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.000
You can write that
way if you like.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.390
13 minus 6 is 7.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.860
So it's going to be
$7.20, or 7.2.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.560
And then to solve for p, we just
divide both sides by 0.6.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.590
So if we divide both sides by
0.6, the 0.6's is cancel out

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.270
on the left-hand side, so you're
just left with a p.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.440
So you're left with--
do it over here.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:14.920
p is equal to 7.2
divided by 0.6.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.010
So let's work this out.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:23.890
0.6 goes into 7.2-- I'll throw
in some trailing 0's.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.570
Now, division by decimals.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.860
This is sometimes a little bit
confusing, but you just have

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.280
to remember, you take the number
that we're dividing

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.920
into the other number, and you
make it into a whole number.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.740
So you shift its decimal
point, in this

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.930
case 1 to the right.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.550
So it just becomes a 6.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.380
Since you shifted its decimal
point 1 to the right, you have

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.700
to shift this guy's decimal
point 1 to the right.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.680
So it'll go right there.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.790
So 0.6 into 7.2 is the same
thing as 6 into 72.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.810
Or you could just do
this as a fraction.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.730
You multiply the top and the
bottom by 10, is the same

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.640
thing as 72 divided by 6.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.630
And that's just exactly
what we did here.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.110
So 6 goes into 72-- well,
actually, even better, 6 goes

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.640
into 7 one time.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.770
1 times 6 is 6.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.850
And then 7 minus 6 is 1.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.140
Bring down the 2.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.150
6 goes into 12 two times.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.930
2 times 6 is 12.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.140
You get a 0.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.050
All 0's left.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.710
So you get exactly 12 times.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.020
And if you know your 6 times
tables, you knew that.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.390
72 divided by 6 is 12.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.930
So p is equal to 12.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.740
He bought 12 packs of paper.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.130
Next problem.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.300
What is the value of this
thing, 3 plus 5 squared,

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.820
divided by 4 minus x plus
1, when x is equal to 7?

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.890
So let's write it down
when x is equal to 7.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.760
So this becomes 3 plus
5 squared-- so let me

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.630
just write it out.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.860
5 squared is 25.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.750
Divided by-- and so they want us
to do a little bit of order

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.990
of operations here.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.590
So parentheses are the
dominant role here.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.700
So this thing, 3 plus 25,
this is going to be 28.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.160
So parentheses take the dominant
role here, so this is

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.050
going to be a 28 right there.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.120
So let me write it down.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.090
Parentheses are the most
important, then exponents,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.560
then multiplication and
division, and if there's a tie

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.530
you go left to right, and
then you do addition and

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:22.400
subtraction.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.890
So they're clearly trying to
make sure that we understand

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.100
our order of operations.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.350
So let's do the things
in parentheses first.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.610
So it's 3 plus 5 squared is
3 plus 25, that's a 28.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.929
Then you have an x plus 1.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.030
They're telling us
that x is 7.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.789
This is a 7 plus 1, so that's
going to be an 8.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:42.289
And then we do the division
before we do the subtraction.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:45.260
So this becomes 28--
let me rewrite it.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:51.790
28 divided by 4, minus 8.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.560
And so order of operations,
we do this first. So 28

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.660
divided by 4 is 7.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.340
And then we have the 7 minus
that 8 right there, which is

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.280
equal to minus 1.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.900
So that is choice B.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.980
Next problem.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.080
Problem 27.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.680
What is the equation of
the graph shown below?

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.500
So we just have to figure out
its slope and its y-intercept.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.530
In general, these are
all in kind of the

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.930
classic mx plus b form.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:29.010
y is equal to mx plus b, where
m is the slope, b is the

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.320
y-intercept.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.300
The slope here, our
rise over run.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.750
For every 1 we run,
we rise up 1.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.850
For a change in x of 1, we
have a change in y of 1.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:45.580
So slope is equal to change
in y over change in x,

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.660
or rise over run.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.560
We rise by 1 when we run by 1.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.780
So it's equal to 1/1 which
is equal to 1.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.440
So m is equal to 1, and in
every situation here

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.500
our slope is 1.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.250
So that didn't help us so far.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.150
But then b is the y-intercept,
where we intersect the y-axis.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.690
And you could see, just from
inspection, that's it.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.190
y is equal to 3.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.540
So we look for b is 3.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.300
So our equation is going to be y
is equal to 1 times x, which

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.250
is just x, plus the
y-intercept of 3.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:25.640
So y is equal to x plus 3,
which is right there.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.050
No more problems on that page.
