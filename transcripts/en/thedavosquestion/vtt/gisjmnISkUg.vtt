&gt;&gt; Hi,YouTubers, my name is Trevor Manuel.
I am the Minister responsible for planning

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.959
in the Republic of South
Africa.

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.920
It's a great opportunity to be sharing with
you here from Davos, that

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.420
we're able to engage with you and pick up
on the issues that matter to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.960
you.
Today, the world is in very powerless state

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.600
at the moment, coming out
of the recession caused largely by excesses

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.160
in the financial sector.
A lot of the emphasis has been placed on the

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.411
balance sheets of banks,
size of the deficit of government.

00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:43.250
But the bigger challenges lie in the impact
of the financial crisis on

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.970
the lives of very ordinary working people,
people who have lost their

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.380
jobs, people who've lost access to credit,
to the houses, to all manner

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.329
of issues. A major setback in the lives of
the poor.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.020
So as we deal with issues right now we must
focus.
