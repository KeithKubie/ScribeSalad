00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.630
So to show you an example of what that

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.647
looks like, we've created a test page that's in udacity.com

00:00:07.647 --> 00:00:12.570
cs101 index.html and when we run get all links

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.090
we'll see all the links on that page. Let me

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.410
show you what the page is first. This is

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.750
our test page for learning to crawl. So that's the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.720
URL that we're using to get page and get all

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.510
links from that page. Now you see that this page

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.698
has three links on it. The first one goes to

00:00:27.698 --> 00:00:32.650
crawling.html, the second one goes to walking.html, and the third

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.410
one goes to flying.html. We'll look soon at the structure

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.950
of these pages when we do our web crawler. You can

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.360
try that on your own in the web browser. For

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.460
now, what we are interested in is finding these three links.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.020
So when we assign links for the result to get

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.520
all links. We can print the value of links that we

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.710
get back. And when we run that, we see a list

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.620
containing the three links on the page. And because that is a

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.550
list, well, we can do useful things with it. We could

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.000
extract the value at position zero, and get just the first link

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.880
on the page. So think on your own, if you could

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.600
define get all links. If you're ambitious, you'll try to define this

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.100
all by yourself. We're going to step through how to do this with

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.730
a few quizzes because I think it's quite a challenging thing to

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.590
do all by yourself. But think about that by yourself first,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.760
and then we'll step through it with a series of quizzes.
