Hi, my name’s John Green, this is Crash Course:
World History, and today we’re gonna talk about Africa.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.820
Mr. Green Mr. Green! We’ve already talked
about Africa. Egypt is in Africa, and you

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.510
haven’t shut up about it the entire course
-

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.410
Yeah that’s true, Me from the Past. But
Africa’s big - it’s like, super big - much

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.560
bigger than it appears on most maps, actually.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.590
I mean, you can fit India and China, and the
United States if you fold in Maine. All of

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.190
that fits in Africa! Like any huge place,
Africa is incredibly diverse, and it's a mistake

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.630
to focus just on Egypt. So today let’s go
here, south of the Sahara desert.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:38.500
[theme music]

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.740
First, let’s turn to written records. Oh, right.
We don’t have very many, at least not written

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.800
by Sub-Saharan Africans. Much of African history
was preserved via oral rather than written tradition.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.489
These days, we tend to think of writing as
the most accurate and reliable form of description,

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.890
but then again, we do live in a print-based
culture. And we’ve already said that writing

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.410
is one of the markers of civilization, implying
that people who don’t use writing aren’t

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.219
civilized, a prejudice that has been applied
over and over again to Africa. But:

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.670
1. If you need any evidence that it’s possible
to produce amazing literary artifacts without

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.430
the benefits of writing, let me direct your
attention to the Iliad and the Odyssey, which

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.760
were composed and memorized by poets for centuries
before anyone ever wrote them down. And,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.670
2. No less an authority than Plato said that
writing destroys human memory by alleviating

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.920
the need to remember anything.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.840
And 3. You think the oral tradition is uncivilized
but here you are listening to me talk!

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.229
But we do have a lot of interesting records
for some African histories, including the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.790
legendary tale of Mansa Musa. By legendary
I mean some of it probably isn’t true, but

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.000
it sure is important. Let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.490
So there was this king Mansa Musa, who ruled
the west African empire of Mali, and in 1324-ish,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.490
he left his home and made the hajj, the pilgrimage
to Mecca.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.200
He brought with him an entourage of over 1000
people (some sources say 60,000) and, most

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.590
importantly, 100 camel loads of gold. I wish
it had been donkeys so I could say he had

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.909
100 assloads of gold, but no. Camels.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.110
Right, so along the way Mansa Musa spent freely
and gave away lots of his riches. Most famously,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.020
when he reached Alexandria, at the time one
of the most cultured cities in the world, he

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.700
spent so much gold that he caused runaway inflation
throughout the city that took years to recover from.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.639
He built houses in Cairo and in Mecca to house
his attendants, and as he traveled through

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:17.739
the world, a lot of people - notably the merchants
of Venice - no, Thought Bubble, like actual

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.559
merchants of Venice - right - they saw him
in Alexandria and returned to Italy with tales

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:27.480
of Mansa Musa’s ridiculous wealth, which
helped create the myth in the minds of Europeans

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.540
that West Africa was a land of gold, an El
Dorado. The kind of place you’d like to

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.249
visit. And maybe, you know, in five centuries
or so, begin to pillage. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.090
So what’s so important about the story of
Mansa Musa? Well, first, it tells us there

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.680
were African kingdoms, ruled by fabulously
wealthy African kings. Which undermines one

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.790
of the many stereotypes about Africa, that
its people were poor and lived in tribes ruled

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.100
by chiefs and witch doctors. Also, since Mansa
Musa was making the hajj, we know that he was:

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.139
A. Muslim, and
B. relatively devout.

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.319
And this tells us that Africa, at least western
Africa, was much more connected to the parts

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.370
of the world we’ve been talking about than
we generally are led to believe. Mansa Musa

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.559
knew all about the places he was going before
he got there, and after his visits, the rest

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:13.379
of the Mediterranean world was sure interested
in finding out more about his homeland.

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.199
Mansa Musa’s pilgrimage also brings up a
lot of questions about west Africa, namely,

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:21.379
what did his kingdom look like and how did
he come to convert to Islam? The first question

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.129
is a little easier, so we’ll start with
that one.

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.150
The empire of Mali, which Mansa Musa ruled
until the extremely elite year of 1337, was

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.290
a large swath of West Africa, running from
the coast hundreds of miles into the interior,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.439
and including many significant cities, the
largest and best-known of which was Timbuktu.

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:41.089
The story of the Islamization of the Empire,
however, is a bit more complicated. Okay,

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:45.019
so pastoral North Africans called Berbers
had long traded with West Africans, with the

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.849
Berbers offering salt in exchange for West
African gold. That may seem like a bad deal

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.549
until you consider that without salt, we die,
whereas without gold, we only have to face

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.489
the universe’s depraved indifference to
us without the benefit of metallic adornment.

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.709
That went to an ominous place quickly.

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.689
Right, so anyway the Berbers were early converts
to Islam, and Islam spread along those pre-existing

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.599
trade routes between North and West Africa.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.719
Right, so the first converts in Mali were
traders, who benefited from having a religious

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.209
as well as commercial connection to their
trading partners in the North and the rest

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.099
of the Mediterranean. And then the kings followed
the traders, maybe because sharing the religion

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.060
of more established kingdoms in the north
and east would give them prestige, not to

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.520
mention access to scholars and administrators
who could help them cement their power.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.900
So Islam became the religion of the elites
in West Africa, which meant that the Muslim

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.990
kings were trying to extend their power over
largely non-Muslim populations which worshipped

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.270
traditional African gods and spirits. In order
not to seem too foreign, these African Muslim

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.699
kings would often blend traditional religion
with Islam - for instance, giving women more

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.020
equality than was seen in Islam’s birthplace.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.770
Anyway, the first kings we have a record of
adopting Islam were from Ghana, which was

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.520
the first “empire” in western Africa.
It really took off in the 11th century. As

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.800
with all empires, and also everything else,
Ghana rose and then fell, and it was replaced

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.330
by Mali. The kings of Mali - especially Mansa
Musa, but also Mansa Suleyman, his successor

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.759
- tried to increase the knowledge and practice
of Islam in their territory. So for example,

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.959
when Mansa Musa returned from his hajj, he
brought back scholars and architects to build mosques.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.370
And the reason we know a lot about Mali is
because it was visited by Ibn Battuta, the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.629
Moroccan cleric and scholar who kind of had
the best life ever. He was particularly fascinated

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:23.449
by gender roles in the Malian empire - and
by Malian women - writing, “They are extremely

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:31.099
beautiful, and more important than the men.”
Oh. It must be time for the open letter.

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.810
An Open Letter to Ibn Battuta: I wonder what’s
in the Secret Compartment today. Oh. I appears

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.480
to be some kind of fake beard... Movie magic!
Stan, why did you do this to me?

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.680
Dear Ibn Battuta,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.620
Bro, I love twitter and my x-box and Hawaiian
pizza, but if I had to go into the past and

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.219
live anyone’s life, it would be yours! Because
you were this outlandishly learned scholar

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:57.669
who managed to parlay your knowledge of Islam
into the greatest road trip in history.

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.069
You went from Mali to Constantinople to India
to Russia to Indonesia; you were probably

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:06.539
the most well-traveled person before the invention
of the steam engine. And everywhere you went,

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.259
you were treated like a king and then you
went home and wrote a really famous book called

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.370
the Rihla, which people still read today and
also, you could grow a real beard and I'M

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.730
JEALOUS!

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.060
Best wishes, John Green

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.120
One more thing about Mansa Musa: There are
lots of stories that Mansa Musa attempted

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.160
to engage in maritime trade across the Atlantic
Ocean, and some historians even believe that Malians

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.780
reached the Americas. DNA investigation may one 
day prove it, but until then, we’ll only have oral tradition.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.300
The Malian Empire eventually fell to Songhai,
which was itself eventually overthrown for

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.669
being insufficiently Islamic, all of which
is to say that - like China or India or Europe

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.449
- West Africa had its own empires that relied
upon religion and war and incredibly boring

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.889
dynastic politics. Man, I hate dynastic politics.

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.370
If I wanted to live in an ostensibly independent
country that can’t let go of monarchy, I’d

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.509
be like Thought Bubble and move to Canada.
Oh, come on, Thought Bubble, that’s not

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.169
fair. Shut up and take back Celine Dion!

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.560
All right, now let’s move to the other side
of Africa where there was an alternative model

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.029
of “civilizational” development. The eastern
coast of Africa saw the rise of what historians

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:04.960
called Swahili civilization, which was not
an empire or a kingdom but a collection of

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.560
city states - like Zanzibar and Mombasa and
Mogadishu - all of which formed a network

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.020
of trade ports. There was no central authority
– each of these cities was autonomously

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.749
ruled, usually, but not always, by a king.
But there were three things that linked these

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:20.960
city states such that we can consider them
a common culture: language, trade and religion.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.419
The Swahili language is part of a language
group called Bantu, and its original speakers

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:28.909
were from West Africa. Their migration to
East Africa changed not only the linguistic

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.840
traditions of Africa, but everything else,
because they brought with them ironwork and

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.939
agriculture. Until then, most of the people
living in the East had been hunter-gatherers

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:41.479
or herders, but once introduced, agriculture
took hold, as it almost always does. Unless,

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:45.830
wait for it, you’re the Mongols.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.729
Modern day Swahili, by the way, is still a
Bantu-based language, although it’s been

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:52.800
heavily influenced by Arabic. On that topic,
for a long time historians believed that the

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.949
East African cities were all started by Arab
or Persian traders, which was basically just

00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:01.639
racist - they didn’t believe that Africans
were sophisticated enough to found these great

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:05.939
cities. Now scholars recognize that all the
major Swahili cities were founded well before

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:10.499
Islam arrived in the region and that, in fact,
trade had been going on since the first century CE.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.300
But Swahili civilization didn’t begin its
rapid development until the 8th century, when

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.430
Arab traders arrived, seeking goods that they
could trade in the vast Indian Ocean network,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.870
the Silk Road of the sea. And of course those
merchants brought Islam with them, which,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.819
just like in West Africa, was adopted by the
elites who wanted religious as well as commercial

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:29.620
connections to the rest of the Mediterranean
world.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.599
In many of the Swahili states, these Muslim
communities started out quite small, but at

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:37.320
their height, between the 13th and 16th century,
most of the cities boasted large mosques.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.430
The one in Kilwa even impressed Ibn Battuta,
who of course visited the city, because he

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.419
was having the best life ever.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.209
Most of the goods exported were raw materials,
like ivory and animal hides and timber - it’s

00:08:47.209 --> 00:08:51.060
worth noting, by the way, that when you’re
moving trees around, you have a level of sophistication

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.110
to your trade that goes way beyond the Silk
Road. I mean, if you’ll recall they weren’t

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.850
just trading, like, tortoise shells and stuff
- not again!

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.240
Africans also exported slaves along the east
coast, although not in HUGE numbers, and they

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.860
exported gold, and they imported finished
luxury goods like porcelain and books. In

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:11.240
fact, archaeological digs in Kilwa have revealed
that houses often featured a kind of built-in bookshelf.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:17.490
Learning of books through architecture nicely
captures the magic of studying history. Archaeology,

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.760
writing, and oral tradition all intermingle
to give us glimpses of the past. And each

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.680
of those lenses may show us the past as if
through some fun house mirror, but if we’re

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.800
conscious about it, we can at least recognize
the distortions.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.260
Studying Africa reminds us that we need to
look at lots of sources, and lots of kinds

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.490
of sources if we want to get a fuller picture
of the past. If we relied on only written

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.910
sources, it would be far too easy to fall
into the old trap of seeing Africa as backwards

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.120
and uncivilized. Through approaching it with
multiple lenses, we discover a complicated,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.529
diverse place that was sometimes rich and
sometimes not - and when you look at it that

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:56.089
way, it becomes not separate from, but part of, our
history. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

Last week's Phrase Of The Week was "Animal
crackers." If you want to suggest future phrases

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.430
of the week or guess at this one, you can
do so in comments; also, if you have questions

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.320
about today's video, ask them, and our team
of historians will endeavor to answer them.

00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:18.220
Thanks for watching and supporting Crash Course.
And as we say in my hometown, Don't Forget

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.520
To Be Awesome.
