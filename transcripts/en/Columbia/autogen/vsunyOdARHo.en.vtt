significant downturn in revenues from
 

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.150
significant downturn in revenues from
the export side yeah and yet the only

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160
the export side yeah and yet the only
 

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.790
the export side yeah and yet the only
way to compensate is to go to a domestic

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800
way to compensate is to go to a domestic
 

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.120
way to compensate is to go to a domestic
consumption and in China the savings

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.130
consumption and in China the savings
 

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.920
consumption and in China the savings
rate is so high because there's so few

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:40.930

that have built up yet that power of
 

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.090
that have built up yet that power of
domestic consumption so so how do we get

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:54.100
domestic consumption so so how do we get
 

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.830
domestic consumption so so how do we get
from here to there and what will happen

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:55.840
from here to there and what will happen
 

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.510
from here to there and what will happen
in between and everybody's always

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:57.520
in between and everybody's always
 

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.180
in between and everybody's always
concerned about instability in China I

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:00.190
concerned about instability in China I
 

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.820
concerned about instability in China I
mean this might as well go into the big

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:02.830
mean this might as well go into the big
 

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.080
mean this might as well go into the big
subjects right away and then I'm going

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:04.090
subjects right away and then I'm going
 

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.930
subjects right away and then I'm going
to turn to merit and ask her

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:06.940

the China's domestic market

00:13:14.249 --> 00:13:14.259
the China's domestic market
 

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:16.530
the China's domestic market
sprung a lot faster than that people

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:16.540
sprung a lot faster than that people
 

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.169
sprung a lot faster than that people
might otherwise perceive I think China's

00:13:19.169 --> 00:13:19.179
might otherwise perceive I think China's
 

00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:20.909

export business only accounts for about

00:13:20.909 --> 00:13:20.919

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:23.369
export business only accounts for about
a third of the gross gross domestic

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:23.379
a third of the gross gross domestic
 

00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:28.289
a third of the gross gross domestic

what happens in the United States or the

eurozone and to my mind this is clearly
 

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.650
eurozone and to my mind this is clearly
wishful thinking so you think that

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660

theory of decoupling is was I think it's

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.300
theory of decoupling is was I think it's
 

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.180

very much overblown in allusion yeah

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:47.190
very much overblown in allusion yeah
 

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.460
very much overblown in allusion yeah
yeah it's just overblown I mean I

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:49.470
yeah it's just overblown I mean I
 

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.730
yeah it's just overblown I mean I
certainly growth in Asia my senses is

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740

a recession so it will help us get out

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920
a recession so it will help us get out
 

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.240
a recession so it will help us get out
of there but I don't think this idea of

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:08.250
of there but I don't think this idea of
 

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.430
of there but I don't think this idea of
decoupling has proven itself to be

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.150
durable you've seen us markets go down
by about thirty three percent I think

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160
by about thirty three percent I think
 

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.000
by about thirty three percent I think
you see chinese going down and russia

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.010
you see chinese going down and russia
 

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:25.430
you see chinese going down and russia
down about sixty percent and so I mean

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440
down about sixty percent and so I mean
 

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.140
down about sixty percent and so I mean
to my way of thinking globalization is

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:27.150
to my way of thinking globalization is
 

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:32.230
to my way of thinking globalization is
mostly positive and is unavoidable and

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240
mostly positive and is unavoidable and
 

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.120
mostly positive and is unavoidable and
the only way would stop would be because

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.130
the only way would stop would be because
 

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:39.320
the only way would stop would be because
of some major calamitous events yeah but

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:39.330
of some major calamitous events yeah but
 

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.000
of some major calamitous events yeah but

institutions I think the WTO is at risk
 

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:27.920
institutions I think the WTO is at risk
for becoming increasingly obscure but I

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:27.930
for becoming increasingly obscure but I
 

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.460
for becoming increasingly obscure but I
think that it's an important institution

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:30.470
think that it's an important institution
 

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:34.340

that's really a powerful statement that

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:39.770
that's really a powerful statement that
 

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.419
that's really a powerful statement that
the WTO is at risk of becoming obscure

00:17:43.419 --> 00:17:43.429
the WTO is at risk of becoming obscure
 

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:45.549
the WTO is at risk of becoming obscure
is that because bilateral trade

00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559

and and rather than international trade
 

00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:51.940
and and rather than international trade
what is behind that statement well I

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:51.950
what is behind that statement well I
 

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.590
what is behind that statement well I
think first of all ninety-five percent

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600
think first of all ninety-five percent
 

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.870

of global trade is covered by the rules

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880
of global trade is covered by the rules
 

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:00.399
of global trade is covered by the rules
of the WTO yeah and so you know that's

00:18:00.399 --> 00:18:00.409
of the WTO yeah and so you know that's
 

00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:02.980
of the WTO yeah and so you know that's

enormously important there are important
 

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.899
enormously important there are important
areas that we're facing now that are

00:18:04.899 --> 00:18:04.909
areas that we're facing now that are
 

00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:07.000
areas that we're facing now that are
outside of the rule architecture things

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.010
outside of the rule architecture things
 

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.700
outside of the rule architecture things
like antitrust things like banking and

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:09.710
like antitrust things like banking and
 

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.010
like antitrust things like banking and
securities and so forth that's really a

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:12.020
securities and so forth that's really a
 

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.909
securities and so forth that's really a
national matter but and you are seeing

00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919
national matter but and you are seeing
 

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:18.639
national matter but and you are seeing
more bilateral and regional free trade

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:18.649
more bilateral and regional free trade
 

00:18:18.649 --> 00:18:22.779
more bilateral and regional free trade
agreements and you're seeing you know a

00:18:22.779 --> 00:18:22.789
agreements and you're seeing you know a
 

00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:24.430
agreements and you're seeing you know a
tremendous and ability of the

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440
tremendous and ability of the
 

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.210
tremendous and ability of the
multilateral system to reach new Accords

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:27.220
multilateral system to reach new Accords
 

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.130
multilateral system to reach new Accords
the part of the system that is working

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:30.140
the part of the system that is working
 

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.080
the part of the system that is working
well is the dispute settlement system

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:32.090
well is the dispute settlement system
 

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.370
well is the dispute settlement system
and that is I think a very important

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:35.380
and that is I think a very important
 

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.399
and that is I think a very important
function because instead of the old

00:18:38.399 --> 00:18:38.409
function because instead of the old
 

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:41.230
function because instead of the old
confrontational approach of the 70s and

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240
confrontational approach of the 70s and
 

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.220
confrontational approach of the 70s and
80s where big powers could could get

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:45.230
80s where big powers could could get
 

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.070
80s where big powers could could get
concessions from small everything is

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080
concessions from small everything is
 

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.039
concessions from small everything is
rule-based and through an impartial

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:51.049
rule-based and through an impartial
 

00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:56.909
rule-based and through an impartial
tribunal so to me that's a real plus but

00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919
tribunal so to me that's a real plus but
 

00:18:56.919 --> 00:18:59.590
tribunal so to me that's a real plus but
but countries have not been willing to

00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600
but countries have not been willing to
 

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.570
but countries have not been willing to
come forward to each other satisfaction

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:01.580
come forward to each other satisfaction
 

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.560
come forward to each other satisfaction
I think the next administration could

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:10.190
priority could could reach a deal and I
 

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.529
priority could could reach a deal and I
guess I think that's enormously

00:19:11.529 --> 00:19:11.539
guess I think that's enormously
 

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:15.279

because we had a country we could turn
 

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:38.300
because we had a country we could turn
to to to change politically but we it's

coordination cooperation is great but

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440
coordination cooperation is great but
 

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.100
coordination cooperation is great but
you know it's not enough you sit on

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:55.110
you know it's not enough you sit on
 

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:56.930
you know it's not enough you sit on
these international bodies what can be

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:56.940
these international bodies what can be
 

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.860
these international bodies what can be
created what should be created

00:20:59.860 --> 00:20:59.870
created what should be created
 

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.570
created what should be created
institutionally yeah I'm not sure I have

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:02.580
institutionally yeah I'm not sure I have
 

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:08.240
institutionally yeah I'm not sure I have
a full-blown answer I do think that you

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:08.250
a full-blown answer I do think that you
 

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.450
a full-blown answer I do think that you
made a multilateral institution was

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:10.460
made a multilateral institution was
 

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.220
made a multilateral institution was
created out of a recognition that

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:13.230
created out of a recognition that
 

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.740
created out of a recognition that
national responses were insufficient

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:15.750
national responses were insufficient
 

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:21.020
national responses were insufficient
yeah and so you know there's a lot of

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:21.030
yeah and so you know there's a lot of
 

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.700
yeah and so you know there's a lot of
talk in this country and around the

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:22.710
talk in this country and around the
 

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.460
talk in this country and around the
world about loss of sovereignty

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:24.470

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.430
associated with these international
institutions to my way of thinking it

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440
institutions to my way of thinking it
 

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.730
institutions to my way of thinking it
was an exercise of sovereignty to

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740
was an exercise of sovereignty to
 

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.740
was an exercise of sovereignty to
establish them and and the WTO is is

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:35.750
establish them and and the WTO is is
 

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.360
establish them and and the WTO is is
imperfect as it is needs to be bolstered

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:38.370
imperfect as it is needs to be bolstered
 

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.420
imperfect as it is needs to be bolstered
I don't think you're going to see a new

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:41.430
I don't think you're going to see a new
 

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.590
I don't think you're going to see a new
I don't see the enthusiasm for a global

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600
I don't see the enthusiasm for a global
 

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.430
I don't see the enthusiasm for a global
financial regulatory body but I do think

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440
financial regulatory body but I do think
 

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.890
financial regulatory body but I do think
that there is scope for improved

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900
that there is scope for improved
 

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.730
that there is scope for improved
coordination you know new emergency

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:55.740

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.840
coordination you know new emergency
powers there will be come

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:57.850
powers there will be come
 

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.110
powers there will be come
out of this period clearly a lot of

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120
out of this period clearly a lot of
 

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.630
out of this period clearly a lot of
regulation and so the challenge is going

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640
regulation and so the challenge is going
 

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.990
regulation and so the challenge is going
to be to think through mechanisms that

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000
to be to think through mechanisms that
 

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.880
to be to think through mechanisms that
better think through the linkage between

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:08.890
better think through the linkage between
 

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.880
better think through the linkage between

at first I was amazed at that just for

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:15.160
at first I was amazed at that just for
 

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.490
at first I was amazed at that just for
the sake of doing it but the second

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:17.500
the sake of doing it but the second
 

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.610
the sake of doing it but the second
thing was that it was not yet published

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:20.620
thing was that it was not yet published
 

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.100
thing was that it was not yet published
nor was there a commercial recording of

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:23.110
nor was there a commercial recording of
 

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.710
nor was there a commercial recording of
it but she had the music in a recording

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:25.720
it but she had the music in a recording
 

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.370
it but she had the music in a recording
of it

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:26.380
of it
 

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.250
of it
and so you have to see how important

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:29.260
and so you have to see how important
 

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.710
and so you have to see how important
that is she managed not only to get

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720
that is she managed not only to get
 

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.750
that is she managed not only to get
interested in something I had American

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760

composer that was so distant from her

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360
composer that was so distant from her
 

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.870
composer that was so distant from her
world but she actually was able to find

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880

through the internet all the information

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:42.550
through the internet all the information
 

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.000
through the internet all the information
she needed to different uses and I've

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.010
she needed to different uses and I've
 

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:47.400
she needed to different uses and I've
been touch with young composers from

Siberia from all parts of China from
South America on so I think there's a

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.320
South America on so I think there's a
 

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.760
South America on so I think there's a
huge huge difference but I think it's

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:56.770
huge huge difference but I think it's
 

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.850

and see whether you think this is true

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200
and see whether you think this is true
 

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:34.970
and see whether you think this is true

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.960
is one of the biggest things that the
United States export so as much as

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:41.970

and so on culture continues to be
 

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:55.160
and so on culture continues to be
something that appeals the coming out of

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:55.170

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:10.190
you have tapped into that next
proposition that will change that is if

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200
proposition that will change that is if
 

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.540
