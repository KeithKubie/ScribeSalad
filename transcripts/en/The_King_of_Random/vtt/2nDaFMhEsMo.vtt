00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.560
[Captions by Y Translator]
Fog juice is used
for making the special effect

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.840
where you create clouds, mist, or fog.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.800
Today, we're going to try
boiling a whole gallon of it

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.680
and see what kind of result we get.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.140
[Music]

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.100
What happens when you boil
an entire gallon of fog juice?

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.800
I don't know,
but I want to find out,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.200
so that's what
we're doing today.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.060
The idea is simple.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.000
We'll try boiling or burning
a small portion of the fog juice,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.440
and see what kind of effect we get.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.872
If it's anything that we like,
we're going to take a whole gallon of it,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.720
pour it into a steel pot,
put the pot in a big old foundry

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.980
and crank up the heat.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.200
Some of the ingredients
in fog juice don't boil

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.692
at as low of a temperature as water.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.800
Water, of course boils
at a 100 degrees Celsius

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.540
or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.820
Some of the ingredients
in the fog juice don't boil until

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.900
5 or 600 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.900
so we're going to use
a little bit more heat

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.000
than usual to try and really
get this to vaporize.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.500
What exactly goes
into these fog fluid recipes

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.820
is a little bit of a trade secret,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.300
but there's often water,
there's some glycerin,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.592
there's a whole bunch of different
compounds based on ethylene glycol.

00:00:56.592 --> 00:00:59.860
[Music]

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.560
We're going to start off
with a relatively small amount.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.280
Pour that in,
then watch what happens.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.920
So, so far, it seems
like it's just steaming.

00:01:10.742 --> 00:01:14.100
Normal steam from water,
but I think there is still

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.000
a lot of water in it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.600
And the water in it is going
to keep the temperature down

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.202
until it's all evaporated,

00:01:19.582 --> 00:01:22.500
and at that point I'm hoping
the other chemicals will sort of,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.200
do their thing where they vaporize
and we'll see if we start

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.100
getting thicker smoke.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.700
I think we already
are getting thicker smoke.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.900
In fact, up in the air it's
starting to be quite visible.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.000
Now the way that fog fluid works is
that it vaporizes.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.400
And normally, this is done
inside a machine.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.080
It pulls some of the fluid out
in a very small quantity,

00:01:41.482 --> 00:01:44.500
applies it to a heating element,
that vaporizes it,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.080
it sprays it out the front,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.300
and when it hits the cooler air
it condenses into the thick fog

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.720
that we're used to seeing.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.400
This is happening in a little bit
of a different method right now

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.100
because we are just
using a pot on a stove

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.700
and so it stays really hot.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.072
And it's probably not condensing
until 6 to 10 feet above our pot.

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.122
Now it's bubbling
interestingly.

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:07.480
[Music]

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.440
Part of our pot is
literally red hot.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:20.760
[Music]

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.000
We're definitely
getting a thicker fog now.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.000
Oh, and it caught on fire.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.212
Fascinating.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.580
[Music]

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.400
It's off the heat.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.300
Pot is obviously still very warm,
and we've still got fog rising up.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.000
We've definitely started filling the dome,
and it's got--

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.600
If you've been around fog machines,
there's a smell that they have,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.700
and it's got that smell filling
the dome at this point.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.100
So I would say our small-scale test,
we are getting some fog coming

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.100
out of that fog juice
as we boil it and burn it.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.000
I don't know if it's necessarily
as efficient as it is when you put it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.700
into a fog machine.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.500
Those things do a pretty good job
of using their fog juice

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.880
for quite a while,
but this is definitely faster.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.800
So I think what we need to do
is upgrade a little bit,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.400
and we're just going to try
doing the whole gallon

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.000
and see how much it'll fill the dome.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.200
And then also,
in the top of our dome

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.680
there is a small little oculus ring.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.272
That allows for airflow,
and some light to get in,

00:03:15.272 --> 00:03:17.300
although most of the light
comes in through the door.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.600
But we want to see
if we get fog kind of pouring up

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.660
out of that circle in the top.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.500
Not only that, but we are also going
to be using our giant metal foundry,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.292
which so far has had,
sadly, very little use.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.600
I think we poured some liquid
nitrogen down into it once

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.700
but now we get to actually fire it up
with something inside it.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.900
And hopefully it's just going
to get that whole pot blazing

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.400
hot as fast as possible.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.600
But the hope is that we get
a lot of smoke out of this.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.580
A gallons worth of
fog fluid out of this.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.460
Let's give it a try.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:04:11.200
[Music]

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.900
Feels like it has plenty.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.620
[Music]

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.660
Throw this on to see
if it helps, or hurts.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:29.660
[Music]

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.620
Oh, suddenly some fog
is coming up out of that.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.620
[Music]

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.600
It is all boiling
rather marvelously.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.700
You can see how much
of this is just water

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.232
that needs to boil off and...

00:04:48.232 --> 00:04:50.000
It's getting lower.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.200
But water creates a little bit of vapor,
whereas the other chemicals create

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.272
a lot more vapor.

00:04:57.272 --> 00:05:07.160
[Music]

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.000
It's very shallow now,
there's only like an inch

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.782
of liquid at the bottom of that.

00:05:11.662 --> 00:05:13.600
And it's definitely
getting smokier.

00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:16.000
Like you're now hazy.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.042
Oh, I think we're hitting
the critical point.

00:05:19.122 --> 00:05:21.192
This is looking more.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.360
[Music]

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.140
Man, that is crazy
how little is left.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.200
Maybe 3/4, or a half an inch
at the bottom of that pot now.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.880
[Music]

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.840
We may finally have started
to boil off all the water.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.832
[Music]

00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:46.502
Oh, I think we might have started
to actually ignite it inside there too.

00:05:47.382 --> 00:05:49.900
Our fog juice, or what's
left of it has actually caught

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.600
on fire inside the pot.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.702
Bigger flames than I thought
were going to happen.

00:05:54.462 --> 00:05:56.600
That is well, and truly on fire.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.400
It's pretty smoky in here.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.600
So now, I'm going to take a knife
and perforate it and then

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.602
try and run and jump through it.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.040
Boiling fog juice does not work as well
as just putting fog juice in a fog machine.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.400
That's what they're designed for,
it's all been carefully formulated

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.680
and measured to work
with that system

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.000
to disperse it into the air.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.100
You do get some nice thick fog
when you heat it up,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.600
but I think it just gets too thick.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.700
Usually when it's applied
into a fog machine, it's in just

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.800
the right amount that it can vaporize
before it's thrown out in the machine

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.000
and it then condenses.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.200
You don't have nearly
that much control when

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.420
you just light it on fire.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.500
It's a cool thing to see and do,
but I bet we would get

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.220
a lot more fog out of a gallon
if we just put it into a machine.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.300
We've got a little bit
more time right now.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.020
We're going to do
some more Q&amp;A.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.200
You have asked us
some questions.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.812
We're going to try and
answer some of them for you.

00:06:46.202 --> 00:06:46.512
Alright.

00:06:46.512 --> 00:06:52.700
We now have a question
from Vedant Sakhuja, I am so sorry.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.452
I'm pronouncing that wrong
in nine different ways.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.460
Sakhuja, Sahulya.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.600
I'm very sorry that I
do not know how to say that.

00:07:02.862 --> 00:07:05.000
He asked, what is
your filming gear?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.200
That depends, If you ask me,
our filming gear is a camera,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.600
a microphone, and some lights.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.400
But I don't think that's quite
the answer you're looking for.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.200
So we're going to turn this over
to our cameraman who's gonna give

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.800
you actual answers
about what we use.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.500
Mark?

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.900
Cool, so the main camera that
we use is the Sony A6500.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.200
We love this camera,
it's cheap.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.100
If we happen to destroy it,
it's not that expensive to replace it

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.040
and buy a new one.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.900
It's lightweight and we can
put it in a lot of places

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.500
that we probably couldn't put
a larger camera in.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.352
We have gone through a couple
different kind of microphones.

00:07:39.632 --> 00:07:42.800
We mainly use these lav mics,
it's a Sony lav mic

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.800
and hooked to a Sony field recorder.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.100
We love the the sound of the audio,
it's really easy to sync up in post.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.100
So on the camera,
we have a Rode videomicro,

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.942
and it's mainly for getting ambient
sounds, like, the sounds of explosions,

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:57.560
or something boiling.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.000
On top of the camera,
we have a small HD monitor that I use to

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
be able to see what I'm recording instead
of on that tiny little LCD that's built into the camera.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.142
It's just nice having
something a little bit brighter

00:08:08.482 --> 00:08:11.200
and larger for making sure
I have everything in focus.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.000
And to specify, smallHD is
actually the brand of the monitor.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.300
That's not just a description,
that it's small and high definition.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.300
Yep.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.700
The lens on my camera is a Zeiss 24
millimeter 1.8 aperture prime lens.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.800
And it is the main lens that we use,
I do have quite a few other lenses.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.600
I love this Zeiss
1.8 aperture lens.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.500
It helps with low light
video shots that we need.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.000
The lights that we use
in our studio are pretty cheap

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.560
that you can just find them on Amazon.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.160
We can link them down
in the description below.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.600
Yeah, we do use other cameras.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.000
We really like using the
Sony RX100 Mark V.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.552
It's a great camera

00:08:49.552 --> 00:08:51.642
it's small, again, portable.

00:08:52.012 --> 00:08:55.900
We have actually had this really close
to like molten aluminum exploding onto it.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.300
On the lens, you can see
we actually have a couple

00:08:58.332 --> 00:09:03.500
of pock marks from where molten aluminum
and molten brass have splashed onto it

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.600
and melted the glass

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.600
but it still works great
and we love it.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.300
We love using GoPros as well.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.700
They are excellent for putting up
even closer to the action.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.600
For example, this GoPro
right here is totally

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.600
melted on the top.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.600
We had molten brass melt the top
of this GoPro but it still

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.800
works which is very impressive.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.200
So for editing, we,
as a team use PremierePro.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.960
It's excellent for being able
to start off editing on one machine.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.700
I'll upload the footage
to Dropbox and we

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.922
have editors that are not local,

00:09:35.282 --> 00:09:38.200
download the footage
and the project file and just

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.400
be able to start working right
from where I left off.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.180
Hey, thank you Vedant
for your question.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.600
Guys, that's all for today.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.900
But the fun doesn't end here that box
at the top will take you directly

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.000
to our most recent video.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
You should go check that out.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.700
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.720
you should be watching next,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.792
and if you haven't joined the club
yet just hit this bomb

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:55.000
and you'll be subscribed to the channel.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.900
So you never miss
out on the fun.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.200
Don't forget to ring that bell

00:09:57.212 --> 00:09:58.300
and we'll see you
on the next one.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.000
Talk to you then.
