00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.280
You just added a powerful user to your
server that authenticates using a user

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.790
name and password.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.100
Hopefully, you chose a strong password
since attackers will soon start running

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.730
bots against your server attempting to
guess any valid usernames and passwords.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.160
This is going to cause all sorts
of issues for your server.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.040
Your logs are going to be filled
with invalid login attempts, and

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.710
if one of these hackers
manages to gain access,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.820
well that's about the worst
thing we could possibly imagine.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.480
There's another way to perform user
authentication that's much more secure.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.345
It doesn't rely on passwords, which
we're pretty horrible at making secure,

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:36.305
since we have to make them
simple enough to memorize.

00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:40.175
Instead, this form of authentication,
called key based authentication,

00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:42.865
relies on physical files
located on the server and

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:45.015
your personal machine,
the one you're logging in from.

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:48.435
Before we get into key
based authentication,

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:51.575
let's demonstrate how public
key encryption generally works.
