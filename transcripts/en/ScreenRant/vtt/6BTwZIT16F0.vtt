00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.430
One of the worst things that can happen to
an actor is to get constantly typecast. If

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.370
someone becomes associated with playing a
certain kind of role, like Michael Cera did

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.530
for Arrested Development and Superbad, it’s
hard for audiences to see them as any other

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.180
kind of character. That’s why it’s best
for actors to establish a wide range of performances

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.210
in order to not get pigeonholed into specific
roles. Some are better at this than others.&nbsp;

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.290
Here are 10 Actors with Incredible Range&nbsp;
Jared Leto&nbsp;

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.820
After gaining teen heartthrob status for his
role in My So Called Life, it would have been

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.910
easy for Jared Leto to continue down that
path, instead he made less obvious choices,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.920
appearing in offbeat films like Fight Club,
American Psycho, and Requiem for a Dream,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.120
all of which now have cult status. After gaining
67 pounds to play John Lennon’s assassin

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.290
in Chapter 27, Leto took a break from film
to concentrate on music.&nbsp;Five years later

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.200
Leto returned to movies to play a transgendered
woman in Dallas Buyers Club. The role earned

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.640
him an Oscar and gave him the acting bug again.
A barely recognizable Leto will soon be seen

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.150
going full method in this summer’s Suicide
Squad.&nbsp;

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.740
Charlize Theron
As much as we all love her, Charlize Theron

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.710
has avoided playing the love interest. Instead
of making mediocre romantic comedies, Theron

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.899
mostly made a name for herself by holding
her own in male dominated action films like

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.509
The Yards and The Italian Job before landing
the role that demanded recognition for her

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.750
serious talents. It was a lot more than makeup
that made Theron virtually unrecognizable

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.869
in Monster, the true story of an abused woman
turned killer that would earn Theron an Oscar.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.259
She’s consistently puts out versatile work,
and is probably the only person who could

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.609
steal a Mad Max movie from Mad Max.&nbsp;
Brad Pitt

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.840
Brad Pitt is far too good looking to be as
talented as he is. People who don’t watch

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.060
his riskier films probably assume this is
where all of his appeal ends, but Pitt has

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.200
worked hard to shed his pretty boy image.
Even early in his career he was taking different

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.110
roles like the stoner roommate in True Romance,
but it wasn’t until his manic, twitchy performance

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.749
in 12 Monkeys that most audiences realized
he was a force to be reckoned with. Pitt can

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:59.070
play subtle and introverted in art films like
Tree of Life, or he can be silly while scalping

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.490
Nazis in Inglorious Basterds. He’s used
his star power for good by supporting independent

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.840
filmmakers and appearing in films outside
the Hollywood box. You really never know where

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.289
Pitt will pop up next.&nbsp;
Heath Ledger

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.090
Heath Ledger appeared in less than 20 films
before he died at age 28, but in his short

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.550
career he demonstrated more range than most
actors do in decades of work. If you look

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.980
at his most famous roles, you’ll find a
sensitive bad boy, a knight in shining armour,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.530
a closeted cowboy, and the scariest super
villain ever committed to screen. It felt

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.260
like Ledger was just getting started and it’s
sad to think what could have been if he’d

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.920
been able to continue on his exciting career
trajectory, but at least he made the best

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.660
of the time he had.&nbsp;
Cate Blanchett&nbsp;

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.660
There’s a timeless quality to Cate Blachett
that makes it hard to believe she only started

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.360
appearing in films in 1997. It wasn’t long
until she gained worldwide acclaim for her

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.840
portrayal of the Queen in 1998’s Elizabeth.
From the angelic Galadriel in Lord of the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.980
Rings to the hard-nosed Katharine Hepburn
in Martin Scorsese's The Aviator, directors

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.440
count on Blanchett to pull off whatever outlandish
requirements they seek. Disappearing into

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.640
her roles and mastering any accent, most people
would probably have a hard time telling you

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.810
where she’s from or realize that she’s
already been nominated six Oscars and counting…&nbsp;

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.250
Gary Oldman&nbsp;
Is there an actor who embodies the idea of

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.880
the performer as a chameleon better than Gary
Oldman? In the 90s he played a slew of villains

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.410
that most audiences didn’t even realize
were the same actor. This included films like

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.920
Leon: The Professional, The Fifth Element,
True Romance and Bram Stoker’s Dracula,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.650
to name just a few. His villainous persona
made him the perfect choice for Sirius Black

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.780
in the Harry Potter films. Black is terrifying
at first, but when his true side is revealed

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.770
we feel like Harry and his friends are perfectly
safe with him. As Oldman has become an older

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.120
man, his image has softened somewhat, though
he was still an inspired choice the goodhearted

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.150
Commissioner Gordon in Batman Begins.&nbsp;
Edward Norton &nbsp;

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.080
Not many actors can boast proving their range
in their very first role. How is this possible

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.720
you ask? In 1996 Edward Norton wowed audiences
with his performance in Primal Fear as an

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.200
accused murderer suffering from multiple personality
disorder. Norton effortlessly goes from stuttering

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.970
and meek to commanding and intimidating. It's
a creepy performance that Norton arguably

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.470
topped a couple years later when he played
a beefed up neo Nazi in American History X.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.740
Since then Norton has tried his hand at everything,
from quirky comedies like Moonrise Kingdom,

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.020
to blockbuster action flicks like The Incredible
Hulk.&nbsp;

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.020
Emily Blunt&nbsp;
Playing everything from British royalty to

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.840
American farmer, few actresses are able to
genre hop the way Emily Blunt does. When she

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.209
first made us laugh in The Devil Wears Prada,
we had no idea she’d soon be making us cry

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.259
in The Young Victoria or gasp in action flicks
like Looper, The Edge of Tomorrow and Sicario.

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:29.139
Despite these wide ranging characters, Blunt
doesn't feel the need to make drastic or constant

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.210
changes to her appearance, letting her performance
create her characters, not her looks.&nbsp;

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.150
Denzel Washington&nbsp;
Depending on the role, Denzel Washington can

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.499
either be the most comforting presence on
screen or the scariest. You believe him as

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:43.860
the famous civil rights activist in Malcolm
X and you fear him as a dirty cop in Training

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.520
Day. He seems to oscillate between hard hitting
drama, and hitting hard in action roles. Denzel

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.620
cites shakespearean dialect in Much Ado About
Nothing with just as much conviction as his

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.030
trash talk on the court in He Got Game. Once
he commands a role, it’s impossible to imagine

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.310
anyone else in it.&nbsp;
Christian Bale

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.419
While it’s now difficult to separate Christian
Bale from his cape that he crusaded in for

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:12.389
three films, at the time of his casting he
was far from an obvious choice. He was best

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.849
known for playing narcissistic serial killer
Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. Apart

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.180
from the similar name, the only thing this
character shared with Batman was a muscular

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.210
physique, which Bale had recently shed to
play an emaciated insomniac in The Machinist.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.340
In addition to his physical transformations,
Bale has tackled just about every genre. His

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.150
most recent Oscar nominated turn in The Big
Short proves that Bale continues to be an

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.460
actor who’s impossible to nail down.&nbsp;
As performers who have continually broadened

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.090
their horizons and tried new things, these
actors all created opportunities for themselves

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.069
that otherwise might not have been there.

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:52.240
the biggest range? Did we miss anyone? Let
