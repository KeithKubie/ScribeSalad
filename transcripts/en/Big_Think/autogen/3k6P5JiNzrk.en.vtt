any of a number of questions and there's

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
any of a number of questions and there's
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.890
any of a number of questions and there's
a sense that if someone goes in and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
a sense that if someone goes in and
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.550
a sense that if someone goes in and
assesses that situation and gives a

assesses that situation and gives a
 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.790
assesses that situation and gives a
biologic dimension to why we do like

biologic dimension to why we do like

those things that somehow it's all
diminished by that and that's that's

diminished by that and that's that's

what we were responsible for was working

what we were responsible for was working
out the functions of each hemisphere you

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
out the functions of each hemisphere you
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.250
out the functions of each hemisphere you
could work with them independent of the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
could work with them independent of the
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.990
could work with them independent of the
other influencing it so you kind of got

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
other influencing it so you kind of got
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.680
other influencing it so you kind of got

the study it alone and over many many
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.439
the study it alone and over many many
years the basic finding is of course

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
years the basic finding is of course
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.670
years the basic finding is of course
that one brain didn't know what the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
that one brain didn't know what the
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.130
that one brain didn't know what the
other one was doing and such people that

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
other one was doing and such people that
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.990

the information doesn't transfer between
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.240
the information doesn't transfer between
the brains we found out that in the left

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
the brains we found out that in the left
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.929
the brains we found out that in the left
brain there's a special system that

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
brain there's a special system that
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.010

seems to always want to explain actions

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
seems to always want to explain actions
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.219
seems to always want to explain actions
and moods that we have after they

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
and moods that we have after they
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.679
and moods that we have after they
occurred so we would put a question to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689
occurred so we would put a question to
 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.859
occurred so we would put a question to
the right non-speaking hemisphere and it

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
the right non-speaking hemisphere and it
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.380
the right non-speaking hemisphere and it
in effect would direct the left hand to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
in effect would direct the left hand to
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.920
in effect would direct the left hand to
do something and so the patient would do

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
do something and so the patient would do
 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.440
do something and so the patient would do
that and then we would simply say to the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
that and then we would simply say to the
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.840
that and then we would simply say to the
patient well why did you do that the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
patient well why did you do that the
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.840
patient well why did you do that the
patient would make up a story that would

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850
patient would make up a story that would
 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789
patient would make up a story that would
explain why their hand had done one

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
explain why their hand had done one
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.230
explain why their hand had done one
thing and why the other hand had done

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
thing and why the other hand had done
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.620
thing and why the other hand had done
another thing and wove a tale that made

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630
another thing and wove a tale that made
 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.260
another thing and wove a tale that made
coherent the as it were the behaviors

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
coherent the as it were the behaviors
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.850
coherent the as it were the behaviors
that are coming from all these separate

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860
that are coming from all these separate
 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.639
that are coming from all these separate
brain areas the behavior comes out and

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649
brain areas the behavior comes out and
 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.139
brain areas the behavior comes out and
then there's this little narrator up

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149
then there's this little narrator up
 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.209
then there's this little narrator up
there that turns it into a story that

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219
there that turns it into a story that
 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.940
there that turns it into a story that
makes this feel coherent and unified

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950
makes this feel coherent and unified
 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.200
makes this feel coherent and unified
turns out it's a thing in the left

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
turns out it's a thing in the left
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.539
turns out it's a thing in the left
hemisphere it does this and we called it

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
hemisphere it does this and we called it
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.709
hemisphere it does this and we called it
the interpreter and it's a very powerful

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719
the interpreter and it's a very powerful
 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.990
the interpreter and it's a very powerful
force in the human condition and it's

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
force in the human condition and it's
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.600
force in the human condition and it's
always trying to figure out and seek

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
always trying to figure out and seek
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.180
always trying to figure out and seek
explanations for

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190
explanations for
 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.580
explanations for
our behavior that's that's what it does

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590
our behavior that's that's what it does
 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.630
our behavior that's that's what it does
I think the the human as the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640
I think the the human as the
 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.670
I think the the human as the

it is because this system is continually

it is because this system is continually

it is because this system is continually
trying to keep the story coherent and

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040
trying to keep the story coherent and

trying to keep the story coherent and
even though these actions may be coming

action is produced and then do you have

it could it be as some people have

it could it be as some people have

it could it be as some people have
suggested could it be that that prepares

us for unexpected things that happen in

us for unexpected things that happen in
 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.210
us for unexpected things that happen in
our life because we've already thought

our life because we've already thought

our life because we've already thought
about them in our fantasy world and are

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110
about them in our fantasy world and are
 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.840
about them in our fantasy world and are
are right about them in a fictitious

are right about them in a fictitious

are right about them in a fictitious
setting and saw how those characters

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550
setting and saw how those characters
 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.400
setting and saw how those characters
acted and so then when we're confronted

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410
acted and so then when we're confronted
 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.650
acted and so then when we're confronted
with it we're ready we've we've sort of

why do we like that stuff well maybe

why do we like that stuff well maybe
 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.900
why do we like that stuff well maybe
that's a reason why we like it and to

that's a reason why we like it and to

that's a reason why we like it and to
think of all of those things seems to me

just to make it all richer a richer
