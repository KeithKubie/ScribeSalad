00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.860
So how do we know
that there is a core,

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.470
and that the core is made
up of a liquid outer core

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.220
and a solid inner core?

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.610
And the answer there comes
from the same technique

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.780
that we saw Mohorovicic use
in 1909 to essentially see

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.430
the behavior, or when you
measure the seismic waves,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.780
or whether you can even
measure the seismic waves,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.100
the different distances
from an earthquake.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.120
So if there's an
earthquake right here.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.040
We're calling that zero degrees.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.090
Let's remember a
couple of things here.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.550
Let's remember that P-waves
can travel through anything.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.316
They can travel through solid or
liquid or air for that matter.

00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:38.815
So they can travel
through anything.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.770
But S-waves, S for secondary,
these are the transverse waves,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.460
these can only travel
through solids.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.600
So it turns out that if
an earthquake happens

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.420
at zero degrees, and you
had seismograph stations

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.620
all over the world, and
these are extremely sensitive

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.180
in order to be able to measure
earthquakes that are happening

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.140
thousands of kilometers
away, it turns out

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.582
that there's something called
an S shadow, an S-wave shadow.

00:01:11.582 --> 00:01:13.540
If these are S-waves you
can measure them here.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.580
You can measure them here.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.996
They can go all
the way over here.

00:01:15.996 --> 00:01:17.180
They can go over here.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.930
They can go over there.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.600
You can measure them over here.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.790
So you could measure them
at all of these points,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.514
but then all of a
sudden at 105 degrees,

00:01:26.514 --> 00:01:28.180
and so we're measuring
zero degrees here

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.930
and we're going
outwards like that,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.140
all of a sudden at 105
degrees and further

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.930
you stop measuring S-waves.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.830
For some reason you would
think that some of the S-waves

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.980
would get over here, maybe they
would be a little bit weaker,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.190
but they would be able to
get all the way over here.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.050
But they just abruptly stop.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.540
No more S-waves.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.500
So in this whole area right
over here you get no S-waves.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.400
And obviously I could
flip this picture over

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.858
and you would see
a symmetric thing

00:01:56.858 --> 00:02:00.860
on the other side of the globe
that all of this area over here

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.470
you also would not see S-waves.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.699
You'd only see them from 105
degrees in this direction

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.979
and 105 degrees
in that direction.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.160
And the only reasonable
explanation that we can give is

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.290
that there must be some material
that an S-wave cannot travel

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.200
through that it would have to
travel through to get to these

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.680
points beyond 105 degrees.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.090
And we know that S-waves
only travel in solids.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.880
So the assumption there is
that at some point beyond 105

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.100
degrees it's hitting liquid.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.050
So that's what tells
us that this right here

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.880
is probably a liquid.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.919
It's hitting some
layer that is liquid.

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.460
So that tells us
that there's a core,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.260
and at least the outer part
of that core is liquid,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.360
enough to stop S-waves.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.190
So the S-waves, because
it only travels in solids

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.330
it leads to this S-wave shadow.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.560
And this tells us
that we have a core.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.240
And that core, at least
the outer part, is liquid.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.024
We don't know yet whether the
inner part is liquid or solid.

00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:11.440
Now, the next point
of evidence is

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.190
how do we know that
there's an inner core?

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.140
And we can use P-waves for that.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.480
A P-wave can travel
through anything,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.870
but remember, in general for
the same type of material

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.206
if you get denser material
it's going to move faster,

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.580
so it's going to
refract outwards

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.010
like we've seen over here.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.840
But if it goes into a liquid,
in general, sound waves,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.550
or I should say P-waves, seismic
waves move slower in liquids.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.330
And so the refraction
patterns we

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.760
get when we do measure
from seismograph stations

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.090
around the world is that it
looks like the P-waves are kind

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.230
of doing what you would
expect in the mantle,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.030
but then they're
getting refracted

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.800
as if they're going
to a slower medium

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.660
as they go through
the outer core.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.780
And we see that right over here.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.440
And then they get
refracted again

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.730
to get to some point
on the other side.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.450
Now, that is just what you would
expect if it was all liquid,

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.180
but if you go to stations
that are even further out

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.680
it looks like, if you just look
at the refraction patterns,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.638
and you can now model
this with fancy computers

00:04:14.638 --> 00:04:16.680
and get all the data
points, but you could say,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.019
well, the only way that reality
can fit the data that we

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.060
get based on when
things reach here

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.140
is if the P-waves are
being first refracted

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.656
through the outer core, but
then they're refracted in a way

00:04:27.656 --> 00:04:30.030
that they're going through
denser material, significantly

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.670
denser material
than the inner core.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.040
And then they're just
continuing to refract

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.170
the way you would expect.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.284
So it's really the refraction
pattern of the P-waves.

00:04:41.284 --> 00:04:42.700
And frankly, the
fact that there's

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.800
this what you call
a P-wave shadow.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.060
The P-wave shadow
by itself, all that

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.720
tells you is that kind
of roughly crazy things

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.020
are happening
someplace in the core.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.010
But the real way to know that
we have an inner core that's

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.990
solid, as opposed to the
whole thing being liquid,

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.870
is that the P-waves
is the pattern

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.520
of when and how
the P-waves reach

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.220
essentially the other
side of the globe.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.060
And then you can kind
of, based on modeling

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.054
how waves would travel
through different densities

00:05:11.054 --> 00:05:12.970
and different types of
mediums, you could say,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.867
well, there's got to be an
inner core right over here.

00:05:15.867 --> 00:05:18.200
And obviously, it's a lot
more math than I'm going into.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.146
But if you do the math
based on the shadow,

00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:21.770
and you know the
speed of the material,

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.394
and all of that type
of thing, then you

00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:28.340
can figure out the depth at
which these transitions occur.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.400
We know that we have a
transition from mantle

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.590
to outer core here.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.380
And then a transition from
outer core to core there.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.650
So hopefully that
satiates your questions

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.450
about how do we know what
the composition of the earth

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.080
is without ever having
to dig down there,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.472
because we've never even
gotten below our crust.
