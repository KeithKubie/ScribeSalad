00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.980
Take a second and
scope out your competition.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.850
What monetization methods do
they implement most often?

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.690
In your searching, have you also
found any hidden competitors?

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.590
And, by hidden, we mean companies that
might be fighting on the same budget as

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.970
you, but offering a different service.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.920
This might require you to get a little
bit creative in your search terms.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.440
Maybe getting very specific or

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.520
drilling down to page two or
three of the results.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.760
But seeing what people in the same
monetary class are doing to monetize,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.980
is a great way to get ideas for
your own product.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.000
When researching your competitors,
take a moment and jot down the pros and

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
cons to their approaches
to monetization.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.130
