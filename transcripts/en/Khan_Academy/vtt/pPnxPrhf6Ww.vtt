00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.433
Voiceover:Kenny interviewed
freshmen and seniors

00:00:02.433 --> 00:00:03.301
at his high school,

00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:07.700
asking them how many pieces
of fruit they eat each day.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.968
The results are shown
in the 2 plots below.

00:00:10.968 --> 00:00:13.366
The first statement
that we have to complete

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:16.036
is the mean number of
fruits is greater for,

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.312
and actually, let me go
down the actual screen,

00:00:18.312 --> 00:00:19.366
is greater for,

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.435
we have to pick between
freshmen and seniors.

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:24.174
Then they said the mean is a good measure

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:26.366
for the center of distribution of,

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.500
and we pick either freshmen or seniors.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.646
Let me go back to my scratch pad here,

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:32.786
and let's think about this.

00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:34.500
Let's first think about the first part.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.767
Let's just calculate the mean

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.633
for each of these distributions.

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:42.033
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:44.700
and try to calculate it out on your own.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.233
Let's first think about
the mean number of fruit

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:47.100
for freshmen.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.167
Essentially, we're just going to take

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:49.700
each of these data points,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.233
add them all together,

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:52.974
and then divide by the
number of data points

00:00:52.974 --> 00:00:54.100
that we have.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.902
We have one data point at 0.

00:00:56.902 --> 00:00:58.700
We have one data point at 0,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.233
so I'll write 0.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:04.233
And then we have two data points at 1,

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:07.833
so we could say plus 2 times 1.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:11.033
And then we have two data points at 2,

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:14.771
so you write plus 2 times 2.

00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:17.368
And then, let's see, we
have a bunch of data.

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:19.768
We have four data points at 3,

00:01:19.768 --> 00:01:21.700
so we could say we have four 3s.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.100
Let me circle that.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.300
So we have four 3s,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.033
plus 4 times 3.

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:33.700
And then we have three 4s,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.300
so plus 3 times 4.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.167
And then we have a 5,

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:42.100
so plus 5,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.033
and then we have a 6.

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:45.700
Let me do this in a
color that you can see.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.774
And then we have a 6 right over here,

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:48.967
plus 6.

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:50.833
How many total points did we have?

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:59.523
We had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

00:01:59.523 --> 00:02:00.490
oh, actually, be careful.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.766
We had 15 points and I
didn't put that one in there.

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:04.568
Actually, let me just ...

00:02:04.568 --> 00:02:06.566
So we have 15 points,

00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:08.566
and I can't forget this one over here,

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:09.900
so plus ...

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.700
my pen is acting a little funny right now,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.168
but we'll power through that,

00:02:13.168 --> 00:02:17.248
plus 19.

00:02:17.248 --> 00:02:18.900
So what is this going to be?

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.900
This is just going to be 0.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.566
This is going to be 2.

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:24.166
This is going to be 4.

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:25.901
This is going to be 12.

00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:27.101
My pen is really acting up.

00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:28.700
It's almost like it's
running out of digital ink

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.033
or something.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.301
This is going to be another 12,

00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:34.033
and then we have 5, 6, and 19.

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:34.833
So what is this going to be?

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:38.101
2 plus 4 is 6,

00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:40.304
plus 24 is 30,

00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:44.233
plus 11 is 41,

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:48.233
plus 19 gets us to 60.

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:51.166
60 divided by 15 is 4,

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:53.531
so the mean number of fruit per day

00:02:53.531 --> 00:02:57.034
for the freshmen is 4
pieces of fruit per day.

00:02:57.034 --> 00:02:58.434
This right over here,

00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:01.500
that right over there
is our mean for the ...

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.366
Let me put that in a color
that you can actually see.

00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:07.366
Now let's do the same
calculation for the seniors.

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:10.100
We have one data point where they didn't

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.515
eat any fruit at all each
day, not too healthy.

00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:15.038
Then you have one 1,

00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:16.300
so I'll just write that as,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.034
we could actually write that as 1 times 1,

00:03:18.034 --> 00:03:19.633
but I'll just write that as 1.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.700
Then we have two 2s,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.100
so plus 2 times 2.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.768
Then we have one, two
, three, four, five 3s,

00:03:29.768 --> 00:03:32.166
five 3s,

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:35.433
so plus 5 times 3.

00:03:35.433 --> 00:03:41.233
And then we have three 4s,

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:44.233
so plus 3 times 4.

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:48.900
And then we have two 5s,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.433
plus 2 times 5,

00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:53.767
and then we have a 6.

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.167
We have a 6,

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:56.634
plus 6,

00:03:56.634 --> 00:03:58.100
and we have a 7,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.233
someone eats 7 pieces of fruit each day,

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:02.433
a lot of fiber,

00:04:02.433 --> 00:04:03.967
plus 7.

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:06.766
And now, how many data points did we have?

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:14.433
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:16.366
16 data points.

00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:20.235
So we're going to divide this by 16.

00:04:20.235 --> 00:04:21.566
So what is this going to be?

00:04:21.566 --> 00:04:22.900
This is just 0.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.500
Let's see.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.712
This is, just right over, that's 0.

00:04:25.712 --> 00:04:27.847
This is 4.

00:04:27.847 --> 00:04:30.100
This is 15.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.572
This is 12.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.567
This is 10.

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:38.233
So we have 1 plus 4 is 5 plus 15 is 20

00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:40.100
plus 12 is 32

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.384
plus 10 is 42.

00:04:43.384 --> 00:04:47.100
42 plus 6 is 48,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.848
48.

00:04:48.848 --> 00:04:50.034
Am I doing ...

00:04:50.034 --> 00:04:54.839
42 plus 6 is 48 plus 7,

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:57.366
48 plus 7 is 55.

00:04:57.366 --> 00:04:58.034
Did I do that right?

00:04:58.034 --> 00:04:58.900
Let me do that one more time.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.307
1 plus 4 is 5

00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:01.966
plus 15 is 20,

00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:04.634
32, 42.

00:05:04.634 --> 00:05:07.034
42 plus 13 is 55.

00:05:07.034 --> 00:05:13.166
So this is equal to 55 over 16,

00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:15.100
which is the same thing as, let's see,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.900
that's the same thing as 3 and 3 that ...

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.566
3 times 16 is 48,

00:05:22.566 --> 00:05:26.300
so 3 and 7/16.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.434
So the mean for the seniors, 3 and 7/16,

00:05:33.434 --> 00:05:34.700
that's right around ...

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.966
let's see.

00:05:34.966 --> 00:05:36.900
This is 3, that's 4, so 7/16,

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.512
it's a little less than a half.

00:05:39.512 --> 00:05:42.834
It's right around there.

00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:45.966
So the mean number of
fruits is defnitely greater

00:05:45.966 --> 00:05:47.100
for the freshmen.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.689
They have 4 ...

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:51.368
Their mean number of
fruit eaten per day is 4

00:05:51.368 --> 00:05:53.633
versus 3 and 7/16.

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:54.633
The mean is a good measure

00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:57.100
for the center of the distribution of.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.792
So when we think about whether
it's freshmen or seniors,

00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:05.633
the mean is fairly sensitive
to when you have outliers here.

00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:07.233
For example, someone here was eating

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.633
19 pieces of fruit per day.

00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:12.433
That's an enormous amount of fruit.

00:06:12.433 --> 00:06:13.767
They must be only eating fruit.

00:06:13.767 --> 00:06:15.914
You can imagine if it
was even a bigger number,

00:06:15.914 --> 00:06:18.100
if someone was eating 20
or 30 pieces of fruit,

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.433
just that one data point will
skew the entire mean upwards.

00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:24.233
That wouldn't be the effect on the mode

00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:25.900
because the mode is a middle number.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.173
Even if you change this one point

00:06:27.173 --> 00:06:28.507
all the way out here,

00:06:28.507 --> 00:06:31.300
it's not going to change
what the middle number is.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.766
So the mean is more
sensitive to these outliers,

00:06:34.766 --> 00:06:35.966
to these really,

00:06:35.966 --> 00:06:37.700
these points that are really, really high,

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.834
really, really low.

00:06:38.834 --> 00:06:42.302
And because the seniors don't seem to have

00:06:42.302 --> 00:06:43.900
any outliers like that,

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.700
I would say that the
mean is a good measure

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.634
for the center of
distribution for the seniors,

00:06:48.634 --> 00:06:50.989
or a better measure for
the center of distribution

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:52.286
for the seniors.

00:06:52.286 --> 00:06:54.289
Let's fill both of those out.

00:06:54.658 --> 00:06:58.369
The mean number of fruit is
greater for the freshmen,

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:00.435
and the mean is a good measure

00:07:00.435 --> 00:07:05.366
for the center of
distribution for the seniors.

00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:06.439
You actually even see it here.

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:09.302
We saw that the mean number
for freshmen was at 4,

00:07:09.302 --> 00:07:12.100
but if you just ignored
this person right over here

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.233
and just you thought about the bulk

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:15.100
of this distribution right over here,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.184
4 really doesn't look
like the center of it.

00:07:17.184 --> 00:07:19.966
The center of it looks closer to 3 here.

00:07:19.966 --> 00:07:21.567
What happened is this one person

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:23.766
eating 19 pieces of fruit per day

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:25.500
skewed the mean upwards.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.033
While here, that 3 and
7/16 really did look closer

00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:30.967
to the actual distribution,

00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:31.900
closer to the ...

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.960
actually, I shouldn't say ...

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.968
I mean in both times,

00:07:33.968 --> 00:07:35.300
we actually did calculate the mean

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.033
of the actual distribution.

00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:38.900
But here, since there's no outliers,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.700
it does seem the mean
seemed much closer to,

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.702
I guess you could say
the middle of this pile

00:07:44.702 --> 00:07:45.967
right over here.

00:07:45.967 --> 00:07:47.180
Let's check our answer,

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.800
and we got it right.
