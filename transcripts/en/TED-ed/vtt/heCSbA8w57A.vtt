00:00:06.713 --> 00:00:10.030
Imagine a police lineup
where ten witnesses

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.631
are asked to identify a bank robber
they glimpsed fleeing the crime scene.

00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:18.274
If six of them pick out the same person,

00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:21.204
there's a good chance 
that's the real culprit,

00:00:21.204 --> 00:00:23.015
and if all ten make the same choice,

00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:25.209
you might think the case is rock solid,

00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:27.255
but you'd be wrong.

00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:29.728
For most of us, 
this sounds pretty strange.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:34.693
After all, much of our society
relies on majority vote and consensus,

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:35.693
whether it's politics,

00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:36.693
business,

00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:37.751
or entertainment.

00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:42.030
So it's natural to think
that more consensus is a good thing.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.863
And up until a certain point, 
it usually is.

00:00:44.863 --> 00:00:48.986
But sometimes, the closer you start to get
to total agreement,

00:00:48.986 --> 00:00:52.590
the less reliable the result becomes.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.032
This is called the paradox of unanimity.

00:00:56.032 --> 00:00:58.347
The key to understanding 
this apparent paradox

00:00:58.347 --> 00:01:01.894
is in considering the overall level 
of uncertainty

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:05.783
involved in the type of situation 
you're dealing with.

00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:09.936
If we asked witnesses to identify
the apple in this lineup, for example,

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:13.389
we shouldn't be surprised 
by a unanimous verdict.

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:17.500
But in cases where we have 
reason to expect some natural variance,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.334
we should also expect varied distribution.

00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:23.460
If you toss a coin one hundred times,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.156
you would expect to get heads
somewhere around 50% of the time.

00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:31.541
But if your results started 
to approach 100% heads,

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:34.177
you'd suspect that something was wrong,

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:35.972
not with your individual flips,

00:01:35.972 --> 00:01:39.001
but with the coin itself.

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:43.806
Of course, suspect identifications aren't
as random as coin tosses,

00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:48.339
but they're not as clear cut 
as telling apples from bananas, either.

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:54.203
In fact, a 1994 study found 
that up to 48% of witnesses

00:01:54.203 --> 00:01:56.967
tend to pick the wrong 
person out of a lineup,

00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:00.312
even when many 
are confident in their choice.

00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:03.788
Memory based on short glimpses
can be unreliable,

00:02:03.788 --> 00:02:07.204
and we often overestimate 
our own accuracy.

00:02:07.204 --> 00:02:08.164
Knowing all this,

00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:12.093
a unanimous identification starts to seem
less like certain guilt,

00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:14.705
and more like a systemic error,

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:17.024
or bias in the lineup.

00:02:17.024 --> 00:02:21.013
And systemic errors don't just appear
in matters of human judgement.

00:02:21.013 --> 00:02:23.364
From 1993-2008,

00:02:23.364 --> 00:02:28.835
the same female DNA was found 
in multiple crime scenes around Europe,

00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:34.433
incriminating an elusive killer
dubbed the Phantom of Heilbronn.

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:40.233
But the DNA evidence was so consistent
precisely because it was wrong.

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:43.963
It turned out that the cotton swabs
used to collect the DNA samples

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:50.045
had all been accidentally contaminated
by a woman working in the swab factory.

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:54.194
In other cases, systematic errors arise
through deliberate fraud,

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:59.218
like the presidential referendum held
by Saddam Hussein in 2002,

00:02:59.218 --> 00:03:06.368
which claimed a turnout of 100% of voters
with all 100% supposedly voting in favor

00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:09.456
of another seven-year term.

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:10.839
When you look at it this way,

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:15.121
the paradox of unanimity isn't actually
all that paradoxical.

00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:18.244
Unanimous agreement 
is still theoretically ideal,

00:03:18.244 --> 00:03:23.588
especially in cases when you'd expect very
low odds of variability and uncertainty,

00:03:23.588 --> 00:03:24.557
but in practice,

00:03:24.557 --> 00:03:29.058
achieving it in situations where 
perfect agreement is highly unlikely

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:34.180
should tell us that there's probably
some hidden factor affecting the system.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.018
Although we may strive for harmony
and consensus,

00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:42.159
in many situations, error and disagreement
should be naturally expected.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.696
And if a perfect result seems too good
to be true,

00:03:44.696 --> 00:03:46.343
it probably is.
