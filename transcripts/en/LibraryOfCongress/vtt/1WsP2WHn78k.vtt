00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.950 position:66%
&gt;&gt; This is Cheryl Lederle from the Library
of Congress and I welcome you to this,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.330
our second annual online
conference for teachers.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.680 position:73%
And it is my pleasure to welcome Sherry Levitt.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.210 position:69%
Sherry is the Executive Director of Teaching
with Primary Sources, northern Virginia,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.580
delivering professional development

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.240
to K16 educators throughout
the commonwealth of Virginia.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.690 position:72%
Prior to her current work, Miss Levitt was the
high school English Language Arts Curriculum

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.130 position:70%
Specialist for Fairfax County Public Schools.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.540 position:61%
She holds an advanced degree in English
with 25 years of classroom experience

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.210
as a teacher and department chair.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.360
And Sherry, we are delighted
to welcome you, this afternoon,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.680 position:63%
to share your knowledge and experiences.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.290
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.570 position:61%
I'm just so glad to be with you, today.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.930 position:67%
I hope everybody's comfortable, settled in,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.710
and that we'll have some useful
and enjoyable time together.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.350 position:73%
From my many years as an English and Humanities
teacher, I know and I think you'd agree,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.280
that students love a great story,
particularly if it really happened.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.110
I think the true stories embedded

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.410 position:64%
in primary sources offer irresistible
invitations to students to find out more.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.020
And along the way learn good habits
of scholarship and attribution.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.500
And really, that's at the heart
of my presentation, tonight.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.590 position:69%
I'm going to model an approach to student
inquiry and research that captures the theme

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.060 position:63%
of this year's conference, ''Discovering

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.970
and Exploring Primary Sources
from the Library of Congress''.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.730 position:72%
And I hope we'll look at some intriguing
stories from one year in our nation's history.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.730 position:56%
So, the primary source images you'll
be seeing, are all hyperlinked.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.260
So, you can find your way
back to anything to interest.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.530 position:75%
And the images come primarily from the prints
and photographs collection, historic newspapers,

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.820 position:63%
and their very excellent teacher's page,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.620
that has easy access educational
resources for all of us.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.120 position:64%
And throughout this presentation, please,
I welcome your reflections and ideas

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.660 position:64%
and maybe you've tried something similar.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.540
Suggest adaptations.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.240
I'd love to hear from you.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.860 position:58%
From a student's perspective, I think
history can be so confusing and it's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.510 position:70%
like a puzzle, maybe, with a thousand pieces.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.520 position:63%
And I think confining an investigation
to some of the events from just one year

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.770
in our history can act as a
sorting mechanism, and then,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.080 position:75%
as a mirror reflecting forward to our own times.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.920 position:58%
So, here's the challenge [inaudible].

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.210 position:63%
I like project based learning very much,

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.760
and I have incorporated some
of the ideas in this model.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.100 position:72%
And I've issued, here, a challenge to students

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.460
to investigate the events
of one year in history.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.700 position:59%
And then, match with primary sources
and make connections to our own times.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.320
And please note the date
on the photograph, there.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.460 position:69%
And perhaps, you're in that same comfortable
lounging position, as we're working here.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.280
So, the role of the teacher
in this project idea,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.670
is to decide the course standards
and learning goals.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.640 position:69%
And really, to develop the plans in advance,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.430 position:73%
so that once the challenge has been issued the
teacher acts more in the role of a facilitator.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.420 position:61%
But really, there's a lot of deliberate
design in structures, routines,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.600
and guidelines that push students
toward completion of the project,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.970
encapsulating course standards,
skills, and learning goals.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.940
So, a very deliberate building of
this before it even gets under way.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.040
A good approach, is to provide rule
[inaudible] and graphic organizers

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.090
for the important steps and
always with flexibility.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:14.940 position:59%
Because adjustments will
inevitably, requires some flexibility.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.250 position:67%
And of course, a teacher ensures balance by
requiring focus on a variety of categories,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.450
but across a broad spectrum
of categories, please.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:30.600 position:75%
So, there's cultural, social, political,
economic, scientific, environmental, categories,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.480
so that the project doesn't just
become one year [inaudible].

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.230 position:64%
And of course, analyzing primary sources.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.670
And we'll talk about a good
way to do that in just a bit.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:50.000 position:69%
And to go deeper than just having the
primary sources simply illustrate the event.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.730
And throughout, the teacher
works with students conferring,

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.650 position:59%
supporting, differentiating as needed.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.740
And assessing at every step,
keeping students on track.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.080
These assessments could be
daily logs, journal entries,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.900 position:69%
peer evaluation, exit tickets, focus groups.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.430
You probably have some more ideas.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:17.330 position:73%
And certainly, a detailed bibliography would
be an important part of a summative assessment.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.900
And I'd also like to recommend
some flexibility in date range.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.810
And I've done that, here.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.020
I've taken a few liberties.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.940 position:59%
Sometimes, a bibliographic record of
a primary source isn't all that clear.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.500 position:61%
And every single item at the Library of
Congress does come with a bib record.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.770
But sometimes a specific
date is a little nuanced.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.430
And the role of the student.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.170 position:69%
The student chooses a year, far enough
removed in time so that they would be likely

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.100
to have sufficient primary sources,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.860
even from the world's largest
library, to avoid frustration.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.530 position:58%
And also, time to investigate several
choices before a final decision.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.770 position:58%
So, it goes without saying, that each
group should have a different year.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:15.620 position:73%
And the teacher should ensure that students can
identify a primary versus a secondary source.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.650
And also, the various formats in
which primary sources can come.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.160
And to think about the skills
they are developing as they work

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.720 position:67%
through the steps toward the final product,
of collaboration, critical thinking,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.990
problem solving, and building
content knowledge, as well.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:41.200 position:75%
So, in project based learning an audience, which
ideally includes people outside the classroom,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.360
is a wonderful idea, maybe
parents, teachers, specialists,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.280
and the final project options
can take many forms.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:56.960 position:72%
Magazines with articles, poems, political
cartoons, performances, website design, video.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.520 position:75%
And during their presentation, their public
presentations, student groups should be prepared

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.200
to share and discuss their choices.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.930
To process and field questions
from the audience with attention

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.820
to good oral communications skills.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:20.170 position:64%
So, you might have guessed, I have
chosen 1920 to model how this might look.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.290 position:70%
I've always been interested about the concept
of decades, as if somebody flips a switch,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:30.150 position:66%
and suddenly, it's the Gilded Age, the
Roaring Twenties, or the Great Depression.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.920 position:66%
I mean, every year has significant events.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.040
Some more than others.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.570
And the question for students,
again, is why is the year,

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.970 position:73%
whatever they choose, important in our history?

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.040 position:64%
And how does it connect to our own times?

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.530 position:63%
So, listed on the slide are some of the
people, events, and places I encountered

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.980 position:64%
as I consulted secondary source material.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:58.420 position:59%
And perhaps, you are familiar with the
term Zeitgeist, or the defining spirit

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:04.370 position:59%
or mood of a particular period, excuse
me, period of history that's reflected

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.450 position:58%
in the ideas and beliefs of the time.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.190 position:66%
And that's another aspect of this project,
to capture some of that zeitgeist we need

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:16.590
to develop empathy for the
real people living back then.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:21.970
So, from the students' point of
view, where would I look to begin?

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.990 position:63%
Probably timelines would be a good idea.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:29.220 position:56%
And if you were a student, how would
you start the process of finding

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.270
out about the events of one year?

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.550
Well, for timelines, a caveat.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.300
Because like so much else
students encounter on the internet,

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.710
timelines may be selective,
and not entirely free of bias.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.720 position:66%
So, students need to source and to verify.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:56.230 position:72%
For example, I kept coming up with this claim.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.920 position:67%
And I'll give you a moment to look at that.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.630
And I couldn't believe that
possibly could be true.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:09.560 position:56%
And yet, when I went to verify it,
I'll give you a moment to read this.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.770
I found this 2013 blog from
the Smithsonian Institution.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:20.100 position:66%
So, the teacher can help the process along
by recommending some reliable timelines

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.150
and requiring citation of
the ones that students use.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.650
So, once they've decided on the
particular events to investigate,

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:32.440 position:67%
they can begin using the Library of
Congress website to collect primary sources

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.840 position:56%
and making contemporary connections.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.520
But after locating a primary
source that looks promising,

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:46.640
how do they begin to really
analyze it carefully?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:53.820 position:75%
The Library of Congress, for many years, has had
this valuable approach, a three-step approach

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.730 position:72%
to analyzing primary sources, which is online,

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.040
with versions customized
in a variety of formats.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:10.950 position:58%
And this is the basic one, with steps
to observe and reflect and question.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.850
The circle in the upper right-hand
corner illustrates

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:21.040
that it's not a linear process,
but really a recursive one.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:27.190 position:72%
So, this primary source analysis tool can help
students generate new questions for research.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.440
Let's see how this works.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.830 position:64%
Let's try it ourselves, with a 1920 image
that I found in Prints and Photographs.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.420
So, please take a moment now.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.740
I'm going to hold you to this.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:46.260 position:73%
For some time, I read somewhere recently, from
James Elkins, who's an art critic and historian

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:54.070 position:61%
from the Art Institute of Chicago, that
people in a museum who visit a museum,

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:59.740
found maybe spent an average of
ten seconds, sometimes up to 17,

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.890 position:58%
looking at an image before moving on.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:07.500 position:75%
And that the Louvre found that people looked at
the Mona Lisa for an average of only 15 seconds.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.430 position:72%
So, let's conduct our primary source analysis.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.750 position:61%
Put yourself in the role of the student

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.090
and please begin listing everything
you see in this photograph.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:20.760 position:61%
Let me hold you here for a full minute,
and see what you can come up with.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.650
Just what you observe.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.740
Okay. I'm calling time.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.080 position:69%
And now, please move on to your reflections.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.450 position:75%
Maybe the background knowledge you already have.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.770
And questions.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.600
You might want to find out more.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.280
And what do you hypothesize?

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.310
What's going on, here?

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.430
What would you like to find out?

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:48.370 position:66%
Well, fortunately, the Library of Congress
has information for us in the bib record.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.600
And I like that.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.550
Men. Seem to be some type of team.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.650
You're absolutely right, Mary.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.630 position:63%
And they're learning the dance, but why?

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.300
New perspective on sport training.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:11:59.850
Excellent.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.430
And that really is very close.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:06.720 position:58%
The title of this photograph is ''The
Charleston as an Aid to the Game''.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.310
Vivian Marinelli is giving
dance lessons to the members

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:15.420
of the Palace Club basketball
team of Washington, DC.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:20.600 position:56%
The subject of jazz and dance crazes
appeared on several 1920 timelines.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:28.570 position:58%
So, I consulted an historic newspaper
collection ''Chronicling America''.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.880
Here it is.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.380 position:59%
This is a great resource for teachers.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:39.620 position:59%
It's a database of historic newspapers
published between 1836 and 1922.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:45.320 position:56%
I used the search engine and the
date range for 1920 to find articles

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.150 position:64%
about dancing, and came up with this one.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.440
Spend a moment to read the
headline from the Chattanooga News,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:13:01.810 position:69%
and please record your reaction to this, and
any contemporary connections you can make.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.460 position:75%
The name of the database is Chronicling America.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:10.150
And Cheryl noted there's a
session on that, tomorrow.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.350 position:67%
And really, I see my colleague Cynthia, is
who I passed beyond the chat and she and I,

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.280
we love this resource when
we work with teachers.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.740
A literation overkill.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.790
Absolutely.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:30.380 position:59%
So, this led me to recommended topics.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.680 position:73%
This is a feature in Chronicling America that's
especially valuable for student research.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:41.110 position:59%
It lists subjects widely covered in
the American press in that date range.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:46.580 position:66%
And it's searchable by alphabetical
listing, subject category, and date range.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.390
It makes for fascinating browsing.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.220 position:64%
It's almost a little dangerous, when
you're supposed to be doing other things.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:58.350 position:75%
But here is where I found the connection
between the dance crazes of 1920 and jazz music.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:04.000
And you can read the little
descriptor at the top.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.650 position:64%
There are the selected best pages on the
topic, as well as background information.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:15.500 position:73%
And dancing was I learned, and jazz music
often described as moral, ugly, and ridiculous.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:20.840 position:70%
And I even found an article from the New
York Tribune that read, ''Jazz is responsible

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:28.330 position:66%
for most of the evils, say teachers.'' And
an aside about these historic newspapers,

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:33.500 position:63%
advertisements talk about the zeitgeist,
wonderful windows into the past

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.050
and a feeling for the time period.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.450
Take a look at these.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.350
Especially that one in the middle.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:43.060
Three examples form 1920,
from the Washington Times

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.970 position:75%
and maybe imagine how your students would react.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:53.770
And what connections we could make
to our own advertising and media.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:56.070 position:58%
The generation gap never does change.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:00.510 position:73%
Every timeline and text I consulted about 1920,

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.510
the 18th Amendment figured
prominently in major events.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:11.710 position:69%
And as you probably know, the 18th Amendment
prohibited sale and transport of alcohol.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:16.840 position:72%
But I learned that the ideas about controlling
alcohol began more than a century before.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.310 position:56%
And that's an interesting story and
a research project for another time.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:27.320 position:66%
And you probably also, recall that the
18th Amendment caused widespread disregard

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:33.400 position:59%
for the law and a surge in organized
crime, before it was repealed in 1933.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.150
And here, we have a photograph,

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.280
admittedly opposed photograph,
but it's still a primary source.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.240
And it's a deputy police
commissioner, John A. Leach,

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:48.270
watching agent pouring liquor
into a sewer, following a raid.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:52.150
And I wonder what connections
you can make to our own times?

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.520
Such a waste.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.860 position:67%
So, here's another interesting photograph
I found, this time, in Chronicling America,

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:05.590
that might spur students to
grapple with some text features.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.620
And practice their literacy skills.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:14.310 position:73%
What words grab your attention to look at this?

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.990
What do we need to find out?

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.240 position:56%
And how are we going to go about it?

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.270
Bootlegs. Absolutely.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.610
Bootlegs. All you have to do
is look at a good dictionary.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:35.250 position:70%
And most agree that a pair of bootlegs refers
to smuggled liquor that's hidden in boots.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:42.120
A czar, you know we think of
czar, an environmental czar,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.320 position:58%
a legislative czar, as a modern term.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:50.470
But here it is, 1920, and the
office of the Prohibition Czar.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:55.940
And we have Miss Hattie Klawans
and then, the caption there.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:04.360
So, I have a bonus crime question
for you, if you recognize.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:09.680 position:70%
I couldn't resist including this man, because
I was shocked that it went so far back.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.230 position:73%
I'm sure you've heard of Ponzi schemes, rather.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:21.250 position:67%
This is a mug shot of Carlo Ponzi, who was
up to shenanigans back at this time period.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.850
I don't think you'd recognize him.

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:30.060 position:56%
And moving on to political cartoons.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.730
Take a look at this one.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:37.700
it really provides a bridge between
the 18th and the 19th Amendments.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:45.910 position:70%
The 19th Amendment was ratified on August
18th, 1920, granting American women the right

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.860
to vote, known as Women's Suffrage.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:56.760 position:75%
And the Library of Congress has extensive
resources on the subject, including this cartoon

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.190 position:72%
from a primary source set on the teacher page.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.060 position:64%
Can you see what's written on the bottle?

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.820 position:56%
The bottle's label says,
''Injustice, intolerance, hypocrisy,

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.730
and that scary genie is tearing
at the woman's banner.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.140 position:66%
And the banner reads, ''Votes for women''.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.310
What's the connection?

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:21.770 position:63%
I think this would be something older
students might puzzle out and interpret.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:24.920
And that is the question.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.800
How are these two issues conflated?

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:34.880 position:64%
You know, some research might reveal
that the groups that supported and pushed

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:44.250 position:70%
through the 18th Amendment might be dangerous
allies, because of the 18th Amendment,

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.970
subsequent problems, and
unintended consequences.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.260
I'm going to move ahead to
make sure we cover more

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.760
of the primary sources we
have on Women's Suffrage.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:02.940 position:70%
Here's sheet music and a poster image from
the primary source set on the teacher's page.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:08.060
It's got sound files, photographs,
letters, and maps.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:13.980 position:56%
And really, it's just a wonderful
aid in helping understand a subject.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.710
And there's also a free eBook
version of student discoveries.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.440 position:58%
And through all of these, you know,
the opportunity to examine persuasion

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.970 position:73%
and propaganda techniques in support of a cause

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:33.570
and how this works today,
how differently, today.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:39.980 position:61%
Wonderful images around the changing
roles and perceptions of women in 1920.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.390
Take a look at the three of
these differing perspectives

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.950 position:63%
and the connections we could make today.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.940
Yes, that's, ''My Little Bimbo''.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.190
That's a sheet music cover.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:20:00.040
The elegant woman at the bottom
poster is smoking a cigarette.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:06.680 position:58%
And the title of this one is, ''Where
There's Smoke, There's Fire''.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.890
And in the middle, a photograph
of a Flapper Girl,

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:15.740
probably an invented image,
for a Flapper, more authentic.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:21.190 position:67%
And where do you think students would think
the name flapper might have come from?

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:25.880
Well, the term ''flapper''
apparently, from what I can tell

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.990 position:69%
in my research, originated in Great Britain.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:35.950 position:70%
Where there was a short fad among young women
to wear rubber galoshes and leave them open

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.880
so that they'd flap as they walked.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.250
And the name stuck.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:47.300 position:72%
And flapper became synonymous with a liberated
young woman, scandalous galoshes, indeed.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:54.810 position:72%
And again, the true line to our times, I think
kids would immediately get the connection

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.150 position:67%
with what is considered interesting, today.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.980 position:63%
And a screenshot of Chronicling America,

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:09.560 position:56%
which I hope you'll go investigate
background information and articles.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.180 position:59%
And I found so much information, here.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.460
Primary source information.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.740
And popular culture, reflected
in the films of 1920.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:24.950 position:72%
You know, a few of the timelines I looked at,
marked 1920 as the rise of the movie industry.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:31.410 position:70%
And a comparison, I think, of today's popular
culture with that of a past year in history,

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:36.750 position:58%
would likely engage students, very
much, and spark inquiry and research.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:40.780 position:67%
And here are some of the library resources.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.400 position:56%
Any resonance with beams and
subject matter in contemporary film?

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.140
I can tell you that I found lots
of pirates and lots of cowboys.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:54.920 position:69%
And that seems to be an enduring popularity.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.460 position:63%
I love this entry from the teacher blog.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:03.990 position:70%
If you have never used it, I highly
recommend it, addressing stereotypes in humor

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:07.820
and historic film clips to view
from the library's collection.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:11.230 position:56%
And that movie poster in the middle.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.780
That's a nice accompaniment.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.540
But capturing cultural norms and
societal values, nothing, I think,

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.630
is as effective as some of
these primary sources.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:28.900 position:67%
And I was fascinated by, ''The Crimson
Skull'', with an all African American cast.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.080
Fascinating lures to research.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.830
I want to find out more,
and imagine you might, too.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:37.670
And in sports.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.810
Here's Babe Ruth at bat,
Garrett is catching in 1920.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:47.250 position:75%
And with the World Series about to get underway,
with historic results, whichever team wins.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.910 position:59%
Here is a terrific photo of Babe Ruth.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:55.180 position:64%
And although the bib record for this
photograph doesn't have much information,

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.780
the page will point to related
resources at the library.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.510
So, there's also opportunities.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:05.640
Here is a primary source set.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:12.890 position:75%
As I read about baseball in 1920, I learned that
Babe Ruth hit a homerun out of the Polo Grounds.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:17.150 position:56%
I learned that spitballs were
allowed, and that the Negro Leagues,

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.940 position:67%
as they were called, were first recognized.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:25.550 position:61%
But for further research, the library's
teacher page has this wonderful set,

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:31.350 position:72%
''Baseball Across a Divided Society'', your
students are likely to find of great interest.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:37.460 position:61%
There's baseball songs, cards, letters,
speeches, as well as information

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.030
about some of the baseball greats.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:42.510 position:59%
Like Roger Maris, Ty Cobb, and others.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.320 position:59%
But what I like about this collection,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.830
it goes beyond simply offering
interesting primary sources,

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:54.320
and looks at our national pastime
through the lens of desegregation.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.420 position:61%
The Jackie Robinson story, for example.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:02.200
And I would be asking students, are
these issues still with us today?

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.320
Are there true lines that
we trace to our own time?

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:12.550 position:69%
And I want to say, here, I know you all may
do some related projects, something similar.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:16.960
And I'd love to hear the
versions that you've created.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:25.650 position:69%
And let's go back to Chronicling America,
where I found the Black Sox Scandal of 1920.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:26.820
Here it is.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.630
Think I've got an arrow.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:30.940
Oop. I don't Okay.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.050
But you can read the headline.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:39.340 position:58%
There. The Black Sox Scandal of 1920.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.160
And really, baseball fans, I
think, would immediately point

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.140 position:75%
to some contemporary scandals from our own time.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:51.820 position:72%
And that's, when I searched by the date range,
I found there were some other very unpleasant

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:58.120
and ominous undercurrents at
work during the year 1920.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.780
And there, the Ku Klux Klan
adding thousands of members.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.690 position:58%
This one's from my home state of
Connecticut, Bridgeport, Connecticut.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.110 position:69%
And I think that headline speaks for itself.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:11.140
I found this, as well.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:17.000 position:67%
My research came across some startling
statistics regarding the growth of the Klan

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.050 position:63%
at its peak, almost five million members
up to, some sources say, eight million.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:27.800
Including members of Congress,
several mayors, and governors.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:33.090
And six years after this
photograph was taken in 1920,

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:38.980
the Klan would hold a massive
parade in Washington, DC.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.240 position:75%
I think that's such an important point, Cynthia.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.200 position:59%
So, it didn't just happen in a vacuum.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.300
You know, how did it happen?

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.550
What were the influences that
led to the rise of the Klan?

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:55.240 position:66%
And again, the parallels to our own times.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.450 position:73%
As the develop their project and presentations,

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.470
students can learn great habits
of scholarship and attribution.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.370
By avoiding Google images.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:09.410 position:58%
Somebody earlier in the chat, pointed
to that would be the, you know,

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.610 position:73%
the natural place that the kids would first go.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:18.030 position:69%
But the Library of Congress, here's a
screenshot of a typical bibliographic record

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:22.920 position:58%
from the library that accompanies the
photograph from the previous slide.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.880
And I know that the print is small.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.220 position:75%
But I especially appreciate the rights advisory.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.950
So, no known restrictions.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.450
No, it's copyright free.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.050
You can use it.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:44.300
And then, also, this is a real boon
to research, citation guide in MLA,

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:49.710
APA, and Chicago style, I believe.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:53.520 position:64%
And this, I was shocked to discover this.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.640 position:59%
I had not known or ever heard of this.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:03.930 position:70%
But apparently in 1920, in Duluth, Minnesota,
three men were lynched on June 15th.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.570 position:59%
Three African American circus workers.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:12.530
And their names are Elias Clayton,
Elmer Jackson, Isaac McGhee.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:17.630
They were attacked and lynched by a
mob, because of rumors circulating

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.060
that they had assaulted and
robbed a teenage girl.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.630 position:66%
Physician's examination revealed no
evidence that any assault ever took place.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.980
But apparently, no one was
ever punished for the murders.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:36.310 position:61%
However, in 2003, the city of Duluth
erected a memorial to the murdered men.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:43.410 position:67%
And I imagine your students would be able
to research and furnish modern day examples

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.640
of this kind of racial intolerance.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.350
And I love Mary Johnson's
[assumed spelling] recommendation

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:52.700 position:59%
to always collaborate with librarians.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.140
I certainly agree.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:01.130
There are other dark undercurrents
during the year 1920.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:07.100
And this time, this one, connecting
indirectly maybe to world events.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:13.540
Again, back in recommended topics,
I read about the Palmer Raids.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:20.710
And this is a paper from Ogden,
Utah, 1920, January third.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.820 position:56%
There had been bombings and strikes.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:29.170 position:70%
And the Attorney General, Alexander Palmer,
set about a campaign to crush suspected reds.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.490 position:61%
And that's how far back that term goes.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:33.590
And anarchists.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:38.310
And thousands were arrested
and hundred deported.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:43.900 position:67%
Some connections to our own times, perhaps.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.080 position:59%
So, a time of high anxiety in America.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.500
And you know, why?

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.150
Why was that?

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:52.580
And Cynthia, that's true.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:53.400
Let me go back.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.910
Cynthia notes the connection to
Russia, right on that same page.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.650
I meant to point that out.

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:05.360
So, the time period, 1920.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.310 position:69%
These undercurrents from the interwar years.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:14.870 position:73%
World War One had just ended two years, before.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:23.060 position:64%
And the sense of loss and devastation was
captured in the literature of this year.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.010 position:63%
Here is some first edition dust jackets.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.180
I'll let you admire those.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.230
And a photograph.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.410
You recognize who that is?

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.710 position:75%
If you said the Fitzgeralds, you would be right.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.050 position:58%
That's Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:45.030 position:70%
The expatriate writers, living in Europe and
following World War One, you probably recall,

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.020 position:69%
became a great force in American literature.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:53.150
And among good books published
in 1920, ''Main Street''.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.290
I don't know if you've read that.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:56.010
Anybody read that?

00:29:56.010 --> 00:30:02.920
Very depressing look at small town
life in America, by Sinclair Lewis.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:09.180
''This Side of Paradise'' was the
debut novel of F. Scott Fitzgerald.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.270
A real sensation.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:19.870 position:61%
And also, his collection of short
fiction, ''Flappers and Philosophers''.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:23.030 position:73%
And you recognize who that is typing, up there.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.630
That's Ernest Hemingway.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:31.640 position:66%
And in 1920, Fitzgerald introduced Maxwell
Perkins, a famous editor from Scribner's,

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:38.370 position:63%
who introduced him, to Ernest Hemingway.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.820
So, I would ask, why were they
called the Lost Generation?

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.520 position:75%
What connections would we make to today, if any?

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:52.100
The book on the left, refers to the
signing of the Treaty of Versailles

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:56.610 position:64%
on June 28th, 1919, ending World War One.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:31:03.290 position:72%
And you can read the title, ''The Greatest
Moment in History'', according to the authors.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:06.870 position:69%
Woodrow Wilson proposed a League of Nations,

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:12.350 position:58%
but debate over the U.S. membership
is captured in the sheet music cover.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.200
It's clever.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.620
I found this very curious jewelry.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.760 position:66%
It's an anti-League of Nations emblem pin.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.860 position:66%
And this would be a good one for students.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.190
I mean, how do we let people
know what we are thinking to.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.640
&gt;&gt; And this is Cheryl.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.690
I've muted Sherry.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.880
I'm not sure that she can hear me.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:36.000 position:73%
But I am obligated to end this session on time.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.630 position:66%
Because we do have another session coming.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.200
&gt;&gt; I see the time is quickly
approaching and I'm ten minutes up.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.370
So, I have enjoyed this very much.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:48.810
And I would love to hear from you.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:53.190
And there's the contact information
where you can reach me.
