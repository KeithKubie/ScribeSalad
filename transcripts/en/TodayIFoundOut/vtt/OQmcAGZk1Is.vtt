00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.170
What Unobtainium really is

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.020
In the 2009 film, Avatar, the events of the
film are set in motion by the desire to acquire

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.580
a rare mineral of unfathomable value known
simply as “unobtainium”.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.450
The unimaginative, seemingly lazy naming of
this mysterious substance drew the ire and

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.390
scorn of several critics, many of whom seemed
blissfully unaware that aeronautical engineers

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.410
and scientists have been talking about unobtainium
since the 1950s.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.050
So what is unobtainium and who named it?

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.800
Although it isn’t clear who first coined
the term “unobtainium”, the first known

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.190
documented case of it appeared in the February
27, 1956 edition of the Marshall, Michigan

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.420
Evening Chronicle where it stated, “The
metal is so hard to come by that the scientists

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.670
have devised a lugubriously-humorous name
for it.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.540
They call it ‘unobtainium.'”

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.540
The next known documented instance occurred
in the 1957 Ohio based newspaper, The Zanesville

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.540
Signal.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.689
In it, Major General William O. Senter, the
chief of procurement and production at Wright-Patterson

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.329
Air Force Base, explained that the Air Force
was currently looking for a virtually weightless

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.600
material that was simultaneously “infinitely
strong” and easy to work with.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.930
Senter went on to explain that this wonder
material also needed to be able to “resist

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.969
any degree of heat” while being “available
at negligible cost”.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.750
The Major General then jokingly added that
although the Air Force had yet to find such

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.600
a substance, they did have a name for it-
“unobtainium“.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.130
Just one year later, in 1958, unobtainium
was officially defined by the Interim Glossary

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.429
of Aero Space Terms as a noun that refers
to:

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.169
“A substance having the exact high test
properties required for a piece of hardware

00:01:57.169 --> 00:02:03.729
or other item of use, but not obtainable either
because it theoretically cannot exist or because

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.299
technology is insufficiently advanced to produce
it.”

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.920
In that glossary, and all subsequent reproductions
of it, the word is listed as being “humorous

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.420
or ironical”, a sort of inside-joke amongst
engineers and scientists.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.270
However, just because the word is often used
jokingly doesn’t mean it doesn’t have

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.810
a useful place in the world of science as
a shorthand way of talking about a material

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.520
that possesses the exact set of properties
you need for a given project, but for whatever

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.050
reason you either can’t get a hold of the
substance or it simply doesn’t exist yet.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.230
In the latter case, it certainly is slightly
more professional sounding than using something

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.810
like the word “thingy” when drawing up
specs and discussing design elements.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.790
But even when the substance already has a
name and very much does exist, “unobtainium”

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.510
is still sometimes used.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.750
For example, during the Cold War, titanium
was sometimes referred to by U.S. engineers

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.500
as unobtainium due to its various properties
being perfect for many aerospace applications,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.480
but almost nobody in the States could get
their hands on any real quantity of it due

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.870
to the Soviet Union controlling most of the
world’s supply at the time.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.820
An example where the unobtainium simply didn’t
exist yet was with the Rockwell X-30, a proposed

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.750
hypersonic aircraft from the 1990s that was
conceived as a “passenger space liner”

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.400
capable of travelling perhaps as high as Mach
25.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.900
For much of the craft’s initial development,
many engineers dismissed the possibility of

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.210
such a craft existing, stating that it would
need to be constructed out of unobtainium

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.730
to have the necessary weight, strength, and
durability requirements, while also able to

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.790
survive continually oscillating between low
temperatures and then being exposed to several

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.880
thousand degrees Fahrenheit as it traveled
at ultra high speeds.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.850
However, shortly before funding for the X-30
was cut (mostly due to budget concerns), this

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.709
particular “unobtainium” was created in
the form of a carbon-carbon composite covered

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.430
with a silicon-carbide ceramic coating.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.870
According to an interview with Dr. Terry Ronald,
the deputy director of materials for the project,

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.389
this substance addressed many of the problems
detractors had pointed out years prior.

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.740
James_Webb_Telescope_ModelFor a more contemporary
example, consider the Integrated Science Instrument

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.699
Module, part of the James Webb Space Telescope
project due to launch in 2018 if there are

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:30.699
no further delays.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:36.130
The ISIM also made use of something referred
to as unobtainium, in the form of a needed

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.810
material that hadn’t been invented yet when
the telescope was initially being designed.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.520
NASA later described this design process as
being like: “building a car chassis without

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.300
a blueprint or even a list of recommended
construction materials.”

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.490
However, they came up with a solution in the
end, creating a “never-before-manufactured

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.439
composite material” capable of surviving
“temperatures that plunged as low as 27

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:18.300
Kelvin (-411 degrees Fahrenheit), colder than
the surface 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.520
of Pluto.”
