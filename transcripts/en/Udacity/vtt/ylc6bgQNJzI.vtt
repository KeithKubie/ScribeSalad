Let's look at these examples ,first let's say you saw a movie with a group of

00:00:03.054 --> 00:00:05.827
friends and you weren't sure how you felt about the movie until you were

00:00:05.827 --> 00:00:08.788
walking out and your group of friends start talking about how much they love

00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:13.906
the movie. And you find yourself liking the movie more and more ,now let's look

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:16.850
at this scenario you walk into a waiting room of an office building and you see

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.840
people writing their daily schedules all over the wall with markers so after a

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.738
while in the waiting room, you pick up a marker and start writing your weekly

00:00:22.738 --> 00:00:29.706
schedule on the wall as well. So is scenario one a normative social influence

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:35.505
or an informational social influence? And same question for scenario two. Write

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:38.278
the corresponding letter in the box for the appropriate type of social

00:00:38.278 --> 00:00:39.429
influence.
