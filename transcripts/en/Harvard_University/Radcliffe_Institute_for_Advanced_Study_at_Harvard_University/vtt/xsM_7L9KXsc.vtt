00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.992
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.990
- Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.877
I just really, first of
all, I want to express--

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:12.710
I'm going to read from
my novel which I just

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.790
finished two nights ago up
in my little office there,

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.110
a five year journey.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.170
And, you know, I just
can't express the gratitude

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.360
I have to the
Radcliffe Institute

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.760
for having given
me this fellowship.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.139
Especially the last couple
of years were very rocky.

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:32.180
A lot of things happened.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.850
And there were some
terrible things

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.820
and some beautiful things,
like a baby being born.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.100
But it was a lot
of interruptions.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.520
So these last three months,
to be able to hole up there

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.040
and get this book together,
have been a godsend.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.740
And, also, I just
have such gratitude

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.230
to the other fellows
at the institute.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.465
Every single presentation I've
been to has been inspiring.

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:55.340
I've learned from it.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.200
I've taken things from it.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.360
In this book, you'll
see this narrator now

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.510
has a childhood memory
of feeding whole walnuts

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.069
to squirrels in Boston Common.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:08.960
And then later on,
when he's trying

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.760
to imagine a meeting in a bar
between his mother and CIA

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.890
director Allen Dulles, Allen
Dulles actually says to her,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.890
I hope you're enjoying
your time here in Boston.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.780
And she says, the other
day in the Boston Common,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.321
we were feeding
walnuts to squirrels.

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:24.562
And so it comes back.

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:26.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.210
This book, how do I
describe this book?

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.100
In some ways, it goes, you know,
Long Night of White Chickens

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.900
was a young man's book.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.500
Now, not a young man looking
back on some of that stuff,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.340
maybe it's sort of fictional
assessing of a life.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.800
It takes place over
a five day period.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.950
Actually, it's stretched
out on a seven day period

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.260
when a narrator,
who has had a life

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.360
in some ways similar
to mine, he's

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.480
come back from Mexico City.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.830
He calls it for the
Lord Jim reasons I did.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.270
He was living there.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.719
But the repercussions
of a crime he'd

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.760
been involved investigating
created repercussions

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.890
for a lot of people,
not just him.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.930
But he'd been warned that maybe
he should get out of there.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.980
And so he moves back,
semi-reluctantly, to New York.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.480
He's had a really rough six
years since a very bad breakup.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.260
He's been utterly
alone for six years.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.360
And he is now 49
and approaching 50.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.850
And he's worried.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.040
And he's sort of thinking
about these things.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.540
He comes from a family-- and
this is a big part of the book.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.380
During this trip, he goes home.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.615
He visits his mother who's
now in a nursing home.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.440
He has dinner the first night
with a girl who's contacted him

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.559
from his high school days.

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.100
He's going to end
up finally visiting

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.439
his sister, various people
who are important in his life.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.230
So he's constantly
having those encounters.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.050
But the way it's written, like,
his life is sort of constantly

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.670
churning through his head.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.872
He's constantly having
to quote, throw,

00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:10.830
you know, "what business
of I have in the woods

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.429
if I'm paying attention to
something outside of the woods,

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:15.220
to keep himself focused
on what he's doing.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.770
He's constantly scolding
himself with that refrain.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.951
And the big event
is that, like, when

00:03:22.951 --> 00:03:25.450
he came back-- he's only been
back in New York a few months.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.450
But suddenly, for the
first time in six years,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.660
there are two women
kind of in his life.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.580
And he's very excited
about that and wondering

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.490
what it's going to mean and
really obsessing on that.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.600
I think it's relatable.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.015
And you hear there's
some really rough part.

00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:42.140
There's a really upsetting
thing I'm going to read.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.540
He comes from a very rough--

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.020
you know, it's about, I think,
the long-lasting effects

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.020
of cruelty on people's lives.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.640
Everyone in his house
certainly suffered a lot,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.090
because of a very,
very violent father,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.010
which you'll be hearing about.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.430
And I think that his sexual
life at the age of 14

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.320
was very badly thwarted by
a terrible act of bullying

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.985
in junior high that you will--

00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:20.860
you hear in the book.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.534
I'm not going to
read about that,

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:23.470
but it's a big
event in the book.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.120
And so it's about, you know,
the trouble with intimacy

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.350
and not being able--

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.940
six years, and he
hasn't been near anybody

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.810
though his life is functional
in every other way, you know?

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.097
So that's kind of
what this is about.

00:04:36.097 --> 00:04:37.680
So I'm just going
to read a few parts.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.040
And if I have to say something
to introduce them, I will.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.500
"What I believe is that even a
seeming lifetime of loneliness

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.740
can end from one day to
the next, even from one

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.600
instant to the next.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.650
You can never have loved
and never been loved,

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.204
or you can have loved and
never been loved back.

00:05:00.204 --> 00:05:01.620
But either of those
conditions can

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.790
be reversed, become
truly loving and loved,

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.290
dismissing for the
moment questions

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.510
about what that actually means.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.660
For the very first time
at 49, does anybody

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.200
believe in such a fairy tale?

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.680
Proust wrote in his novel that
a man through the second half

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.470
of his life might become
the reverse of who he

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.800
was in the first, the reverse.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.030
I believe that, too.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.280
I even carry around a
notebook specifically

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.980
to copy down ideas like that.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.810
I have it right here.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.610
Alain Poitaud at the age of 32
took only a few hours, perhaps

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.740
only a few minutes,
to stop being

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.770
the man he had been up to that
time and to become another.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.030
That's Simenon from The Prison.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.330
From a CÃ©sar Aira novel--

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.290
the phrase, the fantastic
potential for transformation

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.000
that everything has.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.550
He's far from being the first
writer who's noticed that."

00:05:58.449 --> 00:05:59.990
He's always, like,
checking his phone

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.930
to see if, like, a message from
one of these women in his life

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.430
has come in.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.340
So, here, one comes in.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.720
"Lulu hasn't written, but
Jocelyn Quinn, yay, has.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.690
Lady Jo writes, hope
you're having a good trip.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.640
Have you visited
your mother yet?

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.640
Don't forget to bring her
those cookies she likes.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.680
I'd made a mean
joke the other day

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.050
that Jo hadn't thought
funny about it being

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.230
pointless to bring my mother
her usual gift of a tin

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.050
of French butter cookies,
because the next morning she

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.790
wouldn't remember
who'd brought it

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.280
or even that the pretty
Parisian tin on her sill

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.980
was full of those
cookies she loves.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.350
Whatever my mother
remembered later,

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.930
Jocelyn admonished,
she'd feel pleasure

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.030
receiving a gift from
her son and, also,

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.920
when she bit into a cookie.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.850
Anyway, she said, I had told her
my mother wasn't so far gone.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.330
I seem to want to exaggerate
her condition, perhaps steeling

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.920
myself for when
her dementia really

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.960
would become that severe.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.880
You should enjoy her
company and get as much

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.210
out of your conversations as you
can while it's still possible,

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.890
Lady Jo advised.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.530
Give yourself a chance to
escape to the Isabella,

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.060
reads her text message.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.430
And say hello to
Hercules for me.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.230
The Pierra della
Francesca Hercules

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.520
at the Isabella Gardner
Art museum I know means.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.680
It must suck to be a
therapist and suspect

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.160
that everybody looks for encoded
therapy in all your messages.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.010
It would make me want
to be outrageously rude.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.340
Jocelyn, however, is a genuinely
empathetic and thoughtful

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.900
adult, her values and politeness
so deeply ingrained that they

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.480
are the authentic her.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.520
But waking up in her
four-posted antique bed

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.340
was like finding myself in a
Henry James story of old New

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.940
York, one of those singer
sergeant women from the penguin

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.080
book covers lying
naked beside me.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.010
The pewter hued winter
light in the parlor

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.160
floor windows, her
long boom white body

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.430
with protruding hips and
carnation pink nipples,

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.610
dark brown hair, lustrous as
mink spread over the pillow--

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.650
it was the first wasp
woman I'd had sex

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.730
with since the 1980s, that Peace
Corps girl from Wisconsin who

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.160
used to write her motorcycle
down into Guatemala City

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.140
from Momostenango.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.990
But I'd vowed, since
coming back to New York,

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.330
not to racialize my
relationships with women so

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.170
much, a ludicrously
optimistic vow considering

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.970
that I hadn't been
in any relationship

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.780
at all in the six
years since Gisella.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.680
You're a long ago pre-Gisella
Latina, Asian, and [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.902
girlfriends and lovers, where'd
that all get you, Frankie G?

00:08:31.902 --> 00:08:33.120
One thing's for sure.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.510
Not one had a bed as
cozy as Jocelyn Quinn's.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.559
She splurges on bed linens made
in Italy mostly, always freshly

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:44.880
ironed white sheets smelling
deliciously of detergent,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.090
a touch of lavender, goose
down pillows and comforter.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.040
Huddled in her bed
in the frigid air

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.710
of that under-heated
apartment, I felt baked

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.224
into a warm fluffy meringue.

00:08:55.224 --> 00:08:57.390
There are Italian touches
all around her apartment's

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.840
otherwise New England colonial
inn-type furnishings down

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.250
to the pot holders.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.390
Even the bathroom soap
dishes and shower tray

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.254
are by some Milan designer.

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:08.670
She used to have a boyfriend
who was a clinical psychiatry

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.550
professor at the University
of Bologna, lived with him

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.340
there for nearly two years.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.970
And she keeps a doorstop
Piero della Francesca art

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.420
book on the floor by her bed.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.700
Jocelyn couldn't believe
that, despite growing up

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.850
around Boston, I'd never
been to the Isabella Gardner.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.890
I really should go
and see the Hercules,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.810
demonstrate that I'm
thinking of her, that I

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.030
want to try to experience
beauty through her eyes

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.130
and share her enthusiasms.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.230
Jocelyn's the one
I should commit to,

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.450
rather the one I should
commit to pursue,

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.150
since it's not like she's
asked me to commit to her.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.890
She had an especially
cruel breakup

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.570
with her professor boyfriend.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.060
Soon after pressuring
her into agreeing

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.070
to an open relationship,
he fell in love

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.880
with one of his own students,
a girl 25 years younger.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.610
Back in New York, Jocelyn
ended up in a rebound affair

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.540
with a bang on a can cast
member who chased her hard,

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.384
though he was married
five years her junior

00:09:59.384 --> 00:10:01.800
with a two-year-old daughter
he sometimes brought with him

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.389
in the afternoons.

00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:05.430
They'd leave the girl to
watch her Little Mermaid

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.830
video in the basement den
for about the millionth time

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.900
while they fucked
upstairs in the bedroom.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.240
She'd finally put
an end to that one.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.820
Jocelyn owns the bottom
two floors, the parlor

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.210
and the basement with a garden
of a brownstone near Cobble

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.700
Hill's little park and
the Episcopalian church

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.680
where we met on Christmas Eve,
like in some cornball rom-com.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.470
I rent a one bedroom
in Carroll Gardens.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.030
It works out between us.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.370
It's not far fetched that I
could find myself becoming

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.390
a dad in less than a year.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.110
But that could happen
with Lulu Lopez, too.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.710
Can Jocelyn and I cross the
multiple frontiers between us

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.120
and love each other?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.160
Lady Jo, I've come
to understand,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.740
considers me not white.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.500
Lulu thinks of me as
white, an American gringo.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.900
At first, she was bewildered
when I reacted indignantly

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.220
to that assertion.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.300
But, now, she likes
to tease me about it.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.450
[? Mary ?] [? Ann--" ?]
his high school friend--

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.090
"probably still
regards me as a Jew.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.040
Jocelyn asked me if
I were ever to decide

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.960
to see a psychotherapist if it
would have to be a Latino one.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.850
That was during that
long conversation

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.950
we had in a wine
bar when, after I'd

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.350
been telling her some of
the usual painful stories

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.330
about growing up in
my town, but trying

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.960
to be as funny about them
as I could, Jocelyn said,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.440
but Paco, you really didn't
get that calling you monkey boy

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.610
was racist?

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:24.270
Oh, come on.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.620
She exclaimed.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.470
I said, sure.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:33.240
I said, but what if I really
did look kind of like a monkey?

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.070
You know how teenagers are.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.470
She gave me a sternly
skeptical look.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.891
I said, seriously, Jocelyn.

00:11:38.891 --> 00:11:40.890
I've given this a lot of
thought over the years.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.430
And I've concluded that probably
nobody in my middle school

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.830
looked more like a
monkey than I did.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.360
OK, she said.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.130
You have curly hair.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.350
Your ears are not
small, but I really

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.300
don't think you
look like a monkey.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.720
I said, I greatly resent
that you consider curly hair

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.980
a simian feature.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.326
That's a totally false
stereotype, Jocelyn.

00:12:01.326 --> 00:12:03.450
When was the last time you
actually went to the zoo

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.040
and looked at the monkeys?

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.210
Anyway, you left out a certain
chimpanzee facial expression

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.820
that my adolescent
classmates considered,

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.180
I don't think wrongly, to
be characteristic of me.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.550
I let my mouth hang
stupendously open.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.340
Jocelyn brought the back
of her wrist to her mouth

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.110
as if to stifle giggles.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.930
But no, I said, I'm not planning
on seeing a psychotherapist

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:30.090
anytime soon other than you,
of course, off the clock.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.230
But what you're
asking, I went on,

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.420
is if you think only a
Latino could really get

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.770
where I'm coming from, right?

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.570
You're suggesting that
I could be fucked up

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.050
in ways that a so-called Latino
therapist might recognize,

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.300
but that someone
like you might miss?

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.667
Jocelyn, straightening
her stool said,

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:47.500
well, I was just thinking
of how you grew up

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.080
and where you spent most
of your life and college

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.630
and how your last
long relationship was

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.120
with a Mexican woman and
just certain other things

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:55.900
you've expressed.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.769
I think you do identify
as a Latino, Francisco,

00:12:58.769 --> 00:13:01.060
and that it's important to
you even if you do sometimes

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.530
display ambivalence.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.060
I understand that, too.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.560
It's your nature
to resist being put

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.840
into a box, though not always.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.560
Sometimes those boxes provide
some security, am I right?

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.060
I sat there nodding.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.100
And then I said, I guess so.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.880
She lifted her arms around my
neck, leaned forward to kiss me

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.860
and said, plus,
you're the only man

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.940
who's ever hit on me in
church, and I let you.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.500
Wait a sec, I said.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.296
You think my hitting on you in
church was like a Latino thing?

00:13:29.296 --> 00:13:31.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.480
What suddenly
popped into my mind

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.150
was that pair of
buff Mexican twerps

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.720
in the Night of the Iguana, who
danced bare chested around Ava

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.380
Gardner in her hotel
garden, lewdly shaking

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.680
the maracas at her until
she shoos them away

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.680
ordering them to go fetch
Richard Burton's luggage.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.510
And, again, I found
myself contemplating

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.970
this mandatory New
York intelligentsia

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.230
insistence, a not-so-intelligent
intelligentsia insistence,

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.330
on racially or
ethnically categorizing

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.240
and label every damn
thing, every person,

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.670
every artistic or
intellectual or political

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.630
or any other kind of expression,
like putting a brand stamp,

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.460
a Chiquita banana
on every banana

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.580
so that even in the
roses, our painful memory

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.440
needs to be compressed
and segregated

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.650
to such an origin in order
to be coherently discussable

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.540
in the therapist couch.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.360
I know how exasperating
these obsessions

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.180
can sound to people from
places where this pressure

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.420
to identify people and
everything else in this way

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.810
that I so fucking despise
doesn't really pertain.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.360
I wasn't despising
it then, though,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.530
in the wine bar with Lady Jo
before going back to her place.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.410
Because, for once, it was
working to my advantage.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:47.640
Well, I said, it didn't exactly
happened inside the church.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.220
But it started there
when the mass ended

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.500
and I followed
you outside, sure,

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.050
lewdly shaking my maracas.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.510
But I don't think I'd
need a Latina therapist

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.640
to help me understand
why I was hitting

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.320
on a beautiful woman
who was by herself

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.890
in an Episcopalian church on
Christmas Eve, I told her,

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.680
any more than I'd need a Jewish
one to analyze my fucked up

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.750
relationship with my father.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:14.070
It was only seconds later, as I
stared down at the zinc bar top

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.900
while maybe Jocelyn
was considering

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.350
my words, that the realization
fell like a silent ax

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.120
clinging something open.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.814
I looked up and said,
Jocelyn, in that town,

00:15:24.814 --> 00:15:26.230
it was really the
mothers who were

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.530
the bigots more than the kids.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:33.390
Their faces came back to me one
after the other, Ethel Brown

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:37.470
meanly regarding me from
out of her cold cream mask.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.870
The Jewish neighborhood
mothers snubbed by mom

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:43.530
and were jealous of
and feared her beauty.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.170
Mrs. [? Sacco-- ?]
the sultry ignorance

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.180
and that fish-eyed
stare of hers,

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.580
always going around in
summer with blouses knotted

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.040
to expose her midriff,
like she thought

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.010
she was Elly May Clampettoni.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.590
And Mrs. Lucas-- straddling
the spine of her flying

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.170
copy of Portnoy's Complaint.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.340
Really, it was the mothers.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.430
Jo, I told her, my voice rising.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.590
It was [? Ian ?] Brown's
mother, Ethel, who

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.820
gave me the name monkey boy.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.440
Silently, I rebuked myself.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.100
The mothers, but so what?

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.820
Come on, man.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.861
Don't blame the mothers."

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.960
And a little bit about Lulu--

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:26.660
"that night of the snowstorm
a couple of weeks ago,

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.800
Lulu stayed over, though she
said her cousin would be angry.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.140
Even before we
reached my apartment,

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.450
where she'd never
been before, on the

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.030
walk from the pizza
restaurant on Court Street--

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.740
she'd never been to
a pizza restaurant

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.830
either as opposed to an
ordinary pizza parlor.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.440
I'd already fallen a
little in love with her.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.900
Clinton Street and
the falling snow

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.520
looked like a long
straight logging

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.590
road through a
frozen forest, snow

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.880
piled branches, shadowy
white striped tree trunks,

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.010
snow-blanketed parked
cars and trash cans,

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:02.420
the occasional taxi rumbling
past like a Soviet tank.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.839
Behind the trees, lamplight
filled brownstone windows

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.510
as if emanating
from trench pyres.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.579
All this scene through
a gossamer street light

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:15.680
glare caused by snowflakes
splashing into hot watering

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.329
eyes, mine and surely Lulu's,
too, that quiet winter storm

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.460
with its comical intrusions--

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.770
a woman, her
Portuguese water dog

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.940
flopping along behind her
passing on cross-country skis,

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.160
which Lulu also had
never seen before.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.950
The skier cheerfully
called out hello.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.160
And Lulu's voice
chimed back, hola.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.730
On one-way Clinton and the cross
streets in both directions,

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.040
men were riding bicycles,
some with bike lamps,

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.970
the clacking and clinking
of pedals and chains,

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.360
wheels softly hissing
through the snow, hoods up,

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.360
stocking caps pulled low over
dark eyes peering steadily

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.180
ahead, scarves tied over
faces, freezing cheeks exposed,

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.980
leather pizza satchels
balanced atop handlebars,

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.910
and other food
containers and bags

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:09.680
in the baskets, the delivery
men and boys of Brooklyn,

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.140
mostly Mexicanos,
surely some Chapinas,

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.510
Guanacos, Catrachos,
too, bringing

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.280
sustenance to the
people living in all

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.590
those warmly lit brownstones.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.380
[SPEAKING SPANISH],,
Lulu exclaimed

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.990
as we stopped on a corner.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.550
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
flying through the snow.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.050
[SPEAKING SPANISH], I asked?

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:30.510
She grinned up into my
face, cheeks gleaming.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.360
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.436
Lifting her mittened hand and
dropping them to point ahead,

00:18:35.436 --> 00:18:37.310
Lulu said, look how they
go in straight lines

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:41.740
over the snow, [SPANISH],,
bringing food like [SPANISH]..

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.580
Lulu, I love that,
[SPEAKING SPANISH],,

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.030
I said, and put my arms around
her waist, both of us laughing.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.760
That was over a week ago now.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.180
In a shared lexicon,
Mexicans are now [SPANISH],,

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.750
they're [SPANISH] and [SPANISH].

00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:00.260
But Lulu hasn't phoned or sent
the message in three days.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.520
Lady Jo didn't write
last night either,

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.760
but it's my turn to
answer her last message.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.400
I should've at least
texted a sweet good night.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.150
What am I doing?

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.460
Don't tell me it's all
going to crumble now.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.140
No matter what
happens, I'll never

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.080
forget [SPEAKING SPANISH],,
the wild exuberance

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.360
of our lovemaking that
night, the most joyous

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.790
I've felt in years.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.750
I'm willfully conscious
that I have no right

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.330
to put any demands
or any expectations,

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.600
certainly not yet, on a
woman so young as Lulu.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.660
Let's see if I can keep my word.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.150
It's as if I want to be tested.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.640
Almost noon, South Station--

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.130
I'm looking up at the schedule
board for the train's track

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:41.270
number when my phone vibrates,
a text message from Lulu.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.650
It's in English.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.090
[? Tania ?] want
know--" oh, yeah.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:48.260
Lulu works as a nanny.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.470
[? "Tania ?] want know, are
more windows in world or more

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:52.890
children?

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:53.720
So cute.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.790
I tell that my friend
know the answer.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.800
More windows or more
children [SPANISH]..

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.460
I walk out onto
the long platform

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.492
with a bounce in my step.

00:20:03.492 --> 00:20:06.190
[SPANISH] and now this?

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.840
Isn't Lulu a poet?

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.440
Lulu, Lulu is the one.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.410
I don't care what anyone
else says about it.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:15.790
An image of myself walking into
that purposely overheated day

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.100
room on my mother's
floor where I usually

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.710
find her sitting in her
wheelchair sometimes dozing

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.940
like a dormouse, this
superfluidly of ebullience,

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.400
I mean love, sprang from me
like silly spring over [SPANISH]

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.390
and the other dementia and
Alzheimer's sunk old folks,

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.750
perpetually dozing, hunched,
contorted in their wheelchairs,

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.560
faces pale as frozen pie crusts.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.060
Are there more
windows than children

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.050
in the world, or more children?

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.690
As we pull out of the station
through a sunny concrete

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:50.670
ravine, this commuter train,
its grimy steel floor, patched

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.010
and scarred brown
leather seats, reminds me

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.050
of a troop carrier,
namely an East German IFA,

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.050
like the Sandinistas used.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.720
I managed to hitch rides
in the back of a few,

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.000
sitting squeezed on a bench
between young soldiers

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.050
and their AKs, smell of
melon grease, overheated

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:11.820
bodies inside fatigues of heavy
green cloth, overripe sweat,

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.240
and always a slight but
pervasive odor of shit,

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.140
perhaps result of what
constant fear does

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.850
to churning adolescent
stomachs already infected

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.850
with jungle parasites.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.480
But what business
have I in the woods

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.970
when I'm thinking of
something outside the woods?

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.660
My hands, fingers entwined,
dangle between my knees.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.850
Sitting on a train as it
pulls out of a station

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.240
is a quiet rite, a moment
to sit and face the self,

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.130
but not too long a moment.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.970
My hands resemble me
more than my face does.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.460
I'm more recognizable
to myself in my hands.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.920
Every day I look at my hands
much more than I do my face.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.580
I unclasp my hands and
stare down at their backs,

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.920
at the mole in the
middle of the left one.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.710
That young Sandinista
officer, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.890
was convinced it
was a stigmata scar

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:03.090
and wasn't sure my presence
presaged good or bad.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.290
But that was ridiculous.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:07.020
For this mole to be
credible as stigmata,

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.600
you had to imagine people
worshipping at Christ

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.660
dangling from the
cross by one arm.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.360
But in my dyslexia, I've
always relied on this mole

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.940
to tell me which way is
left, where they're trapped

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.880
inside that instant of panic.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.750
Turn left.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.610
I only have to remember
to look for the mole

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.860
on the back of my hand.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.930
These are the knuckles
that crashed into the side

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.890
of my father's head, the second
punch landing harder than

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:36.210
the first as he fell forward,
the appalling sensation of bone

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:39.420
and skin through hair, a
criminal punch in a way

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.800
the first wasn't.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.080
I can never recall it without
feeling a lurch in my stomach.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.180
[? Tania ?] is the
little girl Lulu Lopez au

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.810
pairs for, her parents
are a Mexican opera

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.780
singer and his wife,
a financial analyst.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.000
In a town like ours,
there are easily

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.920
more windows than children.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.580
The house on Wooded
Hollow Road, for example,

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.670
had, let's see, five downstairs
windows, seven upstairs,

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.700
plus the sliding glass
doors onto the porch.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.550
The overwhelming numerical
advantage of windows

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.070
over children in
Boston, New York,

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.670
probably in any Western city,
any city in China or Japan,

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.720
too--

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.980
but what about Lagos?

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.460
What about Mexico City,
more children than windows?

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.800
Or might it be close to a tie?

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.400
Traditional Maya village houses
have one room with mud walls,

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.220
are built from mud packed
with grass and sticks,

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.110
might not even have one
window, just a door,

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:36.040
often a half dozen children
or more living inside.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.070
All over the world, poor
people's residences,

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.290
throughout rural
and village Mexico,

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.200
the southern hemisphere,
are more or less like that.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.950
In the Amazon, well,
in every jungle

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.470
the environment I've been to--

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.720
way more children than windows.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.770
Every child represents infinite
windows, [SPANISH] Lulu.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:53.920
So does love.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.740
Questions open windows.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.540
I thumb these words
into my phone, sit back.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.590
Jesus fucking Christ, that
I just write that corniness?

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.790
Did I just tell Lulu
that I love her?

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.770
Before the train
reaches my stop,

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.620
I quickly type 80% of
the world's children

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.920
live in poverty, so more
children than windows.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.540
They're really not sure.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.290
Moments later I
thumb, miss you."

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:24.750
So this next section,
he's visited his mom

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:25.710
in the nursing home.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.680
And that's been a very
long intense chapter.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.640
And, now, he's going to have
lunch with [? Felly. ?] And

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.630
[? Felly ?] is a girl, who
you've encountered an earlier

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.470
version of her in Long
Night of White Chickens.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.210
She was sent to
live with his family

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:50.290
by his grandmother in Guatemala
when she was 14, basically,

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:54.061
you know, so that she can
go to college and study

00:24:54.061 --> 00:24:56.060
and begin to try to make
herself into a teacher,

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.970
as she eventually
did, the mother here.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.550
The grandmother
in Guatemala, who

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:06.320
actually has more money
than the family up here,

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.570
always sends a girl to
help raise us and help

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.040
with the housework.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.660
And this woman becomes like
a lifelong incredibly close

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.310
person to him, right?

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:18.530
So he's come to visit her now.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.410
He's going to see her
now for the first time

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.390
in several years.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:24.920
He's in a taxi.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.550
"We turn into the expanse of
old Charles River wetlands

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:32.300
filled in to make way for the
industrial zone, high tech

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.442
and online media companies."

00:25:34.442 --> 00:25:35.900
Oh, one other
thing-- and this town

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.860
has changed so much
since he was a boy there.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.290
It used to be a kind of working
class Irish-Italian town.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:46.390
And it's now become a very,
like a lot of the 128,

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.780
you know, suburban
towns around here.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.650
The housing values have
just gone through the roof.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.160
And it's really changed, right?

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.610
"High tech and online
media companies,

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:00.170
the distribution hub
warehouses of box stores

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:01.970
and online marketers--

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.700
the Boston television
studios of a national network

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.810
are located here now.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:09.890
[? Felly ?] asked me to meet her
out there at a sandwich bakery

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.150
cafe instead of in the
square where Gino's, formerly

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:18.240
our town's best and almost only
place to eat, is long gone,

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.300
replaced now by
half a dozen family

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.460
healthy food options
plus Thai and Indian.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.560
The place is nearly empty.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.260
Separate or together, asked
the young counter woman?

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.180
I look over each of my
shoulders and back at her.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.750
Together?

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.960
Oh my god, she exclaims,
clapping a hand over her mouth.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.060
I could have sworn
you were with a woman.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.370
She's college-aged,
lively Irish pug

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.930
face, hedge of
reddish curly hair

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:48.520
down the middle of her head
closely shaved at the sides.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.470
I make a frightened expression.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.070
She giggles.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.806
Believe me, sir,
I'm not on drugs.

00:26:52.806 --> 00:26:54.430
I know this sounds
weird, but the woman

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.320
I thought I saw
standing next to you

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.870
looked like the French
actress in that movie Amelie.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:00.920
You know who I mean?

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.570
I've seen the posters, I say.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.280
Well, I wouldn't complain.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:04.840
Oh, no.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.030
You're sure wouldn't,
she says carefully--

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.820
cheerfully, going to
pour my cup of coffee.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:14.120
I sit by a window
with my coffee.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.664
[? Felly ?] is, what, 62 now?

00:27:16.664 --> 00:27:18.080
But it never matters
how much time

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.180
has passed since the last time.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.060
I always quickly reconnect
with a teenaged girl living

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.490
in our basement
on Sacco Road who

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.260
used to drag me
in front of the TV

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.414
to dance to Shindig!
or American Bandstand.

00:27:30.414 --> 00:27:32.330
Whenever I talk about
[? Felly ?] and the life

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:37.460
she's made with her husband
here, the respect I feel

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.100
makes me reluctant to
pronounce American dream

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.570
with overt irony.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:44.600
But I do anyway, probably
because the only part

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.620
of anybody's life
that's a dream, not just

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.790
a hardworking immigrants,
happens when they're asleep.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:53.060
[? Felly's ?] second
husband, Giorgio Montolivo

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:57.110
is Argentine, from an Italian
family that emigrated there

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.640
after World War II.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.860
He is the head
mechanic at a garage

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.000
that specializes in
repairing imported luxury

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.710
cars in Brookline.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.560
He and [? Felly ?] bought
a small house in our town

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.270
at one edge of the
wooded swamp that

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.540
is bordered on the opposite
side by where the Kirby rubber

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.430
factory used to be.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.290
When [? Felly ?]
and Giorgio were

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.930
in the process of
closing on their house,

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.900
the neighbors circulated
and signed the petition

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.955
that they brought to
the realtor protesting

00:28:25.955 --> 00:28:29.630
that the sale of the
house to Spanish people

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.370
would lower their
own property values

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:33.920
and demanding the
sale be rescinded.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.400
But the Italian-American
realtor, a car buff and soccer

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.160
fan who hit it off with
Giorgio, took a stand.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.310
Still, [? Felly ?] hasn't
spoken a word to those neighbors

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.030
from the day she moved in
until now, not one word.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.610
Their two daughters, both
taller than her parents,

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.456
went to high school in her
town and to good colleges.

00:28:52.456 --> 00:28:54.080
And afterward, Gina
married a young man

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.130
from a prosperous family that
owns several locally famous

00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:59.380
Seafood restaurants.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.480
And the other, Jenny, became
an investment banker married

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.250
to an investment banker.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.590
They live in a house
on the North Shore.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:10.190
They've given [? Felly ?] and
Giorgio four grandchildren.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.880
My sister's relationship with
[? Felly ?] is a bit strained.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.480
Once, when
[? Felly ?] told Lexi,

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.780
you and Frankie really had two
mothers when you were children,

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.450
she says that Lexi
answered, I have one mother.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:25.690
Who was the other one?

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.360
Whenever we meet, [? Felly ?]
retells that anecdote

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.240
as if she's still hurt by it.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.840
But I wonder if
Lexi was just being

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.210
literal and, generally,
didn't understand

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:36.850
what [? Felly ?] meant.

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:38.540
Through the window,
I see [? Felly ?]

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.270
drive into the parking lot
in her blood orange Jaguar,

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:44.900
a late '70s or '80s
model that Giorgio

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:50.000
rescued from scrap at his
garage and beautifully restored.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.340
She crosses the
parking lot sprightly

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:56.090
as ever, pixie hairdo
dyed a dark reddish

00:29:56.090 --> 00:30:00.560
hue, big sunglasses of a
coppery tint, sprightly as ever,

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.230
pixie hairdo dyed
a dark reddish hue,

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.650
big sunglasses of coppery
[INAUDIBLE] lipstick,

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:10.610
tight maroon corduroys, a
waist-length leopard skin

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:11.480
jacket.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.900
Must be fake fur, but who knows?

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.340
When she comes in through
the front door and sees me,

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.050
she puts her hands
out by her sides

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:21.200
and sways her hips like
she's inviting me to dance

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.180
and exclaims, Frankie!

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.190
[? Felly ?] always
greets me like that.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:28.160
Her caramel feature's are
a bit sharper, more drawn,

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.420
but she's the same.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.390
She could easily pass
for a woman in her '40s.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.000
When we go up to order,
the counterwoman's grin

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.420
is rakish as she says,
separate or together, sir?

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.910
She thinks [? Felly ?]
is my wife or partner.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:43.760
I give a cartoonish
wink, answer together,

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.220
and order the meatloaf
sandwich special

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.840
and a bottle of Snapple.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.500
[? Felly ?] has an apple spiced
muffin and chamomile tea.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.404
Back at the table,
[? Felly ?] explains

00:30:53.404 --> 00:30:55.070
that she wanted to
meet out here instead

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.670
of in the square, because
she's fed up with the way

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.730
even the young mothers
in our town stare at her.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.280
The other day, she was in
Walgreens speaking in Spanish

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.630
on her cell phone.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.130
And as she approached
the cash register line,

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.070
she was so provoked
by a women's stare

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.180
that she erupted, excuse
me, do you know me?

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.072
Have we met?

00:31:13.072 --> 00:31:14.780
Then why are you
looking at me like that?

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.790
Does it bother you that
I'm speaking Spanish?

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.560
It's not illegal, right?

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.750
Because [? Felly ?]
laughs, I do, too.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.610
I know Frankie, she goes on.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.900
Every year, this town get
richer and the people get worse.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.800
And she puts two
fingers under her nose

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.590
and lifts it, pulling
her lips up, too.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:33.080
I don't doubt the truth of
that or that the town is

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.250
as white as ever.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:36.560
But I also think that
those young mothers mostly

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.950
see other adults who resemble
themselves day after day

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.140
and never encounter anyone
who looks and dresses

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:46.100
like [? Felly, ?] driving around
in her magnificent old Jaguar.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.890
She clearly isn't
somebody's nanny.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.080
I've finished my
sandwich, but [? Felly ?]

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.140
has only eaten some pinched
morsels of her muffin.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.210
I'm tempted to tell her
about my conversation

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:58.660
with my mother in Green
Meadows yesterday.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.820
But, instead, I ask her what
my parents' marriage was

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.120
like back then during
those first years

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.070
when she was living with us.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:08.900
Did they at least get
along a little better

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.610
back then than they did later?

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:15.330
You'd think I'm doing research
for The Newlywed Game special

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.640
50 year anniversary show.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.700
I'm about to make that joke,
but [? Felly's ?] expression,

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.120
the way she takes off
her sunglasses, stops me.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.290
And her amber eyes,
smallish rimmed in black,

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:30.180
are something both
unsettled and resolved

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.570
shifting from one to the
other inside of a second.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.054
Her voice surging,
she says, oh Frankie,

00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:37.470
what you and your
sister witnessed

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:41.160
in that house no child should
ever have to see and hear.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.730
I know, Frankie.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.960
Lexi was too little
to understand,

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.730
but it was terrible for you.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.280
You were so frightened.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.450
You were always crying.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:54.210
I have no memory of what
she's talking about.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:58.200
I remember standing on my green
sofa by the picture window

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.010
during that first
winter in our town

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.510
when I was recovering from
tuberculosis, to look out

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.370
at the other
neighborhood children who

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.490
came into our snowy yard in
their snow suits and hats

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:13.560
to look at me on the other
side of the glass pane.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.090
I remember crows screaming
across the gray winter sky

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.310
like the flying monkeys
in The Wizard of Oz.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.280
I remember how icicles dangled
from the eaves of the house

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.390
and over the doorstep,
silvery and transparent,

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:30.570
narrowing into long, sharp
points that might break off

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.430
and stab deep down
into your skull

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:35.370
as you stood there ringing
the doorbell desperate to come

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:36.780
in and pee.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.180
But I have no memory of
what [? Felly ?] begins

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.436
to tell me about my parents.

00:33:42.436 --> 00:33:44.310
Twice, your mother tried
to leave your father

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.410
in those days, she says.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.260
Twice, she'd had her bags
packed waiting in the living

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.080
room ready to flee back to
Guatemala and to her parents'

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.330
house again.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.190
Once, she packed for
my sister and me, too.

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:58.920
But if I understand
[? Felly ?] correctly,

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.010
the second time she was
going to flee without us.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.440
Both times, Aunt
Millie, summoned

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.180
by my mother,
rushed to our house

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.790
to tell my mother that she
wouldn't allow her to abandon

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:12.570
her husband, wouldn't allow her
to destroy her brother's family

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.969
and ruin his life.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:18.840
[? Felly ?] says, Mr.
Goldberg sat in his chair

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.699
doing this with his hands.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:24.000
She puts out her
hands, wringing them.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.080
But, oh, she says, Aunt Millie
scolded Mr. Goldberg, too.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.909
She told him that
he had to change,

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:32.415
or he was going to lose
his wife and family.

00:34:32.415 --> 00:34:36.370
[INAUDIBLE] Yoli was all packed
and ready to go to the airport,

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.909
but Aunt Millie
convinced her to stay.

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:40.980
Two times I saw that, Frankie.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.370
Two times I saw her convince
your mother to stay.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.889
At your father's funeral,
says [? Felly, ?] Aunt Millie

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:50.699
came from Florida in her
wheelchair, so old now.

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:53.100
And she apologized
to [INAUDIBLE] Yoli.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.770
At the funeral, I heard
Millie say, I am sorry,

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:58.200
Yolanda, for how you
suffered with [? Burt ?] all

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.160
those years.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.760
I feel responsible, because
I forced you to stay.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.730
Aunt Millie felt responsible,
Frankie, says [? Felly. ?]

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:08.550
And she apologized
to your mother.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.640
Your Tio [INAUDIBLE],, didn't
like to visit your mother here,

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.560
says [? Felly. ?] That's
why, when he came,

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.040
he would stay at the
Holiday Inn in Dedham.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.040
Tio [INAUDIBLE] knows how
your father treated Yoli.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.720
He always knew.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.590
Because of that, he couldn't
stand to be with [? Burt. ?]

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.240
I didn't notice
that conversation

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.570
between Aunt Millie and my
mother at my father's funeral.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.000
I wasn't aware of Tio
[INAUDIBLE] hostility

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.220
to my father when I was a boy.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.990
I was deaf to the icy nuances
in the forest [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.850
with which Tio [INAUDIBLE]
spoke to my father.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:46.520
My mother sobbing in bed
with her nightgown ripped off

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.690
her shoulder, her skin
scratched and bruised,

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.820
scratched marks that bled--

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.250
[? Felly ?] seems to
think I'd seen that, too,

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.080
and must remember it.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.170
How could I not remember
bloody claw marks

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.520
on my mother's
soft bare shoulder?

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.380
My father,
[? Felly, ?] tells me,

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.560
sat on the edge of the
bed, face in his hands.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.060
Then he got up
shouting at my mother

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.390
and went into the bathroom,
slamming the door.

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:14.420
That didn't happen just
once, Frankie, she says.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.730
Maybe I saw it.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:18.710
Or maybe, hearing the commotion,
I ran to the bedroom door.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:20.750
But I don't remember any of it.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.990
My mother would tell [? Felly ?]
to take me downstairs.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:27.260
Mr. Goldberg was impotent,
says [? Felly. ?] When Mr.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.320
Goldberg tried to make love
to [INAUDIBLE] Yoli, she says,

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.670
he couldn't.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.290
Then he would be enraged.

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.510
And that's when
he would hit her.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:38.120
Your mother told me
everything, Frankie.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.870
Because, in those days,
she had no one else.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:45.110
Her uncle, by whom she
met Rodolfo [? Springer ?]

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:48.800
[INAUDIBLE],, the Guatemalan
Army Colonel who eventually rose

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.880
to general, who she always
says was like a father to her,

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.740
told [? Felly ?] that she
should leave her house.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.610
She had no obligation to
us or to anyone to endure

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.650
such ugliness and sadness.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:03.170
Her powerful military
relatives said,

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:06.380
she was young and had to
look for her own happiness.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.780
But I couldn't leave your
mother alone with your father,

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.165
she says, or abandon
you and Lexi.

00:37:11.165 --> 00:37:13.670
I couldn't, Frankie.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.330
[? Felly ?] tells me that Tio
[INAUDIBLE] wife, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.290
phoned from Guatemala
to thank her

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:21.890
for taking care of my mother
and of me and of Lexi.

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:24.710
Tio [INAUDIBLE] she was right
to thank [? Felly, ?] I think.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:26.390
Because of [? Felly, ?]
I was happy,

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:29.450
shut away as much as was
possible in our own world

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:32.330
in the basement, out
playing down back,

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:35.780
walking with her to the town
square to buy penny candy,

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.240
sometimes even going into
Boston with her on her day

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.540
off to see a matinee movie and
eat spaghetti and meatballs

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.310
in the North End.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:46.280
Was Lexi, because of
[? Felly, ?] happy,

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.260
happy enough, too?

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.670
I think she was.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:50.810
I hope so.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:54.640
As a small girl, though, Lexi
was my father's favorite.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.740
But by her early
adolescence, my father

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:02.060
had turned on her, viciously
insulting and deriding her.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.980
I used to find your
mother shaking, Frankie,

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.780
shaking like this.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.810
And [? Felly ?] puts out her
hands and makes them shake.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:12.140
He was brutal with her, Mr.
Goldberg, says [? Felly. ?] Oh,

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.580
she suffered, Frankie.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.540
Your mother suffered.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.100
And she couldn't
talk to her family.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.740
You [SPANISH] was such
a strict Catholic.

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.097
You could never divorce.

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:21.680
You were supposed
to accept your fate.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.530
And [INAUDIBLE] Yoli was
always telling her mother

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:27.770
that everything was fine,
so that she wouldn't worry.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:31.520
I felt like I was
responsible for your mother,

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.760
says [? Felly. ?] I wasn't
afraid of your father.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.480
God gave me strength
to stand up to him.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.490
I would get between
them and say,

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:43.010
I'm going to tell them in
Guatemala what's happening.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.810
And that would
scare Mr. Goldberg.

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.960
That's when he'd
turn and go away.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.320
[INAUDIBLE] Yoli used to
call me her salvation.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.900
[SPEAKING SPANISH], she'd say.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.620
Her studies and then her
teaching, that saved her, too,

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.775
says [? Felly. ?] That
was your mother's escape."

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:07.750
The book ends in New
Bedford where I meet--

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.290
I won't get into
the whole story,

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:12.640
but I go there with
[? Aba ?] Rubinstein-Wong,

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:18.190
who's a lawyer for a war crimes
unit in the Justice Department.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.465
She was adopted.

00:39:20.465 --> 00:39:22.840
I'll just read just a teeny
bit, even I go to two minutes

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.360
over just to end
on a more up thing.

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.090
But it begins with
this little thing.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.882
Because it's appropriate
to New Bedford.

00:39:36.882 --> 00:39:38.340
"In this notebook
where I copy down

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.830
quotes regarding human
transformations that

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:44.100
can occur even from
one moment to the next,

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.350
I have one by Herman Melville.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:50.310
It's from a letter he wrote
to Nathaniel Hawthorne.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:55.110
Until I was 50, I had
no development at all.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.555
From my 50th year,
I date my life.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.200
Three weeks have
scarcely passed,

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.570
at any time between
then and now,

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:10.380
that I have not
unfolded within myself.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.960
Actually, Melville wrote 25.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.110
I wrote 50, because
why the fuck not?

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:19.750
Have a Hawthorne quote, too.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.810
In Wakefield, the
magic of a single night

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:25.750
has wrought a similar
transformation.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.350
Because in that brief
period, a great moral change

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:30.790
has been effected.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:33.930
But this is a
secret from himself.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:38.170
If he has changed, but in
a way secret from himself,

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:41.200
do others notice?

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.430
I was adopted as a baby, says
[? Aba. ?] I was around a year

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:47.610
old, but there's no way to
know my actual birth date.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:49.800
It seems like I was born
up in the highlands,

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.750
somewhere almost
certainly in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:53.700
But-- she shrugs.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.290
What year, I ask?

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.767
I just turned 30, so
you can do the math.

00:40:57.767 --> 00:40:59.850
Yes, the massacres were
getting under way by then.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:01.230
Well, you know the history.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:05.160
I silently calculate,
definitely underway.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.560
[? Aba ?] says,
somehow I ended up

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.590
alone in the hands of
soldiers and was turned over

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:12.450
to a state orphanage.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:13.830
That's all I know.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:18.040
Maybe someday, she
says, a DNA test

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.040
will show that one of
those skeletons being

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.269
exhumed from the mass graves
was my natural mother or father.

00:41:24.269 --> 00:41:26.560
But whenever I travel through
the highlands down there,

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.070
Francisco, I'm always
terrified that at any moment

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:31.990
somebody is going
to say to me, you're

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.980
a walking picture
of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.020
Was she your mother--

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.510
or some name like that.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.460
She explains that
she was adopted

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.610
by Clara Rubinstein,
a geology professor

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:45.440
at Michigan Tech in
the upper peninsula,

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.350
but was also adopted,
unofficially,

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:49.840
by her mother's
partner, Mary Wong.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:53.110
The Guatemalans would permit a
gringa single mother to adopt,

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:54.910
but not a lesbian couple.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.250
But when she managed to track
down her official adoption

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.830
records in Guatemala
City, she was

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:04.090
surprised to discover that a
social worker had written down

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.120
the Dr. Clara Rubinstein lived
with her close friend, Mary

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.600
Wong, an artist, who's going
to help raise the child.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.210
Mary teaches in the tech art
department, says [? Aba. ?]

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.850
She started out teaching
sculpture and pottery.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:20.730
But, now, she's all
about Earth art.

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:23.710
The [INAUDIBLE] is obviously
a great place for that.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:27.190
Anyway, Ma Clara used to go
to Guatemala every few years

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:30.850
on short term contracts to
work for an American company

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:34.240
exploring for oil in the PatÃ©n.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.420
Needless to say, Guatemala
wasn't such a festive place

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.800
in those days.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.980
To celebrate the adoption's
official approval, which

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.740
came through just before
the Christmas holidays,

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:47.410
Clara and Mary went
to Tulum, Mexico.

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:50.440
That's why, says [? Aba, ?]
on my first US passport,

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:54.880
my name is [? Jaba ?]
Rubinstein-Wong from

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.550
the Yucatec Maya words
for happy new year.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:02.230
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] She even
writes it out in a cocktail

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.170
napkin for me.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:07.385
Clara and Mary pronounced my
name [? Jaba, ?] she says.

00:43:07.385 --> 00:43:10.010
And that was a cool enough
name until Jabba the Hutt

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:12.050
made his Star Wars debut.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:15.230
So [? Jaba ?] got changed to
[? Aba. ?] In grad school,

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:19.100
she says, Clara at Berkeley,
Mary at San Francisco State,

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.140
her moms fell in
love to ABBA music,

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.380
dancing under disco balls."

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.960
I think I'll stop there.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:25.560
Thank you.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.610
