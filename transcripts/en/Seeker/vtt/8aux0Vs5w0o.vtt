00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.980
E = mc2, energy is equal to mass times the
speed of light squared.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.340
We’ve demonstrated this to dramatic effect
with nuclear bombs, converting a little mass

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.080
into a lot of energy, but we’ve never done
it the other way around and turned energy

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.080
into mass.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.240
At least we haven’t done it… yet.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.679
When you think high energy, where does your
mind go?

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.640
That’s right, to Trace.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.480
But after that, probably lasers.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.319
And lasers are getting extremely powerful.

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:31.710
The current record-holding laser resides in
China, at the Shanghai Superintense Ultrafast

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.710
Laser Facility.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.940
In 2016 it set the bar at 5.3 million billion
Watts of power, or 5.3 Petawatts.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.760
Even though that’s a lot of power, it doesn’t
last very long.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.810
Power is energy over time, so there are two
ways to make these super powerful lasers.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.690
Scientists can just up the energy, but certain
components like the amplifiers can’t handle

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.510
more energy unless they’re impractically
large.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.200
One laser in the US uses 1.8 megajoules to
produce about one petawatt and it’s the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.950
size of a 10 story building.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.100
The other approach to upping the power is
by packing that energy into a very short amount

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.100
of time.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.920
The laser in Shanghai fires for just a few
quadrillionths of a second.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.060
In that tiny timespan, the laser produces
about 500 times the power of all the world’s

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.100
electrical grids combined, while being small
enough to fit on a tabletop.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.710
And yet it’s still not enough.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.770
Chinese scientists are upgrading the facility
with the goal of hitting 10 petawatts by the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.090
end of the year.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.950
And they’re hoping to build another laser
capable of pumping out 100 petawatts by 2023,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.960
if the Chinese government approves the roughly
100 million dollar price tag.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.100
China might have a compelling reason for footing
the bill though: at these powers levels scientists

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.700
can achieve new and mind-bending things, like
plucking electrons from an empty vacuum.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.060
Well… when I say empty, it really isn’t,
at least according to the theory of quantum

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.090
electrodynamics.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.300
Because the quantum world is a silly place,
for the briefest of moments, electrons and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.900
their antimatter evil twins, positrons, flicker
into existence before their opposite charges

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.360
draw them together and poof!

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.260
They’re gone again.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.119
But a 100 petawatt laser beam focused down
to just 3 micrometers across should create

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.610
an electric field so intense as to keep the
electron and positron separate.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.060
The energy from the laser would also shake
the electron and positron enough that they

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.970
give off gamma rays that create more electron
positron pairs and radiation we’ll be able

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.970
to detect.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.450
A chain reaction that creates matter from
energy.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.210
Of course we’re still an order of magnitude
shy of this kind of power, but after we overcome

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.620
the technical hurdles we’ll be able to try
our hand at using E = mc2 for creation rather

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.819
than destruction.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.590

We make videos about them all the time, like
this one about how scientists are using diamonds

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.620
to combine laser beams a la the death star.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.160
Super powerful lasers can have more uses than
pulling electrons from thin air.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.629
Scientists are exploring how they might be
used to treat cancer or build smaller particle

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:21.629
accelerators.

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.599
