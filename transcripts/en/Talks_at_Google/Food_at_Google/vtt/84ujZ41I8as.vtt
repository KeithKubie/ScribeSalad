[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.977
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.977 --> 00:00:10.060
JASON ANDREAS: So I pulled
this from your website,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.120
so hopefully it's accurate.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.870
So you can correct me
if anything's wrong.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.670
So I'm going to
read it verbatim.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.310
"A native of small,
rural-town Michigan--"

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.090
most of us know Howell--

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.572
"and a Schoolcraft College
graduate, Chef Rigato's cooking

00:00:22.572 --> 00:00:24.280
philosophy started
with his grandparents,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.650
who exposed him to the art of
handcrafted Italian cuisine.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.530
Rigato entered the
restaurant business at age 14

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.830
as a dishwasher
at a local diner.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.260
After enrolling in Schoolcraft
College's culinary program

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.040
at 17"--

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.170
very impressive-- "he
spent the next eight

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.340
years working in some of metro
Detroit's finer restaurants.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.497
In 2007, Chef Rigato became
personal chef for Ed"--

00:00:45.497 --> 00:00:46.330
JAMES RIGATO: Mamou.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.470
JASON ANDREAS: Mamou--

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.307
"Mamou's business,
Royal Oak Recycling

00:00:49.307 --> 00:00:51.640
and Royal Oak Storage," where
his passion and enthusiasm

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.723
in the kitchen sparked
their friendship and future

00:00:53.723 --> 00:00:55.030
partnership.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.120
The two collaborated in
developing and opening

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.640
the Root, which was named
the top restaurant in Detroit

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.582
in 2012 by the 'Free Press,'
followed by Mabel Gray.

00:01:04.582 --> 00:01:06.790
In Rigato's restaurants,
diners experience everything

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.289
he loves about
growing up and living

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:10.214
in the great state of
Michigan, community

00:01:10.214 --> 00:01:11.380
and the bounty of the Earth.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.838
At the Root Restaurant and Bar
in White Lake and Mabel Gray

00:01:13.838 --> 00:01:16.595
and Hazel Park, to Top
Chef season 12 contestant

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:18.220
creates dishes with
ingredients sourced

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.040
from his favorite local
farmers and artisans.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.280
Rigato welcomes his guests
as if they are family, aiming

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.040
to nurture and delight them."

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.670
So again, a quick
round of applause--

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.180
please welcome to Google
Detroit, Chef James Rigato.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.589
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:35.380
The stage is yours.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.100
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah-- good.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.933
Thank you very much.

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:41.280
So yeah, that sounds accurate--

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.671
nice PG version of--

00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:43.754
JASON ANDREAS: Good, good.

00:01:43.754 --> 00:01:45.206
JAMES RIGATO: --my
last 18 years.

00:01:45.206 --> 00:01:45.690
JASON ANDREAS: Awesome.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.981
JAMES RIGATO: So, yeah, I
got a job on my 14th birthday

00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:50.360
at a local diner in Howell.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.150
I'm not a big fan of
Howell, to be honest.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.030
It's a pretty
culturally dead town.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.380
You can't find a piece of fish.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.930
You can't find a
person of color.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.800
You can't find
anything interesting.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.410
So I really grew up just--

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.335
I don't know-- hungry.

00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:05.710
That's what I
always tell people.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.709
I grew up really hungry.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.756
And legit-- I mean,
I had a single mom.

00:02:08.756 --> 00:02:10.630
And we were on welfare,
and she worked a lot.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.930
And so my sister and I
were home alone a lot.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.494
So I just was like
hungry for everything.

00:02:17.494 --> 00:02:20.290
And I think a trait that I
developed young that a lot

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.839
of my friends didn't--

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:23.380
for instance, I'm
the only kid that--

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.060
I grew up with kind of
posse of four kids, me

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.820
and three other neighbors.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.840
And they actually had
it worse than I did.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.230
But I'm the only one that
graduated high school.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.804
And we moved downtown Howell.

00:02:34.804 --> 00:02:35.970
I grew up in a trailer park.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.670
We moved downtown Howell into
a house when I was about 12.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.525
And then I was in
proximity to that diner.

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:44.369
And that diner kind of like--

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:45.910
I don't want to say
it saved my life,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.660
but it kind of shifted things.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.350
I grew up, and I always felt
like trailer park, Howell,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.364
like mundane things
are temporary.

00:02:55.364 --> 00:02:57.280
I always felt like my
situation was temporary.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.920
I was like, this
sucks, and I can't

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.980
wait to get over there,
where it doesn't suck.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.290
JASON ANDREAS:
We're going to have

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.390
to put a disclaimer on
this video for anyone

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.400
watching from Howell.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.053
So apologies.

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:07.022
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:07.022 --> 00:03:08.105
Anyone from Howell, it's--

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:09.040
JAMES RIGATO: It's fine.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.430
JASON ANDREAS: There's some
decent things there, too.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.916
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:11.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.420
JAMES RIGATO: No, I
don't need to say it.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.560
JASON ANDREAS: Couple
stop lights-- it's good.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.434
[LAUGHING]

00:03:14.434 --> 00:03:17.210
JAMES RIGATO: But, I mean,
literally think about it.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.580
You grow up in a town.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.310
You have no-- there's
just no resources.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.430
There's no live music.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.310
There's no art.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.364
There's no food--
especially food.

00:03:26.364 --> 00:03:28.030
Even right now, go
there and try to eat.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.821
I mean, it's tough.

00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:30.040
There's no food.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.030
So I always wanted better food.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.777
I wanted culture.

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:35.360
I wanted life.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.300
And actually, my dad started
to enroll me in YMCA camps.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.980
So in the summertime, I'd go
away for two weeks at a time,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.300
and I'd go up to Camp Nissokone
in the middle of Oscoda.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.570
And there were kids all
over Detroit and Michigan,

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.740
counselors from Africa
and South America.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.110
And literally, I remember
watching one of our counselors,

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.010
this African dude from Kenya,
cooking potatoes over the fire

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.260
and like butter and bacon fat.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.487
And stuff like that
was really the things

00:04:04.487 --> 00:04:05.570
that stood out in my mind.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.319
I'm like, man, here's
all these people

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.610
from different walks of life,
and we're over this fire,

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.470
and we're cooking
potatoes from raw.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.960
We all can connect
with that potato

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.360
regardless of where
we're all from.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.430
So just things like that stood
out so I got a job at 14.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.075
Actually, if anyone knows Rose's
Fine Foods down in Detroit,

00:04:21.075 --> 00:04:22.780
so that's Molly
Mitchell's restaurant.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.946
Molly Mitchell went to the
same high school as me,

00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:26.030
and actually elementary school.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.071
I've known Molly forever.

00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:28.190
Molly actually called me.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.000
She's like, yo, I
know you're 14 now.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.083
You can work at the diner.

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:32.470
Come down and get a job here.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.220
So I did.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.230
I got a job.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.179
I just washed dishes,
and it sucked.

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:37.470
It was like the worst job ever.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.700
And I ended up getting a
job at Papa John's flipping

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.510
pizzas instead.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.690
But that was kind of like--

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.060
that day one, washing
pots and pans--

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.290
and it was a 24-hour diner,
so it never shut down,

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.010
and I went home, and my fingers
were all pruned, and I'm tired.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.880
I'm was like, man,
I got purpose.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.210
I felt like I had
purpose all of a sudden.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.230
And then you got paid.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.140
And I was like, oh my god.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.250
Growing up poor, we used
to walk to the party store

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.479
and collect bottles on the way.

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.770
And you get in the party
store with a buck, 10 bottles,

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.310
and you're like, dude,
that's like a beef jerky

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.660
or whatever, a Whatchamacallit
and a Mountain Dew.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.620
So once I started getting
paid for washing dishes,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.030
and then I got a job at Papa
John's making $6.50 an hour,

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.804
I was like, psht--

00:05:21.804 --> 00:05:22.580
I'm ballin'.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.730
For Like 18 hours a week, like,
oh, my god, are you kidding me?

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.620
That's like $100 a week
I can probably make.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.430
And so then I got a
job at a restaurant.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.436
Because one girl in
my class was like, yo,

00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:35.019
we need a pizza guy
at our restaurant.

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:36.450
I said, I can make pizza.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.840
Went to that restaurants.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.580
I was 16.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.740
And I could make pizza
better than anybody there,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.510
but that's when
I saw line cooks.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.800
That's when I saw a chef.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.240
I saw a dude in white checks.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.053
Checks are like the chef pants.

00:05:49.053 --> 00:05:51.660
And I was like, oh, that guy
is a chef, like for a living?

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.010
Like that's what he
does for a living?

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.884
He's a grown-ass man.

00:05:53.884 --> 00:05:55.324
He's got kids--
like, oh, my god.

00:05:55.324 --> 00:05:55.824
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:55.824 --> 00:05:57.160
And then I saw the cooks.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.230
And now you look
back at these cooks,

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.190
and they're like 23-year-old,
drugged-out bums.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.715
But then, I was like,
these dudes are flipping

00:06:06.715 --> 00:06:09.010
and like hitting each other
with tongs on the butt

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.380
and lighting hands on fire
and just like spinning shit,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.080
pulling off tickets.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.720
You used to put a
plate in the window,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.120
and you put enough English on
to where it goes to topple over

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.350
but spins back.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.310
I was just like, bfft!

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.340
I couldn't see straight.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.920
And so about six
months into that job--

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.477
I'm like almost 17, 16--

00:06:31.477 --> 00:06:32.185
grill cook quits.

00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:35.410
This dude AJ, choked out
Caveman-- the saute cook,

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.155
we called him.

00:06:36.155 --> 00:06:37.820
He choked out
Caveman on the line.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.548
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:39.548 --> 00:06:41.170
And I'm like, damn,
this guy's crazy.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.280
And AJ quits.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.834
Chef was a nice guy,
but he sure as shit

00:06:44.834 --> 00:06:46.750
was not going to get on
that hotline and cook.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.840
He was like 40, and they're
always drugged-out cooks

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.640
doing 600 covers a night.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.190
He's like, you!

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.670
He's like, Jimmy, can you cook?

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:55.590
I'm like, yeah, I can do it.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.173
I've been watching
him for six months.

00:06:57.173 --> 00:07:01.480
Went on the grill, banged-out
grill, and killed the night

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.696
service.

00:07:02.696 --> 00:07:04.820
The owner comes over, and
he's like, I'm lead cook.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.190
You're the new grill cook.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.210
OK.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.335
So grill cook is a big position.

00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:11.390
It was like 45 hours a week.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.530
I just get the schedule.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.650
But I don't know if they
just forgot I was 16 or

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.476
But 45 hours a week.

00:07:17.476 --> 00:07:18.767
Like they schedule you at 2:00.

00:07:18.767 --> 00:07:21.105
Well, OK, well, class
gets out at 2:40.

00:07:21.105 --> 00:07:25.270
So like sixth hour, Mr.
O, I was like, Mr. O,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.187
can I go to art class and paint
if I finish my homework early?

00:07:28.187 --> 00:07:29.270
He's like, yeah, OK, cool.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.840
I had three hours of art.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.716
So he was like, yeah.

00:07:31.716 --> 00:07:32.215
OK.

00:07:32.215 --> 00:07:34.520
I literally finished my
homework and just get in my car

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.970
and go to work,
punch in at 2:00,

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.120
close down at 12:00 midnight.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.518
Bring back a pitcher of
beers in the kitchen.

00:07:42.518 --> 00:07:43.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:44.850
The guy hands me a beer.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.230
I swear to God the
dudes forgot I was 16.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.260
So I just started working.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.760
And I stated dating a waitress
who was much older than me.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.135
And she eventually
found out [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:55.135 --> 00:07:57.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.450
But that just like--

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.060
I just immediately-- and
then I was making like--

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.770
I don't know-- $10
an hour, $11 an hour.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.330
I eventually got a
raise to like $11.50.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.560
I moved out after I
graduated high school at 17.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.194
I tried getting an apartment
but couldn't sign a lease.

00:08:11.194 --> 00:08:12.610
But I had like
four grand in cash.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.859
So I was like, can I just
pay for six months up front?

00:08:14.859 --> 00:08:17.600
This was the village in Wixom
if anyone knows where that's at.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.020
One of the whole complexes
was burned down at the time.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.353
And so I think they were like,
we'll take it-- whatever.

00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:24.890
So I just gave six months'
rent, they gave me the key,

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.870
and I had an apartment.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:31.280
So 17, apartment, I'm making
like $11.50, $12 an hour, 50,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.084
60 hours a week,
enrolled in Schoolcraft.

00:08:34.084 --> 00:08:36.539
And I just was entrenched.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.159
That's really my
jump-start, I think.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.120
Because I opened a
restaurant at 26.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.890
I graduated from
culinary school at 20.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.290
All day long, I got people
that come to my restaurant,

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.750
even now, as recent as last
night, oh, you're baby face.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.920
You're so-- how old are you?

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.040
Where's your dad at?

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.636
Where's the chef?

00:08:53.636 --> 00:08:54.510
I'm 32.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.720
I'm young.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.700
I've been doing this--

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.658
I've been on the grind.

00:08:57.658 --> 00:09:02.740
I've been standing on
quarry tile under UV lights,

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.910
banging pans, for 18 years.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.380
I could be a fucking surgeon.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.540
So to me, that's the
industry in a nutshell.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.170
And that's how I started,
banging pans, drinking beers,

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.930
just being the man.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.910
But then at Schoolcraft,
I was like, oh, shit.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.080
There's actually finesse, right?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.400
There's knowledge.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.820
There's like, OK,
this is a profession.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:33.630
This is as distinguished as
politics or the fine arts.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.710
This is ballet.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.290
I'm like in the club,
and I see a ballerina,

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:39.280
and I'm like, oh, shit.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.530
No, actually, it's that.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.490
It's not pop, lock, and drop.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.472
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:44.472 --> 00:09:46.930
It's actually pirouettes.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.140
So I got "The French
Laundry Cookbook."

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.850
That changed my life.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.660
And I came across a couple of
my fellow chefs at Schoolcraft,

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.340
and those guys are
just like, I got it.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.590
I was like, OK.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.290
So at, I don't know, 19 I
took a job with Matt Prentice

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.330
at Shiraz.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.204
I don't know if anyone
here remembers Shiraz,

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:06.687
but that was a good restaurant.

00:10:06.687 --> 00:10:10.137
And I started getting
serious about food.

00:10:10.137 --> 00:10:13.210
And then I became a sous chef.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.240
I just got in tune with
Michigan seasonality.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.370
I always grew up with it.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.266
I always saw, oh,
it's blueberry season.

00:10:20.266 --> 00:10:21.390
Oh, pick your own cherries.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:26.412
Oh, farmer's market, corn,
like so-and-so has a whole pig,

00:10:26.412 --> 00:10:28.870
and then they're slaughtering
because the Windsor's coming.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.390
I always knew that.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.310
When you actually start
applying it to menus--

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.810
Halloween is a pagan holiday.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.430
It's the harvest.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:40.420
Winter solstice is-- even like
I started paying attention

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.110
to history and
food and holidays.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.190
Everything started making
sense through food.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.470
Travel, right-- you see
what France is doing.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.430
You go see the mussels
on the coast of Brittany

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.190
and where Prince
Edward Island actually

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.090
discovered their similar
climate for mussel harvesting.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.810
And all these
things will start--

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.602
even today as I travel
now, just constant--

00:11:03.602 --> 00:11:04.435
it's like formulaic.

00:11:04.435 --> 00:11:07.050
There's algorithms, and
they're all plugging in.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.730
So food did that for me.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.480
JASON ANDREAS: Well,
I've been listening--

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.484
so Chef Rigato has a new
podcast, or a newish podcast

00:11:14.484 --> 00:11:15.150
with Ann Delisi.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.410
We were talking about
Ann earlier, who's

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.190
a local DJ, really awesome,
great music taste if you ever

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.892
listen to her.

00:11:21.892 --> 00:11:23.600
But you guys have been
doing the podcast,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.870
and I was able to listen
to quite a few of them.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.520
JAMES RIGATO: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.220
JASON ANDREAS: It
think it's really cool.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:27.928
Yeah, no problem.

00:11:27.928 --> 00:11:31.032
They're actually really
interesting-- quick plug.

00:11:31.032 --> 00:11:33.490
But what I really like is what
you were just talking about.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.573
You go into a lot of the
history of things, right?

00:11:35.573 --> 00:11:38.220
You go into the history of
where certain types of recipes

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.297
came from or a certain
type of ethnicity

00:11:40.297 --> 00:11:42.130
behind a food, which I
think is really cool.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.019
And you can obviously
tell the passion.

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:45.810
It's cool hearing you
say it now in person,

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.370
but in those
podcasts, you really

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.310
go deep into not just
a certain type of food

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.190
and talk about just something
that's new or up and coming,

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.380
but you go into the history
of like very basic stuff

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.734
as well, like geographies
and things like that,

00:11:57.734 --> 00:11:58.900
which is really interesting.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.130
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.540
I think for me, food--

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.495
I don't know.

00:12:01.495 --> 00:12:02.726
It's like purpose, right?

00:12:02.726 --> 00:12:04.725
I grew up in a Catholic
school, which is ironic,

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:06.000
because I grew up
in a trailer park,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.380
and my dad would pay
for Catholic school

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.130
but would like not
pay for other things.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.890
I had like one uniform.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.246
I was the dirty kid
in Catholic school.

00:12:13.246 --> 00:12:15.490
But I was the Catholic
kid in the neighborhood.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.120
So I was always juxtaposed.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.000
I was either like a prissy punk
or like a dirtbag trailer park

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.410
kid.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.229
I couldn't find--

00:12:23.229 --> 00:12:25.020
Which actually kind of
fits, because that's

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.400
kind of what Mabel Gray
is, honestly, right?

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.720
We're the fancy
restaurant in Hazel Park.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.142
But if you like
fancy restaurants,

00:12:31.142 --> 00:12:33.100
we're like the grungy,
piece-of-shit restaurant

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.790
that plays Tupac while
you eat a tasting meal.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.110
So that's been my identity.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.470
I enjoy that.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.160
Now I love it.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.590
But then it was like my paradox.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.710
But I think it's very important
to pay attention to food.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.520
Food is so much purpose.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.840
Like if you look at France--

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.400
I've spent a lot
of time in France.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.651
France is kind of a
culture of arrogance.

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:57.150
It just is.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.540
I'm not mad at France,
but they're very proud.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.850
If you're in France, you're
on the Basque border,

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.510
they don't cook Spanish food.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.957
But go on a train, go 30
minutes, go eat Spanish.

00:13:05.957 --> 00:13:06.540
You're French.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.260
We eat French food.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.190
Whereas us, we're like,
dude, go to Windsor.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.790
Go check out Little Italy.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.880
We'll give you
advice where to eat.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.510
Oh, you should go over to the
Western side of the state.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.260
Go to [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.030
Go to Chicago.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.320
We all love Chicago.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.490
Live There it's
like, Spain is crap.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.860
This is the best.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.620
But think about it, man.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.890
This is a country
that's-- how many wars--

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.180
look at Champagne, the region.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.010
Every single war from France
has trampled through Champagne.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.050
And there's a bloody,
sad, bleak history

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.970
of that-- we all think of
Champagne, pop the cork, party.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:40.996
Go to Champagne.

00:13:40.996 --> 00:13:42.870
Pay attention to the
history and the culture.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:43.369
It's flat.

00:13:43.369 --> 00:13:45.150
There's no mountains, right?

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:51.040
It is the highway of invasion,
from the Vikings to Hitler.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.294
Everybody has trampled through
that part of-- in the world.

00:13:54.294 --> 00:13:58.475
So I think of Champagne,
yes, I pop champagne.

00:13:58.475 --> 00:13:59.600
It's New Year's-- whatever.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.385
But when I drink champagne,
I look at that bottle, fuck,

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:04.420
man, like the history--

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.870
Champagne is so important and
so serious in the world, right?

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.047
Like they set the bar.

00:14:11.047 --> 00:14:12.880
If you have great
sparkling wine from Italy,

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.690
if you have great
Schramsberg from California,

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:16.970
they do a champagne method.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.140
They label it "Champagne
method" because they let

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.100
you know they set the standard.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:22.959
So I don't know.

00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:24.750
If you're just like,
let's order champagne,

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.835
or they call American sparkling
wine champagne, I'm like--

00:14:28.835 --> 00:14:30.668
I can talk about Champagne
for fucking days.

00:14:30.668 --> 00:14:32.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.130
So with food, it's important
to remember that, too.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.690
American culture, we
barely create much.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.210
We kind of just lift it, right.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.587
You look at soul food.

00:14:41.587 --> 00:14:42.810
You look at barbecue.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.030
How much bad white-boy
barbecue does Michigan need?

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.516
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:48.516 --> 00:14:50.432
JASON ANDREAS: We haven't
hit the ceiling yet.

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.130
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah, you
haven't seen nothing yet.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.260
There's probably like 20 more
barbecue restaurants opening up

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.130
in the next two years.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.060
There's so much bad
barbecue in this state.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.970
And even the good
barbecue, they buy

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.510
the shit at Restaurant Depot,
add sugar and salt in, then

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.650
smoke it for 24 hours.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.610
It's like candy.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.680
Like barbecue is such a
serious cuisine for me.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.230
Because, for one, the
real barbecue out there

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.500
is like a heritage pig, right?

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.040
You pick your pig, you butcher
it, it's whole roasted,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.470
it's broken down.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.360
Usually the cook is up with it
all night, tending the fire,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.360
loving in the process.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.240
Next morning, lunchtime, you
break down the whole pig.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.130
You serve it till it's out.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.310
Barbecue is done.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.190
That's barbecue.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.610
400 pounds of just
one cut of the--

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.810
400 pounds of brisket is
like, whatever, like 20 cows,

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.920
but just like one
part of 20 cows.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.876
So like it's a
2,000-pound animal.

00:15:45.876 --> 00:15:48.210
You're going to take a
10-pound chunk of it and say,

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.740
who gives a shit about the rest?

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.850
Rub it down with sugar and
then smoke it, then slice

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.600
and be like, I'm the man?

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.450
I don't get that.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:03.960
Barbecue is like the off cuts,
open flame, or whole animal,

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.070
local proximity to
farms, nurturing,

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.250
using vinegar and
sugar and spices

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.980
to manipulate the
tougher, fattier, not

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.020
like center-table kind
of cuts and cooking it

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.710
for people of the Earth,
hand-to-mouth people.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.860
So it's lifted from
the West Indies.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.160
It's lifted from
history of slaves.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.190
Barbecue is a very
serious cuisine for me.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:34.890
So I don't like the, like I
said, strip-mall, shitty, fast,

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:40.590
sugar, cheap junk, get the
fat people fatter mentality.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.760
It bothers me.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.660
So I could talk about
barbecue for days.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.280
So that's what food
had done for me.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.363
It's created this purpose.

00:16:48.363 --> 00:16:51.470
Food is this living
history, right?

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.320
I think when robots
take over the world,

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.810
and there's robots cooking,
they're still not going do it--

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.330
it's one of the protected arts.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.280
Google is an interesting
company because where

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.980
was it 20 years ago?

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.730
Where is it going to
be 20 years from now?

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.104
So many questions--
I think there

00:17:07.104 --> 00:17:09.262
are more questions
about the tech industry

00:17:09.262 --> 00:17:10.220
than there are answers.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.260
Whereas the food, I feel
like there's more history

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.201
than there is future.

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:18.700
You want to think about forward,
you've got to go backwards.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.420
You've got to look at
where everything came from.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.800
If anything, we're running
into trouble with food, right?

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.050
We're going to run out of it--

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:30.880
GMOs, like fishing-- oh, my
god, what sushi restaurants

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.550
have done to the world.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.630
So I think we need to think
about food holistically

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.300
and who we are as a people.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.486
Wasn't it
Brillat-Savarin, show me

00:17:41.486 --> 00:17:43.510
what you eat, I'll
show you who you are?

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.100
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.920
JAMES RIGATO: So that's
what food is to me.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.650
Mabel Gray is obviously
just a restaurant

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.890
in a neighborhood-- you
can say whatever you want,

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:55.050
gentrifying or
pop redevelopment.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.880
But to me, we were
talking about earlier,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.910
Mabel Gray is a blank canvas.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.730
It's like a little art
gallery for me and my friends.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.532
And maybe I'm passionate
about barbecue.

00:18:04.532 --> 00:18:06.990
Maybe I'll get a whole pig and
I want to do barbecue night.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.080
And maybe I want to
focus on the West Indies

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.280
or show my cooks why a certain
technique is important.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.610
Or my farmer has 16 rabbits.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:20.047
Well, then we're going to play
with rabbits for a couple days.

00:18:20.047 --> 00:18:20.880
It's a living space.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.850
To me it's like my best attempt
to curate the purpose of food

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.166
in metro Detroit.

00:18:28.166 --> 00:18:28.680
JASON ANDREAS: Well,
obviously there's

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.290
a lot of care that goes into
your menu on a nightly basis.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.623
And for those of you who
haven't been to Mabel Gray yet,

00:18:33.623 --> 00:18:37.450
the menu changes daily
based on ingredients

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.721
and I guess whatever you feel
like cooking for the day, maybe

00:18:40.721 --> 00:18:41.220
barbecue.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:41.370
JAMES RIGATO: Attitude.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.620
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, maybe
we'll get, yeah, attitude.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:43.020
JAMES RIGATO: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.700
JASON ANDREAS:
[LAUGHING] Yeah, exactly.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.410
How do you then equate that idea
to what we were talking about,

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.790
local sourcing things, right?

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.670
So how do you find
the right types

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.910
of sources that aren't
Restaurant Depot that you can

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:01.200
pull some of those better
types of foods from

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.579
and that you can support
the whole local community?

00:19:03.579 --> 00:19:04.870
And how does that process work?

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.450
And how did you set that up when
you were getting Mabel Gray?

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:08.520
So I guess it's probably
a never-ending thing.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.360
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.520
That's like a living thing.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.950
It's like a network.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.820
So I did that a lot
before we opened The Root.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.890
2010 I was just
scouring the state,

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.155
physically visiting
a lot of places,

00:19:19.155 --> 00:19:20.270
to Chicago, to New York.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.920
I went and visited.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.711
I want to know where
everything comes from.

00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:23.874
So I have a big network.

00:19:23.874 --> 00:19:25.790
So I have people liked
D'Artagnan Foods, which

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.310
is an online-based
company that FedExes.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.610
They deal with a lot of chefs.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.560
They're like a very
high-standard broker

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.050
of farm animals, mushrooms
across the country.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.150
So if I want the best
bison America has to offer,

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.300
D'Artagnan, they broker it.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.470
And they list their farms and
their network of accountability

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.030
that chefs can contact into.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.150
So I met that caliber of
I guess my career, where

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.400
I can tap into the best
network in America.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.290
Locally, I have a
number of farmers,

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.550
and they all know each other.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.650
So Solomon, this dude
out in Brass Lake,

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.970
raises chickens
and beautiful eggs.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.910
Solomon is buddies
with Tom Becker,

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.790
who runs Sunseed Farms,
which we have a co-op with.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.860
I met Tom Becker through a
girl named Rachel Beyer, who

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.920
was doing an internship
at Tilian Farms

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.200
because she was going to
MSU's organic farming program

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.955
with Thomas, her
instructor, right?

00:20:13.955 --> 00:20:16.270
So right there id three
degrees of separation

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.030
to how I get my chickens now.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.730
So good develops good.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.500
So we do a co-op
up Sunseed Farms.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.340
Like just this week, I'm
cutting Tom a $5,000 check

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.530
because we buy on co-op.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.700
I give him $5,000
upfront, and usually

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.800
bleaker months like
February, when farmers

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.320
are paying all the expenses,
the crops are docile,

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.790
there's some
greenhousing going on,

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:41.100
but it's minimal when it's 10
degrees outside, so Tom needs

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.110
money now more than he
does in August, when

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.200
the CSA shares are--

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.275
it's kind of like the
planning and the harvesting

00:20:48.275 --> 00:20:49.569
in the financial sense.

00:20:49.569 --> 00:20:51.860
You sure as shit can't relay
on the banks for anything,

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.360
especially nowadays.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.814
So Tom and I--

00:20:55.814 --> 00:20:57.480
and I introduced him
to Selden Standard.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.271
You go to Selden
Standard, you go to Bacco,

00:20:59.271 --> 00:21:02.310
you go to Chartreuse, you'll
find Sunseed farms produce--

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:03.210
The Root.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.800
And that's because I met Tom and
introduced him to those guys.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.800
I told Tom, these
restaurants, these restaurants

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.280
are safe to invest in because
the chefs understand farmers,

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.940
and they will pay you upfront.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.370
Like I will pay Tom before--

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.710
if times were tough, Tom gets
money before I take money.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:17.960
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.876
JAMES RIGATO: And other
chefs think like that,

00:21:19.876 --> 00:21:21.310
like Andy and Doug.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.860
A lot of restaurants don't.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.790
So that's how it all happens.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.430
We network, I'm
sure probably how

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.010
you find a replacement
for Calvin when he quits.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:33.522
JASON ANDREAS: [LAUGHING] Right.

00:21:33.522 --> 00:21:35.230
JAMES RIGATO: Joe is
like, I got a buddy.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.710
JASON ANDREAS: You keep
it in the family, right?

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:37.930
It's a true food network.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:38.930
JAMES RIGATO: Very much.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.880
There's a lot of
phonies out there.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.450
The conversation in Detroit
lately is about criticism,

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:44.080
right?

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.760
Like our food critics are like--

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.910
I don't know-- either
uneducated, inexperienced,

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.400
or scared to take a
stab at a restaurant.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.400
If a restaurant sucks,
you don't write about it.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.000
That's been a rule in Detroit
cuisine for the last 25 years.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.680
Why?

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.530
Because we barely
have any restaurants.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.075
If someone writes and says,
oh, Joe's restaurant sucks

00:22:02.075 --> 00:22:05.007
and then it closes, and now he's
got a vacant building for 10

00:22:05.007 --> 00:22:07.340
years, you're the dick that
should have just not written

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:07.840
anything.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.320
JASON ANDREAS: [LAUGHING] Sure.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.340
JAMES RIGATO: But
we're coming to a point

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.550
where we need watch dogs.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.990
We need to be protected
from the bad restaurants.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.980
We need a writer to
kind of discuss, hey,

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.012
this restaurant is full of shit.

00:22:20.012 --> 00:22:21.970
They said they source
everything from Michigan.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.160
They don't.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.130
Like they said they--

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.225
or they have wild salmon.

00:22:27.225 --> 00:22:29.165
Where does wild salmon
come from right now?

00:22:29.165 --> 00:22:30.970
It doesn't, right?

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.369
Salmon is a spring-based
season, right?

00:22:33.369 --> 00:22:35.160
I don't know if you
guys know salmon can go

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.660
from freshwater to saltwater.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.330
So basically there's a
harvest, or there's like a rush

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.700
back to the creek beds
where they came from

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.890
to lay their eggs, freezes over.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.330
The mom dies.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.100
The babies hatch, eat the
decaying carcass of the mom,

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:55.420
swim out to the ocean, dick
around, eat crustaceans, fight.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.965
That's why they're pink or
orange or yellow in color,

00:22:57.965 --> 00:22:59.740
because they eat crustaceans.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.110
Farm-raised salmon
in the Atlantic Ocean

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.100
is dull gray in color.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.190
They dye the pellets
they feed it.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.750
That's why it turns orange.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.730
That's why when you go to Costco
and you buy your $5 a pound

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.313
salmon thinking
you're scoring a deal,

00:23:11.313 --> 00:23:13.695
and it's all the same
nuclear-orange-Cheeto kind

00:23:13.695 --> 00:23:18.320
of color orange, that's a dye
they ate out in the open ocean

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.800
when they're like literally
in a fraternity with barely

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.680
any wiggle room, just
getting studded up.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:23.980
JASON ANDREAS: Raise
your hand if you

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.300
knew any of that about salmon.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.841
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:26.841 --> 00:23:28.465
Probably one or two--
yeah, one or two.

00:23:28.465 --> 00:23:29.190
JAMES RIGATO: It's just facts.

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.520
That's all.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.645
JASON ANDREAS: That's good.

00:23:30.645 --> 00:23:32.070
We're learning a lot today--

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.160
champagne, salmon.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.234
This is great.

00:23:34.234 --> 00:23:35.650
JAMES RIGATO: Food
world is weird.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.320
40% of all the seafood
we eat is farm-raised.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.350
But yet, farm-raised has a
stigma of like I just said.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.345
But there are very
great farming--

00:23:43.345 --> 00:23:45.615
like I buy organic farm-raised
salmon from Ireland--

00:23:45.615 --> 00:23:48.462
it's $14 a pound--
for the restaurant.

00:23:48.462 --> 00:23:50.890
Atlantic farm-raised
Costco salmon is probably

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.670
like $4 to $5 a pound,
so for that perspective.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.526
I pay three times the amount.

00:23:55.526 --> 00:23:56.900
So just basic math
would tell you

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.217
that if you to Applebee's
and get an $18 salmon,

00:24:00.217 --> 00:24:02.800
you should go to Mabel and pay
three times that amount, right?

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.091
I mean, we don't charge you
three times-- maybe double.

00:24:05.091 --> 00:24:06.680
But like the margin is slim.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.660
Like Applebee's makes
way more money than I do.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.290
One location of Applebee's make
more money than Mabel Gray.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.526
But I can't feed you
Atlantic farm-raised salmon

00:24:15.526 --> 00:24:16.525
and look you in the eye.

00:24:16.525 --> 00:24:18.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.590
JASON ANDREAS: It's easier
to get a reservation

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.510
at Applebee's as well.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.343
JAMES RIGATO: It is.

00:24:22.343 --> 00:24:22.938
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:22.938 --> 00:24:24.720
JAMES RIGATO: Food for ten.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.720
JASON ANDREAS: Slightly.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.219
JAMES RIGATO: $10
apps and whatever.

00:24:27.219 --> 00:24:28.010
Take a date.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.720
JASON ANDREAS: It's a good
deal for some people as well.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.106
There's a lot of Applebee
lovers out there.

00:24:31.106 --> 00:24:32.355
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah, of course.

00:24:32.355 --> 00:24:34.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.460
That's the thing, is
like I walked this line.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.486
When I was younger, 10
years ago, I was like,

00:24:39.486 --> 00:24:40.730
Applebee's sucks.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.774
And now I'm like, do
whatever you want.

00:24:42.774 --> 00:24:44.440
I see customers that
come in and they're

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.170
like $13 for a patty melt?

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.460
Fuck you.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.220
And they leave.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.900
And they get in their F-350 with
their boat attached, go home,

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.790
and watch the NFL Network
on a 70-inch screen--

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:56.637
priorities.

00:24:56.637 --> 00:24:57.470
Like what are your--

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.250
I don't follow sports.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.500
DeAndre Levy is a buddy of mine.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.490
We met last year.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:05.870
He was a dude at the bar.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:06.700
I just thought he
went to the gym a lot.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.650
I didn't know who he was.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:08.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.548
I'm talking to this
guy, oh, what's up?

00:25:09.548 --> 00:25:10.014
You like food?

00:25:10.014 --> 00:25:10.480
Yeah, cool.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.688
We're just shooting the shit.

00:25:11.688 --> 00:25:12.860
I go back, I'm cooking.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.796
And like, that's fucking
DeAndre Levy, man.

00:25:15.796 --> 00:25:17.282
I was like, who?

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:18.415
Is he a rapper?

00:25:18.415 --> 00:25:19.776
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:19.776 --> 00:25:20.275
Who is he?

00:25:20.275 --> 00:25:21.960
Like, no, he's with the Lions.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.170
I was like, oh, shit.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:23.890
Great, you know?

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.390
And now I know who
he is, obviously.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.220
And I pay attention to
the Lions this year.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.679
But I never watched a football
game in my life before that.

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:31.845
JASON ANDREAS: Can you talk
a little bit about that?

00:25:31.845 --> 00:25:33.250
You segue perfectly into it.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:37.150
So with DeAndre, who's a
Detroit Lions football player,

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:41.010
you're doing kind of like
a charity dinner series.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.760
You've done other
things in the community,

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.090
too, in terms of working
with local schools

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:50.050
to teach kids about culinary
arts and cooking and food

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:51.550
sourcing and things like that.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.383
You've also done some
things with technology

00:25:53.383 --> 00:25:55.777
around local doctors
as well, helping people

00:25:55.777 --> 00:25:57.360
learn how to cook
healthy food, right?

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.470
So there's a lot of
things you're involved in.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:00.680
You're very busy, obviously.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.980
Can you talk a little bit about
that community interaction,

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:03.490
too?

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:04.240
JAMES RIGATO: Yes.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.700
I do a lot of charity work,
I guess you would call it.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.560
But I don't want to
call it charity work.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.900
I just like to make changes.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:11.665
I love change.

00:26:11.665 --> 00:26:14.215
I hate anything
that stays in place.

00:26:14.215 --> 00:26:16.140
I get bored very easily.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.920
So when I was at
the Root, I would

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.360
donate my time to local
elementary schools

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.110
and teach the second
grade, third grade classes

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:26.960
how to cook, right?

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.001
And then I got teamed up
with my friend Michelle,

00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:30.200
and we did hydroponics.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.810
So Eastover Elementary
has hydroponics

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:32.520
in their classrooms.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.740
So kids are growing their
own vegetables and stuff.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.255
And then you want to see
a six-year-old eat kale?

00:26:37.255 --> 00:26:38.427
Have him grow it.

00:26:38.427 --> 00:26:39.760
And then they're all about that.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.010
If you chop it up
and put it on a plate

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.468
they don't want to
touch that shit.

00:26:42.468 --> 00:26:45.002
If they like pluck a tomato,
they'll pop it in their mouth.

00:26:45.002 --> 00:26:46.210
They're cleaning green beans.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.100
You know what I'm saying?

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.599
They'll put a marble
in their mouth.

00:26:48.599 --> 00:26:49.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.060
But they are engaged--

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.275
I have nephews, and I'm
like, this is liver.

00:26:54.275 --> 00:26:55.150
And they're like, ew.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.200
I'm like, why?

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.850
I don't know.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:58.390
It's not ew.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:59.670
It's part of the animal.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:00.640
OK.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.370
It's like you can
reason with them.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.786
So I do that up at the Root a
lot with elementary schools,

00:27:04.786 --> 00:27:08.400
doctors, like a
lot of pediatrics.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.150
There's a lot of
overweight kids nowadays,

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.490
so helping that
from the ground up.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.800
But DeAndre and I--

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.730
I've been active
with reaching out

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.130
to the youth for a long time.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.920
DeAndre mentioned that he wants
to some kind of charity event,

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:21.830
doesn't know how.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.539
He was terrified of
hosting an event,

00:27:23.539 --> 00:27:25.580
because he's like, I don't
know to host an event.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.080
I've never worked
in a restaurant.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.920
I don't know what it looks like.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.210
Yeah, let's do a dinner.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.357
And we talked.

00:27:30.357 --> 00:27:32.690
He'll text me every day at
like 2:00 in the morning with

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:33.856
like, well, what about this?

00:27:33.856 --> 00:27:36.490
I'm like, dude, I got
you, like calm down.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.480
So we did Regenerate Detroit.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.810
We raised-- I don't remember
what it was. $24,000?

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.750
I think we raised $24,000,
which is [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.060
Schoolcraft scholarship.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.430
So we picked one young
man who wrote an essay,

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.020
a beautiful essay--
it really moved me--

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.300
Brandon Johnson.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.800
And we picked him, and we bought
him a fill-ride scholarship

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.500
to Schoolcraft.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.750
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.440
JAMES RIGATO: And
he wrote an essay.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.900
He basically dropped
out of high school

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.380
and then kind of thought
about, went back, got his GED,

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.880
had three different jobs in the
culinary field and was like,

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.460
this is my purpose.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.620
So he's going to
Schoolcraft now.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.480
And we did another
one, at Chartreuse.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.430
We hosted another one, raised
a similar amount of money.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.250
And that went the
Detroit Food Academy,

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:19.180
almost like in a trust of
like, let's see what the next--

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.670
maybe we do smaller
scholarships or more.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.450
So we're building a
trust now with our events

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.920
to impact the
Detroit foods scene.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.975
Basically the
conversation came from,

00:28:28.975 --> 00:28:31.099
there's a lot of restaurants
opening up in Detroit.

00:28:31.099 --> 00:28:32.840
We got Shake Shack coming.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.399
Wahlburgers is there, Marcus
Samuelson is snooping around.

00:28:37.399 --> 00:28:39.440
Andrew Carmellini is
looking at the Sinola Hotel.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.830
There's some serious
ongoings happening right now.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.680
Sounds really, really corporate.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.660
A lot of it's
pretty white-bread.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.440
So my issue was like, here
we have a people, Detroit

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.750
resident, whoever you are--

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.100
Middle Eastern, black, white.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.210
I don't care who you are.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:00.745
If you have survive
the Detroit ups

00:29:00.745 --> 00:29:03.140
and and downs of the last 10,
15 years, in the food scene

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.120
especially, you have
something to say.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.000
So I want more of that narrative
involved in the food scene.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.820
So I want more of
the youths in Detroit

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.790
to have access to
the education that I

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.160
went to and then to
actually contribute back

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.080
to the food scene.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.446
I think we're going to have
way better restaurants, we're

00:29:17.446 --> 00:29:18.911
going to have
better food writers,

00:29:18.911 --> 00:29:21.160
we're going to gave better
everything, better markets,

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.090
if we have a narrative.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:28.000
And that's been my
conversation nationally.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.490
We have a cuisine in
Michigan, very much

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:31.510
an indigenous cuisine.

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.620
We're actually really honing it
in in the metro Detroit area.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.140
And I want to develop
the infrastructure

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.180
with the actual
body of workforce

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:43.060
that we have with the youth
and the existing chefs.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.079
But I also want to
see it be indigenous.

00:29:45.079 --> 00:29:47.620
I'm not interested in what-- no
offense to Andrew Carmellini.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.078
I'm not interested
in what the fuck

00:29:49.078 --> 00:29:50.586
he has to say
about Detroit food.

00:29:50.586 --> 00:29:52.002
I'm very excited
to have him here.

00:29:52.002 --> 00:29:54.727
He's a very intelligent
chef, and if he's watching,

00:29:54.727 --> 00:29:55.560
I'm like, much love.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.760
You're badass.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.661
But just like he's
not interested in what

00:29:59.661 --> 00:30:01.660
my point of view on the
New York food scene is--

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.004
I'm not going to open a
restaurant in New York

00:30:03.004 --> 00:30:04.340
and be like, yo, this
is New York food.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.548
And I doubt he's going to
do that in Detroit, either.

00:30:06.548 --> 00:30:09.130
But I think we have
so much to say here.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.080
It's almost like--
think about New Orleans.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.250
Think about Creole cuisine.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.405
Think about Boston and
New England cuisine.

00:30:14.405 --> 00:30:16.720
Think about Pacific Northwest
and Portland, Oregon.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.080
They have something going on.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.302
They have something to say.

00:30:20.302 --> 00:30:21.760
So when you go to
Portland, Oregon,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.801
you want to eat at a
Portland, Oregon restaurant.

00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:26.590
You don't want to go track
down Mitchell's fish market

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.166
and just eat some salmon
out of the Columbia River

00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:30.040
because you're there.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.230
I want to know what a
Portland chef has to say.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.415
And Detroit right now
is teetering on that.

00:30:35.415 --> 00:30:37.590
We have about 100
restaurants open up 2016.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.000
Real talk-- two were good.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.050
We don't need more
macaroni and cheese, man.

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.070
We need like real
food, real chefs.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:50.030
So that alienates me a little
bit, Because I say that shit.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:52.270
And if you're one of
those restaurateurs,

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:56.306
you're like, OK, well,
I know he likes Kotoi.

00:30:56.306 --> 00:30:57.680
I know he's cool
with Grey Ghost.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.270
Well, fuck.

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.756
That means those are the
two that he's talking about.

00:30:59.756 --> 00:31:00.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.750
And I'm running one that he's
not, so like fuck that guy.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:04.850
I sell mac and cheese.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:05.610
Fuck that guy.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:06.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.523
So like seriously, do we
need more mac and cheese

00:31:10.523 --> 00:31:11.670
in this town?

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.600
Every time you serve
macaroni and cheese,

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.504
a culinary idea in Detroit dies.

00:31:15.504 --> 00:31:17.170
JASON ANDREAS: My
four-year-old daughter

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:18.887
would say yes, more
mac and cheese.

00:31:18.887 --> 00:31:21.220
And there couldn't be enough
mac and cheese in the city.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:21.790
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.248
JASON ANDREAS: I
feel like Detroit,

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:25.990
though, based on the history
of folks who have lived here

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.570
for more than just
a few years, they

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:31.000
have this sense of
authenticity, too, though.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.890
When there's
unauthentic-- I mean,

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.970
there's space for any
new restaurant, sure,

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:36.820
and some will do well, and
some won't, depending on--

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.400
JAMES RIGATO: You can open.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.024
There's no guarantee
you're gonna stay.

00:31:39.024 --> 00:31:41.120
JASON ANDREAS: But I
feel like the reason

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.662
a restaurant like
Mabel Gray or Katoi

00:31:42.662 --> 00:31:44.078
or some of these
other restaurants

00:31:44.078 --> 00:31:46.210
have done so well recently,
or Selden Standard,

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.400
some of the top of
the top, is there's

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.450
an authenticity to them.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:52.900
There's a local-ness to them
that people who live in Detroit

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.810
and live downtown or go downtown
to visit these restaurants,

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:56.860
they feel that, right?

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.610
And I don't know
exactly what it is.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:01.630
But I think it's mostly not a
New York chef coming in and not

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:02.860
a Chicago chef coming in.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.276
Even if they have
those influence,

00:32:04.276 --> 00:32:07.180
it's a lot of local
folks really kind of have

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.900
the feel of the city behind it.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.400
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah,
I totally agree.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.820
That's the thing, too, is like
I walk that line, because I

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.014
get called out all
the time because I

00:32:14.014 --> 00:32:15.900
went on "Top Chef,"
James from Detroit.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.566
Well, as you all
heard, I'm from Howell.

00:32:17.566 --> 00:32:19.170
My restaurant is in Hazel Park.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.130
So I don't walk around
like, yo, I'm so Detroit.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:24.060
My restaurant's so Detroit.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.150
But be real.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.860
Like Michigan is what
I represent, for one.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.345
Because I buy so much of
the state's resources.

00:32:31.345 --> 00:32:33.970
I also hang out in the west side
of the state with those chefs.

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:36.080
And I go to Traverse
City with [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.450
Michigan to me is our
strength nationally

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:40.830
from a cuisines standpoint.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:42.740
Food kind of buries
all politics.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:43.820
Everybody eats.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.910
So when I talk about
food, it's like it's food.

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:47.740
Michigan is very much
what I represent.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.210
Detroit happens to just be
our real capital, politically

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:52.480
and culinarily.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.010
That's our real
capital of Michigan.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:55.718
So Detroit is definitely
like the center.

00:32:55.718 --> 00:32:57.100
That's the bullseye.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.695
My restaurant is not
downtown Detroit.

00:32:58.695 --> 00:33:00.570
And that's not because
I don't want it to be.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.785
But I don't know if
you've hung out Eight

00:33:01.785 --> 00:33:03.700
to Ten Mile on
[INAUDIBLE] last 10 years,

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.320
but there hasn't
been shit going on.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.730
And Hazel Park is like a
town that's seen better days.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.230
And now it's kind
of on the upswing.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.000
But I take a town
like Hazel Park,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.490
and all boats need to
rise with that tide.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.170
I think that Hazel Park needs
love and attention, too.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:22.920
So that's why I
went to Hazel Park.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.420
But there is an authenticity.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.080
And I think because
if you stayed here

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.690
and you cooked here, and
it's like, how many macaroni

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.670
and cheeses have I
had to fucking serve

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.660
to get to where I
don't have to anymore?

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.460
And if you walk in the back
door, and you're like, yo,

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.900
I'm at the party,
it's like, yeah,

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.730
but you didn't
wait in line, man.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.489
Like we waited in line.

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:46.780
It's like you walk into a
concert and have VIP tickets.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:47.520
They're all comfortable.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.353
They got a cocktail.

00:33:48.353 --> 00:33:51.070
It's like, I've been
outside in a tent.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.780
So I think that's
the difference.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.239
When you go to a restaurant
like Mabel, you feel that shit.

00:33:55.239 --> 00:33:56.863
You're also seeing
me behind the stove.

00:33:56.863 --> 00:33:58.890
Like if you don't like
Mabel, you don't like me.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.190
And that's OK.

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:01.670
But that's what it is.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:05.260
That's the realest-- like you go
to New York, like a restaurant,

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.120
the chef's got four locations.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.530
You've never even seen him.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:09.380
You can go to a
restaurant [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.135
and never even know who owns it.

00:34:11.135 --> 00:34:12.760
But if you go to
Mabel and you're like,

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.662
I hate that, there's a
good chance I made that.

00:34:15.662 --> 00:34:17.120
So if you don't--
like you hate me.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:17.995
That's kind of like--

00:34:17.995 --> 00:34:18.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:19.940
That's Detroit to me.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.348
That's like the realest shit.

00:34:23.348 --> 00:34:23.889
I don't know.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:25.763
Like if you're mad at
the Lions, like I said,

00:34:25.763 --> 00:34:27.320
you might run into DeAndre Levy.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.510
Like you can hide.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:30.260
You can Instagram.

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.010
Your can bullshit.

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.690
You can Yelp.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:35.294
But Detroit is a
pretty upfront town.

00:34:35.294 --> 00:34:36.237
Like I'm out.

00:34:36.237 --> 00:34:36.820
You mad at me?

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.010
You ate in my restaurant.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:38.780
I'm right here.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:39.687
Let's talk about it.

00:34:39.687 --> 00:34:40.770
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, sure.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.513
JAMES RIGATO: Also, do you
guys partner with Yelp?

00:34:43.513 --> 00:34:44.929
JASON ANDREAS:
Nothing direct, no.

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:45.720
JAMES RIGATO: Good.

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.400
JASON ANDREAS: I do have
a question here about--

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.931
we mentioned it ahead of time.

00:34:50.931 --> 00:34:52.139
So obviously we're at Google.

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:53.860
We talk about
technology when we can.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:59.020
And there's obviously
unwanted or wanted connection

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.970
between restaurants
and technology

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:02.710
that's grown a lot in
the past few years.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.620
We talk about this all
the time, so social media,

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.601
Twitter, OpenTable.

00:35:07.601 --> 00:35:09.600
I mean, some of these are
good, right, I'm sure.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.600
OpenTable helps.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.308
There's companies like
[INAUDIBLE], which

00:35:12.308 --> 00:35:14.080
was started by a few
former Googlers that

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.390
helps with some of the
larger-scale restaurants

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:17.514
doing ticketing, right?

00:35:17.514 --> 00:35:19.180
But then you've got
something like Yelp,

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.355
where it's either
100%, like you had

00:35:21.355 --> 00:35:23.230
the best experience of
your life or the worst

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.100
experience of your life, and
there's nothing in between.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.370
So how do you deal with that?

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:30.775
Because it's the faceless,
either good or bad feedback.

00:35:30.775 --> 00:35:32.900
So it sounds like you've
got your feelings on Yelp.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.177
But I'm just curious with
like technology in general.

00:35:35.177 --> 00:35:36.760
Like what does that
look like for you?

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.940
JAMES RIGATO: Well, to
me, obviously social media

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:39.607
is great, right?

00:35:39.607 --> 00:35:41.439
I mean, you obviously
can reach an audience.

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:43.815
I can post like, yo, I'm doing
a dinner with Matt Millar.

00:35:43.815 --> 00:35:44.314
Boop!

00:35:44.314 --> 00:35:45.040
Sold out.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.240
So it has its impact, obviously
from a business standpoint.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.930
Yelp, though,
places like Yelp, I

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:56.710
don't think the world
needs more platforms

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.959
for the under-informed
to communicate.

00:35:58.959 --> 00:36:01.000
I always said Yelp is like
passing the microphone

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.270
on a Trump rally.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.840
God knows what you're gonna get.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.610
And it's really what it is.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.186
It's just the
Yahtzee of feedback.

00:36:10.186 --> 00:36:13.490
And people-- I got so many
one-star reviews for Mabel

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:15.060
on Yelp from people
that didn't eat

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:18.164
there, like literally,
tried to get in, hour wait.

00:36:18.164 --> 00:36:20.580
Even though the website, when
you're making a reservation,

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.540
we're like, hey, just so you
know, peak-time reservations

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.582
run up to 30 minutes late,
sometimes even longer.

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:26.206
We have local bars
that we send you to.

00:36:26.206 --> 00:36:27.730
We're happy to
provide free fucking

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:29.930
champagne, true champagne,
as a matter of fact.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.180
JASON ANDREAS: Real champagne?

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.980
JAMES RIGATO: So we
let you know, like, yo,

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:33.665
this is what Mabel's about.

00:36:33.665 --> 00:36:34.420
We're tiny.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.990
Sometimes diners
leave in an hour.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:37.323
Sometimes it's an hour and half.

00:36:37.323 --> 00:36:40.700
So there will be some wait.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.214
Reservation is not a guaranteed
seat waiting for you.

00:36:43.214 --> 00:36:44.380
And still I'll get one star.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.891
We waited a half hour.

00:36:45.891 --> 00:36:47.140
Who does this guy think he is?

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.850
Fuck James Rigato.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:49.360
Top Chef?

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.106
More like Bomb Chef, Pizza Chef.

00:36:51.106 --> 00:36:53.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.055
And so, what do I do with this?

00:36:55.055 --> 00:36:55.930
Is that constructive?

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:56.660
No.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.950
If somebody says like, five
stars, had a great time,

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:02.246
music was a little
loud, I prefer

00:37:02.246 --> 00:37:04.120
to have more fish on
the menu, I'll read that

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.110
and say, oh, shit, OK, like
let's do another fish dish.

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:09.360
Like that's like constructive.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.070
So one out of 20
is like somebody

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.920
that's mildly educated
and appropriate.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.740
So like I'm like,
yeah, that's nice.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:18.446
Thank you.

00:37:18.446 --> 00:37:21.370
And I mean educated like in a
restaurant service industry.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.140
I don't mean like life.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.400
You can have a Master's
degree and still be a dick.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.760
But the thing about
service industry,

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.150
though, is like
there's an education.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.870
And you can tell.

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:37.990
Service people are so
specific the way they dine.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:41.080
Like I don't even
like to tip 20%.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:41.890
I tip like 40%.

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:44.890
Like I watch somebody work
for me for, whatever, an hour,

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.770
two hours that I'm at a table,
and to like leave them like--

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:50.710
if I happen to nosh and we got a
cheap bottle of wine and chill,

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.626
or if I ball out and get
a bottle of champagne

00:37:52.626 --> 00:37:55.330
at at tasting menu, I feel like
if you visit my table 10 times,

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:56.920
and you generally care,
you're pouring water

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.003
and you're asking how I
feel and you take my coat,

00:37:59.003 --> 00:37:59.780
like, fuck, man.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.200
How could I not give you $50?

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.350
Like Jesus Christ,
like here you go, man.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.740
Like industry people take
care of industry people.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.960
It's a subculture in America.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.387
I think that luckily we
get a lot of that at Mabel.

00:38:12.387 --> 00:38:13.720
We get a lot of industry people.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.636
And they're wonderful.

00:38:14.636 --> 00:38:17.560
Every now and then you get some
assholes who throw shade or are

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.557
mad or they disagree.

00:38:19.557 --> 00:38:21.140
I'm in the industry,
and you shouldn't

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.650
talk to guests that way.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.690
There's a certain--
turn the music down!

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.110
We get that a lot.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:31.090
Which, for the record, I like
the music loud at Mabel Gray,

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.760
because it creates privacy.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.010
This is one thing I feel
like people don't understand.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:36.040
Mabel is in a tin can.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.025
It's 43 seats.

00:38:37.025 --> 00:38:39.050
It's a 1,600-square-foot
building,

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.080
including half of it
being kitchen and dish.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.730
So it's a tiny
little dining space.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.490
And when you're sitting
this close to another guest,

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:48.960
and if you're telling somebody,
like, I'm getting divorced,

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.682
my wife slept with another man--

00:38:50.682 --> 00:38:51.345
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:51.345 --> 00:38:52.780
I think that should be private.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:54.698
JASON ANDREAS: I agree.

00:38:54.698 --> 00:38:56.630
JAMES RIGATO: Like if
you hear, like whatever,

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:59.950
like a loud song playing and
you can get away with that,

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.660
I'm gay!

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.419
Like you can get away like
no one else hearing that,

00:39:04.419 --> 00:39:05.460
I think that's important.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.660
So that's why the
music is a pinch louder

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.960
than the average restaurant.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.800
JASON ANDREAS: Understood, Yeah.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.466
JAMES RIGATO: I'm not forcing my
favorite song down your throat.

00:39:11.466 --> 00:39:12.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.590
It literally becomes
a wall of privacy.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.400
And ever now and then,
the music will go out,

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.310
the Wi-Fi will go out, and it
will be silent for a couple

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:18.550
minutes, and it sucks.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.675
Because you can literally--

00:39:19.675 --> 00:39:22.881
I can hear table 27, like,
I have athlete's foot.

00:39:22.881 --> 00:39:24.605
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:24.605 --> 00:39:27.240
Oh, my god, like, turn
the music back on!

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.990
JASON ANDREAS: Turn
the knob a little bit.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.970
Crank it up a little bit more.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.178
JAMES RIGATO: With technology,
back to your question,

00:39:32.178 --> 00:39:35.040
yeah, some parts of it are
good, like social media good,

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.082
Yelp sucks, Google great.

00:39:36.082 --> 00:39:37.123
JASON ANDREAS: Thank you.

00:39:37.123 --> 00:39:37.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:38.890
JAMES RIGATO: No, legit.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:40.750
How many times a day
do I say, Google it?

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:41.500
I swear to God.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.081
Someone's like, Chef, where
does this crab come from?

00:39:45.081 --> 00:39:48.030
I'm like, Google it!

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:49.530
Like I like to
answer questions, but

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.590
like if you have like a really--

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:55.040
like Tellicherry peppercorns,
where are they from?

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.260
You walked from the back.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.280
You could have found
it faster on Google.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.060
So I literally say "Google
it" like every day.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:05.700
But then honestly, Wi-Fi
Bluetooth speakers sucks, man.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.640
I hate that shit.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.605
Because like, oh,
Wi-Fi is acting up.

00:40:08.605 --> 00:40:11.006
Well, then you have no music.

00:40:11.006 --> 00:40:12.630
I get annoyed with
some of the modern--

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.870
like Helios isn't synced
up with Spotify today.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.530
Well, great.

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:17.800
That shit drives me crazy.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.310
JASON ANDREAS: Technology
is good when it works.

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:20.226
JAMES RIGATO: Exactly.

00:40:20.226 --> 00:40:23.380
I think we did a little
too much too fast.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.760
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.958
JAMES RIGATO: My iPod Classic
burned out a couple years ago,

00:40:26.958 --> 00:40:27.954
and I had it forever.

00:40:27.954 --> 00:40:28.950
JASON ANDREAS: Nice.

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.880
JAMES RIGATO: Man, I still had
like 32 gigs of space on that.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.374
And I'm like, ugh.

00:40:33.374 --> 00:40:35.290
Some of the modern
technology drives me crazy.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:36.510
JASON ANDREAS: Absolutely.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.940
On the tipping point, I'm a
good tipper in my own eyes.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:40.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.100
But my wife used to
work in a restaurant.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.580
She was a waitress when
she was in high school.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.770
And I feel like every
time I sign a bill,

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.570
she always kind of glances
over just to make sure

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.530
that I tipped enough.

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:48.942
JAMES RIGATO: Make sure
you're not an asshole.

00:40:48.942 --> 00:40:51.400
JASON ANDREAS: [LAUGHING] I
think that's her full-time job.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.350
JAMES RIGATO: I mean,
honestly, to met,

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:56.290
the ballingest servers
that I know in Detroit area

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.819
like maybe 60 grand a year.

00:40:58.819 --> 00:40:59.860
That's people that grind.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:00.985
That's like career service.

00:41:00.985 --> 00:41:02.359
Don't you think
if you are really

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:05.160
good at something for 10, 15
years, you could break $60K?

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.510
You know what I'm saying?

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:10.270
So tipping-- I don't know.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:13.300
To me, look at it
like a service.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.010
You go get a pedicure.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.060
It's maybe 25 minutes.

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.140
It's like $36.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.075
And they're not really
spending any money

00:41:19.075 --> 00:41:20.950
on you, a little water,
a little bit of soap.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:21.880
It's a service, right?

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.150
So to me, if somebody scrubs
your toes for a half hour,

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:26.484
you give them like $30.

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:28.150
So if someone waits
on you for two hours

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.400
and you give them
like $15, it's like--

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.320
I don't know, man.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.420
I don't dig it.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.640
Oh, like boo-hoo of our servers
start making $100 grand a year.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.790
Like they're fucking scarping
plates, sweeping floors.

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:41.889
You know, if you puke in
your plate they clean it up.

00:41:41.889 --> 00:41:42.930
You know what I'm saying?

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:45.499
Your kid smashes crumbs into
the carpet, they vacuum it.

00:41:45.499 --> 00:41:46.582
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, sure.

00:41:46.582 --> 00:41:46.725
I agree.

00:41:46.725 --> 00:41:48.240
JAMES RIGATO: You ralph
in the bathroom man,

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.880
they're-- you know
what I'm saying?

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.580
And the service industry is
like a special group of people.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:56.979
We are like second
to like nurses.

00:41:56.979 --> 00:41:58.020
You know what I'm saying?

00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.394
And like janitors.

00:41:59.394 --> 00:42:01.060
The other day in some
New York Magazine,

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.649
I don't know who it was, called
me at the Root, four years ago

00:42:03.649 --> 00:42:04.190
or something.

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:05.770
You know, Sean, you've
got a phone call.

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.086
I was literally in the bathroom,
mopping up the bathroom,

00:42:08.086 --> 00:42:10.035
because I was there early
and the night before,

00:42:10.035 --> 00:42:11.118
they didn't do a good job.

00:42:11.118 --> 00:42:12.682
Yeah, hey, what's up?

00:42:12.682 --> 00:42:14.640
Hey, this is so-and-so
from so-and-so magazine.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.720
Cool, what's up?

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.994
What's it like being the
best chef in Michigan?

00:42:17.994 --> 00:42:19.962
I was like what the
fuck question is that?

00:42:19.962 --> 00:42:21.980
I was like, dude I'm
mopping up piss right now.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.740
That's how it feels.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.534
I'm like, I'm a janitor.

00:42:23.534 --> 00:42:25.860
I was like what are you talking
about best chef in Michigan?

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.030
Don't give me that bull.

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:29.127
So you can like sneak
a quote out of me

00:42:29.127 --> 00:42:30.210
about being the best chef?

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:31.486
Get the fuck out of here.

00:42:31.486 --> 00:42:33.482
I'm mopping piss, print that.

00:42:33.482 --> 00:42:35.940
JASON ANDREAS: I was going to
ask you about the James Beard

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.106
nomination, but I feel like
that's a terrible segue.

00:42:38.106 --> 00:42:42.167
So I got to put this
question aside now.

00:42:42.167 --> 00:42:43.000
They're kind of out.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:43.882
Because there was two on that.

00:42:43.882 --> 00:42:45.340
JAMES RIGATO: That's
an honor, man.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.970
James Beard Foundation
is a real governing body.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:52.230
You know, I feel like it's
an uncontaminated source

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:53.870
of accolades.

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:54.370
You know?

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:55.411
JASON ANDREAS: Certainly.

00:42:55.411 --> 00:42:58.520
JAMES RIGATO: I don't know
many chefs that I don't respect

00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.280
that have--

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.310
I don't see anybody that's
like James Beard award winner

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.120
and they suck.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.161
You know what I'm saying?

00:43:04.161 --> 00:43:07.470
Like it's really a
legit industry accolade.

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:09.875
So if you see James Beard
you can trust that blindly.

00:43:09.875 --> 00:43:12.000
You know, I think even over
Michelin, to be honest.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.740
Michelin is a pinch elitist.

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:14.460
You know?

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.640
They have some interesting--
and I don't want to say blindly,

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.100
I shouldn't say that blindly.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.185
Michelin targets a lot
of the upper crust.

00:43:21.185 --> 00:43:23.310
You know, and they're
changing that internationally

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:24.540
through the Singapore Food cart.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.060
You know what I'm saying?

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.360
They're changing it.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.100
But Michelin often has--

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.305
the restaurant changes
with Michelin, right?

00:43:31.305 --> 00:43:33.650
The kind of, like, two
stars wants to be three.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:35.730
And in order to get
three the China changes,

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:36.990
the reservation changes.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:38.940
It just feels rigid.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.780
Michelin's like you
want to stab somebody.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.320
James Beard is
like I've got fear.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.686
It's like I want to cry.

00:43:46.686 --> 00:43:49.380
It's like, oh my god, my life's
work has meaned something.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.710
Michelin feels like--
it makes you crazy.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.690
It's like coke or something.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.060
You just want more.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.460
Like it's dangerous.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:59.343
All the chefs that I know that
have Michelin literally they're

00:43:59.343 --> 00:44:00.283
all fucking skittish.

00:44:00.283 --> 00:44:02.352
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, they
don't want to lose it, right?

00:44:02.352 --> 00:44:03.020
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah, it's
like it's terrifying.

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:03.680
JASON ANDREAS: It's
all they focus on.

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.513
JAMES RIGATO: It's like
if you get two stars

00:44:05.513 --> 00:44:06.810
it's a pat on the back, right?

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.050
Then next year you
go down to one.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:08.695
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah

00:44:08.695 --> 00:44:09.810
JAMES RIGATO: You
fucking blew it.

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.200
JASON ANDREAS: It's a disaster.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.862
Even though you're
still a one star.

00:44:12.862 --> 00:44:14.340
JAMES RIGATO: Even
though you're one star.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.390
James Beard you get an award,
if you never get it again

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:16.260
no one's mad at you.

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:17.421
It's like an Oscar.

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:18.670
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah,
put it on your mantel

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:19.290
and it's good to go.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:21.665
JAMES RIGATO: Like you were
an Oscar award winning actor.

00:44:21.665 --> 00:44:24.410
Who cares it was in 1976,
you're still an actor.

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:25.932
So Michelin scares me.

00:44:25.932 --> 00:44:27.640
I don't want Michelin
to come to Detroit.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.749
It just scares me.

00:44:28.749 --> 00:44:30.540
JASON ANDREAS: We've
got some time probably

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:31.373
before that happens.

00:44:31.373 --> 00:44:32.760
JAMES RIGATO: We very much do.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.969
But James Beard
that's a little more--

00:44:34.969 --> 00:44:36.010
that's more, like, feels.

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:37.551
I just went to the
James Beard dinner

00:44:37.551 --> 00:44:40.160
at the James Beard
House in New York.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:44.000
And I teamed up my buddy Ryan
Burke who is a cider maker.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.028
And he was actually at Virtue in
Michigan when Virtue was good,

00:44:47.028 --> 00:44:48.780
sorry.

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.970
But you know this wild
fermentation, crazy,

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.840
cool like give me original
American style cider.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.300
It's funky, tart.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.790
Makes cider, like cider
for the wine drinker.

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:00.142
You know, dynamic cider.

00:45:00.142 --> 00:45:01.350
Angry Orchard scooped his up.

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:02.750
I don't know if
you guys to know,

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.613
Angry Orchard is the
largest cider producer

00:45:04.613 --> 00:45:05.779
in the United States, right?

00:45:05.779 --> 00:45:09.040
They're like crisp apple,
the generic sweet version

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.510
that all- the cougar
juice I like to call it.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.650
Moms just go to
Buffalo Wild Wings

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:16.480
and get smashed on cougar juice.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.906
Like, that stuff is
fine, but it's sweet

00:45:18.906 --> 00:45:20.280
and it's for the
American pallet.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.655
It's kind of like new Mike's
Hard Lemonade, to be honest.

00:45:22.655 --> 00:45:24.467
Better made but it's
Mike's Hard Lemonade.

00:45:24.467 --> 00:45:25.300
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:26.832
JAMES RIGATO: Smirnoff Ice,
Zima you know what I'm saying?

00:45:26.832 --> 00:45:27.916
JASON ANDREAS: Sure, yeah.

00:45:27.916 --> 00:45:29.373
JAMES RIGATO:
Bartles &amp; Jaymes wine

00:45:29.373 --> 00:45:31.476
coolers they're always in
a slot for cougar juice.

00:45:31.476 --> 00:45:33.246
This is the current
cougar juice.

00:45:33.246 --> 00:45:36.790
But it's owned by Sam
Adams Boston Beer Company.

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:39.216
And Jim Coke being
the billionaire owner

00:45:39.216 --> 00:45:41.550
of that, basically approached
Ryan, plucked him out

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.770
of Virtue, and was like,
come make Angry Orchard.

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:46.590
I want to do what you do under
our umbrella, make it cool,

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:47.520
build a cider house.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.515
Like made Angry Orchard cool.

00:45:49.515 --> 00:45:52.140
And the best example I can give
you guys, and I've told people.

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.615
I now wearing Angry
Orchard shirts.

00:45:53.615 --> 00:45:55.740
I did a collaboration you
know, at the beard house.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.300
I'm going, yo, Angry
Orchard's sweet.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.070
90 percent of the
population thinks

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.845
I'm talking about cougar juice.

00:46:00.845 --> 00:46:02.911
I'm like, no, I have a
whole new like the vision

00:46:02.911 --> 00:46:04.660
coming out that's going
to blow your mind.

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.100
It's the best cider
I've ever tasted.

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:09.460
But it's kind of
like if NIckelback

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.870
dropped the most metal album.

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:12.030
You know?

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.475
And even like Zakk
Wylde was like,

00:46:13.475 --> 00:46:14.850
this is the greatest
metal album.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:16.290
It's like that's what
would happen, right?

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:18.391
Nickelback really is about
to drop the best metal

00:46:18.391 --> 00:46:19.520
album in history.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.110
And every metal head is
like, yes, like this--

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:23.670
Like, all the cider
makers in America

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:26.360
are like, yes, Ryan is the
best cider maker in America.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.510
JASON ANDREAS: That might
be the best endorsement

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:28.690
I've ever heard of anything.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:30.060
JAMES RIGATO: I mean it.

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:30.700
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, well done.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:31.200
JAMES RIGATO: Swear
to God, look it up.

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:31.525
JASON ANDREAS:
That's impressive.

00:46:31.525 --> 00:46:33.830
JAMES RIGATO: Their line
of ciders coming out

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:35.581
is an American Revolution
of cider making.

00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:36.830
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.052
JAMES RIGATO: Sam Adams is,
like, changing the game.

00:46:39.052 --> 00:46:41.260
Angry Orchard is, you know,
because that's Sam Adams,

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.570
is changing the game of cider.

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.680
I mean, you're about to
get your minds blown.

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.513
JASON ANDREAS: Nice.

00:46:45.513 --> 00:46:48.120
JAMES RIGATO: But it's
very fun trying to endorse

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.332
them publicly right now.

00:46:49.332 --> 00:46:50.790
I'm jumping the
shark, essentially.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:51.490
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:53.621
JAMES RIGATO: People then they
go like, oh Angry Orchard, oh,

00:46:53.621 --> 00:46:54.746
what are you talking about?

00:46:54.746 --> 00:46:57.045
This isn't the best
cider in the world.

00:46:57.045 --> 00:46:59.590
JASON ANDREAS: Well, you
talked about when you cooked

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:01.120
for the James Beard Foundation.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:06.940
I think I read you named it
high society, the meal itself.

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.040
Like, was that
kind of a kick on--

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.280
JAMES RIGATO: No,
you're mistaken.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.020
That was the DAC.

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.404
The Trans Atlantic Club cooked,
like, a couple weeks before.

00:47:17.404 --> 00:47:18.320
JASON ANDREAS: Gotcha.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.750
JAMES RIGATO: They
called it high society.

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:21.670
JASON ANDREAS: Was that
their naming or your naming,

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:23.860
because I was curious if you
were tying that back to like

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:24.820
some of your roots?

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.080
JAMES RIGATO: No, I
mean that was really--

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.038
I think that was just--

00:47:27.038 --> 00:47:28.570
DAC kind of has that like--

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:30.361
we're actually doing
a collaboration dinner

00:47:30.361 --> 00:47:32.850
with the DAC, me,
Andy, Doug, and Anthony

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.040
Lamar, and [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.248
JASON ANDREAS: Oh, very cool.

00:47:35.248 --> 00:47:37.780
JAMES RIGATO: And, you know, I
kept telling him, I was like,

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.460
this is like Game
of Thrones shit.

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.170
The king is inviting
the vikings.

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:42.760
You know, I almost
feel like it's

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.807
like we should Trojan
horse them or something.

00:47:44.807 --> 00:47:45.640
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.630
JAMES RIGATO: Take them
to DAC, jeans everywhere.

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:52.200
But, like, Chef Kevin
is a really great guy.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.855
The DAC is just obviously
a 100 year old institution.

00:47:55.855 --> 00:47:58.400
So they were kind of like
the DAC going to New York

00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.810
was kind of like too
high societies meeting.

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:00.650
That was kind of their--

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:00.800
JASON ANDREAS: Got you.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:01.330
JAMES RIGATO: We
were, like I said,

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:03.560
I was just doing a
cider dinner throwdown.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.267
I'm like, this is us.

00:48:05.267 --> 00:48:06.850
Everyone was like,
oh are you nervous?

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:08.130
I'm like, not really.

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:10.570
I don't know, it's
like we're doing it.

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:11.785
I gave it all I had.

00:48:11.785 --> 00:48:12.650
I mean, I left it on the floor.

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:14.180
If you don't like it,
it's kind of like what

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.900
I say at Mabel, if you don't
like it, you don't want me,

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.160
that's OK.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:16.993
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:48:16.993 --> 00:48:19.140
JAMES RIGATO: So,
no, I don't think.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:22.213
Like I said, Mabel is the high
society of Hazel Park, right?

00:48:22.213 --> 00:48:25.510
That's like the $65 tasting
menu, which in New York City

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:26.652
is like a burger.

00:48:26.652 --> 00:48:27.152
You know?

00:48:27.152 --> 00:48:29.609
So like $65 is really
very under-priced.

00:48:29.609 --> 00:48:31.900
For an eight course tasting
menu of a restaurant that's

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.775
James Beard, you know,
nominated, blah, blah,

00:48:33.775 --> 00:48:37.130
it's probably $110 I'd say
is the average nationally.

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:39.390
So we're very much
on, we're almost half.

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:42.610
But I think that because
they have low rent, you know,

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:43.750
they can afford it.

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:45.250
I'm not going to--

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:46.360
I keep the restaurant.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.361
You know, I'm not trying to get
rich, you know what I'm saying?

00:48:49.361 --> 00:48:51.360
I want to be authentic,
you know, like you said.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.270
JASON ANDREAS: Very cool.

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:53.289
JAMES RIGATO: That's a
cool thing about the trade

00:48:53.289 --> 00:48:53.800
right now.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.100
JASON ANDREAS:
Authenticity for sure.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:55.430
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah.

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:57.388
So, no, I'm not really
interested in like going

00:48:57.388 --> 00:48:58.360
high society type.

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.360
JASON ANDREAS: Want open
it up to maybe a couple

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.510
audience questions.

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:05.240
Like I said, we've got a mic
over there or pass it around.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.260
But we have to capture it
for the video capture, which

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:09.670
is why we need the mic.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:10.615
So any one?

00:49:10.615 --> 00:49:12.490
[INAUDIBLE] you want to
run the mic if anyone

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:13.560
has any questions?

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:14.810
JAMES RIGATO: Don't be scared.

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:16.101
JASON ANDREAS: Don't be scared.

00:49:16.101 --> 00:49:18.215
JAMES RIGATO: It's
only [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:18.215 --> 00:49:19.840
JASON ANDREAS: Anyone
need reservations

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.570
while Chef Rigato is here?

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:25.630
A lot of hands raised.

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:28.760
JAMES RIGATO: Get to the mic.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:29.815
Yeah, pass it around.

00:49:29.815 --> 00:49:30.945
JASON ANDREAS: OK.

00:49:30.945 --> 00:49:31.820
Sorry, mic, go ahead.

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:33.010
AUDIENCE: Just a quick question.

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:34.051
You mentioned Hazel Park.

00:49:34.051 --> 00:49:36.830
Do you have ties to Hazel
Park or was it just,

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:40.360
hey, this is a cool area,
you know, rising tide?

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.275
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah.

00:49:41.275 --> 00:49:43.540
AUDIENCE: Obviously not
Birmingham, Bloomfield, crap

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.039
like that.

00:49:44.039 --> 00:49:47.274
But Hazel Park is
interesting, old park.

00:49:47.274 --> 00:49:48.940
I mean there's a lot
of cool other areas

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:49.898
that are up and coming.

00:49:49.898 --> 00:49:50.971
Just curious?

00:49:50.971 --> 00:49:53.220
JASON ANDREAS: Not midtown
either where a lot of folks

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.170
are flushing as well
So, yeah, very cool.

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:57.544
JAMES RIGATO: I mean, why
Hazel Park is a great question.

00:49:57.544 --> 00:50:01.201
So I lived in [INAUDIBLE]
for seven years I think.

00:50:01.201 --> 00:50:03.200
So I kind of used to
actually go down to the BMX

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.750
all around Hazel Park.

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:08.507
You know honestly that
town resonates with me.

00:50:08.507 --> 00:50:10.590
It's kind of like I grew
up kind of in a paradise.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:14.301
It was either, like, the dumpy
Catholic school kid trailer

00:50:14.301 --> 00:50:14.800
park.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.697
I was either like the
prissy Catholic school

00:50:16.697 --> 00:50:18.780
kid in the trailer park,
or the dumpy trailer park

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.084
kid in the Catholic school.

00:50:20.084 --> 00:50:21.250
Hazel Park kind of
has that mentality.

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:21.580
You know what I'm saying?

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.590
It's like next to
Ferndale, right?

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:27.322
Hazel Park is like
constantly not Ferndale.

00:50:27.322 --> 00:50:29.190
That's like, oh, it's
the next Ferndale.

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:30.130
And I always say,
like, bullshit.

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:30.430
Why?

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:31.640
Who wants to be
the next Ferndale?

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.140
Ferndale's is
Ferndale, let them be.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:34.470
I like Ferndale, like, cool.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:36.750
But, like, Hazel Park
is very much Hazel Park.

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:38.375
You know and like,
honestly, real talk,

00:50:38.375 --> 00:50:42.040
Hazel Park before Mabel Gray
has better food than Ferndale.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:45.144
Louie's Pizza, Pi's Thai, like
you can't mess with those guys.

00:50:45.144 --> 00:50:46.810
Man, Pi's has the
best Thai food around,

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:49.261
and Louie's Pizza is the
OG of like Detroit square.

00:50:49.261 --> 00:50:50.010
And we're buddies.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:51.910
I don't care.

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:54.130
So like Hazel Park
has that going for it.

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:58.570
For one it's naturally cool,
like it's got it's grit.

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:01.840
But it's like a forged grit.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.900
It's not like it's dangerous
therefore it's like cool.

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:09.145
It's not even dangerous, it's
just like people stuck it out,

00:51:09.145 --> 00:51:13.090
16,000 residents in a
very small little radius.

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:15.410
You know it's the two
bedroom houses, tiny yard.

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:18.670
You know, it's just got the
natural disposition of always

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:20.680
being an underdog suburb.

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.990
And I like that, man.

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:23.170
I feel that.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:27.410
And it also has these little
shotgun, cinder-block buildings

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:28.180
all over.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.370
Old tool and dye
shops, old diners.

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:34.470
So like I opened it
for $550,000 all in.

00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:36.220
You know, I own the
building we opened up.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:37.680
You can't do that.

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.210
That's like, shit,
that's a couple

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:41.519
of months rent in Birmingham.

00:51:41.519 --> 00:51:43.310
You can't do that in
a lot of other cities.

00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:47.250
And the city themselves,
how I opened up--

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:49.020
I cold called the City.

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.380
So I told them I'm
opening up a restaurant.

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:55.080
Went down to the city hall,
sat at a table with a city

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.390
manager, city planner,
city attorney.

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:58.800
I told them what I wanted to do.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.880
We got in one of
their cars, they

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.790
drove around and showed me
every vacant building that

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:03.195
fit what I was talking about.

00:52:03.195 --> 00:52:04.540
I said I like that one.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.636
They mediated the real
estate agent, made an offer,

00:52:07.636 --> 00:52:08.750
bought the building.

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:10.000
You know, what city does that?

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.655
I've never, you know, Root in
White Lake is like whatever.

00:52:13.655 --> 00:52:15.280
You know, that city
is not progressive.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.510
They don't give a shit.

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:19.690
They want to get you
in because it's like,

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:23.030
yeah, come on in, buy
a building, pay taxes.

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:25.110
Hazel Park's like--
they're [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:26.530
AUDIENCE: So that's awesome.

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:29.100
So then on, like,
following up to that,

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.650
did you have any concerns at
all about people finding you?

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:35.540
I mean, because you're not
going to get foot traffic,

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.320
there's certain aspects
to your business

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.670
that probably were
a bit concerning.

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:41.100
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah, very much.

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.433
I mean, you're absolutely right.

00:52:42.433 --> 00:52:45.810
I don't have the
anchor tent, right,

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:47.470
I'm not next to the theatre.

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:49.500
I'm not in [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.710
But the thing about Mabel was
it's an offshoot essentially

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:54.490
of the Root.

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:56.430
So I have a following
at the Root.

00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:58.080
It's 43 seats.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.300
The cool thing about Mabel
is we can dial it back.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:03.570
Worst case scenario it could be
like me and my girlfriend Sam,

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:05.560
you know, and like 10 customers.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.250
We can dial it as far
back as we need to go.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:13.850
You know, so I think that made
me feel comfortable that it's

00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:15.190
a low overhead.

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:16.540
So I'm taking a risk.

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.470
But also I think
Detroit responds

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:20.689
to something authentic.

00:53:20.689 --> 00:53:23.230
That's the cool thing about this
market is that if you like--

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:27.600
if you care and you curate
something and you do it well,

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.700
people will respond.

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:29.280
You know.

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.480
And that's really
what it is, it's

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.920
like a little art
gallery where--

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.756
I mean, I had like 20
guest chefs last year.

00:53:34.756 --> 00:53:36.630
We did Spanglish, a
taqueria for three weeks.

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.910
That was like a stint
where a chef took over

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:40.120
with a different menu.

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.050
And then we had a
couple random nights

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:44.500
just with chefs around Detroit.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.580
We did one night
with Andy and Doug

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.970
came down and just banged
out beer food on plates.

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:52.980
And people chug beer and there
there's like a 80 person line

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.270
out the door.

00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:55.664
We mess around.

00:53:55.664 --> 00:53:57.080
So I think, like,
that helps, too.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.440
If it was one menu,
you know, like

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.650
rigid I don't think
it would be the same.

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:03.936
I think I would
worry about sales.

00:54:03.936 --> 00:54:06.391
But the way we do
it's kind of exciting.

00:54:06.391 --> 00:54:07.890
You know, it's like
a concert venue.

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:11.080
You know, it's like, OK,
sure, G-Love is playing.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.720
You don't like
G-Love, wait next week

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.790
and it will be someone you like.

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:17.084
JASON ANDREAS: Very cool.

00:54:17.084 --> 00:54:20.360
Any questions?

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.060
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:27.910
Is there any other
restaurants, brewery, meatery,

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:31.020
whatever food, artisan
person you think

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.520
is like knocking it out of the
park that nobody knows about?

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.507
You're like why do people
not know about this?

00:54:35.507 --> 00:54:36.340
JAMES RIGATO: Right.

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.510
It's a good question.

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:40.340
And Detroit is pretty well
publicized at this point.

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.750
It's hard to find the underdog.

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:44.480
You know, Matt Millar
on the west side

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.660
of state at a restaurant
called the Southerner.

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:47.775
He's like in his mid 40s.

00:54:47.775 --> 00:54:51.850
He was at Reserve, then he was
at the Journeyman before that.

00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:53.950
He's a very lowkey guy.

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:56.620
He came over to Mabel,
the dinner sold out.

00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:00.060
But that's somebody that I
was telling go to [INAUDIBLE],

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:01.390
go to the Southerner.

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:04.210
That's very much
a Michigan chef.

00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:06.500
He's all Michigan cuisine.

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:09.010
So the guys like that I think
I'm more excited about some

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:09.800
of the dudes in the outskirts.

00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.925
You know, because that's
really the guys that don't

00:55:11.925 --> 00:55:13.190
get the attention, and girls.

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:14.690
You know, you go
to Trattoria Stella

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:16.182
in Traverse City, Alliance.

00:55:16.182 --> 00:55:18.640
You know, the chef up there
just got in the New York Times.

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:21.905
You know, there's some kind of
pockets all across the state.

00:55:21.905 --> 00:55:24.030
Even up in the UP I've got
a couple of my favorite,

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:27.796
like Stein House, you
know, up in Marquette.

00:55:27.796 --> 00:55:29.660
There's kind of cool
spots like that.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.587
But you know, real talk, Trizest
in Sterling Heights at 14

00:55:33.587 --> 00:55:34.170
and Dequindre.

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:38.160
It's a Sichuan restaurant,
a little dumpy Chinese joint

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.370
in a strip mall.

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:41.210
Very, very off
the grid, but they

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:42.917
are banging out some
of the best plates.

00:55:42.917 --> 00:55:45.250
You know, now you've got
places like Katoi and Peterboro

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:47.833
doing, like, moderations modern
Asian, but it's all delicious.

00:55:47.833 --> 00:55:50.101
But these guys you know
it's some old Chinese dude

00:55:50.101 --> 00:55:51.100
back there just banging.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.410
And that's some of the
most exciting Sichuan

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:55.060
food I've ever ha din my life.

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.410
I think that's like
internationally good.

00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:59.155
So, like, places
like that are kind

00:55:59.155 --> 00:56:01.540
of the off-the-radar places
that will just blow your

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:02.040
[INAUDIBLE].

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.039
AUDIENCE: And you said
Southerners in Saugatuck?

00:56:04.039 --> 00:56:06.260
JAMES RIGATO: Southerner
is in Saugatuck, yeah.

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:10.120
And it's-- I'm telling you,
Matt Millar's food is profound.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.900
He's a twice James
Beard nominee.

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:15.700
I mean, I'm telling you he's one
of the best chefs in Michigan.

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:17.950
If Matt was wanting
to move over--

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:20.170
if Matt wanted to move
over to Hazel Park

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:25.014
and, like, be aggressive I would
be both excited and nervous.

00:56:25.014 --> 00:56:26.180
AUDIENCE: One more question.

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:26.580
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah, please.

00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:28.621
AUDIENCE: Nastiest burn
you've ever gotten?

00:56:28.621 --> 00:56:30.370
I see you got one on
your arm right there.

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:30.866
Is that it?

00:56:30.866 --> 00:56:31.532
Is that the one?

00:56:31.532 --> 00:56:33.880
JAMES RIGATO: No, I
was at Schoolcraft.

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:34.690
I was in class.

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:36.690
And I was young and
dumb, and the over

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:39.130
were brand new because
I was the first class

00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:40.350
in the new facility.

00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:42.960
And I think it was
Jade or Viking ovens.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.950
If you didn't open
it all the way,

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:47.460
it would like close
back really fast.

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:51.340
I had a pan, a Monte Cristo,
a pan-fried sandwich.

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:55.150
And I like just opened the oven,
kind of like a swift movement.

00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:57.460
And the oven, like, I
slammed my hand in the oven

00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.350
and it spilled the
hot oil on my hand.

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:01.940
And it was like really bad.

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.390
I mean, it just chewed me up.

00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:04.640
Because it was like an impact.

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:07.770
It was like a bruise, scraping
of the skin, and a burn.

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:10.190
And I think it was my left hand.

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:12.640
I mean, it was like
[INAUDIBLE], it was angry.

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.603
AUDIENCE: That's
what I expected.

00:57:15.603 --> 00:57:16.102
Thanks.

00:57:16.102 --> 00:57:17.020
JAMES RIGATO: I was like 19.

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:17.920
That's when you do--

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.330
AUDIENCE: Live and learn, right?

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:21.250
Now it's like open
the oven, wait, make

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:23.762
sure it doesn't do anything.

00:57:23.762 --> 00:57:25.220
JASON ANDREAS:
Dangerous out there?

00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.410
JAMES RIGATO: Yeah, exactly.

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:28.270
I actually don't
mind-- burns I think

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:32.210
are more traumatic to the
flesh, but like cuts like really

00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.970
drive me crazy.

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:35.310
I got 8 stitches
in my thumb once.

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:38.210
And I have a long
beautiful slicing knife

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:40.670
and I cut the top
of my finger once.

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:42.910
And it's like that's
the kind of-- you

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:45.470
cut yourself like
that you're just blah.

00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:47.542
It's like it's deeper, right?

00:57:47.542 --> 00:57:49.000
Like is like surface
and that sucks

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.650
and it hurts, but it's more
like you deal like scabby skin.

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:53.150
a cut.

00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:54.760
A cut is like-- it
feels traumatic.

00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:57.830
Like it throbs the next day.

00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:00.020
You know, you can't
bend your finger.

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:00.950
I hate cuts.

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:06.332
I'm way more careful you know
cutting than am sauteing.

00:58:06.332 --> 00:58:09.380
Every cook it's
the pop, you know.

00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:12.760
Duck skin will always pop
and get you in the face.

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.640
Those aren't bad
burns, like but like

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.599
if you get a pop of
grease on your eyelid--

00:58:16.599 --> 00:58:17.890
AUDIENCE: It's your face, yeah.

00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:19.770
JAMES RIGATO: Oh my god.

00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:21.680
Or like an Alto-Shaam,
if you open it up

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.590
and the steam hits you
it burns your eyelids,

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:25.470
because it's like the
thinnest skin on your face.

00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:26.040
You know?

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:29.100
I burnt my eyelids a few times.

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:29.815
Pisses me off.

00:58:29.815 --> 00:58:31.856
AUDIENCE: So I'm going to
shift to violence here,

00:58:31.856 --> 00:58:34.565
you talked about AJ
getting choked up.

00:58:34.565 --> 00:58:37.210
I know that kitchens
are intense, right,

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:38.030
an intense place.

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:41.710
And you have to really,
as a chef, rule the place

00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:42.880
or it can fall apart.

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.880
Like, do you have a management
style that you stick to?

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.837
Is it like Gordon
Ramsay, you know,

00:58:47.837 --> 00:58:50.170
I'm going to cut your head
off if you don't do it my way

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:50.961
or is it different?

00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:55.650
JAMES RIGATO: No, I mean I was
a lot angrier and more interest

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:57.110
ridden before I got a dog.

00:58:57.110 --> 00:59:01.600
The dog really changed
my life 100%, get a dog.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.030
When I was younger
and terrifying,

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:05.240
when I opened the group I
was absolutely terrified.

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:08.372
It was like $1.6 million
bailout from Ed, my partner,

00:59:08.372 --> 00:59:09.580
who was like, it's just cash.

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:11.280
Here, I trust you.

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.934
Getting that kind of
investment, coming

00:59:13.934 --> 00:59:15.100
from a very poor background.

00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.020
I mean, I was terrified.
so, like, that

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:20.220
manifest in intensity.

00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:23.960
You're in a strip mall White
Lake in 2011, the worst

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:26.970
economy, throwing a Hail
Mary that Michigan wants farm

00:59:26.970 --> 00:59:28.340
to table food in the burbs.

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.470
I mean, not in
burbs, it's country,

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:31.940
White Lake's like
the agriculture.

00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:33.480
It's country.

00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.590
So, yeah, I threatened
to chainsaw people

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.470
in half and stuff.

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:40.800
Now it's different.

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.890
Like, I'm very
much professional.

00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:44.830
To me it's business.

00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:46.060
You know what I'm saying?

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:49.920
I'm not emotionally attached
to people's problems anymore.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:54.740
I used to, like, work hard for
their success than they would.

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:57.580
Now I'm more like I'd like to
create a path for your success

00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:00.530
and assist, But you have
to do the heavy lifting.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:04.340
So I have a standard of
cooking that I don't go below.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.800
Whether you are cutting
the vegetable or I am,

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.590
this is the standard
we operate at.

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:10.160
If you're below
it I let you know.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.690
If you remain below it, you
know, I sound the alarm.

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:16.190
If that is where you
will always remain,

01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:20.400
then you find a new way
to go about your life.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.870
Yeah, I don't know.

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:22.550
I don't yell.

01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:24.992
I really don't think
I ever yell at Mabel.

01:00:24.992 --> 01:00:27.490
But I do swear and I'm stern.

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:30.636
You know, I think
intense is probably

01:00:30.636 --> 01:00:34.920
the word that gets used more
than insane or aggressive,

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.540
or like too much is
probably something

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:39.104
that would have been said eight
years ago, seven years ago.

01:00:39.104 --> 01:00:41.420
I think now intense
is just the word.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.640
Which I'm fine with that.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.990
I do have a very strict rule
that I'm the only asshole

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:48.362
allowed at Mabel Gray.

01:00:48.362 --> 01:00:49.334
That's it.

01:00:49.334 --> 01:00:51.890
Customer, staff
member, that's it.

01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:56.480
If I see someone else taking on
that, hey, man what the fuck.

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:56.990
No.

01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.830
Stop.

01:00:57.830 --> 01:00:59.864
You know, we're all
ladies and gentleman.

01:00:59.864 --> 01:01:00.530
I'm the asshole.

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:05.320
I to I look at it
like Wonder Years.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.232
I'm Kevin Arnold's dad.

01:01:07.232 --> 01:01:10.160
Jack Arnold is very
much a dick, you know,

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.320
but he loved his family.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.450
You know?

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:16.991
He wanted Wayne to stop
being a mean [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:16.991 --> 01:01:18.470
Like he let Paul eat dinner.

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:19.511
You know what I'm saying?

01:01:19.511 --> 01:01:22.585
Like he always seemed intense
but I think it gave him luck.

01:01:22.585 --> 01:01:23.960
That's kind of
how I am at Mabel.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.085
I want everyone to succeed.

01:01:25.085 --> 01:01:27.626
And my real staff that's
been with me for a long time

01:01:27.626 --> 01:01:28.240
knows that.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.551
And they feel when I go
over there, this is wrong.

01:01:30.551 --> 01:01:31.450
Is this the kind--

01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:33.742
I always say, wait until you
opened your own restaurant

01:01:33.742 --> 01:01:34.658
to cook food this bad.

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:35.220
You know?

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:39.580
Go open John's Shitty Bistro
and do food like this.

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.920
Everyone's in a rush
to make bad food here.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.550
Why?

01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:45.620
Those are the things I say.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.742
Slow down, do it
right, make it count.

01:01:48.742 --> 01:01:49.700
JASON ANDREAS: Awesome.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.862
Chef Rigato, thank you
so much for coming in.

01:01:51.862 --> 01:01:52.570
We appreciate it.

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:53.861
Thanks for sharing your story.

01:01:53.861 --> 01:01:55.360
I think most of us
knew a lot of it,

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.080
but thanks for adding
some color to it.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:58.840
We appreciate it.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.050
Best of luck with everything,
and one more round of applause.

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:02.820
Thank you for visiting
us in New York.

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.779
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:04.779 --> 01:02:05.820
Thanks, that was awesome.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.670
JAMES RIGATO: My
pleasure, thank you.
