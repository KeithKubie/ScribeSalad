00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
[TYPEWRITER NOISES]

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:04.980
RETO MEIER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.920
My name is Reto Meier, and
Welcome to This Week in

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.110
Android Development,
October 22nd, 2012.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.220
If you've ever wondered what
happens when you combine a

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.560
love of Android with an
appreciation for fine grilled

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.260
meats, you are probably one of
the hundreds of Android meat

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.870
lovers to descend on Hurst,
Texas, for the Big Android

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.630
Barbecue last weekend.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.400
Meanwhile in Germany, DevFest
Berlin was in full swing last

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.925
week, with one highlight being
the impromptu Android Design

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:30.200
in Action session held at Sybase
hosted by Nick Butcher

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.250
and special guest designer
Marie Schweiz.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.120
While Nick was enjoying the
wurst and beer of Germany,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.510
Rich [INAUDIBLE] was in Italy
enjoying pasta, pizza and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.650
presenting at the
Firenze DevFest.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.860
You can meet both Nick and Rich
this week at DroidCon

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.040
London, the annual celebration
of all things Android in the

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.190
beating heart of old
London town.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.710
It was also a big week for the
Googleplay team, with the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.480
launch of sales support in
India, which is now the

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.080
fourth-largest market for
app downloads worldwide.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.590
They also launched the new
sleeker, faster, and easy to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.200
navigate Android Developer
Console, details for which can

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.010
be found on the Android
Developer blog.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.319
To celebrate the big week, you
can join the Developer Console

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.990
team for a special hangout on
Monday, 12 PM, London time,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.680
should you be in possession of
a functional time machine.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.780
Had the App Clinic been in
possession of such a device,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.690
we could have avoided the string
of failures that have

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.330
plagued our broadcasts
in recent weeks.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.690
As the Google founders have
instead chosen to invest their

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.640
discretionary budget in
self-driving cars and wearable

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.810
computers, we had to
rely on alternative

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.550
techniques for success.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.330
We did so in style last week,
successfully broadcasting not

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.830
one, but two App Clinics,
starting with the long-awaited

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.510
Video Player app clinic, only
one day later than promised,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.000
on Wednesday morning.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.040
Having wisely chosen not to
rely on our success, Nick,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.980
Roman and Adam's Android Design
in Action completed the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.680
design for a hypothetical
video player.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.920
Then on Friday, Ian and I were
back at it, reviewing

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.695
shopping list apps.

00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:52.320
Tune in this Tuesday, as the
Design in Action team present

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.150
their take on Out of Milk
and Grocery IQ.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.780
It turns out that there may
still be a rich market for

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.780
developers of pumpkin carving
and candy cataloging apps, so

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.750
this week we'll be announcing
some exciting changes to

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.530
future app clinic broadcasts,
rather than trying to review

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.610
non-existent Halloween apps.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.710
In the meantime, use this Trello
board to nominate the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.330
app and app categories
you'd like us to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.690
review in future weeks.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.670
In other Android Developer live
broadcasts this week, Dan

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.180
will be back again for the
Friday games review.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.040
And our regular office hours
will be broadcast from London,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.380
Mountain View, and Brazil, where
Bruno will once again be

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.830
dispensing what I can only hope
is Android development

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.670
knowledge in Portuguese.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.570
If This Week in Android doesn't
offer you a rich

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.730
enough variety of Australian
accents, tune in to

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.960
[INAUDIBLE]'s weekly ADL Plus.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.000
Last week he covered
notifications, and this week

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.670
he'll have more details on the
ADL Plus experiments with

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.610
connectivity API's.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.080
In new Android documentation
this week, the notifications

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.500
API guide has received an
update to include rich

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.910
notifications.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.040
As always, we look forward to
you joining us for our many

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.270
live shows, the schedule of
which you can find at Google

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.730
Developers Live.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.830
Today's live wallpaper
was Galactic Core

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.400
from Kittehface Software.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.440
And remember, missing you
is dark gray all alone.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.830
My name is Reto Meier.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.080
Thanks for watching.
