00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.383
Somewhere out there in that vast universe,

00:00:19.407 --> 00:00:22.517
there must surely be countless
other planets teeming with life,

00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:24.972
but why don't we see any evidence of it?

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.831
Well, this is the famous question
asked by Enrico Fermi in 1950:

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:30.089
"Where is everybody?"

00:00:31.612 --> 00:00:35.286
Conspiracy theorists claim
that UFOs are visiting all the time

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.352
and the reports are just being covered up,

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:39.952
but honestly, they aren't very convincing.

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:42.106
But that leaves a real riddle.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.269
In the past year,
the Kepler space observatory

00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:49.060
has found hundreds of planets
just around nearby stars,

00:00:49.084 --> 00:00:50.935
and if you extrapolate that data,

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:54.293
it looks like there could be
half a trillion planets

00:00:54.317 --> 00:00:55.782
just in our own galaxy.

00:00:56.792 --> 00:01:01.353
If any one in 10,000 has conditions
that might support a form of life,

00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:04.799
that's still 50 million possible
life-harboring planets

00:01:04.823 --> 00:01:06.378
right here in the Milky Way.

00:01:07.074 --> 00:01:08.320
So here's the riddle.

00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:10.290
Our Earth didn't form

00:01:10.314 --> 00:01:13.294
until about 9 billion years
after the Big Bang.

00:01:14.134 --> 00:01:17.667
Countless other planets in our galaxy
should have formed earlier

00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:20.285
and given life a chance to get underway

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:23.367
billions or certainly
many millions of years

00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:25.019
earlier than happened on Earth.

00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:28.469
If just a few of them
had spawned intelligent life

00:01:28.493 --> 00:01:31.118
and started creating technologies,

00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:34.099
those technologies
would have had millions of years

00:01:34.123 --> 00:01:36.579
to grow in complexity and power.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:39.370
On Earth,

00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:41.984
we've seen how dramatically
technology can accelerate

00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:43.655
in just 100 years.

00:01:45.018 --> 00:01:48.516
In millions of years,
an intelligent alien civilization

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.241
could easily have spread out
across the galaxy,

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:54.709
perhaps creating giant
energy-harvesting artifacts,

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:57.607
or fleets of colonizing spaceships,

00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.313
or glorious works of art
that fill the night sky.

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.727
At the very least, you'd think
they'd be revealing their presence,

00:02:04.751 --> 00:02:06.012
deliberately or otherwise,

00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:09.016
through electromagnetic signals
of one kind or another.

00:02:09.702 --> 00:02:12.253
And yet we see no convincing
evidence of any of it.

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:13.427
Why?

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.802
Well, there are numerous possible answers,

00:02:17.826 --> 00:02:19.081
some of them quite dark.

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.002
Maybe a single,
superintelligent civilization

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:25.545
has indeed taken over the galaxy,

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.358
and has imposed strict radio silence

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:31.460
because it's paranoid
of any potential competitors.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:34.453
It's just sitting there
ready to obliterate

00:02:34.477 --> 00:02:36.219
anything that becomes a threat.

00:02:37.567 --> 00:02:40.033
Or maybe they're not that intelligent.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.153
Or perhaps, the evolution
of an intelligence

00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:45.839
capable of creating
sophisticated technology

00:02:45.863 --> 00:02:47.639
is far rarer than we've assumed.

00:02:47.663 --> 00:02:49.118
After all,

00:02:49.142 --> 00:02:50.753
it's only happened once on Earth

00:02:50.777 --> 00:02:52.149
in 4 billion years.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:54.604
Maybe even that was incredibly lucky.

00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:58.475
Maybe we are the first
such civilization in our galaxy.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.617
Or, perhaps, civilization carries with it

00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:04.433
the seeds of its own destruction

00:03:04.457 --> 00:03:07.853
through the inability to control
the technologies it creates.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.989
But there are numerous
more hopeful answers.

00:03:12.013 --> 00:03:13.972
For a start, we're not looking that hard,

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:16.608
and we're spending a pitiful
amount of money on it.

00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:20.416
Only a tiny fraction
of the stars in our galaxy

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.838
have really been looked at closely
for signs of interesting signals.

00:03:24.648 --> 00:03:27.468
And perhaps, we're not looking
the right way.

00:03:27.492 --> 00:03:29.558
Maybe as civilizations develop,

00:03:29.582 --> 00:03:32.252
they quickly discover
communication technologies

00:03:32.276 --> 00:03:35.738
far more sophisticated and useful
than electromagnetic waves.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.713
Maybe all the action takes place

00:03:38.737 --> 00:03:42.087
inside the mysterious
recently discovered dark matter,

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:43.534
or dark energy,

00:03:43.558 --> 00:03:46.364
that appear to account
for most of the universe's mass.

00:03:47.742 --> 00:03:50.535
Or maybe we're looking at the wrong scale.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.443
Perhaps intelligent civilizations
come to realize

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:56.537
that life is ultimately just complex
patterns of information

00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:58.752
interacting with each other
in a beautiful way,

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:01.460
and that can happen
more efficiently at a small scale.

00:04:01.847 --> 00:04:06.243
So just as on Earth, clunky stereo systems
have shrunk to beautiful, tiny iPods,

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:08.032
maybe intelligent life itself,

00:04:08.056 --> 00:04:10.492
in order to reduce its footprint
on the environment,

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.125
has turned itself microscopic,

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.437
so the Solar System
might be teeming with aliens,

00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:16.103
and we're just not noticing them.

00:04:16.127 --> 00:04:19.316
Maybe the very ideas in our heads
are a form of alien life.

00:04:19.998 --> 00:04:22.389
Well, okay, that's a crazy thought.

00:04:22.413 --> 00:04:24.116
The aliens made me say it.

00:04:24.982 --> 00:04:28.828
But it is cool that ideas do seem
to have a life all of their own,

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:31.307
and that they outlive their creators.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.637
Maybe biological life
is just a passing phase.

00:04:36.627 --> 00:04:39.621
Well, within the next 15 years,

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:42.699
we could start seeing
real spectroscopic information

00:04:42.723 --> 00:04:44.106
from promising nearby planets

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.720
that will reveal just how
life-friendly they might be.

00:04:47.055 --> 00:04:48.205
And meanwhile SETI,

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.721
the Search for
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence,

00:04:50.745 --> 00:04:52.672
is now releasing its data to the public

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:55.698
so that millions of citizen scientists,
maybe including you,

00:04:55.722 --> 00:04:58.275
can bring the power of the crowd
to join the search.

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:01.991
And here on Earth,
amazing experiments are being done

00:05:02.015 --> 00:05:03.976
to try to create life from scratch,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.310
life that might be very different
from the DNA forms we know.

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:10.180
All of this will help us understand

00:05:10.204 --> 00:05:12.378
whether the universe is teeming with life

00:05:12.981 --> 00:05:14.462
or, whether indeed,

00:05:15.076 --> 00:05:16.486
it's just us.

00:05:18.356 --> 00:05:20.739
Either answer, in its own way,

00:05:20.763 --> 00:05:22.995
is awe-inspiring,

00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:25.668
because even if we are alone,

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:28.168
the fact that we think and dream,

00:05:28.192 --> 00:05:30.033
and ask these questions

00:05:30.057 --> 00:05:32.677
might yet turn out to be
one of the most important facts

00:05:32.701 --> 00:05:33.903
about the universe.

00:05:34.805 --> 00:05:37.602
And I have one more piece
of good news for you.

00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:40.388
The quest for knowledge
and understanding never gets dull.

00:05:40.412 --> 00:05:42.388
It doesn't. It's actually the opposite.

00:05:42.412 --> 00:05:43.658
The more you know,

00:05:43.682 --> 00:05:46.000
the more amazing the world seems.

00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:49.746
And it's the crazy possibilities,
the unanswered questions,

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.994
that pull us forward.

00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:53.745
So, stay curious.
