00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:01.681
- [Narrator] The last video we constructed

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:04.792
an experiment where we
had a drug that we thought

00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:07.834
might help control people's blood sugar.

00:00:07.834 --> 00:00:10.249
We looked for something
that we could measure

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.803
as an indicator for their
blood sugar's being controlled,

00:00:12.803 --> 00:00:15.497
and hemoglobin A1c is
actually what people measure

00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:16.797
in a blood test.

00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:19.467
It is, we have a whole
video on it on Khan Academy.

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:22.114
But it is an average
measure of your blood sugar

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:24.274
over roughly a three month period.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.015
So that's the explanatory variable.

00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:27.594
Whether or not you're taking the pill.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.452
And the response variable
is well, what does it do

00:00:29.452 --> 00:00:30.984
to your hemoglobin A1c.

00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:33.283
And we constructed a
somewhat classic experiment

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.257
where we had a control
group and a treatment group,

00:00:35.257 --> 00:00:37.486
and we randomly assigned
folks to either the control

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:40.017
or the treatment group.

00:00:40.017 --> 00:00:42.618
And to ensure that one group of the other,

00:00:42.618 --> 00:00:45.079
or I guess both of them, don't
end up with an imbalance of,

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.887
in the case, in the
case of the last video,

00:00:48.887 --> 00:00:52.085
an imbalance of men or
women, we did what we call

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.663
a block design, where
we took our 100 people,

00:00:54.663 --> 00:00:57.797
and we just happened to
have 60 women and 40 men.

00:00:57.797 --> 00:01:00.886
We said, okay, let's split
the 60 women randomly

00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:03.765
between the two groups,
and let's split the 40 men

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:07.201
between these two groups,
so that we have at least

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:10.661
an even distribution with respect to sex.

00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:13.418
And we would measure folks'
A1c's before they get

00:01:13.418 --> 00:01:15.578
the treatment or the placebo.

00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:18.132
Then we would wait three months of getting

00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:20.361
either the treatment or the placebo.

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.474
And then we'll see if
there is a statistically

00:01:22.474 --> 00:01:23.983
significant improvement.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.491
Now this was a pretty good,
and it's a bit of a classic

00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.441
experimental design.

00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:30.137
We would also do it so that
the patients don't know

00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:33.434
which one they're getting,
placebo or the actual treatment,

00:01:33.434 --> 00:01:34.989
so it's a blind experiment.

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:36.963
And it'll probably be
good if even the nurses

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.496
or the doctors who are
administering the pills

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:40.516
or giving the pills also don't know which

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:41.349
one they're getting.

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:42.931
So it would be a doubles blind experiment.

00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:44.858
But this doesn't mean that
it's a perfect experiment.

00:01:44.858 --> 00:01:46.808
There seldom is a perfect experiment,

00:01:46.808 --> 00:01:49.270
and that's why it should
be able to be replicated,

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.824
that other people should
try to prove the same thing.

00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:53.937
It may be in different ways,

00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:55.144
But even the way that we designed it,

00:01:55.144 --> 00:01:58.299
There's still a possibility
that there's some

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.364
lurking variables in here.

00:01:59.364 --> 00:02:03.730
Maybe we took care to
make sure our distribution

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.075
of men and women was roughly even

00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:07.979
across both of these groups,
but maybe my throwing

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.857
at random sampling, we got
a disproportionate number

00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:14.411
of young people and the treatment group.

00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:18.358
And maybe young people responded
better to taking a pill.

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:21.655
Maybe that changes their
behaviors in other ways.

00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:24.953
But maybe older people,
when they take a pill,

00:02:24.953 --> 00:02:25.786
they decide to eat worse
because they say the pills

00:02:25.786 --> 00:02:26.784
are gonna solve all my problems.

00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:29.149
And so you can have these
other lurking variables

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.818
like age, or where in
the country the live,

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:33.863
or other types of things, that
just by the random process

00:02:33.863 --> 00:02:36.530
you might have things get uneven

00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:39.290
one way or another.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.962
Now one technique

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:44.445
To help control for this a little bit.

00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:46.279
And I shouldn't use controlled too much.

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:47.789
Another technique to help mitigate this,

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:51.206
is something called matched pairs design.

00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:53.978
Matched, matched pairs.

00:02:56.612 --> 00:03:00.397
Pairs design of an experiment,
and it's essentially

00:03:00.397 --> 00:03:04.437
instead of going through
all this trouble saying,

00:03:04.437 --> 00:03:05.436
oh boy maybe we do block design

00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:06.876
or all this random sampling.

00:03:06.876 --> 00:03:10.614
Instead, you randomly put
people first into either

00:03:10.614 --> 00:03:12.170
the control or the treatment group,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.585
and then we do another round you measure,

00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:16.326
and then you do another
round where you switch,

00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:17.998
where the people who are in the treatment

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:19.693
go to the control, and the
people who are in the control

00:03:19.693 --> 00:03:20.715
go into the treatment.

00:03:20.715 --> 00:03:22.294
So we can even extend
from what we have here.

00:03:22.294 --> 00:03:26.461
We can imagine a a world
where the first three months

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:32.139
we have the 50 people
in this treatment group,

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.298
we have another 50 people
in this control group,

00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:36.086
they are taking the placebo.

00:03:36.086 --> 00:03:39.198
We see what happens to the
A1Cs, and then we switch.

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:41.448
Where this group over here.

00:03:43.075 --> 00:03:45.351
Then, they don't know, they don't know.

00:03:45.351 --> 00:03:47.209
First of all, ideally
it's a blind experiment

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.950
so they don't even know
they're on the treatment group,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.295
so hopefully the pills look identical.

00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:55.661
So now that same group
for the next three months

00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.261
is now going to be the control group.

00:03:58.261 --> 00:04:01.350
And so they got the medicine
for the first there months

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.138
and we saw what happens to their A1c,

00:04:03.138 --> 00:04:04.995
and now we're gonna pet the placebo,

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:06.713
then we're going to get the placebo

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:08.223
for the second three months,

00:04:08.223 --> 00:04:12.077
And then we're going to
see what happens to their

00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:15.862
A1c and likewise the
other group is going to be

00:04:15.862 --> 00:04:16.791
switched around.

00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:18.974
The thing that the folks
that used to be getting

00:04:18.974 --> 00:04:22.307
the placebo could now get the treatment.

00:04:25.074 --> 00:04:27.861
They are now going to get the treatment.

00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:30.972
And the value here is,
is that because everyone

00:04:30.972 --> 00:04:33.991
is going through, is it for one period

00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:36.800
in the control group, and once period

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.799
is in the treatment group.

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:39.540
But they don't know
when, which one happening

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.466
you are less likely to
have a lurking variable

00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:44.883
like age or geographic region

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.387
or behavior, cause an imbalance

00:04:48.387 --> 00:04:51.359
or in somehow skew the results

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:54.192
of give you a biased result.

00:04:54.192 --> 00:04:55.817
So this is an interesting thing,

00:04:55.817 --> 00:04:57.512
even when I've talked
about it in this video

00:04:57.512 --> 00:04:58.999
in the last one, these aren't just

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.763
different ways to approach it,

00:05:00.763 --> 00:05:02.156
and as you construct experiments,

00:05:02.156 --> 00:05:03.062
this is in medicine.

00:05:03.062 --> 00:05:04.455
You'll obviously construct experiments

00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:05.788
in other fields.

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.214
It's important to think
about what types of things

00:05:10.214 --> 00:05:11.047
are practical to do.

00:05:11.047 --> 00:05:13.952
And also (stammering) have the best chance

00:05:13.952 --> 00:05:17.087
at giving you real, I guess you could say,

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:19.754
an unbiased and real information

00:05:21.127 --> 00:05:22.892
as to in the case of an experiment

00:05:22.892 --> 00:05:26.677
to the efficacy of something,
or whether a certain variable,

00:05:26.677 --> 00:05:30.177
an explanatory variable really does drive,

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:35.164
have a causal effect
on a response variable.
