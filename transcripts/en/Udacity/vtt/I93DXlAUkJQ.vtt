00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.750
Most likely this trait is autosomal and dominant. Now how do we know this? Well,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.750
we're guessing autosomal in part because both males

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.930
and females are affected equally and one mother

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.565
doesn't have all affected offspring. This rules

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:18.620
out sex-linked and maternal. And as far as

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.099
dominance is concerned, we see the trait in

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.950
every generation and affected parents have affected offspring.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.000
This is typical of a dominant trait.
