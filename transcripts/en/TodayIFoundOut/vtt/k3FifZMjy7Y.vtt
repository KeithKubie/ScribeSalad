00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:11.099
Why does Breathing Helium Changes the Sound
of Your Voice?

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.099
The air in your lungs gets pushed up by the
relaxation of your diaphragm.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.410
It then goes through your trachea and out
a small orifice that has two folds of skin

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.020
(vocal cords) on either side of it, in the
shape of a V.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.480
This is called your larynx or voice box.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.350
As the muscles that attach to your voice box
tense and relax, they create a vibration of

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.369
the cords.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.489
As these cords vibrate, they release pulses
of air.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.010
The tension in these muscles creates the differences
in frequency.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.969
The higher the tension, the higher the frequency
and therefore the higher the pitch.

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.519
This frequency is measured in hertz (how many
times a second this repeats).

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.969
For example, nearly all human speech sounds
usually range from approx.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.519
200 hertz-8,000 hertz.

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.579
Meaning the sound waves vibrate at approx.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.750
200-8,000 times per sec.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.370
Once out of the voice box, the air travels
into the area of your mouth that can be informally

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.430
known as your vocal tract.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.630
As you manipulate your tongue, jaw and lips,
you can change the resonant frequencies created

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.850
by your vocal cords, allowing you to make
the many different sounds of speech.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.240
Together, the sound we hear created by air
flowing at different frequencies and resonances,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.420
creates our voice.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.480
One other factor affecting pitch is the thickness
of ones vocal cords.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.230
The thicker the folds of skin are, the deeper
the voice.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.490
This is due to the amount of mass your chords
have that the air has to manipulate.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.880
As you would expect then, men tend to have
much thicker folds of skin then women, ah

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.880
the soulful folds of Barry White!!

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.350
So now letâ€™s talk about the air thatâ€™s
coming out of your lungs.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.920
The number of molecules in a fixed volume
of gas, like the volume of air in your lungs,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.780
does not change with the type of gas (assuming
the pressures are reasonably low).

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.170
As long as the temperature and the pressure
are the same, it does not matter whether it

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.610
is helium or air, the number of molecules
is the same.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.630
The mass of those molecules is then measured
by atomic weight.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.149
Atomic weight is a dimensionless physical
quantity (which is why it works so well for

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.110
a gas that does not necessarily have a given
dimension).

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.969
It is the ratio of the average mass of atoms
of an element compared to 1/12 of the mass

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.999
of an atom of carbon-12.

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:25.109
All that basically means is the higher the
number the heavier the gas.

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.810
Helium has an atomic weight of 4.002602.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.819
Air which is approximately 80% Nitrogen, has
differing characteristics depending on the

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:34.819
environment.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.890
(for instance if you live in Los Angeles its
about 99.27% car exhaust) ðŸ˜‰ Because of

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.859
this, its actual atomic weight is impossible
to precisely define.

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.849
However it is generally about seven times
heavier then helium.

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.239
So why the perceived difference in your voice
with helium?

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.329
The answer lies in how sound waves travel
through a given gas.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.720
The more dense, or heavier, the gas, the slower
the sound wave will travel.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.569
Helium is much lighter than air.

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.170
The speed of a sound wave through helium will
then be much higher.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.310
So by inhaling helium and using it as the
source of the perceived sound, you are simply

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.430
increasing the speed or frequency of your
voice.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.150
You are not changing the pitch, since your
vocal chords are vibrating at the same speed

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.530
as when you are using air.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.790
You are also not changing the configuration
of your vocal tract.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.270
So while the base frequency of the chords
remains the same, the frequency of the sound

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.529
heard by others is increased due to the wave
traveling through helium much faster than

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:51.340
through air.
