Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. I had Paulie Malignaggi, he was at my gym and uh, then he kind of knew, he goes, wait a minute, I just figured out who the fuck you are. You're the guy. I know. He's freaking out. So, so I take that opportunity to ask him like, I'm just asking them like some boxing questions. Next thing I know he's giving me a boxing lesson. How fucking cool is that? [inaudible] yes, it was three days ago. He really going to do that. Bare knuckle boxer is art. I'm curious. Yeah, and he's taken it personally. Yeah, but man, you don't want to break your hands. You don't want to get your face cut up. Like, cause he'd done fighting like boxing bag. He's like, oh I noticed that. He looked like he was in shape. He was like, and he was given people pointers. He's very, he looks, he seems, I listen to him a lot on, you know, showtime stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:42          He's cerebral as hell. I mean he knows the game. He's very smart guy. He doesn't get hit a lot. No, I mean when you think about a boxer they can talk as well as he can. Oh, I'm pose. Articulate as he is and understand. I mean if you watch him the way he fights, like watch his fights with Adrian Broner like he, he knew how to figure out the puzzle that's or his hand speed and power punching and he punches him volume. He's always in gray showing me patterns, like just basic things that I was like damn, I really want to see the actual sparring match between him and Connor cause all the UFC released. Is Connor cracking them? I know it's a long one. It had to be, there had to be some fun moments in that. Yeah. I will also, I think apparently Pauley got off a plane and then he hadn't, it wasn't even really, he wasn't even working out that much then they thought it was going to train with them.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Yeah. And they go, we're going six rounds or something. He was filming what you film it. Yeah. That's something, they use it as a promo. Right. People are ruthless bro. The idea that they weren't gonna use. That is more ridiculous. Come on. Wait, who are you? You don't understand how this business works. They're promoting, they're promoting of, he's a Brooklyn Kid. He's a smart guy. Listen, they're promoting a fight that is going to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. You think that they're going to spare your sensibilities, they're going to spare your feelings and not show edited versions of you getting popped. But my problem is so the, I have a problem with that all across the board because? Because I feel like when common decency, fair play, you know a contract and ed sort of a contract, you enter, I'm coming out to help you out and what you're going to do is use me, go fuck yourself.

Speaker 1:          02:26          Like it's not believing it's, I understand. I understand. It's a business leave. They paid him. I'm sure they did and I believe he signed paperwork over. I'm sure they did, but that's a sneaky move. It's fucked yet and I and I have a problem with it. Fuck yes. In general, I just don't like justifying anything because it's going to be good promotion. I, I'm always uneasy. You know how people say, ah hey man, bad press. But you're talking about him. Yeah, but fuck off. I completely agree with you. However, I pulled to play devil's advocate. If I'm Mr businessman mister money bags, that shit just went in one ear and out the other. I don't know what you're talking about. That's a video of some shit that actually happened. You hate. The truth is if you, if you hate the truth, I can understand why you would want to show them that video.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Right? But Conor did drop him with the left hand and it's going to be a great fight. Conor McGregor versus Floyd Mayweather and ironically it might've been good for Pauli in terms of it creating this fight with art traits. You're talking about them all, I think. I think polyman analogies stands on his own. Not only has a boxing announcer. Yeah, I mean he's, he's got a real name and he's a, he's an excellent boxer. It's, he's probably one of the better commentators in the game, if not the best. Oh yeah. Very, very good. 100% him and Andre Ward, Andre Ward from the favorite and Roy Jones Jr for Rachel's juniors. Outstanding at it too. Yeah, he is just brilliant. Brilliant guy. Brilliant guy. I just watching him like figure out Kovalev too. Right? Especially in the second fight. Unbelievable. Yeah. In fact that, you know, he dropped Covello with a body shot and you know, Coppola so that the didn't give him a chance and that they just stopped the fight, but it didn't look like he wanted to keep going.

Speaker 1:          04:02          I felt like that way with Amir Khan, like if people are like, oh listen to them, come here, con has nothing approved. He has an amazing record. He's fighting a genius in Crawford and probably in, there's no shame in this. He was supposed to fight, um, Kell Brooks and he kind of went, you know what, this guy is. He, he's time is on his side and he's going to, he's kind of figured this out. He's bigger and he's going to kidnap. He's going to hit me and maybe hurt me here. I don't feel like doing this anymore. If that was the case, I forgive him for everything. It's like I thought it was a smart decision to find her and maybe he was really hard. He's killed the kettle. I'm not saying he's not, but the Kell Brook fight would have actually gotten Amir Khan more money. It was a actually wanting to test himself and he decided to take the fight against Crawford's real fighter.

Speaker 1:          04:50          If Crawford's not the best pound for pound fighter on earth. He's number two. He's one or two. I want to see him. What else? Or I'll spends, well him Earl Spencer is fantastic too, but I think the argument of pound for pound is Loma Chanko in him. Does the argument, you mean two guys were number one? Yeah. I'm like, who do you think is number one? I mean, I think spreads. You're talking about Crawford, Crawford. I don't know if they'll follow them in Toronto. I don't think Crawford's fought enough competition. Like when he fights Earl Spence and the, I think that Lowman Chenko has probably had more fights and you can really get into this conversation cause he hasn't everybody but he said as had he won the world title would like four fights. I, yeah, how many fights? It was like something ridiculous like that. I mean he fought a world class fighters first time out the, when I saw him fight a Jorge, um, what was that amazing Mexican fighter?

Speaker 1:          05:44          Uh, or some are like that. Who is the guy who follows record here is 13 and one in Crawford's 35 now. Yeah. Wow. Big Difference. But, but boxing is tricky that way. Right. So what's, what's the level of competition as they bring you up slow? Well, the difference is Loma Chanko had an extensive amateur background internationally, but soda, Crawford, Crawford had a great amateur background to look Crawford. The differences Crawford's way bigger. That's the difference. If there were the same size, it'd be really interesting to see what would happen. But Crawford's a lot bigger than him. He would. Yeah. I mean, it's not a good fine now it's just, I still watch him take rig and Dow and all these amazing fighters were gone. Dio [inaudible] I thought it was Reagan now. I don't think so. I think that's it in French and he gained do Rigondeaux if he game Gumdale um, but yeah, he did.

Speaker 1:          06:32          He just manels people. His footwork is unparalleled. But Terrence Crawford men, first of all, he's probably the best switch hitter ever next to Marvin Hagler. He might be better. Yeah. I mean it's hard to say. Maybe he can find you a game plan for that. I do so good orthodox then. So good south paw, but to watch Linaris that's it Jorge, that nurse, I think it's sick fighter and to watch him, he knocked Lemon Chenko down. But then again, like this guy figures you out. He just, he goes, I know what you're doing now and then you're done. We'll sodas. Crawford. Yeah, I mean the the best. I mean that was an interest in sylvan is prime to, he would just figure out your timing. Yeah. Figure out what you do, how you enter, where the gaps are, where the holes are. Okay, I see a key to the castle.

Speaker 1:          07:12          Let's rock. Right? And then somewhere around the end of the first round Anderson, we start switching stances on you and fucking doing some Bruce Lee moves. And the next thing you know, he's got his foot in your face. Yeah, that's right. It's figures you out. It's exactly right. These guys are just the, the, a really elite of the elite fighters. They're just the best at solving the little riddle. That is what your skills are. Now, how do you solve that riddle that is never back. That's a different riddle because that motherfucker's not on the outside boxing you. And he caught her Connor Franta while Connor for a while. You know, he's going to take you down. But what it looked like Konner for a while was isolating. He had two hands on that wrist. He was stopping him for a long time from closing his, his hands.

Speaker 1:          07:56          And, and that seemed kind of effective for awhile. I mean, good luck. It's a long road. That's like saying, um, you're running a marathon. Hey, you know he beat me in the marathon, but for the first hundred yards I was way ahead. I know. That's what it's like cause it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's a five round fight like okay, keeping me from grabbing my hands for now. Write your hands tired yet. Yeah, how you formed. I'm taking it down. Just going to take it down. That guy is so relentless and the skill level and the endurance level, he has to pursue that pace for five rounds. Like I don't think I even appreciate it. I mean I can intellectualize it and I could describe it, but I think when you're in there with him, like when he fought Edson Barboza and he had Edson Barboza up against the cage.

Speaker 1:          08:44          Come on buddy. His mind give up. Edson has this. No, that was against Michael Johnson antenes as this thousand yard stare where where he's getting mauled. It's just like he's like breathing. He's like, Oh fuck. Like this is, this is a different kind of human being. Those Russians are it. That's a different kind of human being so tight and they grow up fighting from the Zip. Tommy's a baby. Yes. He's a sad that culture. They were, they suffer a great deal. That's the look. He's like Jesus Christ. What the fuck did I sign up for? Skin mauled and I love, I love [inaudible]. It looks like his legs. His body looks like, you know, guys see at the pool kind of works out maybe a little. It just doesn't, it looks pretty fit. I don't know. Talking, I don't know. That guy looks fit. Barboza is really muscular.

Speaker 1:          09:29          He was jacked man. He's just using Shope photo of cubby like making like a most muscular poles or something. Yeah, he's fucking pretty Jack. He's just not though. He's just a freak. No, not compared to a lot of dudes. Yeah, go down there. Look at that. You know, cause he's dude, what are you talking about? His jacket not, you know, he looks like a really strong grappler. He's got, he's, we know he is, but really look at him like shut your mouth and it's pretty good there. Shut your turn. You're dirty. Lie spilling. He's got. It's pretty good. What about that one right there? How about that one? Cut The shit out of shadows. Let's go. You look like that. When you, when you were on center TRT about when you were young and that's what you reflect. It's basically the same. If I was in there it would, you would call it steroids.

Speaker 1:          10:14          You were always like that. Yeah, I was always like that. Yeah. When I was going to be more muscular. Actually when I first met you that I didn't even take vitamins. Now you are just jacked. I remember first time I heard mad TV you were jacked out of your mind. I knew it was just cause you lifted weights. Well that was when I was just getting into Jujitsu. So I really started lifting weights heavy cause I was tired of getting mauled. Yeah. So I really got into lifting website. I am weak. I'm like, yeah cause I'm used to striking. Striking is so different than grandpa and different in terms of the demands on your muscles and your fatigue. Yeah, it's soap, but it works the other way too because I remember I had done any striking at all and like a year, like I had done none, zero just Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          10:51          And then, um, my friend Jamie and I started doing, um, Jamie, um, is a, um, a trainer and we were doing this a training session and he had me hit mits too. And like just hitting myths for like a couple of minutes. I was gassed out. I was like, how is this possible? I roll all the time. I'm in good shape right now. That way when we get guys who are triathlon leads or whatever, they come in and, uh, Wayne McCullough shout out to the great way. Mcculloch my trainer, I love, um, I love that guy. He's the best. I fucking, that's one of my favorite people in the world. Like whenever I see them all is right in the world and he's just a humble man, silver medalist in the Olympics world champion and nobody asks them questions in the gym. It's like he that you had this gold mine, this guy here who's food beat Morales, who fought Prince Naseem to the distance and nobody knows it.

Speaker 1:          11:38          And he never tells anybody. And I'll see these guys hitting. And I'm like, wait, why don't you tell them? And he goes, they don't ask me. I don't, I don't bother them. He's just the most humble dude. We're like, it drives me fucking nuts, but launch. But anyway, we'll get like triathletes, people who are in really good shape. But if you, if you're sparring and you're afraid to get hit, you stop breathing. And so in three minutes, in two minutes, I don't care how good a shape you're in, the minute you get punched once you're like, yeah, it took me literally, it probably took me three years to get over that in a way. Cause I have no confidence as a boxer and I shouldn't.

Speaker 2:          12:11          Okay.
