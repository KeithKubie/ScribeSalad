00:00:00.543 --> 00:00:03.845
- [Instructor] The expression
five times two to the T

00:00:03.845 --> 00:00:06.419
gives the number of leaves in a plant

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.180
as a function of the number
of weeks since it was planted.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.879
What does two represent
in this expression?

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.467
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:15.467
on your own.

00:00:16.647 --> 00:00:20.171
All right, so let's look at
the expression right over here.

00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:22.307
We could write it as defining a function.

00:00:22.307 --> 00:00:26.043
So we could say leaves
as a function of time

00:00:26.043 --> 00:00:29.460
is equal to five times two to the T power

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.171
and so we could try this out a little bit.

00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:35.521
If we say well what is L of zero?

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:37.061
That would be T equals zero.

00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:39.287
That's when we are at zero
weeks after it was planted.

00:00:39.287 --> 00:00:41.346
So this is right when it was planted.

00:00:41.346 --> 00:00:44.596
Well that's five times two to the zero,

00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:47.358
which is just two to the zero's just one.

00:00:47.358 --> 00:00:48.853
So it's equal to five

00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:51.780
and so when you see an
exponential expression

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.557
or an exponential function like this,

00:00:53.557 --> 00:00:55.931
that is why this number out here

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:59.843
is often referred to
as your initial value.

00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:01.296
Initial.

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:02.463
Initial value.

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:06.846
And so let's explore
this a little bit more.

00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:08.235
What is L of one?

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.990
What happens after one week?

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.386
Well that's gonna be five
times two to the first power

00:01:13.386 --> 00:01:15.298
or five times two.

00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:19.117
So going from when it was
planted to the first week,

00:01:19.117 --> 00:01:20.543
we are multiplying by two.

00:01:20.543 --> 00:01:22.338
The number of leaves doubles.

00:01:22.338 --> 00:01:24.339
Well what happens after two weeks,

00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:25.514
the number of leaves after two weeks?

00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:30.112
Well that's gonna be five
times two to the second power.

00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:32.995
Well that's the number that
you had in the first week

00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:34.154
times two.

00:01:34.154 --> 00:01:38.176
So it looks like every
week we are doubling,

00:01:38.176 --> 00:01:40.584
we are multiplying by two

00:01:40.584 --> 00:01:44.103
and that's why this
number right over here,

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.290
which is what the question
is about, the two,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.380
this is often referred
to as the common ratio.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.184
Common ratio.

00:01:52.184 --> 00:01:54.991
Because between any two successive weeks,

00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:58.698
the ratio between say week
two and week one is two.

00:01:58.698 --> 00:02:00.698
Week two is double week one.

00:02:00.698 --> 00:02:03.701
Week one is double week zero.

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:05.256
So let's see which of these choices

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:07.284
actually match up to that.

00:02:07.284 --> 00:02:09.958
There were initially
two leaves in the plant.

00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.519
Well we know that there weren't
two leaves on the plant.

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.580
Our initial value was five.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.997
So let me cross that one out.

00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:19.881
The number of leaves is
multiplied by two each week.

00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:21.700
Well that's exactly
what we just described.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.704
So I like that choice.

00:02:23.704 --> 00:02:25.979
Let's look at the last
one just for good measure.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.813
The plant was planted two weeks ago.

00:02:28.813 --> 00:02:31.282
Well no, they don't tell
us anything about that.

00:02:31.282 --> 00:02:34.257
This is a general expression

00:02:34.257 --> 00:02:37.253
for T weeks after it was planted.

00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:39.409
So they're not saying when
it was actually planted.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.415
So we could rule that out

00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:43.906
and we feel good about that second choice.
