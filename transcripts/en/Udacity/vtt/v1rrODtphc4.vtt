[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:10.445
As you can imagine, anything as institutionalized as an online course has

00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:15.310
a strict set of policies to which the students and faculty must adhere.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.090
Of course, Georgia Tech has an honor code linked to in the instructor's notes

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.770
that you should read and follow. Unless explicitly stated in the description of

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.120
an assignment or project, all work you submit must be your own.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.689
The course makes use of the Piasa forum, which allows you to ask questions and

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.680
otherwise communicate with your fellow students. You are encouraged to ask for

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.930
clarifications and about the details of a particular tool or

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.410
technology. But you should not ask for nor provide answers to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.000
questions that are an explicit part of the assignment or project. This course is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.740
officially administered using T-Square. All material will be turned in

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.090
using T-Square according to the specific instructions of the assignment or

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.700
project. Any changes of policy or due date will be announced on T-Square, and

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.050
you are responsible for monitoring T-Square to obtain the latest information.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.890
The projects and some of the assignments require you to turn in written reports.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.240
The format of these documents should adhere to Georgia Tech standards as

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.500
described on the page linked to from the instructor's notes.
