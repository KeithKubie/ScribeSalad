00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.460
When we raise the number
to a given power,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.689
we multiply it by itself the number
of times indicated in the power.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:14.754
So 3 to the 4th is 3
times 3 times 3 times 3.

00:00:14.754 --> 00:00:20.680
3 cubed equals 3 times 3 times 3.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.730
3 squared is 3 times 3.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.010
So 3 to the 1 is just 3.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.049
Every time we go down a power we
are multiplying the base by itself

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.020
one less time.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.020
We are essentially dividing by the base
every time we go down a power.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.760
So if we are dividing by the base
every time we go down a power,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.070
what do you think 3 to the 0 is?

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.140
Enter your answer here.
