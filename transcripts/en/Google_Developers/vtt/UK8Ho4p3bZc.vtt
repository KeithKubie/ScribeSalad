TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.390
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.880
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You haven't
even heard anything yet.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.470
That's OK.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.680
You can applaud as much as you
want for the next hour.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.980
So I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.700
I'm a Developer Advocate
on Project Glass.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.120
A couple of things before we get
started, just to set some

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.650
context, though many of
you will already know

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.650
some of this detail.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.420
Google[x]

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.340
is the moonshot factory
at Google.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.510
It's about these radical ideas
for changing the world and

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.960
improving the way we live.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.695
And Project Glass is one
of those moonshots.

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:49.200
It's a moonshot about our
relationship to technology.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.270
This is strange standing up on
this little step back here.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.540
Let's just pretend it
doesn't happen.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.780
It's about technology that's
there when you need it and out

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.890
of the way when you don't.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.680
And what do I mean by that?

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.570
Some of you have heard this
story, but I'm going to tell

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.280
it again, because it's really
impactful for me.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.950
When you're at a concert and
the band takes the stage,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.490
nowadays 50,000 phones and
tablets go into the air, which

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.000
isn't all that weird, except
people seem to be looking at

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.900
the tablets more than they are
the folks on stage or the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.535
experience that they're
having.

00:01:26.535 --> 00:01:27.450
And it's crazy.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.340
Because we love what technology
gives us.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.590
But it's a bummer when it gets
in the way, when it gets in

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.840
between us and our lives.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.810
And that's what Glass is
addressing is, how do we have

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.520
those benefits of technology and
yet get it out of the way

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.760
at the same time?

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.090
Now up until recently, you had
to take our word for that.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.900
But we've started selling
devices to

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.050
people outside of Google.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.790
In fact, I see a lot of them
in this room today.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.270
Could you raise your hand
if you have Glass?

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.690
Oh, a bunch of you.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.770
And it's a heck of an adventure
we're on together.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.780
Who would have thought a year
ago we'd be in this room

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.410
adopting this new technology
together

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.900
and building it together?

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.140
And that's really what this
session is about, that and my

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.900
really cool roller
coaster video.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.640
Fair warning, there are not
going to be any airships or

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.110
parachuting today.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.720
We did that, and we did
it pretty well.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.320
Today we're going to focus on
developers, that's you, and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.760
what you're doing with Glass
and the conversation that

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.270
we're having together.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.820
Now this session, I'm going to
cover the general landscape of

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.400
building for Glass,
the platform

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.550
and design and examples.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.330
I'll talk about that
in a moment.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.850
There are some other sessions
that you'll want to come to at

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.720
Google I/O today.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.610
One of them is "Building
on the Mirror API".

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.250
Alain and Jenny are going to go
into detail about using the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.350
mirror API to deploy
your Glass service.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.940
There's going to be a session on
"Voiding Your Warranty", if

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.640
you want to tinker around
with Glass and have

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.060
some fun that way.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.650
And then at the end of the day,
we have a fireside chat

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.170
with some of our leadership,
and that's going

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.330
to be a lot of fun.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.610
We'll answer a lot of
your questions then.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.170
For right now, we've got three
things on the menu.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.950
First off, I'm going to talk
about platform, what you can

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.630
do today with a Mirror API
and a little bit more.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.670
Next, I'm going to talk
about design.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.720
Now the platform, for those of
you that have checked out the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.180
documentation, is
the easy part.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.980
It's JSON over REST.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.850
It's not new technology.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.740
We're just using
it in new way.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.960
And that's where design
comes in.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.910
This is the interesting
challenge with Glass right

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.260
now, and this is where we're
innovating, building the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.810
service for a user that
makes sense on Glass.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.690
And to that end, we're also
going to take a look at some

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.840
examples, some of the early work
people are doing in the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.520
area of Glass, building these
Glass services for users.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.750
All right.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.850
Now before we jump into all
that material, I'd like to

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.940
give you a demo.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.760
Who here has not seen a
live demo of Glass?

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.010
There's still a few of you.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.399
OK.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.890
And I understand that we have
another room and a livestream.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.210
So this is for all of you.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.885
I'm just going to go over some
of the basic concepts.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.780
This is always fun
to do live demos.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.880
We'll see if Wi-Fi works.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.760
Either way, it'll be fun.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.090
I have a cable attached to this
demo device so that you

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.810
can see my screen.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.670
We did a little bit of hacking
so you could see what I see.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.900
Now it's going to be more
choppy and a little more

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.130
delayed on that screen.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.350
It's much more smooth
on Glass.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.425
And if you can make a new friend
at Google I/O here who

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:55.960
has Glass, you can ask them very
nicely if you can demo

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.760
their Glass.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.060
I recommend that you do that.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.540
Because putting Glass on and
seeing this rich display and

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.880
experiencing it is so much
different than just seeing it

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.560
on the projection screen here.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.010
But I'll give you a
quick tour anyway.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.787
Now the first thing that you
note when I put on Glass-- and

00:05:14.787 --> 00:05:17.610
this speaks to my point about
the purpose of Glass--

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.500
is that it's not in the way.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.760
It's not in my line of sight,
but it is in my field of view.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.170
And the key thing there
is that it's not

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.210
between me and my life.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.630
It's not that tablet at the
concert where I'm looking at

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.160
that instead of what
I'm doing.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.970
But at the same time, whenever I
want Glass, all I have to do

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.940
is look up, and there it is.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.920
By bringing technology
closer, we can get it

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.490
more out of the way.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.450
So when you do put on Glass,
when you do get a chance to

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.940
demo, make sure that
you take that step.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.540
It's really key.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.180
There's two ways to wake
up or activate Glass.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.920
One of them is with
the touchpad here.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.720
I'm just going to tap on the
side there, and you'll see I

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.230
come to this home screen.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.990
It's got a clock.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.010
Now if I swipe down on that
touched right at my temple,

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.730
it's going to dismiss it.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.680
It's kind of like the Back
button on your Android phone.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.310
Another way I can activate Glass
is by looking up with my

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.540
head, and I get the
same screen.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.280
Cool?

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.670
Right.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.330
Voice commands.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.700
Mind if I take a picture?

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.710
I'll take that as a resounding,
sure, go ahead.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.210
OK, Glass, take a picture.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.170
And there we are.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.420
Aw, you all look so beautiful.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.200
Now let's go ahead and share
that with the world, shall we?

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.010
Swipe forward, tap
on that item.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.223
I get this menu, tap on Share.

00:06:42.223 --> 00:06:44.790
I'm going to swipe my
Google+ friends

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.650
circle and tap to share.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.380
That's it.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.320
So what you saw there
is I took a picture.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.550
That picture was then
put on my timeline.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.310
I swiped forward to get the
last item on my timeline.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.020
As I swiped forward,
I go back in time.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.940
If I tap on any of those
items, I get a menu.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.260
In this case, there was
an option for sharing.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.890
I took that.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.190
I saw my sharing contacts,
and I chose my

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.436
Google+ circle for friends.

00:07:10.436 --> 00:07:14.310
I'm going to come back to
all these concepts.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.940
OK, Glass, google, how do you
say welcome in German?

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.090
Did you all just start Wi-Fi?

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.600
Oh, there we go.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.810
Well, it recognized
what I said.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.640
Now if I had a strong connection
in this conference

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.970
room, it would then come back
and showed me willkommen and

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.670
would have said it to
me at the same time.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.380
Now you notice I don't have
anything in my ear, but I can

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.195
still get audio.

00:07:46.195 --> 00:07:48.260
And it's relatively
private to me.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.330
If you were right next to me,
you might hear a murmur.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.280
But otherwise, it's
just for me.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.582
Pretty cool, huh?

00:07:54.582 --> 00:07:55.290
All right.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.590
So that's your quick demo.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.172
Let's get back to the
slides, shall we?

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:09.490
All right.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.670
So let's start with platform.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.520
What we have out there today
is the Google Mirror API.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.560
I want to go through some of the
concepts I just showed you

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.170
in the demo and how you
can affect those

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.380
with the Mirror API.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.780
This is how the Mirror
API works.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.560
It's RESTful architecture.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.934
JSON is the payload encoding,
and OAuth

00:08:33.934 --> 00:08:35.299
is the install process.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.440
Now this is a developer
conference, so I'm expecting

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.679
to see a lot of hands here.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.289
Who knows what REST is?

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.299
A lot of hands.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:43.020
Great.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.865
Who knows what JSON is?

00:08:44.865 --> 00:08:46.440
A lot of hands again.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.330
Excellent.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.970
And who knows what OAuth is?

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.550
Slightly fewer, but still
a lot of hands.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.860
OK.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.810
That's great.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.750
Let me just touch on each
of those for the

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.900
audience playing at home.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.570
OAuth is an authentication
mechanism.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.520
And for the Mirror API,
it's analogous

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.980
to the install process.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.660
The user gives permission to
the Glass service to write

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.080
into their timeline
and get updates.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.440
JSON is the encoding, JavaScript
Object Notation.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.730
It's pretty much the language
that we send over REST, which

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:18.830
is the protocol.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.930
And that's just HTTP.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.200
It's like submitting a web form,
but in the background.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.730
And all that work happens
right here.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.190
And this is what I think is
really key about the Mirror

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.240
API is that it's super simple
to develop for, and yet you

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.720
could also build powerful
services.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.690
All your work is going to be
right here between your

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.390
service and Google.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.200
And then Google handles the sync
to Glass, dealing with

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.650
any connectivity issues and
actually rendering things on

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.005
the client on Glass.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.220
And there's a handful of
major topics we're

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:58.890
going to talk about.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.130
First, we're going to talk
about the Timeline.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:00.960
You saw that.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.430
We're going to talk about
Share Contacts.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.945
You saw those.

00:10:03.945 --> 00:10:06.390
It's my Google+ friends
I shared with.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.100
We're going to talk about
Subscriptions.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.230
This is how your service
gets updates when a

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.800
user performs an action.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.330
And I might touch a little
bit on Location.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.150
You can get Location updates
periodically

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.400
from Glass as well.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.460
OK So first off,
Timeline cards.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.430
Now Timeline cards
can be text.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.650
It can be images, video.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.130
It can be rich HTML.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.170
And they can also be bundles.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.340
So now you saw, when I was on
the Timeline there, there was

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.020
a single item .

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:41.590
It was an image.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.480
I tapped on it, and
I got a menu.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.330
If that item had a page scroll
in the upper right, like this

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.100
Timeline item here, and I tapped
on it, it would open up

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.700
into a sub-timeline.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.400
This is how you can group
multiple Timeline cards

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.160
together into a single top
level Timeline item.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.700
And this is good for a couple
different things, and I'll

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.960
discuss in detail some
best practices here

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.120
in the design section.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.010
But you might want to do
pagination with this.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.270
Or you might want
to do threading.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.040
For example, if I'm going to
have a conversation over SMS,

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.540
that's going to be in a threaded
bundle with my latest

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.840
message back or forth on top.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.610
I tap in, and I can go through
the whole conversation.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:27.070
Or maybe I want to show a little
bit more of a summary

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.210
than just on one
Timeline card.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.420
So I insert a long text string,
and it automatically

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.706
paginates for me.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.390
Now menu items, like the Share
menu item that you saw when I

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.440
tapped on the image, you
can add these yourself.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.590
And they can be of two kinds.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.210
One, they can be a
system menu item.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.410
And that you just
have to name.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:52.160
And it uses some built-in
functionality of Glass.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.890
This could be Reply,
Read Aloud.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.540
These are system menu items.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.300
Reply will put the user into
voice dictation mode, take

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.330
transcription, send you that
text and the audio file, and

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.020
then you can use that as
you do in your service.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.670
For Read Aloud, Glass will read
aloud to speakable text

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.320
or the text that it finds
on the Timeline item.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.870
There can also be custom
menu items.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.990
These are still going to be
simple, quick interactions

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.710
that you build.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.090
But they can have your name and
your icon, and they can do

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.810
whatever your service
wants them to do.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.020
Now Shared Contacts.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.110
Shared Contacts can be for
sharing, like I shared to my

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.820
Google+ circle for friends, and
then they see that image

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.880
moments later, or something like
Ice Breaker, which I'm

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.520
going to talk about a
little bit later.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.720
Some of you might have been
playing while you're here at

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.020
Google I/O. Now that's just a
service that takes an image

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:49.250
and does something different
or interesting with it.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.510
Now much like the Timeline,
which is a RESTful collection

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:57.900
that you can insert, update, and
delete items from, Shared

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.550
Contacts is also a collection.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.490
And typically how you would do
this in the flow of your

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.000
service is the user
would OAuth--

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.630
say, hi, I wanted to give
you permissions to

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.140
do stuff for me.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:14.270
And then immediately your
service would insert a shared

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.570
contact and subscribe to updates
from that shared

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:21.180
contact, or anything else the
user does in the Timeline that

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.620
the service wants to
pay attention to.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.710
Now the way those subscriptions
work, again

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.130
another collection.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.440
You insert a subscription, and
then you start to get updates

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.280
on the endpoint that
you specify.

00:13:38.931 --> 00:13:39.410
All right?

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.950
So we have three major
collections so far, Timeline,

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:48.580
insert cards, add menu items,
Shared Contacts for the

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.600
sharing menu, and
Subscriptions.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.010
The one last one is Location.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.850
I'll talk about that
in a moment.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.000
For Subscriptions, think
of it this way.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.710
If you've done pubsubhubbub
before, it's sort of similar.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.860
You're going to subscribe by
inserting a request into

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.000
Google that creates an item in
the subscription collection.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.630
And then as the user takes
actions covered by that

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:15.220
subscription, Google will inform
you by calling the

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.440
endpoint that you specify.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.440
It's a lightweight ping,
so it doesn't take a

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.720
lot of network traffic.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.870
And most of the time all you
need is that lightweight ping,

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.890
because it includes a
Timeline ID that you

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:27.980
likely already know.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.410
But if you want more
information, you can then pull

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.800
that item from the Timeline
item collection.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.250
Now Location is very similar.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.270
You can subscribe to Location.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.400
And then as the user's location
gets updated, you get

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.960
a notification.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.740
You pull from the Location
collection to get the actual

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.580
latitude and longitude.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.110
That make sense?

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.790
All right.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.480
So that's the platform as we
know it today, the Google

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.730
Mirror API.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.790
Let's talk a little bit about
what the Google Mirror API is

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.560
good for and some of the use
cases that will feel a little

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.670
bit forced.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.220
In our conversations about
building stuff on the

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.270
platform, we're always thinking,
as we do around

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.850
Google, what's good
for the user?

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.060
What's going to provide
an excellent Glass

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:21.920
experience for the user?

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.600
And in those conversations,
about 80% to 90% of the ideas

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.790
we come up with are great Glass
services for the Google

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.060
Mirror API.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.900
These include being able to send
content to the user and

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.420
microinteractions with that
service, like being able to

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:43.340
reply, or being able to add an
emoticon to something or +1

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:48.660
something, and being able to
share out from Glass images

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.570
and video, either to be posted
on a social network or for

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.990
your service.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.860
All those things work
incredibly well

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.290
on the Mirror API.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.230
You can develop them
very, very quickly.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:05.800
But there's a handful of things
that you might want a

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.370
different kind of aspect
to the platform for.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:15.130
Those can be when you want your
service to work offline.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.590
Now if I get updates from "The
New York Times," I can see

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.210
them, even if I don't
have a connection.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.350
But to actually get those
updates, I needed a connection

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.710
at that time, or to do those
microinteractions.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.270
Well, what if I have something
like Navigation, as you see

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:33.220
here, where I want to be able
to interact and get an

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.140
immediate response from Glass?

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:42.280
Or what if I want to access
hardware features, like the

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.160
Location, in real
time on Glass?

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.860
Well, for something like that,
you need a native API.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.720
And that's something we're
working on right now.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.120
It's called the Glass
Development Kit.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.440
We don't have a lot of details
about this right now, because

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.480
we're actively building it.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.690
And since we're in the explorer
period and we're

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.600
building it at the same time,
it's actually a really unique

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.010
place for a product to be,
because we're having a

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.099
conversation right now about
what we need to make sure that

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:12.030
we add to the Glass
Development Kit.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.720
So my ask do you--

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.680
I make an announcement, and
then I ask you to do

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.740
something for me--

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.930
is to tell us, what are your
dreams for Glass that would

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.330
use the Glass Development Kit
but not the Mirror API?

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.958
And what do you want to make
sure we cover in that?

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.430
Later in the day, if you go to
the hack your Glass session,

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.900
HY and PY might talk a little
bit more about the GDK.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.410
And we might talk about
in the Fireside Chat.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.720
And of course, if you want to
come up and ask me later, we

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.020
can talk about it
in more depth.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.320
And I'll take questions
at the end.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.320
All right.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.400
So we've talked about
platform.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.240
We've talked about the Google
Mirror API, which is what you

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.240
build with today to get services
to users and play

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.460
with the Glass experience and
really understand the design

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.805
and user experience of Glass.

00:17:57.805 --> 00:18:00.115
And we've talked a little bit
about the GDK that'll be

00:18:00.115 --> 00:18:03.410
coming some time in the future,
where you'll be able

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.915
to do things like offline and
immediate access to hardware.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:15.050
The user experience, this big
next section of my talk, is

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.340
about design.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.510
It's about how do you make an
excellent Glass service for

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:20.990
the user, not just
technically?

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.700
But what are the paradigms
that you use?

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.630
What are the user patterns
that you use?

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.630
And to start with, we have four
guidelines that you've

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.280
heard me speak about before--

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.440
I've covered these in more depth
elsewhere, but I want to

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.890
touch on them, because they
really add context to all of

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.610
the other items that
talk about today--

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.752
the first of which is
to design for Glass.

00:18:41.752 --> 00:18:44.940
And this is really key, and
there's a remarkable amount of

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.190
depth in here.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.900
Because at the top level, you
don't want to take an

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.930
experience on mobile or
on the web and just

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:51.870
stamp it out on Glass.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.050
It's not going to work,
because Glass is

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.340
fundamentally different.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.350
And the one essential
thing that you must

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.760
do is test on Glass.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.520
Use Glass in your daily life.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.740
Add your service, and use your
service in your daily life,

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.200
and then you're really
going to know what

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.420
works and what doesn't.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:17.160
The second big thing here
is don't get in the way.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.700
Remember I talked about what are
the things that are good

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.710
for a Glass user.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.480
Well, getting in the
way is not good.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.300
Getting in the way takes them
out of their life and puts a

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.500
barrier between them and
what they're doing.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.050
And that's not what we're
doing with Glass.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:35.760
We want your service to
improve their life.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.980
And sort of a corollary here is
that you never would want

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.490
to take precedence over
the user's experience.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.280
So you would never want to send
them a notification that

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.460
if they didn't respond would
degrade their experience with

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.710
your service.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.580
They should be able to ignore
notifications, and your

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.960
service keeps chugging along,
giving them what they want

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.700
when they need it.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.060
Keep it timely.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.560
Glass is a very now device.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.810
Your phone, you might do stuff
over the last week.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:08.070
Look at your calendar
four days from now.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.030
Your laptop, you've got data
on there from the last few

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.370
months or year.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:15.030
But Glass is really about what
are you doing right now.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.690
And when you think about that
your service, you want to

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.820
deliver content to the user
that's important to them at

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.070
that moment.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.440
And then one last one.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.740
Avoid the unexpected, especially
the unexpected and

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.530
the unpleasant.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.940
And this is bad on
any platform.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.210
But it's particularly dangerous
on Glass when the

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.210
experience is so intimate
to the user.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:41.390
They're wearing your
experience.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:46.230
So you really need to respect
that relationship, and don't

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.760
do anything unexpected.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.190
Just Be honest about the
intention of your application,

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.070
about your Glassware.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.950
And give them preferences to be
able to get notifications

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.430
maybe during certain times or
know how many they're going to

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.026
get before they sign up.

00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:02.510
All right.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.530
So those are our four
guidelines.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.910
And those are things that
you can kind just

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.070
stick in your pocket.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.460
And when you look at your Glass
service and you have a

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.320
question, is this going to be
right for the user, you can

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.140
measure it against those four
things really easily.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.110
And we've talked about those
before, but since that time

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.530
we've been spending more and
more time with our partners.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.460
And we've gotten a lot of little
lessons as well, a lot

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.610
of user patterns that work
really well and a lot of

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.900
learnings around the different
paradigms in Glass that I'd

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.150
like to share with you.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.590
So here are the types
of Timeline cards

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.170
that you might use.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:43.830
You've got text, HTML templates,
images, and video.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.440
I'm going to touch on some
notes for each of these.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.790
Now we also document these on
our documentation, and we'll

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.930
continue to expand these best
practices, these tips and

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.310
tricks, as we move forward and
as we learn together in this

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.770
explorer period.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:03.810
First off, if you're only
sending text, just send text.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.450
Don't use an HTML template.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.370
And the cool thing here is that
if the text is too long

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.720
for one Timeline item.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.970
it's going to autopaginate.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.900
So a user can tap on that
Timeline item, and there'll be

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.390
a Read More menu item, and
they'll be able to swipe

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.020
through that text.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.100
If what you're sending to the
user is text, this is the

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.190
easiest and quickest and
most powerful way

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.890
to get that to them.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.450
And it looks a little
bit like this.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.750
Again, you'll see that text,
tap on it, get to the Read

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.750
More, and you can swipe through
multiple pages of

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.930
text, in this case,
the dramatically

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.180
interesting Lorem Ipsum.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.930
OK.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:42.650
HTML.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:47.540
Now this is when you once more
rich or flexible designs.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.970
And maybe you want to combine
both text and

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.420
images on one item.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.740
Now HTML is a little bit
tricky on Glass.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.260
You really need to
test on Glass.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.520
And we do have a great tool
called the Developer

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.840
Playground.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.240
It's got the CSS built in.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.000
You can edit HTML inline and
see it right there the web

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.140
browser and hit send and have
it go straight to Glass.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.010
That's really helpful.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.960
And we also have these
templates.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.980
We've taken some time just like,
OK, what are some of the

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.630
big categories of usage
for Timeline items?

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:20.710
We've provided these templates
for you to go in and edit and

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:21.960
make your own.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.350
However, if you want to break
past those templates and do

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.430
something a little bit more
stylized and specific, you can

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.890
also add a style tag inline
with the HTML.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.425
Now it won't do JavaScript.

00:23:35.425 --> 00:23:38.130
But you can add your
own CSS, your own

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.310
custom IDs and classes.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:43.020
Just remember to always
test on Glass.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.460
Start with the Playground, and
keep sending those to Glass to

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.780
make sure it renders the
way you want it.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.950
And also, if you use custom
HTML, make sure that as we

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.910
upgrade the system software on
Glass that you keep testing

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.450
that to make sure
nothing changes.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.600
We have a couple UI grid
templates here to get you

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.650
thinking about what's the
padding and the spacing that

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.420
will make your Glassware
consistent with the rest of

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.140
the Class UI so that it's
familiar and easy

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.390
to use for the users.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.510
Photos and video attachment.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.110
There's a couple best
practices in here.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:30.750
First, it's 16 by 9, and the
resolution is 640 by 360.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.450
You want to use that resolution,
if you can.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.960
And the reason is it's going to
transfer to Glass faster,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.590
and it'll be the perfect size
for showing full screen.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.260
It doesn't need to be
resized on Glass.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.790
It's going to look
as you intended.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.190
And for videos, they
should be short.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.140
This is for two reasons.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.030
One, you're sending it to
Glass over the air.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:54.970
It's going to use the user's
data connection.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.900
But another reason is that,
again, we don't want Glass to

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.950
get in the way of the
user and their life.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:05.040
So getting a video and looking
for 30 seconds or maybe up to

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.000
a minute makes sense.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.440
I can take that pause when I'm
walking between meetings, and

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.180
that can be really magical
experience.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.630
But if you push me 30 minutes
of video, I'm never going to

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.060
watch it, for one.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.360
And it's going to be
distracting and

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.510
confusing to the user.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.960
It's about short interactions.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.420
It's not about staring
up all day.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:21.670
It's about living your life.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.080
And another thing that I'd
like to announce today--

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.210
this will be available in
the documentation soon--

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.390
is video streaming.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.230
So what you know about the
Mirror API so far is that if

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.610
you want to upload an image or
a video, you add it as an

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.700
attachment to a Timeline item
that you insert into the

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.700
Timeline collection.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.300
You do this once
for every user.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.030
So if you have 1,000 users and
you want one video to go to

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:49.500
all of them, you upload that
video 1,000 times.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.350
It makes more sense to do that
for the video intended for

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.740
that user specifically
and update to

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.600
them from your service.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.040
If you're going to broadcast
things to users, what makes

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.700
the most sense is to
do video streaming.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.900
Now we're going to add some more
details about video types

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.000
and quality in our
documentation, and that's best

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.290
place to reference it.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:10.190
But you so you know how this
works is this is a URL

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:11.810
attachment.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:15.190
So when you insert the Timeline
item into the user's

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:19.470
Timeline collection, instead
of adding a multi-part

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:23.470
attachment with the video
content inline, you can add

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.050
just a URL.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.950
And then Google's going
to handle the rest.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.200
That's pretty cool, right?

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.670
Everybody's who's been inserting
videos on the Mirror

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:34.560
API is nodding.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.721
And that's nice.

00:26:36.721 --> 00:26:37.260
All right.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.830
Let's talk about bundling.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.990
Bundling is super powerful
but tricky.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.640
There's a few tips I can give
you to do this right so it's

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.610
going to be really obvious to
the user and it's going to

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.100
make a lot of sense to them.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.260
First off, there's many
kinds of bundles.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.760
There's single item bundles,
and there's

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.860
multiple item bundles.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.200
Now what do I mean by that?

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.900
A single item bundle is where
you insert a single Timeline

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:09.280
item, you specify the HTML
attribute as the cover card,

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.250
and then HTML pages is
an array of strings.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:13.780
They're your subsequent
pages when the user

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.030
taps into the bundle.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.490
This is a single Timeline item,
so it should logically

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.410
be a single item with
multiple pages.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.850
That's really straightforward,
right?

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.150
The multiple item one, this
could be for threading, or it

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.230
could be a collection.

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.290
There's a couple great
examples of this.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.380
You've seen "The New York
Times" on Glass.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.960
That's a bundle of the latest
top headlines from "The New

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.358
York Times" for the last hour.

00:27:39.358 --> 00:27:42.900
You tap into it, and you'll
see those multiple items.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.790
Threading is something like
SMS or messaging back and

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:47.040
forth in a service.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.540
All you need to do is insert
additional items.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.660
You set the bundle ID.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.180
In the case of "The New York
Times", the way they insert

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.000
them will constitute
the order.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.340
In the case of threading, you
don't even worry about that,

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:06.220
because the latest items are
always going to appear on top.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.300
Now a trick for all of these
things, especially the

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.700
multiple item bundles, is
to have a digest cover.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.550
This is a cover not where you
say what's in the bundle but

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.380
you show the user what's
in the bundle.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.390
And "The New York Times" does
a great job of this.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:24.470
You'll see this digest cover has
images for a number of the

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:25.720
headlines contained within.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.730
Menu items, a couple short
notes about this.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:37.100
Menu items are one line, and
there's just a few characters.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.270
This is on purpose, because
they're short and actionable.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.410
I can easily scan through a good
menu and choose what I

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.920
want in just a few moments.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.010
That means that not only is it
really easy to recognize what

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.590
this menu item does, because
it's clear in one or two short

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:56.430
words, but there's also a
handful of menu items, not

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.470
more than that.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:02.050
Always make sure to
specify an icon.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:07.200
And be careful with Dismiss
and Delete.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.090
These are similar, but they're
a little different.

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:12.310
Most the time you're not
going to want Dismiss.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.030
It doesn't make a lot
of sense on Glass.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.140
Because the way the Timeline
works, for those of you that

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:22.010
have Glass, is you know
when updates come in

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.280
and time moves on.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.830
You just don't go all the
way back on Timeline.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.410
It just kind of decays
over time.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.270
You're only looking at
your recent stuff.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.620
So they sort of automatically
dismiss, in a way.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.700
So you wouldn't want to get
the user in the habit of

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.360
having to just dismiss, unless
you wanted to give them the

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.810
option, like I don't want to
see this on my Timeline Or

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:45.750
maybe that's an indication to
your service of what kinds of

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.400
updates they like or
they don't like.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.080
Delete, on the other hand, when
you do this it shouldn't

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.180
just remove it from the
user's Glass Timeline.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.280
It should also delete that
item on your service.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.640
A great example of this is
when I share an image to

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.465
Google+ and there's
that Delete Item.

00:30:02.465 --> 00:30:03.550
I tap that Delete Item.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.750
It deletes it from my Glass
Timeline, and it deletes the

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.180
post on Google+.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.520
It's very clear to the
user what it does.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:14.160
OK.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.090
Let's talk about Shared
Contacts.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.190
A couple notes here.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:20.350
Make sure that when you insert
a shared contact that the

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.360
image that you use
is 640 by 360.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.590
That way, if it's the one, it'll
show full screen and

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.000
it'll be beautiful.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.620
Make sure to always specify
acceptTypes.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.830
Now these are MIME types that
say what your shared contact

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:36.940
can be used for.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.980
So maybe you do image slash
asterisk, in which case any

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:46.700
images that the user finds and
they tap on that image and the

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.130
Share menu, your shared
contact will show up.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:52.510
Maybe you also want
to do video.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.390
Now when the user does share
items on your service, we have

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.100
two things that people have
started to use which make a

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.810
lot of sense, #throughglass
and Sent through Glass.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:05.610
So with your service, it makes
sense to include a hashtag,

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.110
like it's a post on
your service.

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:10.515
Adding #throughglass is a great
way to have a through

00:31:10.515 --> 00:31:12.160
line of what that user
is sharing while

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.930
on the go from Glass.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.000
If you're doing messaging,
however, where maybe it

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.930
doesn't make sense to have a
hashtag, but you still want to

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.540
indicate to somebody that
somebody was saying this while

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.660
they were walking between
meetings, then Sent through

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.240
Glass makes a lot of sense
there, just to append at the

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.670
end of the message.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.520
Add these, and there'll be a lot
more clarity, as messages

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.290
are going to go through
and similar

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:37.540
to the other Glassware.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.600
OK.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.740
Some of those details all
on one screen for you.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.101
There are numbers.

00:31:46.101 --> 00:31:47.370
It's all really straightforward.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.210
I've been saying the sizes a
lot, by the way, because

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:56.330
that's one of the things that
we've noticed as we've been

00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:00.090
doing hackathons and building
our own software that it was

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.400
one of those things that's
easy to forget.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.040
But you really do want
to play to the size

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.290
of the Glass screen.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:15.150
All right.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.650
Let's talk about some
examples, shall we?

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:22.560
Examples are really important
right now.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.220
And the reason is that we were
all, collectively, me and

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.230
everybody else with Glass in
this room, figuring out what

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.550
the best experience
is on Glass.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.870
And we're building up a lot of
collective knowledge about

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:37.220
these best practices.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.470
And even though it's early,
some of these Glassware

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.460
already have the
one out there.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.752
And I'm going to talk
about some of those.

00:32:45.752 --> 00:32:49.360
You know about some of the
Google products that are

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.700
already available on Glass,
like Google+ and Gmail and

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.130
Google Now.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.080
These are awesome experiences
on Glass, and we've added to

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.830
those with some of
our friends.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:03.070
We also know that "The New
York Times" and Path are

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.320
available on Glass.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:09.240
There's a few more folks that
we've been working with to

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.700
build this early Glassware,
these V1s that people are able

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.460
to use on Glass.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.280
I'd just like to mention a few
of those that are going to be

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.730
available to Glass
users today.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:22.935
I like that slide.

00:33:22.935 --> 00:33:23.590
It's OK.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.570
You can applaud.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:25.060
No?

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:31.920
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.320
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So this has
been a lot of fun, because

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.080
we've gotten to work with a
lot of really cool people

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.480
innovating in this space and
building these really amazing

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.280
Glass experience for users.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.750
Now it's still early, but some
of these experiences on Glass

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.870
really illustrate some
excellent paradigms.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:51.595
And I'd like to call out just a
few of those and talk about

00:33:51.595 --> 00:33:52.990
the cool stuff that
they're doing.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.330
First off, Google+.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:03.050
There's a lot to Google+
on Glass.

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:04.870
There's a lot that you
can do with Google+.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.600
You can share pictures
and video.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.310
You can get notifications.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:09.719
You can comment on posts.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:15.659
Or my favorite, you can start
or receive Hangout on Glass.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:17.860
If you haven't tried it,
it's really fun.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.909
You can join that Hangout, and
people see what you're seeing

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:23.322
wherever you are in the world.

00:34:23.322 --> 00:34:27.110
I'd like to take a look at one
feature in particular.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:31.020
This is getting a Google+
notification.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.230
Here my friend and colleague,
Ossama, has plus mentioned me

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.969
yesterday in a Google+ post.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:38.280
And I get this notification
on Glass.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.370
If I tap on that notification,
I see two items.

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.570
One, I can comment
or I can plus 1.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.190
Plus 1 is great, because I can
just kind of do that on the

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:50.429
go, and that's it.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:52.730
Or maybe I want to add a comment
to the post, in which

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:56.949
case I tap on Comment and
I just speak out loud.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:03.000
And that will appear on the
Google+ post on the web, and

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.010
the item in my Timeline
gets updated.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.440
And this makes sense, because
Google+ owns that Timeline

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.470
item, and they can keep
the comments as sort

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.780
of a threaded bundle.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.450
Now I see the post
Ossama made.

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.300
I tap inside there, and I can
swipe through the comments.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.700
And as other people add
comments, either through Glass

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:28.140
or on the web or on
mobile, that item

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.320
keeps getting updated.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.570
And we have that conversation.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.290
This is a lot of fun.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:44.410
And one of the things that I
really like Google+ is that

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.880
since we've got this concept
of circles and the plus

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.970
mentioning, I end up getting
the posts that I care about

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.170
with people that I want to
communicate with, whether I'm

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.080
on the go or not.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.980
And being able to do that
on Glass is a really fun

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.820
experience.

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.040
The next one, CNN.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.500
CNN and us have been working
together on this really cool

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.880
experience that you may have
checked out in the Sandbox.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.500
They're out they're
showing you.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.730
And of course, you'll be able
to use it later today.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:15.960
The first thing that you'll
notice when you sign up for

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:21.770
the CNN Glassware is
this Settings page.

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.750
I love this Settings page.

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.100
They're doing some really
cool things here.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:29.280
First off, they're letting me
send alerts between two times.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.040
I just want to get updates from
CNN during working hours,

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.130
or working hours plus a
few in the evening.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.490
And I can set that right here.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.030
Also, I can select which topics
I want to get on Glass,

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:44.450
which ones are interesting
to me.

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.190
And I get an immediate
indication of approximately

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:49.620
how many updates I'm going
to get per day.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.100
That's super valuable
on Glass.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.730
Because maybe I just want to dip
my toes in the water with

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:56.400
some sports and politics
alerts.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.415
Or maybe I want to go whole hog
and get the top stories

00:36:58.415 --> 00:37:01.370
throughout the day.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:05.300
Now once I start getting items
from CNN, they look like this.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:09.170
They're a bundle that
represents a story.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:14.000
I tap into that bundle, and the
first item is some text

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.300
for that story that I
can have read aloud.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:20.110
I swipe forward, and I
have a short video.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:23.400
This was a really cool one about
a taqueria in Florida

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.990
that serves lion tacos.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.030
I don't know how I feel about
that, but I thought it was

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.280
interesting.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.320
Now what's neat about this is
that when you put on Glass,

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.280
the first thing that
you notice is how

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.500
brilliant the screen is.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.660
You can see images in really
high fidelity, and videos look

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.940
really cool on Glass.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:49.300
And having CNN send me these
short video from everywhere in

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.350
the world throughout the day,
and I can look at them

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:53.635
whenever I want, is really
a unique experience.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.030
Twitter.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:04.010
Twitter and Glass, they just
work so well together.

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:05.330
There's a bunch of stuff
that you can do

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:06.840
with the Twitter Glassware.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.905
You can get tweets from
plus mentions.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:15.990
You get the tweets that you
have mobile notifications

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.320
turned on for.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.820
So if I have mobile
notifications turned on for my

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:23.860
friend, Sydney, as he tweets,
I get those on Glass.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.432
You get direct messages,
and you can

00:38:25.432 --> 00:38:28.190
respond to those messages.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.900
And you can share
a picture from

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.120
Glass directly to Twitter.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.710
And it'll post it as
a photo tweet.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.695
A tweet on Glass looks
a bit like this.

00:38:37.695 --> 00:38:42.570
As you know, our friends from
NASA just returned to Earth.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:45.840
And it was really fun watching
all of their updates getting

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.280
retweeted by NASA astronauts
and getting that on Glass

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.440
throughout the day.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.700
Because they're updating about
their return and their tests

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.940
and seeing their family.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.320
And if I want, I can reply to
these tweets, I can retweet,

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.370
and I can favorite
right from Glass.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:04.520
Super simple.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.520
And because Twitter is that
short message model, it just

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.840
makes a lot of sense on Glass.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.510
Another thing that I really
love about the Twitter

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.215
Glassware is this direct
messaging capability.

00:39:15.215 --> 00:39:19.390
Now here Alain sent me a DM
asking if I was ready for the

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:20.640
afters hour party.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.590
To which I replied,
most certainly.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:25.605
Because of course I was.

00:39:25.605 --> 00:39:27.366
It was awesome, right?

00:39:27.366 --> 00:39:27.760
Yeah.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.180
It was a good party.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.670
I think that might be the
best I/O party yet.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.860
Anyway, I hit Reply.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.330
I saved that message.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:40.060
And that gets added to
the thread on Glass.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.980
Remember, I talked about these
bundles and threaded bundles?

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.890
All Twitter had to do was insert
one more item, set the

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:51.020
bundle ID for that bundle--
which is any arbitrary string

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:51.810
it decides.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:54.180
Maybe it's an internal
representation of this

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.240
conversation--

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.460
and that bundle grows.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.660
And it keeps growing as
we reply back and

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.550
forth to each other.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.435
It's pretty neat, huh?

00:40:06.435 --> 00:40:07.740
All right.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:08.990
Let's talk about Evernote.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:17.720
Evernote, as you know, is
great for taking notes,

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.750
capturing ideas and experiences,
and collaborating

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.120
with your friends.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.600
One of the things that I do,
one of my patterns with

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.610
Evernote, is I'll take
notes and then I'll

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:29.780
reference those notes.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:33.230
I do shopping lists all the time
on Evernote, my common

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.330
shopping list every week.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:35.815
And then I add items,
remove items.

00:40:35.815 --> 00:40:38.340
And then I'm in the store, and
I have my phone out, and I'm

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.780
looking at that shopping list.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.650
And it's much cooler having
that experience on Glass.

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:46.690
So here's my shopping list for
Google I/O. I'm not sure that

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.290
I got that last item, but I
did get the extra socks.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:56.590
Now on this Evernote note, if
I tap on that Share arrow, I

00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.470
get all the places I can
share this note to.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.550
And of course, I'm going
to tap on Glass to send

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.520
this note to Glass.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.620
Now Evernote, since this is
primarily text, they do that

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.245
thing where they insert a
Timeline item that's text, and

00:41:12.245 --> 00:41:14.500
it autopaginates.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.020
In this case, it's the
shopping list.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.530
It's simple, and it's easy.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:19.950
I can see it on Glass, so I can
go through the store and

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:25.070
buy these extra socks or
unhealthy energy drinks

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.280
without having to go back
and forth to my phone.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.530
It's a really cool experience.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:34.430
All right.

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.550
Let's talk about Facebook.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:40.330
Facebook for Glass lets you
share your photos on Facebook.

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:43.430
And you can choose who you want
to share with, and you

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:45.240
can say something to
add a description.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.260
In this case, we've got
this photo that

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.290
I've taken on Glass.

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:55.750
Now I'm going to tap that image,
and I get options for

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.770
Share and Delete.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:01.780
This is just, at this point,
a picture on Glass.

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.630
When I tap on Share,
I get my whole

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:05.670
list of sharing contacts.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:08.720
And one of them, once I've set
up the Facebook Glassware, is

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.980
going to be much friends
on Facebook.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.900
Now you can also share with
public or with just yourself.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.160
I'm going to tap on this
sharing contact.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:26.610
And what Glass does is it
creates a new image on my

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.570
Glass Timeline.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:31.510
This time it's owned by the
Facebook Glassware.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:35.410
They get a notification I tapped
on that Share target.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:37.530
And what Facebook is doing is
it's going back to that

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:41.260
Timeline item and adding a new
menu item, Add Description.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.610
So this is immediately posted to
my Facebook Timeline, but I

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:46.990
can tap here and add a
description, say these are

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.810
white stargazers.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:53.410
And then Facebook will update
that Timeline item to also

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:57.140
include that caption,
that description.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.870
And it updates the post
on Facebook as well.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:06.120
Now that picture is going to
show up on Facebook, so my

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.165
Facebook friends can see it when
they visit my profile.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:17.250
This pattern here is the ability
to share a photo,

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.210
delete it right away if
it's an oops moment.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:22.840
But then add a description
is really key.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.830
Because I can do all those
things with Glass and sort of

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:27.880
just having that quick
experience or add a little bit

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.050
more information to it.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:31.812
I really recommend
this pattern.

00:43:31.812 --> 00:43:32.220
All right.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:36.830
Let's talk about "Elle." Now I
am not the target consumer for

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:43.210
"Elle." But what they're doing
with Glassware I think is just

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:44.310
really cool.

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:47.990
They also have this great
Settings page.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.580
And they're a really important,
maybe the number

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.380
one, fashion magazine out there
in the world, part of

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.630
the Hearst collection
of magazines.

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:00.540
And it's a neat experience
on Glass.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.400
You can select on the Settings
page for all these different

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.750
topics, much like
you do on CNN.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:09.400
But "Elle" does something
else that's

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.290
really cool in the moment.

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:16.110
As I get these items on Glass
throughout the day--

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.100
and this is a bundle with
multiple pages--

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.950
and I tap on any one of those
pages and I get this menu, I

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:30.420
can have this read aloud, I can
share it, or right there

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.110
in the middle I can add
to my reading list.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:37.050
Now I love this flow
for three reasons.

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.490
First off, I think it's
cool for the user.

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:45.140
As I'm reading "Elle" or other
articles on Glass, a lot of

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.190
the time having that headline
or that little bit of

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:49.260
information is exactly
what I wanted.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.950
I'm good.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:52.840
But sometimes it's like,
oh, I want to read

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.010
more about this later.

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:57.950
Or maybe I want to bring it up
on my computer at work on a

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:00.770
big screen and share
it with my friends.

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:01.680
How do I do that?

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.130
Well, I tap on Reading List,
and "Elle" adds this to the

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:07.190
Reading List on that Settings
page I showed you, right at

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:08.400
the bottom.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.981
And it's all of the links that
I've saved throughout my day.

00:45:11.981 --> 00:45:14.380
So it's cool for the user.

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:17.510
It also helps me, as a user,
spend more time with "Elle."

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:20.040
because now I'm also on
their web product.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.250
And finally, it helps "Elle"
know what are some of the

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.130
articles that I want to spend
more time with later, not just

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:28.620
the updates throughout
the day.

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.650
So it's really good for the
user, and I think it's really

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:31.990
good for the brand.

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:34.850
All right.

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:36.755
I want to do one more example.

00:45:36.755 --> 00:45:38.320
And I love this story.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.770
Ice Breaker is here at Google
I/O. Whereas this isn't

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:45.190
released on MyGlass website,
you can go to this website,

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:47.720
and you can install it while
you're at I/O and play with

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.220
each other.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.760
This is a game.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.880
A lot of what we've talked
about so far is very

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.470
productive, and sharing
with friends, and

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:55.410
it's a lot of fun.

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:57.270
But also, I want to
have a whimsical

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.270
experience with Glass.

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:03.045
Now these three guys got
together at one of our Glass

00:46:03.045 --> 00:46:06.110
Foundry events, met each other,
built some awesome

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:08.235
Glassware, and won
first prize.

00:46:08.235 --> 00:46:10.810
And afterwards, we were hanging
out, and we came up

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.450
with this idea of Ice Breaker.

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:15.110
And they built it
for Google I/O.

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:16.490
This is what you do.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:20.830
You land on their page, the
icebreaker.io, and it's going

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:21.950
to walk you through
the whole flow.

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:25.220
But let me just touch
on what happens.

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.800
First off, they send
a welcome card.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.030
And this is something
"Elle" does as well

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:28.970
that I really like.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:30.830
When you sign up for the
Glassware, it immediately

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:33.120
inserts a card into your
Timeline, so you know it all

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.820
worked, and the user gets that
kind of warm, fuzzy feeling,

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.020
like now I'm signed up
for Ice Breaker.

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:39.310
And it tells you a little
bit about what's

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:41.270
going to happen next.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:44.690
As Ice Breaker gets location
updates for where you are,

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:49.230
it'll find somebody else also
playing Ice Breaker and sends

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:53.330
you a card with their photo
and their name and the

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:56.000
encouragement to go meet them
and have a conversation, or

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.260
break the ice.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:00.350
You can get directions to this
person, you can pin or unpin

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:03.335
this card, and you can
also give up if

00:47:03.335 --> 00:47:05.220
you can't find them.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.580
Now let's talk a little bit
about those last two items.

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.125
First, the pinning, what this
does is when I pin a card,

00:47:12.125 --> 00:47:14.510
it's a System Menu item.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:15.910
It takes that card and
puts it on the

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:17.840
left side of the Timeline.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.950
That's the space reserved for
things going on right now.

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:22.190
Google Now is over there.

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:24.450
You've got your weather card,
maybe some stocks that you're

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:27.540
following, or other third party

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.470
Glassware that you've pinned.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:31.410
In this case, I'm looking
for Jonathan.

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:34.070
I want to make this new friend,
so I'm going to keep

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:36.330
it pinned to the left side of me
Timeline so I can look back

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:38.560
and like, OK, have
I found him yet?

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:42.000
It's like a fun person
scavenger hunt.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.890
The third option there
is to give up.

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.370
Glass is a very now device.

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:47.360
Remember that?

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:51.010
So in the patterns of doing
something with Glassware, like

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:54.390
breaking the ice and finding
people to do that, what

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:56.442
happens if I can't
find Jonathan?

00:47:56.442 --> 00:47:59.560
And in fact, Ice Breaker knows,
since it's getting

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.260
location updates, if we get too
far away from each other,

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.855
it'll send me a new person still
at the conference that I

00:48:04.855 --> 00:48:07.560
can find and make new
friends with.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.960
It's really cool, because it's
in the moment, and it matters

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.610
to me right now.

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:16.520
Now I find Jonathan, and
we have a conversation.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.360
We get to know each other, and
I take his picture, and I

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.350
share it with Ice Breaker.

00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:23.450
He then gets a notification
being like, did

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:24.460
Timothy really find you?

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.025
And did you have a good
conversation?

00:48:26.025 --> 00:48:29.550
If the answer is yes, then
I get more points.

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:32.660
And I keep looking to make new
friends who have Glass here at

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.150
Google I/O. Again, I really
recommend you try this.

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:36.400
It's a lot of fun.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:43.680
All right.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.420
Let's talk a little bit about
next steps, shall we?

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.700
We've talked about developing
for Glass.

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:53.450
That was this session.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:56.320
There's three more sessions
today, details about the

00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.010
Mirror API, building Glass
services right away.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.380
"Voiding Your Warranty." If
you want to go off-roading

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:07.400
with Glass, cut loose, and
do some crazy stuff--

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:11.090
or do some not-so-crazy stuff,
they'll talk about that too--

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:13.210
you can go to the "Void Your
Warranty" session.

00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:16.690
Now when I mentioned the GDK,
that's something you're like,

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:18.910
oh, that's what I really need
for my service, which might

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:22.760
happen for a few of you, that's
a good place to go and

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.570
get some more material to
start dreaming up those

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:28.980
experiences and give us some
feedback about that GDK.

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:32.330
The Fireside Chat with
the Glass team.

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:33.340
That's at the end of the day.

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.350
That's going to be
a conversation.

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:37.280
I'll answer just a couple
questions here today.

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.410
But some of the bigger
questions, I might be like,

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:41.010
come to the Fireside Chat.

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:43.520
And of course, please do bring
your big questions there.

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.550
We also have a Sandbox
out here on the

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:50.270
floor at Moscone Center.

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:53.060
So if you are live with us here
at Google I/O, please

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.630
come by and say hi.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:56.520
And let's have a conversation
about this stuff.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.360
And visit some of our partners
who are showing off their

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.160
Glassware there in
the Sandbox.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.600
Now we have some resources
as well.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.860
If you have questions,
go to Stack Overflow.

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.500
There's a Glass tag.

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.610
If you want to download some
code and get started with some

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:13.480
starter projects, GitHub
is the place to go.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.410
And of course, we have an issue
tracker for any bugs

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:16.580
that you might find.

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.930
Remember, we're in the developer
preview period.

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.680
So these conversations that you
have on these resources

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:26.810
are really helping us get this
API ready for the real world.

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:30.740
And the Mirror API is if you
want to develop Glass services

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.660
that people are going to use
and that you'll be able to

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.900
distribute to users soon, then
that's where you start.

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:40.470
And if you want to get in
depth with some more

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:42.990
conversations about Glass, we
have a general community.

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:45.600
For those of you that do have
Glass, you have access to this

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.850
site, glass-community.com.

00:50:51.617 --> 00:50:53.075
Thank you so much.

00:50:53.075 --> 00:51:02.290
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:03.200
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.630
So we have about seven
minutes for just

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.170
a handful of questions.

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:09.600
Please head over to
the microphones.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.190
There's one over here as well.

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:16.520
Please know that if you ask
about feature requests, I

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.560
definitely want to hear them.

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.630
That's what this explorer
period is all about.

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:22.710
However, I'm not going to be
able to comment on any future

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:24.570
releases or plans.

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:25.400
Yes.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:25.750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:29.400
Know John Blossom, Shore
Communications.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:33.050
On the API where you're showing
the ability for

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:36.660
individual apps to have command
cards, are those

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.900
commands specific to the app
or specific to the content?

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:44.670
Because it doesn't look as if we
really have the ability to

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:48.340
do the equivalent of tapping
on hyperlinks in that HTML.

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:53.920
So is anybody thinking about
how do you disambiguate

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.300
between buying this and
buying that, say?

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
a great question.

00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:00.610
So I think the question is
really about the Menu options

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.640
on the Timeline item.

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.930
So the way you do that is that
when you insert the Timeline

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:08.390
item, part of that JSON in that
structure is all the Menu

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:10.780
items that you want to appear
with that Timeline card

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:11.500
enumerated.

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:11.860
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:12.825
So it's content-specific?

00:52:12.825 --> 00:52:14.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
content-specific.

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.360
But you can build this however
you want in your app.

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.860
So if you have a template of
menu items for every certain

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:22.100
kind of Timeline item that you
insert, and you just slap that

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:23.960
into your JSON every time,
you can do that.

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.740
It's really under the control
of the Glass service.

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.910
And those can be the System Menu
items, like Reply or Read

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:32.230
Aloud, or they can be any
custom items that have

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:33.570
whatever name you choose.

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:33.900
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:36.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So let's say
you want to include a

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.590
hyperlink and you want to give
the user the option to save

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:41.050
that for later, for when they're
at their computer, you

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:42.340
can add that as a Menu item.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.280
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.890
And will the GDK, as it's
conceived today, include

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:50.140
signals from the headset?

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:53.200
Can you read from the headset
things besides what are on the

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:53.830
command cards?

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:55.200
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
there will be.

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.820
I don't have any details
about exactly what.

00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:59.010
But there will be access to some
of the hardware features

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:01.400
of Glass exposed in the GDK.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.400
Now the GDK itself--

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.170
I'll add a little bit more
information for those of you

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:08.720
that didn't rush off to
another session--

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:13.280
is essentially developing for
Android with an extra library.

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.080
So if you've already use Android
and you know those

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:19.670
paradigms really well, you'll be
able to download additional

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:23.510
code to target against that'll
give you more functionality

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:24.750
specific to Glass.

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:25.170
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:25.870
Thank you.

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:27.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You're
welcome.

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:27.900
Question over here.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.920
And then we're just going
to go back and forth.

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:30.210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:31.730
Steve Ogden from Starz.

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:32.510
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi, Steve.

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:35.340
AUDIENCE: Wondering, are you
adding any new sensors?

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:37.300
And also, could you go
over the existing

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:40.360
sensors within Glass?

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So I can
tell you what the user

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.290
has access to today.

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:47.010
There is sort of an
accelerometer.

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:48.740
They know if you look
up to turn on

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.080
Glass, like I just did.

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.440
There's a camera, and there's
a location built in to the

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.430
paradigm as well.

00:53:56.430 --> 00:54:00.630
When it comes to the GDK, the
best thing to do is if there's

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:03.450
a specific sensor that you want,
make sure that you let

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:04.620
us know on Stack Overflow.

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:05.900
Here's my idea.

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.410
I want to make sure I
have access to this.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.340
And then we'll work on that.

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:09.820
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:10.290
Thank you.

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:10.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We'll
do our best.

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:12.140
Thank you.

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:12.590
AUDIENCE: Hi, Tim.

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:13.620
Antonio [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.160
from [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.540
Apps.

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:16.330
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi.

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:17.690
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:19.960
You were my target for Ice
Breaker, by the way.

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.550
So I need to take a picture
of you right now so I

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:23.580
can send it to them.

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:24.420
Awesome.

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.930
So two quick questions.

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:30.780
You insisted that the image
resolution should be 640/360,

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.300
but everything we send
to Glass goes

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.760
through Google, right?

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.390
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Mm hmm.

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:36.850
AUDIENCE: So is Google doing
some processing of the images,

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:40.100
like if we send something that
is too big, you would reduce

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:43.485
it for us so that it gets the
right resolution for the user?

00:54:43.485 --> 00:54:46.170
TIMOTHY JORDAN: There's a lot
of optimization that we do

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.710
before the user sees
something on Glass.

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:50.890
And I'm sure there's more that
we could do over time.

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:53.140
But the reason I say you should
set the resolution to

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.350
full screen is that that gives
you the most control over

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:57.620
resizing and how it's going to
look when it's full screen.

00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:58.660
And that's always better.

00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.730
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:02.430
The second question is you
showed a few apps, like

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:05.200
Facebook, Twitter, Path,
"New York Times".

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:08.890
Are you going to have an app
store or a place where you can

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:09.820
actually publish your app?

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:09.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:11.680
AUDIENCE: As an app developer,
I'm interested in publishing

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.820
my apps there.

00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:15.960
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's a
really great question.

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.370
As everybody here knows, because
we're all developers,

00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:22.540
a healthy ecosystem involves
some story around discovery.

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:25.530
And right now, if the user
wants to add one of these

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:28.790
Glassware or Glass services,
they go to MyGlass, they've

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:31.350
got cards, and they
can turn them on.

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:34.780
And we believe that that's a
great paradigm for showing

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.640
users how Glassware is there.

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.900
At the moment, we're still in
developer preview, so we're

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:41.910
still working on the details
about how that's going to

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:44.740
evolve and how additional
third-party Glassware is going

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:45.480
to get in there.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.670
And those details will come.

00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:48.345
But we're definitely going
to have something.

00:55:48.345 --> 00:55:48.790
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:50.590
Thanks.

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:50.770
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:51.440
I'm Danny [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.030
I had a question about
best practices.

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:57.250
I was speaking with CNN, and
they mentioned that in their

00:55:57.250 --> 00:55:59.560
Glassware app they were
advised not to

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:00.830
use the Delete function.

00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:04.290
And I was wondering, why would
Google advise them not to use

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:04.790
that function?

00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:05.810
Because you mentioned it.

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:06.520
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
a great question.

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:06.890
Yeah.

00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:08.960
I talked about Delete
and Dismiss.

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.080
Now in the case of sending
data to the user that the

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.350
user's going to look at and be
like, hey, this is cool,

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:17.830
having them be able to delete
them encourages sort of a user

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:20.720
paradigm of curating
their Timeline.

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.340
Which doesn't really make
sense on Glass, because,

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:24.380
remember, there's this
single Timeline that

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.540
stretches into the past.

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:28.710
And since it's such a now
device, I'm going to be

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:30.870
looking at the recent
few cards.

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:33.530
I'm not going to scroll
to a week ago.

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:35.230
So why would I need
to curate it?

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:36.050
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:36.690
OK.

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:37.200
Makes sense.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.160
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:38.975
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:38.975 --> 00:56:40.720
I'm Lucas from [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:45.030
And you talked about you should
test the Glass in our

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:47.090
apps as much as possible.

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:50.530
But how much earlier will get
the other developers the Glass

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:54.000
before the customers
will get them?

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.350
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you're
asking, are we going to make

00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:58.500
more Glass available before
we're selling to consumers?

00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.040
I don't know.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:56:59.770
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:03.060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Right now, we've
just sort of finished

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:05.550
fulfilling and inviting people
that have signed

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:07.460
up at I/O last year.

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:10.020
And we're going on to the "If
I Had Glass" winners.

00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:11.490
That's the next big thing.

00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:12.510
What's next?

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:13.180
I'm not sure.

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.830
I'm sure we'll let you know.

00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:16.930
A way that you can make sure we
let you know is if you go

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:20.040
to google.com/glass, in there
is a web form where you can

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.230
indicate your interest and say
that you're a developer.

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.716
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:22.716 --> 00:57:23.690
Thanks.

00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:24.936
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:57:24.936 --> 00:57:25.244
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:57:25.244 --> 00:57:27.280
I'm Sebastian from
[INAUDIBLE].

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:30.480
I'm just wondering what features
you're going to allow

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.630
us in the GDK.

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:36.085
One of them that would be
interesting is, are you going

00:57:36.085 --> 00:57:38.650
to allow us to have access to
the video stream so they we

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:41.600
can display information directly
on what we are

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:44.690
seeing, something similar
to layers on

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:48.230
Android, but for Glass?

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:49.960
TIMOTHY JORDAN: As I said
before, I can't comment on any

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:50.940
feature requests.

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:52.930
But I like hearing them.

00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:56.220
I think right now the right time
to think about this is

00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:59.070
use the Mirror API.

00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:02.530
Your dream for Glass, can you
build that in the Mirror API?

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:05.220
And what that's immediately
going to tell you is, is this

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:08.800
going to be a simple and quick
user experience that makes

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:09.630
sense on Glass?

00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:11.940
And if it becomes really
complicated really quick,

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:14.330
sometimes that might make sense
for GDK, or maybe it

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:17.600
makes sense that it doesn't
work on Glass.

00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:20.680
But please do go through that
process of design thinking

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:22.700
about how this would work
on Glass, and let

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:23.973
us know in the forums.

00:58:23.973 --> 00:58:24.346
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:58:24.346 --> 00:58:25.110
Thanks.

00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:25.640
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:29.110
And I think, with that, we're
just out of time.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:30.870
Remember that we have
the Sandbox area.

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:32.080
Please come up afterwards.

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.270
And let's keep having
this conversation.

00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:35.520
Thank you so much.
