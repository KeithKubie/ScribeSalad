00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.670
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: Good afternoon. For those
of you I've not met before, I'm Barry Salzman

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.539
and I have to say I've not filled TechTalk
like this in the year I've been at Google.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.539
So, note to self, Mario, you are invited to
every one of our media platforms or hands

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:25.800
meetings from here on forward. So, I first
met Mario in 2001 and at the time, a reservation

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.200
at Babbo was the toughest reservation to get
in New York City. At the time I think he had

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.300
three restaurants-- is that right?-- and had
published two books. Ten years later, Babbo

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.300
is still the toughest ticket in town, which
in and of itself is no small feat in a city

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.920
known for fickle foodies, but in addition,
Mario has, I think, 15 restaurants today.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.210
I'm getting the thumbs up. Fifteen restaurants
today, published eight books, television shows,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.740
vineyard, charitable foundation and the latest
addition to-- I think the latest addition,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:10.670
unless I'm out of date-- to the Mario Batali
empire has been the Android App, and that's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.250
what he's here to talk about today. As a tribute
to Mario, I think everybody knows that all

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.900
chefs at Hemispheres are doing a set of Mario
Batali inspired dishes for lunch. So, after

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.470
this, be sure to head up there and join us
for lunch. I just wanna read you something

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.530
from Mario's official bio. And it says," At
the root of Mario's success is his passion

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.440
and respect for all of the great tastes and
traditions of Italian cooking, combined with

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:48.460
an insatiable desire to experience and experiment.
This magical combination of passion, education,

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.340
and chutzpah is on display every night at
his extremely popular restaurants, and evident

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.479
in his books and TV shows."

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.400
Well, last night I watched Mario's last appearance
at Google on YouTube and I want to say that

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.639
Mario, you have broken a Google record. He
was on record as being the outside speaker

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:19.010
to have used the f word more than anybody
else in a 45 minute presentation. So, I'm

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.790
certain he's not gonna disappoint this time.
Mario, I have to say it is f-ing good to have

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.790
you back.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.790
[laughter]

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.779
Please join me in welcoming Chef Mario Batali.

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:33.169
[applause]

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:43.099
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Good afternoon, everybody.
I'm sure you'll be slightly disappointed that

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.799
with a 12 year old and a 14 year old, I've
changed my rating from R to PG.

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:48.799
[laughter]

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:56.090
So, I only say "fuck" when it's really essential,
which sometimes is and sometimes isn't. I'm

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.840
here today in support of the launch of the
Android App that I have. It is, if you've

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.590
ever watched the old Food Network's show called
"Molto Mario", which is on now on the Cooking

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.480
Channel I think at 4:30 in the morning.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.480
[laughter]

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.769
Maybe it's 4:42 just to challenge you. No,
I think it's like 7:30 or 8:00. What it is,

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:25.779
is a straight-forward, very direct demonstration
of what really good Italian technique, how

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:31.340
simple it is, how much it's based on shopping.
And, as opposed to a lot of the other Apps,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.069
which are virtually cookbooks translated to
the page, this I actually walk through each

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.659
of the dishes, just as if I'm in the kitchen
with you. And the idea is to empower you to

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.939
feel that you can actually watch it. There's
a thousand features which we're gonna demo

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.019
in a few minutes that describe and display
how you can use it in the very complicated

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.019
world of multitasking, how we can use all
of the tricks and treatments to make it happen.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.999
But what it's really fundamentally about is
understanding that people, in addition to

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:04.559
wanting to go out to be entertained by food,
that what they really wanna do is understand

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:08.680
their food, they wanna love their food and
they wanna know about their food.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.609
Thirty years ago, you became a cook, not a
chef, right after you got out of the military

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.480
and some time before you went to jail.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.480
[laughter]

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.770
And that's because cooking at that time was
the lowest common denominator job. Anybody

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.800
could peel a potato, anybody could start in
a kitchen, and effectively work in a diner

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:37.340
in any town or in the military-- or in prison--cooking
food. Our fascination with food came as a

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.979
result of our fascination with our health,
our understanding of our health, our fascination

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.699
with the things that give us pleasure. And
I must say, I'm quite pleased to say that

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.199
whereas 30 years ago you might go out to get
a bite and then go to the game or go to the

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.509
opera and then get a bite, or go to a concert
or a museum and get something to eat on the

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.910
way, at this point now amongst many of the
people in this room, the bite is actually

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.689
the central part of our evening or our afternoon.
And it's our obsession and our pride and our

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:12.009
understanding, as well as our internationalization
in our super Suave' Bolla way that we travel

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.270
around the world and look for things that
make us happy, that food has come to the center

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.520
of the plate, as it were. Subsequent to that,
of course, cooks became a little bit more

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.370
successful. And it's in no short, it's not
to short it, but I think that although cooks

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.780
have enjoyed a certain little bit of fame,
eventually the next rock stars aren't gonna

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.030
be cooks. It's gonna be farmer's [looks to
the left and sighs] and fishermen because

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.000
eventually you'll realize that no matter how
much technique there is and how many bams

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.470
there is or how many squirt bottles there
is, or all of those other things, effectively

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.580
what really is the biggest decision is you're
going to make are going to be on what you

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.759
buy and how you source it and where you get
it. So, there's also shopping parts in this

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.320
app, but I think the real understanding is
to make something delicious, you really have

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.629
to buy something that has a point of view.
And it's that kind of slow-food mentality,

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:08.130
that kind of searching for biodiversity that
is what I really try to represent at this

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.740
point. I don't know if any of you have heard
about this little grocery store I opened up

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:17.520
called Eataly on 23rd Street. But if you walk
in there there's a, there's a huge component

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.370
of it is slogans. It's allowing people to
understand that it's one little bite of information

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.280
that will allow you to really get your hands
on what a great tangerine is, or why you eat

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.069
this kind of spaghetti or what kind of oil
this is. And it's not really about Italian

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:37.740
food. It's about the micro-regional components
of Italian food and American ingredients as

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.169
well, cooked into that world that make it
so satisfying to do and so delicious and also

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:48.520
nutritious for you. So, this app has all of
that rolled into it and what it really is

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.530
about is empowering you to understand that
you can cook just like I can, almost as good

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.759
as some of the great grandmothers from Italy.
And that's the objective behind this is to

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.419
remove a little bit more of the veil, to look
a little bit behind the curtain, but effectively

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:06.600
watch and learn how to cook the kind of things
that I do, as well as use it just for entertainment.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.230
I mean, it's just kind of fun to watch someone
who seems to know what they're doing, doing

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:15.349
what they do pretty good. And that's why I'm
here to do it. Now, I'm gonna introduce Matt

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:19.800
Bardin, who's my partner in this, who understands
all the technology of it. Basically, I stood

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.300
up in front of a camera for about five days
and we shot 85 videos, which is a good little

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.999
clip, and we had a good time. So, Matt, why
don't you show us about how to use this Android

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:30.999
App?

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:39.719
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Ok. So, let's, this is the
home screen of the app. Actually, maybe we'll

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:45.319
start with -- no, that's good. And the main
feature, navigationally, is this--

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:48.509
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Hold on. Lemme interrupt one
second. If there is any questions at all time,

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:52.259
it can be, we can just go right ahead and
say or ask. Bring up what you want. If you

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:55.910
see something that looks incongruous or you
just wanna say that you love Led Zeppelin,

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.090
I mean, just bring it on.
[laughter]

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:04.949
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: So the nav-, main navigation
features this dial, which is inspired by a

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:12.870
stove dial and basically, we give the users
a lot of ways to navigate and drill down and

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:19.409
look at the recipe. So, you can go by region,
by course, by season, things kids love cause

00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:24.470
Mario's into kids. You can bookmark your favorites.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.470
[laughter]

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:31.289
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: "Mario has kids," is what
he meant to say. I have kids; I like their

00:08:31.289 --> 00:08:36.600
friends, we hang out. I'm not so into kids.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.600
[laughter]

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: No, I haven't heard that.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.600
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: I'm childish is what he meant
to say. I'm childish, that's what he meant

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600
to say.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600
[laughter]

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: And he hasn't used the f word
once.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Not yet, just the fucking
introduction.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.600
[laughter]

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:51.110
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: So, let's look by category
and let's look at the pastas. And I didn't

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.580
bring my glasses up, so I don't know what
this is.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.330
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: That's Bucatini All'amatriciana.
One of my personal favorites.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.390
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: So, if you look at it this
way, you can scroll through and just quickly

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:08.061
look at all of the steps. You can also hit
the--not the back button--whoops. You can

00:09:08.061 --> 00:09:18.470
also hit the menu button and this custom designed
navigation bar lets you see the ingredients,

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:25.280
which you can also move to your shopping cart.
It lets you see all the videos that would

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.740
relate to this particular app and I mean--

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.070
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Meaning that as you use an
olive oil, if you wanna understand a little

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.430
bit more about olive oil, right then and there
you stop, you put a little bookmark and say,

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.340
"All right. Lemme find out a little bit more
about olive oil, maybe before I use it or

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.750
before I purchase it." So then you go to that
and then if in the middle of that, for some

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.700
reason, you wanna understand a little bit
about how to zest a lemon, you can go right

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.890
back to that and say, "All right, lemme show
you, lemme see how to zest a lemon." And then

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.590
go back to the recipe and then continue through.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:57.280
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: And since you mentioned going
back, this tab right here is for bookmarks

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.640
and as soon as I touch that it's automatically
bookmarking this recipe. So, that's how I

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:09.100
jump around and can cook several things at
once. So now if I wanna cook this recipe,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:18.080
I would turn it this way, in landscape mode
and this gives me the steps, either in text

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:25.080
form or in images. So, I can scroll through
and just look at all the images. A lot of

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.490
chefs are visual people and they can kinda
look at this and get a sense of what they

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:36.050
wanna do, but then it also gives you the text
and you can toggle back and forth. This one

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:42.900
doesn't -- oh, there's a timer. If Mario calls
for a timer, we've built them into the app.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.900
And--

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.710
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: So, say simmer ten minutes,
for example. Or, cook pasta--

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:50.710
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Whoops! Was there a timer here?
There it is.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:51.710
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: There you go.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:58.440
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: So, if I tap this bar, there's
my timer and I set it and it's now running

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.920
behind all of these. It's good, right?

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.280
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Perfect. Nice, huh?

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.280
[laughter]

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.280
Bravo, Matt.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.280
[clapping]

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.650
Now, if at that same time, you went to another
recipe of a salad that you were making to

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.430
serve with this and there was a timer on that,
you could run concurrent timers going at the

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.910
same time. It will also warn you when your
spaghetti should be coming out of the water,

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:22.740
in case you're busy on the phone or liking
kids or whatever else you do.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.740
[laughter]

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.700
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Which Mario is known to do
apparently. So, just in terms of -- Mario

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.110
mentioned the other kinds of videos there.
There are not just recipes in this app. There

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:38.950
are also two other kinds of videos. There
are kitchen basics, which -- do you wanna

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.060
talk about that a little, Mario?

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:45.700
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Sure. I'll describe how and
what you should look for when you're buying.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.130
Or, what you should be aware of. We'll talk
about different kinds of salumi, what salumi

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.980
is, where you can buy it, what the good ones
are, what the ones that aren't so good are.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:57.140
I generally don't talk poorly about anything,
but if I find something I find that I don't

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.630
like, I'll mention a way to avoid it and that's
just about going to the right stores.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.080
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Umm.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.360
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Like, if you wanna know about
salt, I talk about salt for like, four minutes.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.760
[laughter]

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.361
It's just the kinda guy I am.

00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:11.361
[laughter]

00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:14.690
I think the understanding, however, that really,
in addition to your – to the ingredients

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:20.640
that you use and that you buy specifically
for that dish, the most often drive-by victim

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.671
is the things that you use in your pantry
that you haven't evaluated. If you're using

00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:29.790
a subpar oil or a subpar salt or a subpar
kind of tomato or a subpar kind of anchovy,

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.690
everything that you use that in, or even breadcrumbs.
If you use them improperly or you buy them

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:38.350
wrong, the building blocks, the fundamental
starting, the foundation of your dish is already

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.500
marred. So, you're not gonna be able to stand
much of a chance of making it great. The point

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.860
is not necessarily following only what I say.
It's about developing your own culinary point

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:52.650
of view. And the informational text and the
informational videos in here, kind of coerce

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.650
you to become more involved in understanding
your pantry, which is really how you're gonna

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.110
make much better food. And having three different
kinds of salt because you know what they're

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:04.920
for and using their different levels of salinity
and their texture, will affect the final composition

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.510
of the dishes as well as the pleasure it's
going to give to your friends and yourself

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.200
and understanding those details, is what making
really good food is all about and it's not

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.750
complicated, especially when someone describes
it to you. Maybe reading it, it's not so obvious,

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.620
but when you're sitting there looking at it
and I'm pointing out the things and what to

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.430
look for, that empowers you to become a better
cook. I hope.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:27.950
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: So, let's just go back to,
let's go back to that recipe and just show

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:28.950
you the video--

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:34.650
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Three -- two minutes and 23
seconds, let's get your sauce going, Matt.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:35.650
[chuckles]

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:44.490
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Oops. Ok. Let's turn it back
this way and now you can watch the video.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:49.600
You can watch the video. There we go. Speak
now--

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.600
[laughter]

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.220
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: It wants you to speak now.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.320
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Ok.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:00.480
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Don't talk. Shhh!

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:09.824
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: What was that? I don't know
what that's doing. Here we go.

00:14:09.824 --> 00:14:10.824
[pause]

00:14:10.824 --> 00:14:11.824
[beep]

00:14:11.824 --> 00:14:12.824
Can you guys hear this?

00:14:12.824 --> 00:14:13.824
[video clip playing]

00:14:13.824 --> 00:14:14.824
Anyway, that's the video.

00:14:14.824 --> 00:14:15.824
[laughter]

00:14:15.824 --> 00:14:16.824
&gt;&gt;Audience Member #1: Mario, what is that?.

00:14:16.824 --> 00:14:17.824
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Bucatini all'amatriciania;
that means bucatini in the style of the women

00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:22.230
from Amatricia. It's spaghetti with a hole.
What I have here is guanchiale. If you couldn't

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.580
find some guanchiale--

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.580
[laughter]

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.360
you would go buy some pancetta or some great
American bacon. I just give it a little chop

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.120
right here with one of these fancy knives.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.120
[laughter]

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.390
I point to my name on my sweatshirt. And then
I show you that even with the hands that used

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:40.450
to be the Jimmy Dean pure pork sausage hand
models, you can actually still make good food.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:41.450
[laughter]

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:45.760
The beauty of this is using these cameras,
we use these Canon 5 cameras that are so beautiful

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.050
that you get in there and you can really get
a good sense of it. I always use extra virgin

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.050
olive oil.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.780
[laughter]

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.760
And blah, blah, blah. And it goes on and it's
just like a segment from one of the old shows

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.190
that I used to do, that I'm going to be doing
again, where I fundamentally show people how

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:05.560
to do it step-by-step, watching it there.
I'm really in the kitchen with you which it

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.950
what makes it fun and it also makes it something
that you can really use. It's almost as good

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.540
as a Kid Rock video as far as I'm concerned.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.540
[laughter]

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.540
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: All right.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.721
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Any other details?

00:15:16.721 --> 00:15:21.350
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Uh, I think that's a good start.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.920
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Good. All right. Barry, why
don't you come up? Let's talk a little bit.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.410
Matt'll keep going through that and show us
other details.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:29.420
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Here's the shopping list.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.180
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Well, the shopping list is
really cool because what will happen by the

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:38.950
end of next Spring, is you can create a shopping
list and then you can push a button and it

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:43.240
will go to Eataly and they will send it to
you. So, you're--

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.240
[clapping]

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.730
sitting around pretending you're working,
"Yeah I'm calling someone really important"

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.590
and you're basically shopping for tonight's
meal. Eataly will deliver that to your house

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:56.190
before you get home. That's technology working
for us, my friends.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.380
[audience chatter]

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.380
[clapping]

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.380
[bell ringing]

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.790
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: The timer just went off.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.440
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: There's the timer going off.
Take the pasta out.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.800
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Take the pasta out of the
pan.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.800
[laughter]

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.800
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: I would love to sit next
to you, but I have to stand, since [ ].

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.800
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: All right, no problem.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.360
&gt;&gt;Audience Member #1: We can get them on our
computer, can't we?

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:17.160
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: On your computer. Well, I
know that it, I know they can get it on one

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.450
of your competitors smaller format programs.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:21.450
[laughter]

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.940
I've seen that one. Have you guys got a gPad,
yet?

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.940
[laughter]

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.510
I'll bet it's coming, though and it was immediately
beyond that.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:29.710
&gt;&gt;Audience Member #1: Ok, thank you.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:34.870
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: So, I'm not gonna sit and
have the kind of conversation I would like

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:40.040
for I'm not micced, so I'm gonna stand at
the podium. But I wanted to maybe kick it

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:45.630
off with sort of a broader question and then
we'll come back to the app, Android specifically.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:50.850
But Mario, the broader question is one that
you and I were talking a little about yesterday

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:55.950
and if I look at the arc of your career, to
the ten years, the last ten years and the

00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:00.990
incredible increase that you've had over the
last ten years, it's paralleled very much

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:10.530
a broader interest in food, right? It's the
interest in food, the farm-to-table movement,

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:17.890
nutrition, a lot of these, the making of chefs
as celebrity. This has really been a phenomenon

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.600
that has increased exponentially over the
last ten years. Why? What do you think has

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.949
driven that change in how we think about food?

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:30.480
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Well, I think food became
a significant part of people understanding

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.600
that not only should they exercise, but they
should eat well. I think that information

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:41.310
became much more diffuse with the rise of
the Food Network and then subsequently with

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:47.150
the rise of social media and technology. I
think that it's now very much part of the

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:52.240
game to share information very quickly as
it comes out, as you hear about something.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.790
And the way that we do it now, it used to
be that we wrote letters and then we used

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:02.090
the phone and then we used the handheld phone
and now we can virtually send any piece of

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:07.690
media, any long short document, any piece
of video from cell phone to cell phone, from

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:13.680
handheld to handheld, in seconds. So, the
information gets out. It's much more widely

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.511
read. It's much more widely appreciated and
the sophistication of the people that are

00:18:17.511 --> 00:18:22.210
reading what used to be a Betty Crocker recipe
are now much more fascinated in the idea of

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:27.020
not only regional Italian cooking, but they
understand the difference between the cooking

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:31.880
of Puglia and the cooking of a town in Puglia
called Bari. And then when you wanna talk

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.150
about what really makes Bari interesting,
is the kind of fish that they use there or

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.030
the kind of sweet peppers they use in their
fish stew and suddenly there's a whole level

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:46.450
of sophistication that travel around and as
we will all realize very quickly in the next

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:51.980
ten years, when all content will become free,
then we're gonna really see how that kind

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:57.590
of information goes out. And it's gonna be
much more tied to how you create the relationships

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:02.860
between the content provider and the content
user that's going to make the really big difference.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.360
And the advertisers and the book companies
and, sadly, the record companies have missed

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.590
the entire boat, are all starting to really
pay attention to how this information's getting

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:15.270
out. And that's, that's the real next ten
year generation ideology. It's how we're going

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:19.950
to monetize something, but how also we're
gonna take credit for our own ideas in a world

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:26.310
where it's shared so quickly that it's everyone's
idea at the same time. Which is good, this

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.780
is good. Don't get me wrong. It's not a, not
a bad thing.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.720
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: This is, in the meantime,
anyone who has questions from the audience

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.620
if you wanna make your way to the mics; it
looks like we've got another part of the demo.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:40.300
But feel free to, to make your way to the
mics. Just as a follow-up to that, Mario.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:46.630
So, the Internet being a big catalyst of this
trend, or this phenomenon, because of access

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:53.410
to information. What it also seems that it's
done is create the opportunity for individuals

00:19:53.410 --> 00:20:00.100
to become celebrities and to create brand
around themselves. Prior to the digital media

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:05.600
momentum, the real brands were those that
were owned by very large companies that had

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:12.070
the resource to get the exposure and the,
and the publicity. How do you relate your

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:18.140
success in building the Mario Batali brand
to digital media? Which tools have been more

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:22.690
powerful for you? Where do you feel like you've
had better traction and what has been not

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.120
as effective as you might have expected?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:33.660
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: That's a good question. I
would say that being part-- just being, just

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:41.730
being present in the revolution helps a lot.
I certainly wasn't the first person on, on

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:46.451
YouTube, but a lot of the things that I do
are now well represented. And the beginning

00:20:46.451 --> 00:20:50.790
of that was letting people who might not have
ever watched your show, or ever cared about

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.620
Food Network or ever cared about Italian food;
suddenly, there's a compelling reason to take

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:59.480
a look at one little bite of it. And that
introductory level is what causes people to

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.590
take it viral, if you would like to say that.
And the idea of being able to use that as

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:08.740
a, as, not so much as a marketing tool, but
as a communication tool to allow the message,

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.720
provided you have one; a lot of people don't
have a message and they're all over the Internet

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.210
and all over YouTube, and that's all right,
too. I mean, it's kind of funny to watch the

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:20.960
cat like, chase the alligator for a minute,
but at the end of the day, whatever. I think

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.780
information and content's what's gonna drive
that and if you have that, it's much easier

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.420
now to meet people that might not have ever
heard of you. There's a guy named Gary Vaynerchuk,

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.880
the wine guy, who started out with this weird
little thing in New Jersey and now he's, now

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.880
he sells like ten million dollars worth of
wine in a matter of three years. He's taken

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:44.490
it from a standard iPhone camera, or whatever
camera that you use, and-and-and broadcast

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.970
himself into a position with the Wall Street
Journal, where he's like, the wine guy now

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:52.420
for young people. And it's interesting to
see how he's managed that and it's because

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.460
his content is unique. It's because he's funny
and because he knows what he's talking about.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.350
[incoming tweet sound] And all of the rest
is, all of the rest of it is tools that we

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:05.080
need to learn how to use or we can disregard
and figure out later on. I'm new to the world

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.270
of tweets, Twitters and twats, as it were.
I'm not sure of how you -- the past participle,

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.270
but--

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:14.730
[audience laughs]

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.070
I guess tweeted. I'm sorry. I'm new to this
world and I enjoy it because it's not like

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:22.790
I say, "I'm going to get a pedicure." I-I
manage it in a way that it seems at least

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.900
more interesting to me and a few more people
than just-- I see a lot of people just saying,

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.670
"Yeah, I went and I had a tuna sandwich."
Well, that's really great. Why did you waste

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.970
my time telling me that? But if I say, "All
right, I went and I understood how they cured

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.700
this tuna and I made something interesting
out of it and I watched it." And there's a

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.550
whole level of information, then this new
social media has traction because it has something

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:47.400
more for someone to get their hands into.
If it's just, I mean, "We have a party on

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.430
Thursday and you're all welcome to come,"
is a great use of it because you might reach

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.880
people that you want to come that you never
would have had access to. But just saying

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.040
what you're doing, "I got a hair cut on Thursday,"
is like, "Yeah, right. Good."

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:03.050
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: I see you put some other
content up. Did you wanna talk about that?

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.940
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: I just, you were talking about
Puglia and I just wanted to show another feature

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.350
of the App is to drill down into the recipes
by regions.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.040
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Stretching out eastward toward
Greece and Byzantium.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:18.790
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Whoops. So, here's the map
of Italy and I got Puglia wrong, sorry, Mario.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:24.060
First, I put up Lazio or something else, but
here's Puglia and so here's information about

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.130
the region and then the recipes that are on
this App right now that are from Puglia.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:32.040
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Which is pretty cool. 'Cause
that's original content. That means that's

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.110
not in the book. What that is, is you get
something that's unique to that, and that's

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.510
what, that's what kind of drives an App sale
for me. A lot of the Apps are like, I like,

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:43.450
I like the Google App that you can talk into
the phone. That's probably the one I use the

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:48.100
most cause I can say, "All right, where the
hell is Harry Cipriani right now?" And that

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:53.410
finds it for me. But other informational ones,
like there's this one by a guy named Ruhlman

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:58.190
called Ratio, which for me is the greatest
cook App of all time. If-if you have a fundamental

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:02.309
understanding of how to cook, and you go on
Ratio and it says sausage. It says this is

00:24:02.309 --> 00:24:06.720
how much of meat, this is how much of fat,
and this is how much of spice as a ratio.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.080
And if you wanna make a pound of sausage,
it tells you what to do. Same thing with a

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.760
biscuit batter or a cake mix or a, like a
hundred things. You go in there and you say,

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.630
"All right, I wanna know how to make this."
And you kinda know how to make roux-based

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.360
gravy, like a Thanksgiving gravy, how much
roux do you need for a gallon of stock?

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.360
[metal door closing]

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.360
And it shows you how to--

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.950
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: A lot.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:30.050
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: I'm not worried. Just so you
know -- that's what an aneurysm sounds like.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.050
[laughter]

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:36.250
So if you have one of those in a private,
quiet room, go to your doctor.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.250
[laughter]

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.690
But the idea of -- the information exchange
is what it's all about and that's what makes

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:43.400
this App kind of distinct. I'm really cooking
there with you. It gives you all the information

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.470
that you might have ever thought about while
you're on the show and that's kind of interesting.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:48.470
Yes.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.390
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Hi, Chef Batali,
thanks for coming. So, I actually have a reservation

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.870
at Lupa with some Googlers tonight.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:53.870
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Beautiful.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.220
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: And I'm wondering
what should we order?

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.220
[laughter]

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.230
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: That's an excellent question.
Have you been there before?

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:03.010
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: No, it's actually
my first time.

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:08.860
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: OK. The best way to understand
an Italian meal is to get some antipasti to

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:14.550
split up. Then, get one pasta per two or three
people and split them. And then everyone get

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:18.410
an entree, so that at least everyone gets
one thing that they guaranteed they like.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.940
But you taste other things, like there's this
crazy calves tongue in a slightly briny pickle

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:28.070
with sliced onions in it that's called lingua
salmistrata that is so good, but so many people

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:32.010
wouldn't order it because they won't wanna
commit to that appetizer for themselves. So,

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:36.140
you get like four, five appetizers for five
people, or six people. Then you split a bunch

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:40.220
of pastas, then you'll all get your main course.
If you never had the cacia &amp; pepe, which is

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:47.240
a sheep's milk cheese and black pepper pasta
condiment, we do it as better than almost

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:53.640
any other place in-in-in America and it's
the most classic peasant dish of all Roman

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.870
trattoria. It is not a fancy dish, it's not
a ristorante dish, but it is so good when

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.620
you taste it that you'll die. You won't die,
actually. You'll be happy and live longer.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.620
[laughter]

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.380
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: I'm going for
happy. Thank you.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.391
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: There you go.

00:26:05.391 --> 00:26:09.320
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: All right. So, this is not
a shy crowd. You're not gonna make me sit

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.980
here and read out questions from the Dory,
I hope. So--

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.710
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: And you don't even have to
go to the mic, if you just wanna yell it.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:15.710
Like, I can hear.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.920
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: There are recipes in the App,
by the way.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.920
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Yes.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.920
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: So, hi, my name's
Phoebe. Thanks for coming again.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.920
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Hi Phoebe.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.920
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: I had the chance
to do an internship at a goat farm and one

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:33.300
of the things I learned while I was there
is that it's very challenging to get a foothold

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:39.210
in New York City when you're a small supplier.
So, I'm curious, how do you, how do your restaurants

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:44.240
make their decisions about which suppliers
to go with and how long term are your relationships

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.520
with your suppliers typically?

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:53.510
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Good question. The easiest
way to impress one of the purchasers--and

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:57.220
the purchasers in our restaurants are always
the chefs--we don't have like "purchasers;"

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.940
we don't have that big of an organization.
You bring in a sample. You make sure you get

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.770
an appointment. You talk to the head chef,
or a sous-chef, you let them taste the product

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:11.441
and if it's great, we'll buy it. We love the
idea of local. We love the idea of-of things

00:27:11.441 --> 00:27:16.630
that represent the Italian ideology. When
you talk about ricotta, like, the hardest

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:20.530
thing for us to do often is to get sheep or
goat milk ricotta because it's inconsistent.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:24.350
Because the animals give up milk when they're
ready and if you don't do a lot of the animal

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:28.090
husbandry and you can keep your herd in the
same kind of growth pattern that you need

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:32.380
to make this a year round supply of cheese,
if you're out of it for three weeks, you fade

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:36.280
out of our radar and we need to find a way
that we can get it almost regularly. That

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.380
said, we'll still run specials with products
that maybe come intermittently. Like, listen,

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.530
it's only in the spring that we get ramps.
So, we run ramps in our menu for five, six

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:48.110
weeks and then they're gone. Which to me is
a very beautiful thing because that causes

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:53.670
us, in America, who can buy strawberries on
Christmas Eve -- it allows us to understand

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.610
that, in fact, there's seasons to some of
these things and the time that they taste

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.559
best is when they're in fact coming out of
the Mother Earth when Mother Earth planned

00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:06.120
on it, as opposed to being made in a gaseous
environment with grow lights on it. Virtually

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:10.580
all of our agriculture is now being run like
green pot used to be run out of Northern California--

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.580
[laughter]

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.160
You put everything in a dark hole with a lot
of light on it and it'll grow as quickly as

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.340
you need and then you sell it. Two hundred
dollars an ounce, it used to be. Now, it's

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.270
like twice as much as that as far as I can
tell.

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:21.270
[laughter]

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.510
And that's what they're doing with the mesclun
and all these crazy greens that have absolutely

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:27.690
no season and no reason to be on a plate in
the middle of the winter. So, that, I mean,

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:33.640
the fundamental core of your product is something
we want. We want local, farm-made, beautiful

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:38.080
products that represent something similar
to that in Ita- in Italy. And what we buy,

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.210
and we don't try to import all the ingredients
from Italy. The reason our food tastes Italian

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:47.110
is the same reason that the food in, in Venice
doesn't taste like the food in Palermo. 'Cause

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.559
the people in Venice don't buy ingredients
from Palermo. They don't like the idea of

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:54.460
it. They use all their local ingredients because
for an Italian the thing that tastes best

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.740
is the thing that smells like the wind on
a Thursday afternoon within ten minutes of

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.660
where their mom had them. And if you can capture
that smell, whether it's in the Mid Atlantic

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.320
Hudson Valley, or whether you're in Charleston,
or whether you're in Puglia or whether you're

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.970
in Champagne, Illinois, capturing that regional
flavor is the true method ideology that you

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:13.860
really wanna get to, when you're cooking something
that speaks more than just the recipe, but

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:20.970
of the passion of your interest in the flavor
of the soil and geospecificity of the place

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.679
you live in. So, bring us your cheese.

00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:23.679
[Barry and audience laugh]

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:24.679
Yes.

00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:30.590
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: So, big fan. Thanks
for all the great years on Food Network. So,

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:34.800
you brought up salt a second ago and there's
this kind of new trend for all different kinds

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.240
of salt out there. What's your take on the
pink Himalaya salt and the smoke salt and

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.690
either just sea salt and Kosher salt? It would
be really interesting to hear about that.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.240
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: For me, I use salt for three
things.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.179
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Mario, make him buy the App.

00:29:48.179 --> 00:29:50.679
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: He's gonna buy the App. Of
course he's gonna buy the App.

00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:52.940
&gt;&gt;audience #3: I didn't even do the QR code
yet. I'll--

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:58.620
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: There you go. Well, we need
support on the App in this manifestation because

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:03.600
so far, I believe it's hard for people to
shop for an app in-in the Google space right

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:09.750
now, because it's not organized in a way that
you can just say," I want Mario Batali's app."

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:10.970
You have to say, "Mario Batali, or Mario Cooks"
 -- or it's very specific to whatever the

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:15.630
actual description is, so I'm sure your guys
are working on that to make it easier to do.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:20.080
Because if there's any way to make money,
this app business is knockin' them out of

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:26.510
the park. The guys who present them, the I-
company, as well as the G- company, are gonna

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:30.140
make a lot of money on this if they can make
it easier for the customer to get to the product.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.810
Salt is used for three things.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:34.810
[laughter]

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:41.440
Salt is used as a preservative, as a flavor
enhancer, and as a texture. As a preservative,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.010
I would use kosher salt. Like if I'm making
salami or I'm making something that I wanna

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:49.559
make [incoming tweet sound], like duck comfit
or I want something to dry out, if I wanna

00:30:49.559 --> 00:30:52.480
make gravlax or cured salmon, or anything
like that, I use Kosher salt because it's

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.299
not expensive; it's texture is not so sticky
to my fingers and the salinity is relatively

00:30:56.299 --> 00:31:01.580
benign. There are fine sea salts that are
much saltier and you use them in ways that

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:05.040
you want to, but I'll get to flavor thing
in a whirl. The flavor component, what you're

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.760
looking for is a salt that's softer, easier,
or more intense, or more specifically relates

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.220
to where the salt came from. There's the wet-looking
salt from France; the French have done a great

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:18.860
job marketing salt that normally would've
been a buck a pound and is now 15 dollars.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:24.720
They have this sel, sel de mer, sel le carmargue,
sel de whatever. And some of them were still

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.380
even wet and we're still buying them. We're
buying half-processed salt. And that flavor

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.530
component is something that matches the dish.
If you want something to taste like it's from

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:36.760
Puglia, you should buy Puglia olive oil, you
should buy Puglia olives, Puglia spaghetti,

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.990
Puglia tomatoes, and Puglia salt, if you can.
That said, what I use and then there's the

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:46.660
textual component. And there's this super
Sale Mare Grosso from Sicily, there's the

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.920
Maldon sea salt, which is my personal favorite
and that's about the shaley texture and it's

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.760
slightly lower salinity on a finished dish.
Like you cut a steak, you grill a perfect

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.940
steak, you coat the heck out of it with salt
and a little bit of pepper and olive oil and

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:02.580
you grill it until it's just charred beautifully
and has a nice crust. Inside a steak like

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.799
this, though, it's not salty on the inside.
It's not, it's not seasoned. So, we'll slice

00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:07.799
the steak and then we'll put a little more
extra virgin olive oil and a little bit of

00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:14.030
this Maldon salt on it, so you get this crunchy
texture, a lower level of salinity, but a

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:18.700
game that turns up that rare piece of meat
in the center, or well done if you so like

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.890
it. But what it does is it makes that whole
chewing experience, that one bite captures

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:27.920
everything that I want to say about the potential
for beef's flavor. And it's because I salted

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.200
and crusted it on the outside, I cooked it
right, I let it rest, and then I finished

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.790
it with a different kind of salt. And that's
the understanding of salt. And so, I would

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:40.150
say you need Kosher salt, and that's also
for your pasta water, you need a big crunchy

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:44.581
sea salt that you put in a salt grinder, or
a pepper grinder to put over things when you

00:32:44.581 --> 00:32:50.500
cook them, and then you need a crunchy less
salty salt to finish dishes, which is my favorite

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.280
is the Maldon. Now I go into it in much further
detail.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.280
[laughter]

00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:06.240
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: I'll check it out
as soon as I can. Thanks.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.240
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Beautiful. Yes, sir.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.240
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: Hi, thanks for
coming.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.240
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: My pleasure.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.240
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: Thanks for letting
us try out your App. I, I had one question

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.690
and one criticism about the app, if that's
OK. The first question I had is, the app has,

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.580
I believe, 30 or 40 recipes, in total?

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.580
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: 65.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.040
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: 65. Is there a
plan to get more recipes in there, in the

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:24.611
future? Is that gonna be an update, or are
we gonna have to buy more recipes? How is

00:33:24.611 --> 00:33:25.611
that gonna work?

00:33:25.611 --> 00:33:26.611
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: You're going to have to buy
more recipes.

00:33:26.611 --> 00:33:27.611
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: No, it's fair enough.
I just, is that planned?

00:33:27.611 --> 00:33:29.850
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: It's just like a cookbook.
This is a small cookbook that, for five bucks,

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:35.429
is a good deal. The next one, the thought
originally was to do an in-store upgrade,

00:33:35.429 --> 00:33:39.610
but the problem with that is that if, say
you sell 150 thousand. The only people that

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:43.080
can buy the upgrade are the ones that have
the 150 thousand. The idea of selling a second

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:49.440
one might be that I'll do the flavors of summer,
or I'll do pastas for Easter, or I'll do a

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.790
smaller one and it will, it will be a more
specific need thing. Maybe somebody doesn't

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.800
want 65 videos; maybe they just wanna know
how to make the feast of the seven fishes

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.810
for Christmas Eve for next year.

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:00.500
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: So, it's gonna be a separate
 – separate app.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.000
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: It'll be a completely separate
app. And that's a business decision.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: I think it would
be, personally, I think it would be cooler

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.229
if you could expand, if you could download
another package that already works with this

00:34:10.229 --> 00:34:12.339
app. It's the same format. You're already
used to using it, but--

00:34:12.339 --> 00:34:15.739
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: But you understand that I
would limit myself to the people that had

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:19.349
already bought it. Like, there would be not
one new customer. Because if you didn't buy

00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:21.339
the first one, you don't even know about the
second one. 'Cause it comes up in that first

00:34:21.339 --> 00:34:22.339
one.

00:34:22.339 --> 00:34:23.339
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: Depends how you
market it.

00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:25.669
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Well, I mean, if you market
it, though, and you still have to buy the

00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:27.200
first one, some people might just say, "You
know what? I don't want the first one."

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.889
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: Well, you buy the
first one with the updates.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:29.889
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Right.

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:30.889
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: But, all right.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:33.609
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: It's possible something could
be put in--

00:34:33.609 --> 00:34:40.539
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: One kind of criticism
I had was I was looking through the app and

00:34:40.539 --> 00:34:48.409
I was looking at pan con tomate and I was
looking at the ingredients and it said something

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:49.409
like, what was it, "Six ounces of peeled tomato."
I don't know how to measure that. Like, how

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:50.409
many tomatoes are that? Is there a way--

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:51.579
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Well, they have this device
called a scale.

00:34:51.579 --> 00:34:52.579
[laughter]

00:34:52.579 --> 00:34:53.579
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: OK.

00:34:53.579 --> 00:34:57.071
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: And I know they're hard to
find. No, I mean, you could put it in cups,

00:34:57.071 --> 00:35:00.079
but tomatoes don't really, I mean, like what
you do when you go buy a tomato is you put

00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:03.280
it on the little scale there at the store
and that will tell you. Like that. Once you

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:08.920
have that, the reason I use measurement like
that is because once people see what an eggplant

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.869
weighs or what an onion weighs, it's always
surprising that an onion might cost a dollar.

00:35:12.869 --> 00:35:15.309
You'd think an onion should almost be free.
And then you realize that an onion weighs

00:35:15.309 --> 00:35:18.569
between a pound, a pound and a half. And you
put it on there and it's 49 cents a pound,

00:35:18.569 --> 00:35:23.760
but it's already 75 cents when you weigh it.
And understanding that is to start understanding

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.450
food and it's, it's seeing it in a different
light, although if it challenges you, I'm

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:31.450
not happy about it because I'd rather you
intuitively understand what we say. But we're

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:35.720
kind of stuck using the measurements. It's
cups or ounces and ounces kind of throw people,

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.369
you're right. It kind of throws people off,
but you can't really measure a tomato in any

00:35:39.369 --> 00:35:42.249
other way. I mean, I can't put it, I could
say, "This much."

00:35:42.249 --> 00:35:44.549
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Wait! Doesn't it come in a
can?

00:35:44.549 --> 00:35:47.200
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: You could buy a canned tomato.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.720
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: I mean the tomatoes.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:55.190
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: We're talking about fresh
tomatoes, I think.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.190
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: Fresh tomatoes.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.190
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: If we're making pan con tomate,
I'm grating it over like this.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.190
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Oh, that's a bug. We gotta
fix that.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.190
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: All right.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.190
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: I'll take a look at it.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.190
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: And the party on
Thursday? Where, where is that?

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:02.190
[Mario laughs]

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:03.190
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: It's at Del Posto and Volkswagon's
throwing it and Gavin Rossdale from Bush is

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.359
playing live at Del Posto. I think that is
pretty cool. What time's it start, Pam?

00:36:06.359 --> 00:36:07.359
&gt;&gt;Pam: Uhh.

00:36:07.359 --> 00:36:08.569
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: She's not telling.

00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:13.099
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: She's kind of squishy. I'll
be there at 6:30, just for the record. Yes.

00:36:13.099 --> 00:36:18.369
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: Hi, I'm out here
for the week and New York is awesome as far

00:36:18.369 --> 00:36:21.180
as restaurants go. A food item I love that
you have in your app is--I don't know if I'm

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.940
saying it right--is brashal or braciole.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.829
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Braciole.

00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:32.569
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: And I can't find
it any, at any good Italian restaurant on

00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:38.059
the West Coast. So what could you recommend
out here as the place to get that?

00:36:38.059 --> 00:36:40.880
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Well, there are, of course,
my restaurants. And I'm pretty good at that.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.880
[laughter]

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.890
Let me, without being shameless on that, I
would say that if you're looking for the classic

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:51.940
red sauce done in the most traditional New
York style, you can walk through all of Little

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:57.770
Italy and never find it, but if you spend
15 minutes on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx at

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:01.980
a place like Mario's or Roberto's -- if you
haven't been there and you're only here for

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.010
a couple of days go out there as soon as you're
done with work today. Go to Randazzo's, get

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:10.979
a couple of clams on the half shell standing
outside with a glass of cheap gavi, which

00:37:10.979 --> 00:37:16.309
hardly exists and then go to any one of the
seven, seven great Italian red sauce places

00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:20.420
within two blocks of Randazzo's and go to
the Madonia Bakery and get the prosciutto

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:25.190
bread. It will bring you to a place that they
don't have anywhere else in America. And not

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:30.729
so much in Italy anymore and I know that we
have braciole on Thursdays at Lupa. So, I

00:37:30.729 --> 00:37:34.460
mean, you can go there. But don't discount
Arthur Avenue as one of the great things that

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:40.289
we have here that we don't, that very rarely
do Manhattaners and Brooklyners-- the hipsters

00:37:40.289 --> 00:37:41.670
that I'm talking about--

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.670
[laughter]

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:46.880
I know where you're from, all right? I know
where you all live. We rarely go to the Bronx

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:52.329
anymore unless we're going to the Yankee Stadium.
And to go to Arthur Avenue and see the real

00:37:52.329 --> 00:37:57.220
Italian America and tradition alive and better
than the Sopranos ever was; that's where I

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.049
recommend you go. It is wild.

00:37:59.049 --> 00:38:00.530
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: Cool. Thank you.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:01.550
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Sure.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:06.569
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Thank you again.
My wife actually grew up in Italy and in five

00:38:06.569 --> 00:38:07.920
minutes, she can whip something up that takes
people hours and tastes half as good. She

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.920
does a lot of this--

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.920
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Count your lucky stars.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.920
[laughter]

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.539
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Oh, I know. She's
a keeper. What's your view on improvisation?

00:38:14.539 --> 00:38:16.700
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: What's my?

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:25.069
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Your view on improvisation?
I know you have the recipes and maybe switching

00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:29.809
little things here and there. She seems to
have a knack for knowing, "this is gonna go

00:38:29.809 --> 00:38:32.890
well, this is not gonna go well." How do you
view all that?

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:35.890
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: I completely love it. And
in fact, the idea of taking a recipe to the

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:41.470
grocery store and it says all right veal with
mushrooms and escarole and you go there and

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:44.420
the mushrooms, they don't look so good, but
you buy them because you're feeling like you

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.930
gotta get it. And the escarole, well, that
looks like it's three days old, but you buy

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:53.380
it cause you feel you gotta get it. Once you
become the master of a certain recipe, you,

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:59.420
to-to-to move around within that recipe starts
to become intuitive when you experiment a

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.940
little at the house. I don't say experiment
when you have 12 friends over and it's a big

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:07.390
wine geek dinner at your house. But what you
do do is you understand that a shitake mushroom

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:11.079
certainly works for a portabella mushroom,
neither of which might not be as good as a

00:39:11.079 --> 00:39:14.970
porcini mushroom, but at 38 dollars a pound,
porcini mushrooms might be a special occasion.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:18.930
So, maybe just cook crimini mushrooms today.
And mushrooms are obvious because that's the

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:22.670
natural thing, but when you start to understand
kind of the genus of the different kinds of

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:27.380
things that you're using, like any cruciferous
vegetable will work, if broccoli raab isn't

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:31.160
there. And you could use broccoli, but you
could also use cauliflower or you could also

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:36.430
use the Romanesco and understanding that they
come in kind of groups is where you can start

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:40.750
to experiment and that's when you really become
the master. Like, you read a cookbook and

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:43.680
you make these three recipes and they're all
good and understanding that if you're doing

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.880
something braising, like an osso bucco and
it's traditionally got carrots and onions

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.900
and celery, that you could use celery root
and put mushrooms in there as well, or dried

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:55.120
porcini. You start to think outside that box
and that's when you start to become the master

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.731
of your own destiny. And that's when cooking
becomes something that is instead of going

00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:03.910
with a recipe to the store, you go and you
buy the five best things like, "That looks

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:07.369
unbelievable today." And then you get home
and you figure out what you're gonna make.

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:11.651
It's less about the recipe and more understanding
the steps of the technique. If it's just a

00:40:11.651 --> 00:40:16.980
sauté and then some stuff goes in the pan
and then you finish it with wine and finish

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.660
the sauce, then it could be anything. And
you're only limited by your imagination and

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.789
every now and then you have kind of a dud.
But a dud isn't that bad 'cause it means you

00:40:23.789 --> 00:40:32.479
made it anyway. The real component here is
these; the human touch. The actual nature

00:40:32.479 --> 00:40:37.239
of something being handmade is what distinguishes
it from the rest of people's food. And if

00:40:37.239 --> 00:40:41.219
we can get our hands on it or get someone
that we like, or even love or don't even really

00:40:41.219 --> 00:40:45.640
care for, but will appreciate their technique,
if we can get their hands on our stuff, than

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:50.180
that handmade component is what really transforms
something from being pretty good to really

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.180
exceptional.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.180
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Thank you.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.230
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Sure. Yes.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.440
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #7: Hi. My name is
Dahila.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.880
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Hi, Dahlia.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.359
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #7: Thank you for
coming in. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but

00:41:01.359 --> 00:41:05.230
the goal of your app is to provide original
information to users in a unique way and to

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:12.719
engage them. How has the response been and
do you think you're achieving that goal?

00:41:12.719 --> 00:41:18.460
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: I don't, original is an odd
thing when you're talking about a cuisine

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.839
that's three thousand years old. It's kinda
my take on a lot of the dishes. It certainly,

00:41:22.839 --> 00:41:27.619
my take is slightly original, but not so much.
I'm much more of an adherent to the tradition

00:41:27.619 --> 00:41:33.480
world than the experimentation or, for lack
of a better word, the molecular gastronomy

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:38.950
world. So, the content is my kinda take on
traditional stuff, but it's, I think it's

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:43.979
been successful in that people are cooking
more. I think when people walk in to Eataly,

00:41:43.979 --> 00:41:47.579
they say the same thing, "I wanna eat something."
And what we want them to understand is, "Yes,

00:41:47.579 --> 00:41:50.650
come in and eat something, but eat something
in support of understanding that you can make

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:54.119
this at your house." And I think that people
are starting to use it. Certainly, the larger

00:41:54.119 --> 00:41:58.710
you can see it, the more you feel like I'm
in your kitchen. I haven't had very many complaints,

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.420
but again, I don't read complaint mail very
often.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.420
[laughter]

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.390
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: You can look at the reviews
on that other store.

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:06.059
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Okay. So the reviews are good.

00:42:06.059 --> 00:42:07.059
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: They're very positive.

00:42:07.059 --> 00:42:08.059
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: People love the app.

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:09.059
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #7: Thanks.

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:10.059
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: So, I guess we're good.

00:42:10.059 --> 00:42:13.920
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: I just wanna chime in with
one other thing about the other, your question.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:19.280
You know that it was a choice to-- Mario,
how many recipes do you have in your device?

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.539
Like, 800,000 or something?

00:42:20.539 --> 00:42:22.109
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: No, like 120,000.

00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:29.009
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: No, but literally he has thousands
and in terms of making this app, we discussed

00:42:29.009 --> 00:42:32.680
doing something that wouldn't have the video
content and the images, but it seemed like

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:39.099
you kind of wanna put this guy in your device
and not just have a bunch of text. So, that's

00:42:39.099 --> 00:42:41.130
why there were 63 recipes and not 800.

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.609
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Like Mark Bittman.

00:42:42.609 --> 00:42:43.609
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Right.

00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:46.369
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: whose book is brilliant, but
he doesn't really show you how to do it like

00:42:46.369 --> 00:42:50.489
I show you how to do it. So, if there's ever
a question on technique, not that ours is

00:42:50.489 --> 00:42:55.299
that complicated, but this should remove any
doubt if there's ever a question on how far

00:42:55.299 --> 00:42:58.599
it brown is brown. Or how deep, dark, golden
brown something needs to get before you turn

00:42:58.599 --> 00:43:05.529
it over before you braise. Or how to deal
with pesto or whatever. It's very visual;

00:43:05.529 --> 00:43:07.309
it's very obvious; it's very clear, I think,
I hope.

00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:08.380
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: Thank you.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.380
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Sure.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.380
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: So, Mario, can we just take
those last four questions?

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.380
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Sure, sure.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.799
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: OK, so we'll cut it off after
the fourth.

00:43:12.799 --> 00:43:13.799
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: All right.

00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:18.950
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: So, I was introduced
to OTTO in my first week in New York, seven

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:25.150
years ago, and I still go regularly and over
the years I got a few questions. So, first

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:30.479
can you tell us something about the pizza
recipe there because it looks kind of unique?

00:43:30.479 --> 00:43:31.529
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: At OTTO?

00:43:31.529 --> 00:43:32.759
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: Yeah.

00:43:32.759 --> 00:43:36.280
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: I decided that I wanted to
put a restaurant in One Fifth Avenue, which

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:41.640
is very near my house, directly across the
street. I love the building, I love the look

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:47.579
of it, I love the location and I love the
fact that it was very much featured in "Ghostbusters",

00:43:47.579 --> 00:43:51.809
if you remember when the Stay Puft Marshmallow
Man was coming down the path to crush Bill

00:43:51.809 --> 00:43:56.440
Murray. Although, the large shot showed him
on Central Park. It's, in fact, in that building.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.440
[laughter]

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.440
So, I was very excited about that.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.440
[laughter]

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.569
The problem with that building is that there
is no gas lines. There is no open flame. It

00:44:03.569 --> 00:44:08.130
is all electric, so we had to create a pizza
recipe that would work on a flat-top griddle

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:13.059
and an under hood broiler. So we did, which
has a slightly, a little bit more yeast; a

00:44:13.059 --> 00:44:19.410
lot less manipulation with it. And it's relatively
crisp and not so elastic like some of the

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:23.530
Neapolitan pizzas that are enjoying fame right
now. I think it's a delicious pizza. It is

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:27.940
 -- in Italy, every different region has its
own different kind of pizza. The pizza in

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:32.200
the rage right now is the Neapolitan, which
is considered the mother of all pizzas. And

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.549
it's got a little bit more pull to it; it's
very light and has this kind of spongy not

00:44:35.549 --> 00:44:39.700
so crisp top and a lot of it is very wet in
the center. I like it a little less wet in

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:43.969
the center, so we put less stuff on it, but
I think the fundamental similarities that

00:44:43.969 --> 00:44:47.849
we share with all good pizzas is that there's
not too much stuff on it ever. And it's really

00:44:47.849 --> 00:44:53.039
about the balance between the dough and the
condiment, which is very much like in pasta.

00:44:53.039 --> 00:44:55.940
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: And my other question
is a--

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:56.940
[coughs]

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:01.349
sorry. I tried all your other Italian restaurants,
and the Spanish ones. It seems like you-you-you

00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:06.269
have the range of like, very expensive ones
and less expensive ones and then there's OTTO.

00:45:06.269 --> 00:45:07.269
It's really cheap.

00:45:07.269 --> 00:45:08.710
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Cheap is a bad word--

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:09.710
[laughter]

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:10.710
&gt;&gt;Matt Bardin: Inexpensive.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:14.460
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: Frugal. Yeah, in
a very good way.

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:15.460
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Right.

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:19.849
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: [clears throat]
So, I often sit there and eat pasta alla norma

00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:22.869
or something, and I wonder how can you actually
sell it for nine dollars? It's cheaper than

00:45:22.869 --> 00:45:28.049
really bad pastas I ate elsewhere, and it's
great. [clears throat twice] Like, do you

00:45:28.049 --> 00:45:33.190
lose money when I, when I eat there?

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:34.190
[laughter]

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:38.969
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: I appreciate your concern.
Thank you.

00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:39.969
[laughter]

00:45:39.969 --> 00:45:44.099
And one day we're gonna turn a profit there.
As long as you stop ordering so much of the

00:45:44.099 --> 00:45:50.960
pasta alla norma. No, what, what, what, our
trademark, and particularly in our less expensive

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:55.289
restaurants, is to make it even a little bit
more like real food in Italy. And when you

00:45:55.289 --> 00:45:58.869
eat really great food in Italy, often enough
what surprises you, even though maybe you're

00:45:58.869 --> 00:46:03.980
not so cognizant of it, what surprises you
is the lack of white noise. There's, when

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:08.300
you order spaghetti with peas and prosciutto
in Italy, it's literally only spaghetti with

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:12.319
peas and prosciutto. Like, the prosciutto's
the fat, the peas are in it; maybe a dusting

00:46:12.319 --> 00:46:16.249
of parmesan origiano. But what the fundamental
difference is, is there's not a lot of extra

00:46:16.249 --> 00:46:20.309
chef ego on there. And in that same sense,
when you eat pasta alla norma there, it's

00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:23.950
basic tomato sauce, it's the eggplant that
we've baked in the oven and then a little

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:27.329
bit of that creamy ricotto over the top. There's
not a lot of other stuff, so it's easy for

00:46:27.329 --> 00:46:32.029
me to make. It's inexpensive because I'm not
adding all of this ornate, technical components,

00:46:32.029 --> 00:46:36.119
which means I need a lot more hands to cook
it. And then people eat it and they order

00:46:36.119 --> 00:46:40.249
 -, and it's not like a giant portion. Like
Americans have come to expect that the one

00:46:40.249 --> 00:46:42.849
pound bag is a unique serving size.

00:46:42.849 --> 00:46:43.849
[laughter]

00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:49.839
And in Italy, between 70 and 90 grams is the
normal size of a portion. So, you get six

00:46:49.839 --> 00:46:53.579
portions out of one bag of spaghetti because
they expected to eat something else, whether

00:46:53.579 --> 00:46:57.700
it's just a salad or two slices of prosciutto
or a small main course. So, you're getting

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:01.099
the right portion and what you're doing is
because it's nine and you're having another

00:47:01.099 --> 00:47:04.420
couple of things, so that maybe you get to
20 dollars or 15 dollars or wherever the normal

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.369
is, but you can find a satisfying experience
on that. So, thank you and thanks for coming

00:47:09.369 --> 00:47:12.509
in and thanks for your concern. OTTO is my
most profitable restaurant.

00:47:12.509 --> 00:47:13.509
[Barry laughs]

00:47:13.509 --> 00:47:18.829
Because we sell a lot of wine, too. I mean,
the whole experience is a very fair deal.

00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:22.160
And it works out really well, but I mean also
keep in mind profit is based on volume and

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.910
OTTO this last Saturday did 1273 people. Woohoo!

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:26.269
[laughter and clapping]

00:47:26.269 --> 00:47:33.040
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: Any chance of any
cheaper restaurant? Any more less expensive--

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.040
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Less expensive?

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.040
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: less expensive
restaurant, which you would make more money

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.040
on?

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.040
[laughter]

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.180
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: I'm always working on them.
Have you been to Eataly yet?

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.769
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: I tried.

00:47:40.769 --> 00:47:46.120
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Go! Just go on and don't go
on a Saturday and don't go when there's a

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.330
velvet rope and some guy talking into his
wrist in the afternoon. I'm sorry about that.

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:51.330
&gt;&gt;audience #7: I tried going--

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:53.630
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: I open up this great thing
that I was so excited about and basically,

00:47:53.630 --> 00:48:00.970
I walk into my building and I get in the elevator
and the guy looks at me and says, "Nice line,

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:01.970
asshole."

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:02.970
[laughter]

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:05.060
What? He said, "Yeah, there's a line 300 people
long to get here, fucking grocery store, asshole."

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.060
[laughter]

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.060
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Thank you.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:14.849
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: Hi, Mario, my name
is Frederick. I am, I would to talk a little

00:48:14.849 --> 00:48:23.359
bit about Eataly and I think it was the opening
was the 31st of August and I know the concept

00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:27.079
from Europe. I know you briefly talked about
the beginning, but do you think this is a,

00:48:27.079 --> 00:48:32.059
like, a sustainable business? Like, sort of
a melting pot for Italian culture and so on?

00:48:32.059 --> 00:48:36.059
My own experience was I obviously loved the
variety of products and foods. It felt seeing

00:48:36.059 --> 00:48:45.069
there a little bit like a supreme in McDonalds,
in terms of efficiency and so on, and the

00:48:45.069 --> 00:48:48.664
coffee is, I didn't find it particular good,
but I like the place in terms of--

00:48:48.664 --> 00:48:50.960
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Did you drink your coffee
at the Lavazza bar or at the Vergnano?

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.359
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: The very, at the
entrance and that fits like a Starbucks more--

00:48:54.359 --> 00:48:55.359
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Yeah, it does.

00:48:55.359 --> 00:48:56.400
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: than anything else.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:01.450
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Come in another 30 feet and
there's a big silver machine and all they

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:06.940
sell is espresso and espresso macchiato. There
are no milk drinks. There is no other things

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:10.644
other than those two things and it's two and
a quarter. Go in and have that coffee and

00:49:10.644 --> 00:49:16.039
I assure you your coffee faith will be restored.
As for the rest, efficiency is what Americans

00:49:16.039 --> 00:49:20.279
bring to the table. The passion, the excitement
and the product are what the Italians bring

00:49:20.279 --> 00:49:25.910
to the table. It's definitely sustainable.
Last Saturday, 14700 people went grocery shopping

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:33.579
there. Which is a number that I have no idea
how it happens. But what it is, unfortunately,

00:49:33.579 --> 00:49:38.559
like any great thing in New York, it's over-crowded
during peak hours and it's just right during

00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:44.210
non-peak hours. So, the best way to understand
a place like that is to go at 9:30 at night,

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:48.239
or go at 10 o'clock in the morning on the
weekends, but on Saturday and Sunday, between

00:49:48.239 --> 00:49:52.709
like one and eight, it is, it's like a Beatle's
concert. It's crazy.

00:49:52.709 --> 00:49:55.339
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: So, I guess this
has been a success then so far. Do you think

00:49:55.339 --> 00:49:57.250
they're gonna expand it to other cities as
well?

00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:03.609
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Yes, and we love the expansion
idea. I am a partner in Eataly in North Central

00:50:03.609 --> 00:50:09.460
and South America. I would say probably our
next location will be Toronto and probably

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:13.880
our third location will be Mexico City. And
then I'll try to find one in America. You

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:20.559
need the sophisticated clientele that you
get in an inner city as well as the resulting

00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:24.950
high-rolling suburbs, but they need to be,
they need to. It can't feel like it's gonna

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:29.849
be in Pasadena. It can't, to me, look like
it's in a mall. It needs to be in a place

00:50:29.849 --> 00:50:34.609
that kind of embodies the, like we're in the
toy building in Manhattan, which is a beautiful

00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:39.039
building right across from the Flatiron. And
it needs to feel a part of that vibrant part

00:50:39.039 --> 00:50:44.969
of that live city culture. It wouldn't feel
good in, in Culver City in Los Angeles. It

00:50:44.969 --> 00:50:48.859
wouldn't feel good outside of Chicago; it
would have to be down in the middle of town.

00:50:48.859 --> 00:50:52.569
So, the real issue is finding that kind of
real estate. It's 50 thousand square feet

00:50:52.569 --> 00:50:56.599
in a place that makes sense. So we're looking
into it. But Toronto is like a homerun. It's

00:50:56.599 --> 00:51:00.720
easy. We can get downtown location. It's the
largest population of Italian North Americans

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.849
outside of New York and a great place to be.
So, that's where we're going. Thanks. Vergnano.

00:51:02.849 --> 00:51:03.849
Caffe Vergnano. Yes.

00:51:03.849 --> 00:51:04.849
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #10: Hi.

00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:05.849
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Hi.

00:51:05.849 --> 00:51:07.339
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #10: So, I wanted
to just ask, so you deliver very traditional

00:51:07.339 --> 00:51:18.479
Italian dishes to sort of the American market.
Do you find that sometimes you have to compromise

00:51:18.479 --> 00:51:29.309
on certain things to suit the American palate?
So, say – like if you go to Rome and you

00:51:29.309 --> 00:51:35.359
get a pasta and it's very al dente; there's
like maybe two, three ingredients in it. It's

00:51:35.359 --> 00:51:40.680
not very heavily seasoned. Do you find that
dishes like that maybe aren't so popular here

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.369
and you don't try and sell them, or do you
try and adjust it to suit a palate? Like,

00:51:44.369 --> 00:51:50.809
how do you struggle between staying very traditional
and sort of suiting to the American taste?

00:51:50.809 --> 00:51:54.980
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: That's a very good question.
I would say that the one compromise that we

00:51:54.980 --> 00:52:00.259
might make would be that there's probably
ten percent more sauce on our pastas here

00:52:00.259 --> 00:52:04.920
than there would be in Italy. Anywhere. Anywhere
in Italy. And that's because they look at

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:09.759
the dish as the noodle and the condiment,
or the sauce, as like, salad dressing. Like,

00:52:09.759 --> 00:52:13.910
the idea of having extra dressing at the bottom
of a salad is repugnant to all of us. The

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:17.809
idea of having a little extra sauce to drag
up with our bread is kind of what the Americans

00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:21.839
feel their right is. It's rare that we'll
send out, if someone says, "Can I have extra

00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:26.569
sauce?" We have to actually say no. But we
put a little bit more on just to kind of stem

00:52:26.569 --> 00:52:30.359
that tide. Al dente is a concept that Americans
only think about.

00:52:30.359 --> 00:52:33.279
[laughter]

00:52:33.279 --> 00:52:37.539
Many of them love saying it and many of them
actually like to say "al Dante."

00:52:37.539 --> 00:52:38.739
[laughter]

00:52:38.739 --> 00:52:41.609
Dante was a Tuscan poet from the 1400's.

00:52:41.609 --> 00:52:42.609
[laughter]

00:52:42.609 --> 00:52:46.779
If we had anything al Dante it would certainly
be rather disgusting and buried, so--

00:52:46.779 --> 00:52:47.779
[laughter]

00:52:47.779 --> 00:52:51.609
Al dente in Italy is one thing. It is almost
crunchy and Americans just don't love it and

00:52:51.609 --> 00:52:58.119
the Italians absolutely do. So when we recognize
the low-tip potential of a six top of Italians,

00:52:58.119 --> 00:53:01.650
we definitely undercook their pasta to the
level that we think they want. If Americans

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:06.670
say al dente, I mean we serve it in the realm,
but if you want it, if someone says they want

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:12.221
it like Italy, we will make it literally 30
seconds less in the water.

00:53:12.221 --> 00:53:13.221
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #10: So, we can actually
request that?

00:53:13.221 --> 00:53:14.221
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Oh, absolutely.

00:53:14.221 --> 00:53:15.221
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #10: When we visit
your restaurant?

00:53:15.221 --> 00:53:16.369
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Say I want it just like Mario
says and if you go to Eataly, that's the only

00:53:16.369 --> 00:53:21.359
way we serve it. And we piss off 20 customers
a day, but if they want it more cooked we

00:53:21.359 --> 00:53:22.719
just put it back in the pan, no problem.

00:53:22.719 --> 00:53:23.769
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #10: OK, thank you.

00:53:23.769 --> 00:53:24.769
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: So ask for it Italian al dente.

00:53:24.769 --> 00:53:25.769
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #10: Fantastic, thanks.

00:53:25.769 --> 00:53:26.769
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Sure. Yes.

00:53:26.769 --> 00:53:27.769
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #11: So as the last
question, thank you again for coming.

00:53:27.769 --> 00:53:28.769
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Oh great.

00:53:28.769 --> 00:53:29.769
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #11: I think that
your most well-known for your Italian dishes

00:53:29.769 --> 00:53:30.769
and your Italian cooking and most of the conversation
today has been about Italian cooking, but

00:53:30.769 --> 00:53:34.020
you also have this little place called Casa
Mono, which I think is one of my favorite

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:39.040
restaurants. It's fantastic. And now that
you've opened Eataly and we have the perfect

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:54.269
place to go buy all of our Italian products,
where can I go buy my Spanish products, or

00:53:54.269 --> 00:53:55.489
where should I go?

00:53:55.489 --> 00:53:58.519
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Despania on Broome has just
about anything you'd ever need. Also, latienda.com

00:53:58.519 --> 00:53:59.950
is where they get all their stuff.

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:00.950
[laughter]

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:04.329
So, when you wanna buy morcilla and you don't
wanna pay their markup, latienda delivers

00:54:04.329 --> 00:54:10.119
overnight just like everyone else does. The
real winners in the, in the Internet trade

00:54:10.119 --> 00:54:13.869
business are the customers and UPS and FedEx.

00:54:13.869 --> 00:54:14.869
[laughter]

00:54:14.869 --> 00:54:18.060
So, as long as we understand that, then it's
great 'cause we can get products delivered,

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:23.859
I mean, let's put it this way. If you go on
peck.eat.it and you wanna get a culatello,

00:54:23.859 --> 00:54:27.789
which is illegal to bring in, and you tell
them to mark it with "book" label on the outside,

00:54:27.789 --> 00:54:29.969
they will ship that to your house and no one
will stop it.

00:54:29.969 --> 00:54:30.969
[Female Audience Member #11 laughs]

00:54:30.969 --> 00:54:33.890
So, there's a thousand ways to get around
the pesky rules of the USDA.

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:34.890
[laughter]

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:42.619
But that said, that said, the Spanish products
outside of the really hoof on Iberico, we

00:54:42.619 --> 00:54:45.529
can get just about everything cause the Spanish
guys kind of paid attention a little bit more

00:54:45.529 --> 00:54:49.829
quickly and didn't kind of isolate some of
their products. So, go to Despania on Broome

00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:51.160
and maybe Green--

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.499
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: Lafayette.

00:54:52.499 --> 00:54:56.430
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Lafayette? Great store. And
they have tortilla espanola perfectly made.

00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:57.430
Almost as good as the one we make at Bar Jamon.

00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:58.430
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #11: Perfect. And
I was one of only ten people in Eataly almost

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:00.299
locked in there for the night on Sunday. So,
that's a totally different experience.

00:55:00.299 --> 00:55:06.369
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: You got the luck of being
locked in there?

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:07.412
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #11: I did. Almost.

00:55:07.412 --> 00:55:11.069
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: You know people will pay for
that.

00:55:11.069 --> 00:55:12.650
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #11: I know.

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:13.650
[laughter]

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:14.650
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Well, thank you.

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:19.259
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: So our, in appreciation,
our commitment as a team is to download enough

00:55:19.259 --> 00:55:25.029
of these apps to get it to number one on the
Android store so we stop hearing about the

00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:29.400
other people and how they do a better job
of promoting. So, help me out with that, folks.

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.420
Mario, anything you wanted to say about the
app before -- anything else before we, before

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:34.420
we wrap?

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:39.140
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: I think the funnest part about
it is if you like me, you can have me in your

00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.140
kitchen.

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.140
[laughter]

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:44.690
If you don't, you shouldn't download the app.
I'm sorry.

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:45.690
[laughter]

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:49.279
But it's-it's-it's me doing what I do and
what I enjoy in a very relaxed setting, very

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:53.549
much like this, and it feels like this. You
don't necessarily get my witty response and

00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:57.970
repartee, but you do get the answers to your
questions. And if you say, I say, and then

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:02.859
you zest a lemon, and you say, "I don't know
how to zest a lemon," or, "I don't know how

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:04.930
to trim an artichoke," or, "I don't know how
to make a ragu," or whatever, you can go to

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:08.269
the video that will give you that information
with the support. And that's what this is

00:56:08.269 --> 00:56:15.640
about. This is not the most voluminous recipe-heavy
app on the market, but it is the one with

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:21.209
the most clear, most distinct, most personal
presentation of my take on what this food

00:56:21.209 --> 00:56:22.450
can and should be. And that's why you would
buy this app. Yes.

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:27.239
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #12: One more question.
What do you think about the Barney's Holiday

00:56:27.239 --> 00:56:28.239
Window?

00:56:28.239 --> 00:56:29.239
[Mario laughs]

00:56:29.239 --> 00:56:34.150
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: What do I think about Barney's
Windows? If you haven't seen them, there's

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:38.959
this crazy guy named Simon Doonan, who's a
visionary whose job it is to draw the eyes

00:56:38.959 --> 00:56:44.430
of the world to Barney's Christmas Window
so that you'll go there. I was the sacrificial

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:48.880
animal in the middle of this table and there
was something with a neck of mine about this

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.930
big and then in the tiny neck was a miniature
orange crocs all around me and in the middle

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:55.980
of my mouth is an apple, or something red
and large.

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:57.049
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: Wow.

00:56:57.049 --> 00:57:04.209
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: I'm flat-, like reading Heat.
It's flattering to be a part of it; it's not

00:57:04.209 --> 00:57:06.819
that beautiful to enjoy myself.

00:57:06.819 --> 00:57:07.819
[laughter]

00:57:07.819 --> 00:57:12.559
But that said, it's iconically clear where
their caricature is going. And I'm just proud

00:57:12.559 --> 00:57:16.519
to be in the game. So, I'm, I'm all right
with it. It's funny; the one in Vegas is even

00:57:16.519 --> 00:57:19.150
weirder. You gotta see it, it's pretty strange.

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:20.150
[laughter]

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:23.640
But that said, it's fascinating and fun and
the pop culture component of our business

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:28.279
is wild and it's amazing how many people pay
attention to it and see it and know about

00:57:28.279 --> 00:57:31.599
it, even from a perspective of someone who
doesn't shop at Barney's and doesn't even

00:57:31.599 --> 00:57:35.779
go to 61st Street very often, of which, I
fit into both of those categories. But that

00:57:35.779 --> 00:57:40.680
said, it's kinda cool. And Simon Doonan is
wacky. I mean, it's like being in a Disney

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:42.750
cartoon. He's wacky. I love it.

00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:48.410
&gt;&gt;Barry Salzman: So, I wanted to say when
I kicked this off, I said I didn't think you'd

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:54.769
disappoint and I think that was absolutely
right and Mario, I just have to say the personality

00:57:54.769 --> 00:58:00.119
is a whole lot more colorful than the hair
and shoes put together. So, thank you very,

00:58:00.119 --> 00:58:01.499
very much for joining us today. It was a pleasure.

00:58:01.499 --> 00:58:02.499
&gt;&gt;Mario Batali: Thank you all.

00:58:02.499 --> 00:58:02.500
[applause]
