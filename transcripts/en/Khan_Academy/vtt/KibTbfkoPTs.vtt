00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:02.017
- I have six numbers here

00:00:02.017 --> 00:00:04.478
and you see that five
of them are irrational.

00:00:04.478 --> 00:00:09.239
They involve the square root
of a non-perfect square.

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:13.696
Our goal in this video
is, without a calculator,

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:17.645
see if we can sort these
numbers from least to greatest.

00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:18.503
And like always,

00:00:18.503 --> 00:00:21.615
pause this video and
see if you can do that.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:23.542
So I'll give you a hint.

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:24.656
The hint is--

00:00:24.656 --> 00:00:26.211
it's very hard without a calculator.

00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:27.257
Square root of two

00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:28.743
is gonna be one point
something, something.

00:00:28.743 --> 00:00:29.417
Square root of three

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:30.971
is gonna be one point
something, something.

00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:32.295
How do we do this?

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:34.804
We just have to realize
that, if I have some number,

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:38.797
let's say I have some number
a that is greater than 0.

00:00:38.797 --> 00:00:43.046
And if we know that a is less than b,

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:46.645
then a squared is going
to be less than b squared.

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:51.127
If one positive number is less
than another positive number,

00:00:51.127 --> 00:00:52.658
then the square of this positive number

00:00:52.658 --> 00:00:54.980
is going to be less than
the square of that number.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.534
So one thing that we could
do when we are comparing

00:00:58.534 --> 00:01:00.113
all of these irrational
numbers that involve

00:01:00.113 --> 00:01:02.387
square roots of non-perfect squares,

00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:04.083
let's compare their squares.

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:05.151
Because their squares

00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:07.125
are not going to be irrational numbers.

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:08.610
It's going to be much easier to compare,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.166
and then we can order them.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.536
Because if we order the squares,

00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:13.255
then they'll tell us what happens

00:01:13.255 --> 00:01:15.507
if we order their square roots.

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:16.575
What am I talking about?

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:18.525
Well, I'm just gonna square each of these.

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:21.868
So if I take this to the second power,

00:01:21.868 --> 00:01:25.397
this is going to be four
square roots of two,

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:29.089
times four square roots of two.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.016
You can change the
order of multiplication.

00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:32.643
That's four times four

00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:37.504
times the square root of two
times the square root of two.

00:01:37.504 --> 00:01:40.259
Now, four times four is 16.

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.418
Square root of two times
square root of two,

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:44.531
well, that's just going to be two.

00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:48.733
So it's gonna be 16 times
two which is equal to 32.

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.776
Now what about two square roots of three?

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.904
Well, same idea.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:56.384
Let's square it, let's square it.

00:01:56.384 --> 00:01:58.511
And i'll do this one a little bit faster.

00:01:58.511 --> 00:02:01.319
So if we square two square roots of three,

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.178
this is going to be two squared

00:02:03.178 --> 00:02:05.175
times square root of three squared.

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:06.986
So it's going to be two squared

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:11.537
times the square root of three squared.

00:02:11.537 --> 00:02:14.207
Well, two squared is going to be four.

00:02:14.207 --> 00:02:18.061
Square root of three squared
is going to be three.

00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:23.061
So this is going to be equal to 12.

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.767
That's this thing squared.

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:30.832
If this step seems a little bit confusing,

00:02:30.832 --> 00:02:33.734
if you have the product of
two things raised to a power,

00:02:33.734 --> 00:02:34.616
that's the same thing

00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:36.427
as raising each of them to that power,

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:38.284
and then taking the product.

00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:40.165
And you can actually see,
I worked it out here,

00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:42.511
why that actually makes sense.

00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:45.134
Notice when I just changed
the order of multiplication

00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:47.503
you had four times four, or four squared,

00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:51.845
times square root of two squared,
which is going to be two.

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:53.935
So let's keep doing that.

00:02:53.935 --> 00:02:56.721
So what is this value squared?

00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:59.531
It's gonna be three
squared, which is nine,

00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:03.060
times square root of two
squared, which is two.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.589
Nine times two is 18.

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.329
What's the square root of 17 squared?

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.046
That's just going to be seventeen.

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:13.345
Do that in blue.

00:03:13.345 --> 00:03:17.340
This is just going to be 17.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.685
What is three square
roots of three squared?

00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:22.563
It's gonna be three
squared, which is nine,

00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:25.598
times square root of three squared.

00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:26.947
The square root of three
times the square root of three

00:03:26.947 --> 00:03:27.902
is three.

00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:31.153
So it's gonna be nine times three, or 27.

00:03:31.153 --> 00:03:33.614
And what is five squared?

00:03:33.614 --> 00:03:35.309
This is pretty straightforward.

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.909
That's going to be 25.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.116
So let's order them
from least to greatest.

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:41.695
Which of them, when I square it,

00:03:41.695 --> 00:03:43.622
gives me the smallest value?

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:48.567
Compare 32 to 12 to 18 to 17 to 27 to 25.

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:50.897
12 is the smallest value.

00:03:50.907 --> 00:03:52.205
So if their square is the smallest,

00:03:52.205 --> 00:03:53.085
and these are all positive numbers,

00:03:53.103 --> 00:03:54.822
then this is going to
be the smallest value

00:03:54.822 --> 00:03:55.494
out of all of them.

00:03:55.494 --> 00:03:56.958
Let me write that first.

00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.791
Two square roots of three.

00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:01.439
So I've covered that one.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.785
Now what's next?

00:04:02.785 --> 00:04:04.481
Well, now I have this value.

00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:09.481
17 is the next smallest
square, so its square root

00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:14.464
is going to be the next square root.

00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:17.135
So it's going to be two
square roots of three,

00:04:17.135 --> 00:04:20.525
then square root of 17.

00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:22.846
That is this one here.

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.496
Then we go to 18.

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:26.370
So if we look at its square root,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.370
with the numbers we were
originally trying to sort,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.370
that would be three square roots of two,

00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:36.199
three square roots of two,

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.354
We got that one covered.

00:04:37.354 --> 00:04:39.376
Then the next one is gonna be 25,

00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:40.629
when we look at the squares.

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.276
So the next value out of our original set,

00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:46.315
the next largest one, is going to be five.

00:04:46.315 --> 00:04:51.064
So then we get to five,
we've covered that one.

00:04:51.064 --> 00:04:52.249
Then the next one, let's see.

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.155
We have 27 and 32 left.

00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:58.654
27 is the next largest square,
so the next largest number

00:04:58.654 --> 00:04:59.493
out of the ones we care about,

00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:01.861
is three square roots of three.

00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:06.667
So three square roots of
three, we covered that one.

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:08.038
And then we finish with--

00:05:08.038 --> 00:05:11.660
This is the largest value,
four square roots of two.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.446
Four square roots of two.

00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:15.258
And we're done!

00:05:15.258 --> 00:05:15.909
That was pretty neat.

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.075
Without a calculator, we were able

00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:21.821
to sort these irrational numbers,

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.502
well, not all of them are irrational,

00:05:23.502 --> 00:05:24.894
but ones that involve the square root

00:05:24.894 --> 00:05:28.075
of something that is not a perfect square.
