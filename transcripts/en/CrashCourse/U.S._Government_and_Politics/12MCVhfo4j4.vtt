Hey! I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics and today, I'm gonna cut through

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.030
the red tape with common sense reforms
to get our government back on track.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.640
Actually no we're not gonna do any of those things
although if you pay attention to American

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.109
politics you may have heard that bureaucracies
are a problem. And that they're strangling

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.089
American innovation. And that they must be
dealt with, and soon.

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.880
Part of the reason you may have heard this
is that Americans just seem to hate bureaucracies

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.390
for reasons I've mentioned and probably one
that I haven't -- federal bureaucracies are

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.350
funded by taxes, and the only thing Americans
hate more than bureaucracies is taxes!

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.860
Except for maybe public transportation
and eating healthy food.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.980
Okay there's a lot of other things that
Americans hate but taxes, hoo boy!

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.460
They're definitely near the top of the list.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:46.340
[Theme Music]

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.920
So today we're gonna look at the ways bureaucracies
can be controlled and we'll start with two

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.780
broad categories - those controls that seek
to limit the discretion of bureaucrats, and

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.280
those that seek to shrink the size and number
of bureaucracies.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.500
The first type, limiting the activities of bureaucracies
without actually getting rid of them, is easier and therefore more common.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.940
So congress can attempt to control the behavior of bureaucracies in two ways:

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.180
they can institute before-the-fact controls or,
wait for it, after-the-fact controls!

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.619
Before-the-fact controls are attempts to limit
bureaucrats discretion through the way that

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.259
the bureaucracy itself is set up. I limit
the discretion of eagles by doing this!

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.400
The best way to do this is through careful drafting
of the legislation that creates bureaucracy itself.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.179
If for example congress didn't want
NASA to search for extraterrestrial life,

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.759
they could have written it into the law establishing
NASA in the first place.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.329
A more realistic example is that congress
frequently forbids agencies from funding or

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.499
even discussing abortions or abortion counselling.
This type of bureaucratic control is called

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.280
procedural. One of the main procedural controls
on bureaucracies are reporting requirements,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.920
which are forms that agencies have to send
back to other oversight agencies detailing

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.840
what the original agencies actually did.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.460
This is where a stereotype of the Kafka-esque
bureaucracy comes from, other than you know, Kafka.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.740
Another before-the-fact control that
congress can exercise is in the appointment

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:57.929
of agency heads, although the senate can only
veto them, not actually appoint them. Of course,

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.819
the executive branch will usually take congress'
preferences into account in nominating agency

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.749
heads, so this is also a sort of control.

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:07.539
Influencing the appointment process however
is a weak control because once appointed and

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.020
confirmed, congress does not have the power
to remove the agency heads or threaten their

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.240
job security much, although congress can make
an agency's head ache through after-the-fact

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.340
controls. (Ba dum tss) See what I did there
Stan?

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.440
After-the-fact controls are often just called
oversight but they extend a bit beyond this. Congress

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.530
can exercise very public oversight by holding
hearings. If there's some blockbuster allegations

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.300
people might pay attention, but the more hearings
congress decides to hold, the less attention

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.830
the public will pay. Probably the best known
congressional hearings involve Nixon's impeachment

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.640
which was a very special case and the Army-McCarthy
hearings of 1954, when senator McCarthy held

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.110
hearings to determine if the army was full
of communists. Spoiler, it wasn't.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.390
Congress has it's own watchdog organization
that checks on how bureaucracies are spending

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.680
their money, the general accounting office.
Congress can also institute investigations which

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.620
are less public than hearings, and result in a report.
A report. We all hate doing reports, right? Oohoohoo.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.820
The Warren Commission report on JFK's assassination,
the 9/11 report and the senate report on CIA

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.490
torture are examples of this. The best way
to control what a bureaucracy is able to do

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.970
is through the appropriations process. Congress
has to set aside operating funds for most

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.880
agencies and one of the best ways to get an
agency to do less is by giving them less money

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.110
to do things, or at least threatening to do
so.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.620
Of course the absolute best way to get an
agency to do less of whatever it does is by

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.620
limiting its growth, or in some cases getting
rid of it altogether. Limiting its growth

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.160
is sometimes called taming the bureaucracy
but that makes it sound like some kind of

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160
wild animal and I don't know about you but
wild animals are not the first thing that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.990
comes to mind when I think about IRS agents.
Well, I mean, being attacked by a bear and

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.540
being audited are similar, but let's go to
the Thought Bubble.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.540
Of all the ways to limit the growth of bureaucracies,
the absolute best is to get rid of the agencies

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.070
completely. This is called termination and
despite the calls of politicians to get rid

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.820
of executive departments, it almost never
happens. This is for two reasons. One is that

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.010
bureaucracies create constituencies for themselves
and they can often lobby persuasively for

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.660
the continuation of the agency.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.880
More to the point, lots of agencies are useful
and getting rid of them would mean that some

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.460
important functions might not get done. Like
who would oversee America's failing schools

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.850
without the Department of Education.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.319
More common than termination is deregulation
which is when congress limits the number of

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.069
regulations that an agency is allowed to enforce.
Often the thought behind this is that market

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.569
forces will step in and keep whatever the
agency had been regulating under control.

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:19.459
But often it doesn't work out as we, or congress,
might expect.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.290
In the 1970s, congress deregulated the airline
industry, and one result has been much cheaper

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.510
airfares although it doesn't seem like it.
Another result has been fewer airlines and

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.970
greatly improves service. We can all agree that no
one has ever had any bad service ever on an airline.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.460
The point of deregulation is that it's supposed
to lower costs, but this isn't always the

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.290
case especially when you figure in externalities
which are the social costs of an activity

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.880
that are not paid for by the industry. The
best example of an externality is pollution

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.490
but we'll talk more about that later.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.290
Another way of shrinking bureaucracies that
has become popular since Nixon and new federalism

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.389
is devolution. Devolution is when congress
shifts, or devolves, the task, or burden,

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.530
of regulation from a federal agency to state
and local municipalities. Devolution is a

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.820
bit of a bait-and-switch because while it
may shrink the federal bureaucracy, the total

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.470
level of bureaucratic function remains the
same. Unless congress cuts funding along with

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.730
the devolution, creating an unfunded mandate.
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.139
So, congress has attempted to scale back bureaucracy
by privatization. This means turning over

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.910
bureaucratic functions to private entities, usually 
corporations. What happened to my jacket?

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.530
President George W. Bush proposed
doing this to social security, essentially

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.620
allowing individuals to invest their retirement
funds with private companies. But this proposal

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.280
went nowhere, mainly because it seemed risky
and looked like a giveaway to banks, which

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.310
may be even less popular than bureaucracies
or congress.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.310
Another example has been handing out some
of the jobs that had previously been done

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.620
by the army to private military contractors.
Privatization looks great politically to some

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.660
and it gives the appearance of shrinking the size
of the bureaucracy because employees are off

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.220
the government's books. But they still have to be paid,
so whether privatization actually works is debatable.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.810
In the long term it may be less costly because many
federal employees receive deferred compensation

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.700
in the form of pensions, but in the short
run in can cost a lot more for a private company

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.140
to drive a truck in a war zone than for an
army to do it. So if you wanna limit the power

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.660
of bureaucracies, those are some of the ways
to do it. But before you get too excited about

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.300
cutting government down to size, there are
a few things to remember.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.180
First, bureaucracies are huge and they do
a ton of things. Bureaucracies have grown

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.100
since the new deal and they don't show much
sign of slowing down. I blame the eagle. Stop it!

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.080
Even under Republican presidents like
George W. Bush, bureaucracies have grown and

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.110
along with them, government spending. In fact
President Bush even added a cabinet agency,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.560
the Department of Homeland Security.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.610
Second, once created, bureaucracies create
political constituencies by making themselves

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.320
necessary to people. Ugh, people. So annoying.
It's so much easier without people!

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.620
The idea of getting rid of social security just to
limit social security is scary to a lot of

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.040
people who rely on social security. I said
social security a lot.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.060
The thing to remember here is that no matter
what we may think of them, bureaucracies are

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.620
political entities and subject to political
pressure despite efforts to keep them out

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.640
of politics. But in case you haven't noticed,
you can't really separate politics and government.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.720
But we'll talk about politics in another episode.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.540
