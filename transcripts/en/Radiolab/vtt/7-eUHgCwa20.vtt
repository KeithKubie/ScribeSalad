00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.460
Great. You're listening to radio,

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.570
the podcast from New York public radio, public radio,

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.720
W Y C N N P hey I'm Jad Abumrad,

4
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.240
and I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast,

5
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:21.840
and let me just throw something out here that to set up what is going to be an

6
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:25.590
awesome podcast, New Year's resolutions. Okay. Yes.

7
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.670
Now I know that's a few months out of date, but that's exactly my point by now.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.540
Most of us are the same old schmucks that we were last year.

9
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:36.480
We've completely forgotten about all the promises we made to ourselves.

10
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.530
We've slipped back into old patterns and what you're doing. Out of curiosity,

11
00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:41.520
I didn't make any, so I don't have any problem with it at all,

12
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.580
but how do I make them? In previous years I did.

13
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.030
I would have long since failed long since failed. Now,

14
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:51.450
do you ever wonder why with things like New Year's resolutions which require

15
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:55.350
willpower, why none of us are any good or I'm not sure. None of us.

16
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.850
I know people.

17
00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:00.590
I'm married to a person who seems to be able to make a resolution in fiercely in

18
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.700
determine, at least stick to. We'll see it. There you go. See,

19
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:06.150
some of us can do it. Some of us can't because I was born under a dark star.

20
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.780
There you go. There you go. It's the real question is,

21
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.100
are some of us just doomed because we were born under a dark start and not have

22
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:18.150
willpower? Others do have it or is it something that can be taught?

23
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.610
Do you ever wonder about that? Yeah. Hello. Test, test,

24
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:27.900
test, test, test. Yeah. So you're monitoring the sound. Well,

25
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:31.020
I want to introduce you to some light. His name is Walter Walter May shout.

26
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.650
He's a psychologist at Columbia University in the psychology department.

27
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.540
And if you've ever asked yourself questions about willpower and like what is it

28
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:43.480
exactly? How does it work if I don't have it, can I get it?

29
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.260
Well he has done a remark, global study, so we are ready to go.

30
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.340
And the marshmallow study, the marshmallows study at the start of the study.

31
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:55.050
How did you come up with the idea? Well,

32
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:59.070
I had three little girls who at that time, we're talking now, late sixties,

33
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.870
we're going from uh, being these uh, uh,

34
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.070
sweet sometimes and Yappy often, uh, you know, little creatures.

35
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:12.660
So we'll do there at that point. Well they, they ranged in age from two to five.

36
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.010
Uh, and what I was a,

37
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.240
what any parent immediately knows is that when kids start going into the fourth

38
00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:23.930
year of life, a lot happens to them and he noticed them,

39
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.910
one of his daughters who had just hit four,

40
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.800
suddenly she could delay gratification. Almost all of a sudden he, if he,

41
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:35.390
if he told her, look, I know you want that. I don't know, pack a bubble gum,

42
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.960
but don't whine. Don't complain when we get home,

43
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:42.110
I'll give you something better. Suddenly she could wait.

44
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:46.190
This was in the late 1960s and there was almost no work on quote,

45
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:50.720
willpower or self control, self regulation. It just wasn't a topic.

46
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.890
So he thought he would jump in,

47
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.350
here's what he did to test this hypothesis that something happens to kids around

48
00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:59.770
the age of four. He went to a nursery school,

49
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.290
being nursery school at Stamford University,

50
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:06.790
gathered up a bunch of kids at different ages and one by one he put them in a

51
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.570
real small room off the a play room. He'd bring the kids in,

52
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:11.530
sit them in a chair,

53
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:15.460
and then he would give them a choice which had to do with marshmallows. Yummy.

54
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.370
What kid doesn't love marshmallows? And he would say to them,

55
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:22.810
here's your choice. You can either have one, one marshmallow now or if you wait,

56
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.020
you can have too, too much Milos later. Uh,

57
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.920
now that creates a lot of dilemmas. Yeah, it does.

58
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.850
Especially because you know,

59
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.290
the researchers are leave the room to give the kids a chance to think.

60
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.730
And right there on the table in front of the child where the marshmallows

61
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.050
calling them. There are no distractions in the room. There are no pictures,

62
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.760
no toys, no, I have to sell. Okay. So it's basically some isolation check,

63
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.740
but pure agony. I can show you a video of what they're doing and you can see it.

64
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.350
Can we watch? Sure. Let's turn it on.

65
00:03:56.351 --> 00:04:00.100
And he walked over to a TV and pulled up a video of the marshmallow experiment

66
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:03.250
and I must tell you it is some of the greatest video ever shot,

67
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.380
particularly because the round he showed us,

68
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.510
the researchers had replaced the marshmallows with something even more enticing

69
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.310
Oreo cookies, Oreos. So what you're seeing over here is a tortured looking,

70
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:19.090
adorable little girl wearing a blue sweatshirt bell, five years old,

71
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.020
pigtails kind of sniffing at it, puts her face right up to the cookie.

72
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:26.290
She's weighing do I want this badly? And actually what she's doing,

73
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.520
she picks up the cookie, puts it down, weighing and reevaluating her choice.

74
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:34.480
She knows she can have this one now, but if she wait, she can have more. But

75
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.450
she gives in after just a few minutes. Okay.

76
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:45.451
Now we have a sort of a doughy face boy and a yellow t-shirt who's kicking cause

77
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:49.720
he's so antsy, this kid strategies not to confront the cookie directly,

78
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:53.190
but to kick the table that holds the cookie, kick it, kick it, kick.

79
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.080
It's a very male response. I mean the remarkably,

80
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.830
he holds out way longer than the first girl.

81
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.550
And of course there were the cheaters.

82
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.430
Here we see a guy looking at the two cookies.

83
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.000
He's taken one, which is against the rules.

84
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:12.970
He's licking the inside is licking out the cream,

85
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.140
replacing the licked cookie and putting it back on the tray. Anyhow,

86
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.850
we watch kid after kid after kid being tortured by the gravitational pull of

87
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.820
Oreo cookies, some to avoid the bull went under the table,

88
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.640
some turn their backs and started singing a song. All in all,

89
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.870
Michelin is team tested,

90
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:33.250
500 kids and then initial study and they found that yes,

91
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.550
four year olds are dramatically better than younger kids at resisting

92
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:40.540
temptation. So something does happen at around four years old. But within that,

93
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.990
and here's where the plot thickens. There was a huge range.

94
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.090
Some kids gave up after a minute,

95
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.720
others could last 20 minutes and most fell somewhere in the middle where they

96
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:53.830
could resist the cookie for about seven minutes, eight minutes.

97
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.950
That's the average, all depending on age and what the goodies are and so on.

98
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.530
Now in and of itself, there's nothing too surprising here.

99
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.920
He basically confirmed his hypothesis. But what is amazing,

100
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.160
truly amazing is what happens next.

101
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.790
I just was sitting around the kitchen table and my kids, about five,

102
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:12.950
six years after the studies began,

103
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.280
he was talking with his kids and he knew that they still went to school.

104
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.520
This is now five or six years later with some of those kids from the initial

105
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:24.190
study. So he's asking them, you know, how is Jenny doing and how's a,

106
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.980
you know how Ashley doing this was just totally informal and it's good to tell

107
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:31.610
them, well sesame's doing fine, Jenny, not so good.

108
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.410
And he began to realize a weird pattern.

109
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:37.070
The kids like Tesla who he remembered had been good at waiting for the

110
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:38.840
marshmallow back in this study.

111
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.200
Well they seem to be the ones who were doing better.

112
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.270
They were doing better at school and suddenly on a very small and you know,

113
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.700
very small sample. It looked like there were differences here.

114
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.120
Could there be a relationship between the number of seconds,

115
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:57.230
these kids way when they were four and how they are doing when they're,

116
00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:02.231
when they're 10 and 11 and 12 so what we did beginning when these kids were 15

117
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:08.660
years old, 14 to 17 years old, was the first followup

118
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.603
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

119
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.330
<v 0>So he tracked down as many of those original Cates as he could find.</v>

120
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.170
Just for starters, he looked at their sat scores. Now keep in mind,

121
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:25.880
this is 10 years later and some stupid little tests that a kid takes when

122
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:28.970
they're four that has to do with resisting and marshmallow and how many seconds

123
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:31.340
they can resist, should not. I repeat,

124
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:35.210
not have anything to do with how they do on the sat scores,

125
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:37.520
which is one of the most important tests they're ever going to take.

126
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.680
But we found remarkable correlations between the actual sat scores and a seconds

127
00:07:46.061 --> 00:07:48.300
of delay time. In other words,

128
00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:53.280
the kids who waited the longest when they were four staring at the Oreos did

129
00:07:53.281 --> 00:07:57.630
better on the sats than the kids who just gave up immediately. Yes.

130
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.460
How much better significant.

131
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.730
<v 2>The differences are so big.</v>

132
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.290
<v 0>It's Jonah Lehrer science writer,</v>

133
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:06.670
often a guest on the show who's also reporting about these followup studies.

134
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:06.931
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

135
00:08:06.931 --> 00:08:10.590
The difference between a kid who can wait one minute for the marshmallow on a

136
00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:14.940
kid who can wait 20 minutes is the difference. My sat scores is 210 points.

137
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.630
<v 0>No Way.</v>

138
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.190
<v 2>Yeah. This isn't, you know, fiddling at the margins.</v>

139
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.470
This is a profound difference.

140
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.260
<v 0>Well above what one would expect by chance. And as they dug into the data,</v>

141
00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:27.660
it turned out it went way beyond sats.

142
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.320
The kids who waited back when they were four, now in their late teens,

143
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.170
<v 2>parents reported they were better behaved.</v>

144
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.140
<v 0>And on the flip side,</v>

145
00:08:34.141 --> 00:08:37.170
the kids who hadn't been able to wait back in that initial study,

146
00:08:37.171 --> 00:08:39.870
they were more likely now to be suspended from school,

147
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.930
to be classified as problem kids to be, you know,

148
00:08:42.931 --> 00:08:46.100
the kind of kids who are most likely to wind up as the bullies.

149
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.180
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

150
00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.180
<v 0>the results were so odd and strong admissions team decided to keep following</v>

151
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:05.070
those kids up through their teeth into their twenties and thirties and beyond.

152
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:10.071
So this is now roughly 40 years because they're about 44 45 at this point.

153
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.970
We're still in touch with over 250 and they've expanded the kind of data that

154
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:19.230
they're keeping track of everything for how well they able to stick to goals at

155
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:22.950
work, how far they go in school, even their health, for example,

156
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:23.940
the body mass index,

157
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
<v 2>a huge amount of data they really want to like amass a an FBI file,</v>

158
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:30.210
so to speak,

159
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.310
<v 0>and the more data they collect, the worse it gets.</v>

160
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:35.970
The kids who could way back when they were four and now in their forties have

161
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.840
better jobs. They've gone farther in their education. They're even skinnier.

162
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.600
Yeah, and the kids who couldn't wait. Now think about this.

163
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:48.120
How much willpower you exhibit as a four year old in something so insignificant

164
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:53.121
as trying to resist the pull of a marshmallow could predict this frightening

165
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:55.110
amount about your life?

166
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.800
There's no question that that was something predictive about it and that it

167
00:09:58.801 --> 00:10:00.900
wasn't a fluke. Here's what I'm wondering.

168
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:06.140
If I have a four year old and I informally give them this test and they fail,

169
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.210
<v 3>should I be worried? Do you know what I mean? Yeah,</v>

170
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.870
<v 2>yeah. I mean, you know me, I've got such a bias against um,</v>

171
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.370
these kind of rigid predictive variables when it comes to the brain.

172
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.150
But I think these experiments have to give you pause

173
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.310
<v 0>cause one interpretation of Mitchell's work and it's one we unfortunately cannot</v>

174
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:31.311
rule out is that maybe self control is hardwired the other habit by the age of

175
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:36.180
four or you don't. And if you don't have it, statistically you're screwed.

176
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:44.750
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

177
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.050
<v 0>there's another way to interpret this. Thankfully,</v>

178
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.220
if willpower gets it, start when you're four, which is a big F,

179
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.810
let's just assume for the moment it does.

180
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:58.880
Then you've got to ask what exactly happens at age four that separates the

181
00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:00.980
willful from the rest of us.

182
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.940
So what you're seeing over here is a tortured looking, adorable little girl,

183
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.360
Walter Mischel would say, go back to those videos and really look at them.

184
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.350
If you do, much of what you'll see has very little to do with nature.

185
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.610
She's looking at it. She's withdrawing from it and she's holding her breath.

186
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.060
The first thing you notice he says is that every kid is an agony.

187
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.030
Even the good kids, they are not models of strength.

188
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.950
They are suffering too cause Oreo cookies, man, they're good. Second,

189
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.490
the very simple difference between the good kids and the bad kids seems to be

190
00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:35.870
that the good kids just found ways to distract themselves. They get strategies.

191
00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:40.520
She's holding her breath at this girl saying to herself and stop shushing that

192
00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:44.450
seemed to work or kicking it. Kicking table. That's actually a good strategy.

193
00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:45.800
Says we're making up a tune. You know,

194
00:11:45.801 --> 00:11:49.070
kids composing you song just turning around in the chair. Okay,

195
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:52.580
we're back to girl number one now she has her back completely turned to the

196
00:11:52.581 --> 00:11:56.110
cookies. Some kids actually pretended the marshmallow was a cloud.

197
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.130
I mean the kinds of things one sees like strat or the cookie was a UFO.

198
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:05.370
They turned this hot stimulus into as Michelle puts at a cold stimulus and that

199
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:07.690
might be all that separated. The kids who could wait,

200
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.160
some the kids who caved the best kids and we had a better bag of tricks.

201
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.120
And if that's all we're talking about, tricks. Well you can teach a trick.

202
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.290
You know what I mean? One my favorite, yeah,

203
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.670
<v 2>twist on his experiment that he did was he found that you could take kids who</v>

204
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:23.230
had trouble delaying gratification.

205
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.560
So kids who had really had a tough time waiting for the marshmallow and you

206
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:29.480
simply say to them, put a picture frame around the marshmallow,

207
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.140
apprehensive picture and not a delicious piece of candy.

208
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.160
All of a sudden you gave kids this little trick and you could turn load two

209
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:37.540
layers into much higher delay or

210
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.000
<v 0>oh, so he could help these kids.</v>

211
00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.230
<v 2>Absolutely. You can teach just to, so that simple suggestion,</v>

212
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.300
while do you just pretend to sit picture frame,

213
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.820
he's got these bar graphs and it's dramatic.

214
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.760
All of a sudden the load delay layers are performing just like behind the layers

215
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.360
<v 0>really.</v>

216
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.660
And is there any evidence that if you teach these kids these low de layers and

217
00:12:53.661 --> 00:12:57.710
you give them these tools that you can spend their life in the right direction

218
00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:58.603
in some way?

219
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.850
<v 2>The, there's, there's no evidence of that yet. Um, you know,</v>

220
00:13:01.851 --> 00:13:05.660
he hasn't shown that simply teaching kids how to draw picture frame around a

221
00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:08.570
marshmallow leads to a ballooning sat scores.

222
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.790
And that's where I think even initial admits that it remains unclear how

223
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:16.790
valuable districts are because you can teach obviously a kid a trick to deal

224
00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:18.530
with the marshmallow in a lab setting,

225
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.480
but that doesn't mean they'll necessarily be able to go home and, and you know,

226
00:13:23.481 --> 00:13:25.520
you can't go around drawing picture frames all day long,

227
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.500
<v 0>but that's kind of the crux of it now. I mean,</v>

228
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.570
you kind of have to know that these tricks are useful. Yeah.

229
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.170
Otherwise you're just picking your interpretation. You could say, oh,

230
00:13:33.171 --> 00:13:35.360
it's learned tricks or it's hardwired.

231
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.290
<v 2>Yeah. So, so I think the answer to that, for me,</v>

232
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.100
it's completely unknown that they're just beginning to fly all these subjects

233
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:46.600
out. You know, do a couple of days worth of brain scans. I mean, this is a big,

234
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.830
big project. No one quite knows what they'll find.

235
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:50.470
<v 0>I'm a,</v>

236
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:55.470
I think it's highly likely to be like most things in life are turning out to be,

237
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.950
which is, yes, the wiring makes a difference and yes,

238
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.460
the experience makes a difference.

239
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.020
And the wiring and the experience are interacting and changing each other.

240
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.890
[inaudible] so jad um,

241
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.420
I have never been able to,

242
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.660
with hold my fierce desire to eat all the chicken when seven pieces of chicken

243
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:22.090
is served. Just the people. I will eat four pieces of chicken.

244
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.520
And yet somehow I have gone through most of my life holding the job,

245
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.250
doing quite well. So, you know, I think before people take mystery shows,

246
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.700
views too close to heart. Do you remember there are outliers.

247
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:38.020
There are people who have grabbed the marshmallow early and yet who have somehow

248
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.470
thrive. That's right. Anyhow,

249
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.060
Radiolab is funded by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,
