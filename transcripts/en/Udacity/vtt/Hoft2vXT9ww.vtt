00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.019
We've covered congestion control, which works within network protocols, traffic

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.730
shaping, which is a high level network tool. And now

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.170
we'll look at content distribution, an internet-wide tool that enables

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.300
websites and network operators to deliver data quickly and efficiently.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.030
&gt;&gt; And to wrap up this section of the course,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.600
your project will export TCP in its slow start state.
