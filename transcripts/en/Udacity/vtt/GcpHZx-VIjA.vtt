00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.010
Notice that the apparent similarity between rose and gold is achieved at

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.020
the very moment of lookup and not as a result of some earlier copying process.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.150
For properties that can be found directly on the lower object,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.190
the prototype chain is never consulted.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.280
Since the key b can be found directly within rose,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.640
this isn't considered a field lookup.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.930
And so, the prototype relationship just doesn't come into play in this case.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.190
As usual, completely absent properties are reported as missing.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.020
What do you think will be logged in this situation?
