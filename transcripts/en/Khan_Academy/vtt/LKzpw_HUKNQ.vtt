00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.029
Where we left off
in the last video,

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:03.890
we'd actually set up
our definite integral

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.770
to figure out the
volume of this figure.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.491
So now we just have
to evaluate it.

00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:08.990
And really the
hardest part is going

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.860
to be simplifying that
and that right over there.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.730
So let's get to it.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.980
So what is this thing squared?

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.480
Well, looks like
we're going to have

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.700
to do a little bit of
polynomial multiplication here.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.500
So I'll go into that
same color I had.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.740
So we're going to have 4 minus x
squared plus 2x times 4 minus--

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.756
actually, let me write that
in the order of the terms,

00:00:31.756 --> 00:00:32.880
or the degree of the terms.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.240
It's negative x squared
plus 2x plus 4-- I

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.450
just switched the order of
these things-- times negative x

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.615
squared plus 2x plus 4.

00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:47.262
So we're just going to
multiply these two things.

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:49.220
I shouldn't even write
a multiplication symbol,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.590
it looks too much like an x.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.190
So 4 times 4 is 16.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.490
4 times 2x is 8x.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.540
4 times negative x squared
is negative 4x squared.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.550
2x times 4 is 8x.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.280
2x times 2x is 4x squared.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.580
And then 2x times
negative x squared

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.032
is negative 2x to
the third power.

00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:17.490
And now we just have to multiply
negative x times all this.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.050
So negative-- or
negative x squared.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.830
Negative x squared times
4 is negative 4x squared.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.180
Negative x squared times 2x is
negative 2x to the third power.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.730
And then negative
x squared times

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.960
negative x squared is
positive x to the fourth.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.030
So it's going to be
positive x to the fourth.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.160
And now we just have to
add up all of these terms.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.770
And we get, let's see,
we get x to the fourth--

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.400
add these two-- minus
4x to the third.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.470
And then this cancels
with this, but we still

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.470
have that, so minus 4x squared.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.150
You add these two right
over here, you get plus 16x.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.570
And then you have plus 16.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.090
So that's this expanded out.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.960
And now if we want to-- 4
minus x times 4 minus x.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.372
So if we just have 4
minus x times 4 minus x,

00:02:09.372 --> 00:02:11.080
we could actually do
it this way as well.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.920
But that's just going
to be 4 times 4, which

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.860
is 16, plus 4 times negative
x, which is negative 4x,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.421
negative x times 4,
another negative 4x,

00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.420
and then negative x times
negative x is equal to

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.852
plus x squared.

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:25.310
So if we were to
swap the order, we

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.500
get x squared minus 8x plus 16.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.450
But we're going
to subtract this.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.047
So if you have the
negative sign out there,

00:02:37.047 --> 00:02:38.630
we're going to
subtract this business.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.310
So let's just do
it right over here

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.890
since we already have it set up.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.360
So we have this minus this.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.202
We're going to
subtract this, or we

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:50.410
could add the negative of it.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:58.360
So we'll put negative x
squared plus 8x minus 16.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.830
So I'm just going to add
the negative of this.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.970
And we get-- and I'll
do this in a new color--

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.790
let's see, we get x
to the fourth minus 4x

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:21.420
to the third power minus
5x squared plus 24x,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.060
and then these cancel out.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.650
So that's what we are left with.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.000
And so that's the
inside of our integral.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.100
So we're going to take the
integral of this thing,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.183
just so I don't have to
keep rewriting this thing,

00:03:31.183 --> 00:03:34.400
from 0 until, if I
remember correctly, 3.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.250
Yup, from 0 to 3, of this, dx.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.290
And then we had a
pi out front here.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.210
So I'll just take that
out of the integral.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.770
So times pi.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.260
Well, now we just to
take the antiderivative.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.470
And this is going to be equal
to pi times antiderivative

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.250
of x to the fourth is
x to the fifth over 5.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.170
Antiderivative of
4x to the third

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.740
is actually x to the fourth.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.570
So this is going to be
minus x to the fourth--

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.480
you can verify that.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.030
Derivative is 4x, and
then you decrement

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.510
the exponent, 4x to the third.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.710
So that works out.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.420
And then the antiderivative
of this is negative 5/3 x

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.050
to the third.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.920
Just incremented the
exponent and divided by that.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:29.370
And then you have plus 24x
squared over 2, or 12x squared.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.280
And we're going
to evaluate that.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.380
I like to match colors
for my opening and closing

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.074
parentheses.

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:36.740
We're going to evaluate
that-- actually,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.380
let me do it as brackets.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.690
We're going to evaluate
that from 0 to 3.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.590
So this is going to be
equal to pi times-- let's

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.770
evaluate all this business at 3.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.500
So we're going to get
3 to the fifth power.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.390
So let's see, 3 to the
third is equal to 27.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.910
3 to the fourth is equal to 81.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:13.130
3 to the fifth is going to be
equal to-- this times 3 is 243.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.640
So it's going to
be 243-- it's going

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.700
to be some hairy math-- 243 over
5 minus-- well, 3 to the fourth

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.670
is 81.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.530
Minus 81.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.340
Minus, let's see, we're going
to have 3 to the third times--

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.140
let's see, so it's going
to be minus 5 over 3

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.460
times 3 to the third power.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.740
So times 27.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.950
Well, 27 divided by 3 is just 9.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.864
9 times 5 is 45.

00:05:43.864 --> 00:05:45.030
So let's just simplify that.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.670
So this is going
to be equal to 45.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.550
Did I do that right?

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.050
Yeah.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.654
It's essentially going to
be like 3 squared times 5,

00:05:52.654 --> 00:05:54.070
because you're
dividing by 3 here.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.350
So it's going to have 45.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.700
And then finally,
3 squared is 9.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.800
9 times 12 is 108.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.240
So plus 108.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.519
These problems that
involve hairy arithmetic

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:08.060
are always the most
stressful for me,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.926
but I'll try not to
get too stressed.

00:06:09.926 --> 00:06:12.550
And then we're going to subtract
out this whole thing evaluated

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.740
at 0, but lucky for us,
that's pretty simple.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.420
This evaluated is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.390
So we're going to
subtract out 0,

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.950
which simplifies
things a good bit.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.980
So now we just have to do some
hairy fraction arithmetic.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.550
So let's do it.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.277
So what I'm going to do first
is simplify all of this part.

00:06:29.277 --> 00:06:31.110
And then I'm going to
worry about putting it

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.030
over a denominator of 5.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.340
So let's see what we have.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.930
We have negative 81 minus 45.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:45.350
So these two right over
here become negative 126.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.300
And then negative 126 plus 108.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.120
Well, that's just going to be
the same thing as negative 26

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.230
plus 8, which is going
to be negative 18.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.340
So this whole thing
simplifies to negative 18.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.020
Did I do that right?

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.820
So this is negative 126.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.270
And then negative 126-- yes.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.480
It will be negative 18.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.360
So now we just have to
write negative 18 over 5.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.170
Negative 18 over 5 is the same
thing as negative-- let's see,

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.050
5 times 10 is 50, plus 40.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.580
So that's going to be
negative 90 over 5.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.310
So this whole thing
has simplified

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:37.980
to-- is equal to pi
times 243 over 5 minus 90

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:44.810
over 5, which is
equal to pi-- guys,

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.010
I deserve a drum roll now.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.970
This was some hairy mathematics.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:55.400
So 243 minus 90 is
going to be 153 over 5.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.570
Or we can write this
as 153 pi over 5.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.200
And after all that
math, you sometimes

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.750
forget what we were
doing in the first place.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.640
We were figuring out
this right over here

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.210
is the volume of
this figure that

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.720
had this little inside
of it bored out.
