00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.609
This is inside the cockpit of NASA’s operation
IceBridge, the largest airborne survey of

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:09.950
Earth’s polar ice ever flown.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.910
The scientists aboard are hunkered down in
their command stations, gathering critical

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.830
measurements on thinning sea ice, shrinking
glaciers, and calving ice shelves.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.260
Flying in 8-12 hour shifts, multiple days
a week, they’re taking the vital signs of

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.260
the Arctic.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.590
It’s an unprecedented, birds eye view of
what climate change actually looks like.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.940
Temperatures in the Arctic have been rising
about to two to three times the global average.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.161
So over the next century, we expect Greenland
to experience a lot warmer temperatures, continue

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:39.600
to melt, and then continue to raise sea level.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.850
That’s Nathan Kurtz, a project scientist
with Operation IceBridge.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.460
He’s part of a team of over 30 glaciologists,
engineers, and pilots who survey the massive

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.210
ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland on
this flying laboratory.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.200
We probably do 60 to 70 flights per year.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.440
Then once we're up in the air, we transit
at high altitude but then we'll descend down

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.009
to low altitude, so 1500 feet.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.840
The P-3 in particular is meant to fly low
and slow.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.079
First constructed during the cold war to track
Russian submarines, the P-3 is an ideal reconnaissance

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.579
aircraft for polar surveys.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.070
The crew will follow a meticulously planned
flight path, with specific targets in mind.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.920
The goal is to create a consistent and continuous
data stream of the changing ice, bridging

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.259
the gap between the decommissioned ICESat
satellite and the ICESat-2 that’s expected

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.810
to launch in 2018.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.700
Hence the name, Operation IceBridge.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.500
The P-3 is outfitted with a suite of instruments
-- and one of the most critical is the laser

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.529
altimeter.

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:48.860
It shoots out tiny green pulses straight at
the ice sheet.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.039
Along with laser altimeters, there are radar
instruments, GPS, gravimeters, and of course,

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.179
a digital camera system that captures images
of the terrain below.

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.950
We're measuring how thick the ice is in total,
and then mapping what the rock structure is

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.439
underneath the ice.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.030
These tools reveal what’s invisible to the
naked eye, transforming Greenland’s massive

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.110
ice sheet into a 3D picture with incredible
detail.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.560
We're trying to figure out how the surface
changed year to year to year, and so Helheim,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.920
what's called the calving fronts of the end
of the glacier, has been retreating for quite

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.250
a while.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.840
And out of the nearly ten years of flying
zigzagging patterns across the poles, the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.540
data points to an irreversible trend.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.840
We’ve had large changes in sea ice, and
this is changing the albedo of the surface

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.640
so sea ice is bright, reflects a lot of the
sun's energy, but as the Arctic has been warming

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.500
we’ve been seeing a decrease in the amount
of ice, and that in turn exposes open ocean,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.960
which absorbs more of the sun's energy.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.400
This feedback loop is what keeps scientists
like Nathan coming back to the poles for month-long

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400
missions.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.650
Retreating sea ice will increase global temperatures,
which leads to widespread surface melting

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.480
of Greenland's ice sheet.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.590
The amount of ice that’s on Greenland, if
it were all to melt could raise sea level

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.090
by something like 8 meters, so over 20 feet.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.920
Basically, Nathan wants to arm the people
in charge of making huge environmental decisions

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.490
with the facts.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.000
And all of the data collected during each
flight mission is actionable.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.261
They help climate scientists more accurately
predict how the poles could change in the

00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:31.100
future; because even though the ice looks
peaceful from above, there’s a whole other

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.450
story underneath.
