00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.190
Here's what the steps will look like in order. The

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.060
first step will be to break open the cells. All

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.890
of the cell contents will spill out into solution, including

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.600
the DNA. Then we'll need to break down some of the

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.520
cell protein, by letting the sample sit in hot water

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.200
with our meat tenderizer, for a few minutes. Next, we'll pour

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.820
our sample, through a coffee filter, and this will get

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.560
rid of any undigested chunks of strawberry that are left over.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.780
Then we'll take our filtered liquid, and add

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.350
the alcohol, so that our salty DNA can precipitate

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.600
out of solution. Finally, we'll collect the DNA with

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.510
our fork, and take a picture, to post online.
