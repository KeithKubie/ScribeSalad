we're gonna show you four different kids

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380
we're gonna show you four different kids
 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.169
we're gonna show you four different kids
answering a question and you have to

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179
answering a question and you have to
 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.910
answering a question and you have to
decide whether they're lying or telling

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920
decide whether they're lying or telling
 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.769
decide whether they're lying or telling
the truth each kid is told that if they

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779
the truth each kid is told that if they
 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.419
the truth each kid is told that if they
get seven out of ten balls in the basket

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429
get seven out of ten balls in the basket
 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.940
get seven out of ten balls in the basket
they will be given five dollars but just

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950
they will be given five dollars but just
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.470
they will be given five dollars but just
before they start the experimenter finds

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480
before they start the experimenter finds
 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.600
before they start the experimenter finds
an excuse to leave the room and ask them

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610
an excuse to leave the room and ask them
 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.279
an excuse to leave the room and ask them
to stand behind the line and throw the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289
to stand behind the line and throw the
 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.529
to stand behind the line and throw the
balls into the basket one at a time so

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539
balls into the basket one at a time so
 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.720
balls into the basket one at a time so
these kids are now alone in the room so

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
these kids are now alone in the room so
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.429
these kids are now alone in the room so
the incentive to cheat is pretty high

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439
the incentive to cheat is pretty high
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.560
the incentive to cheat is pretty high
but little do they know the scientists

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570
but little do they know the scientists
 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.870
but little do they know the scientists
have placed a hidden camera in the room

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
have placed a hidden camera in the room
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.849
have placed a hidden camera in the room
the question the experimenter asked when

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
the question the experimenter asked when
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.730
the question the experimenter asked when
they got back was did you cheat and here

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740
they got back was did you cheat and here
 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.520
they got back was did you cheat and here
were their answers okay could you tell

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
were their answers okay could you tell
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.780
were their answers okay could you tell
which ones were telling the truth and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790
which ones were telling the truth and
 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.840
which ones were telling the truth and
which were lying try again nope okay it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
which were lying try again nope okay it
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.520
which were lying try again nope okay it
turns out that kids one and two we're

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530
turns out that kids one and two we're
 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.200
turns out that kids one and two we're
telling the truth and kids three and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
telling the truth and kids three and
 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.750
telling the truth and kids three and
four were lying but in fact 80% of kids

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
four were lying but in fact 80% of kids
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.819
four were lying but in fact 80% of kids
over the age of four will lie in this

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
over the age of four will lie in this
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.680
over the age of four will lie in this
scenario when guessing who was lying the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
scenario when guessing who was lying the
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.900
scenario when guessing who was lying the
answer was either yes or no so you had a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
answer was either yes or no so you had a
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.299
answer was either yes or no so you had a
50% chance of getting it right so even

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
50% chance of getting it right so even
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.740
50% chance of getting it right so even
if you did guess correctly you're

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
if you did guess correctly you're
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630
if you did guess correctly you're
actually not necessarily that good at

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640
actually not necessarily that good at
 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.429
actually not necessarily that good at
detecting lies and turns out no one

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
detecting lies and turns out no one
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.770
detecting lies and turns out no one

while they tell lies they look right

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
while they tell lies they look right
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.609
while they tell lies they look right
into your eyes they don't blink so that

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
into your eyes they don't blink so that
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.859
into your eyes they don't blink so that
that common-sense view is totally out of

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
that common-sense view is totally out of
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.140
that common-sense view is totally out of

professions like judges social workers
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.749
professions like judges social workers
or police officers people who would

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
or police officers people who would
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.120
or police officers people who would
expect are good at detecting lies turns

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
expect are good at detecting lies turns
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.980
expect are good at detecting lies turns
out they aren't okay so we are here at

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
out they aren't okay so we are here at
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.749
out they aren't okay so we are here at
Congolese developmental lab and I'm with

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
Congolese developmental lab and I'm with
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.030

Sarah who's gonna help us with one of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
Sarah who's gonna help us with one of
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.410
Sarah who's gonna help us with one of
the technologies that can detect

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
the technologies that can detect
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.149
the technologies that can detect
emotions and lying so what are we gonna

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
emotions and lying so what are we gonna
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.580
emotions and lying so what are we gonna
do we are going to use FAFSA which is

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
do we are going to use FAFSA which is
 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.560
do we are going to use FAFSA which is
behind me we had already recorded you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570
behind me we had already recorded you
 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.420
behind me we had already recorded you
making some interesting facial

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
making some interesting facial
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.160
making some interesting facial
expressions different I tried to make

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
expressions different I tried to make
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.929
expressions different I tried to make
different emotions okay so what are we

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
different emotions okay so what are we
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.670
different emotions okay so what are we
looking at we have my face and a bunch

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680
looking at we have my face and a bunch
 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.580
looking at we have my face and a bunch
of

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590
of
 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.980
of
graphs what do they mean so each of

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990
graphs what do they mean so each of
 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.930
graphs what do they mean so each of
these different colors is a different

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940
these different colors is a different
 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.530
these different colors is a different
emotion so right now we're looking at

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540
emotion so right now we're looking at
 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.860
emotion so right now we're looking at
joy there's anger surprise fear and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870
joy there's anger surprise fear and
 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.980
joy there's anger surprise fear and
contempt you look great about here it

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990
contempt you look great about here it
 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.390
contempt you look great about here it
looks like you're about to experience a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400
looks like you're about to experience a
 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.410
looks like you're about to experience a
little bit of disgust really I was asked

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420
little bit of disgust really I was asked
 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.780
little bit of disgust really I was asked
about eating toenails

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790
about eating toenails
 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.850
about eating toenails
how do you do this with kids and in like

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860
how do you do this with kids and in like
 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.610
how do you do this with kids and in like
a more experimental environment yeah so

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620
a more experimental environment yeah so
 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.500
a more experimental environment yeah so
this there's kind of two options you can

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510
this there's kind of two options you can
 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.020
this there's kind of two options you can
use this technology with one is you get

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030
use this technology with one is you get
 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.540
use this technology with one is you get
a person to sit down and watch and

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550
a person to sit down and watch and
 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.610
a person to sit down and watch and
record them with the webcam you can put

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620
record them with the webcam you can put
 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.140
record them with the webcam you can put
some stimuli on the screen see how they

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150
some stimuli on the screen see how they
 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.550
some stimuli on the screen see how they
react to it but that really doesn't help

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560
react to it but that really doesn't help
 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.890
react to it but that really doesn't help
us out with lying instead we want to see

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900
us out with lying instead we want to see
 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.350
us out with lying instead we want to see
how two kids or even adults lie in the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360
how two kids or even adults lie in the
 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.270
how two kids or even adults lie in the
real world so we put them into real

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280
real world so we put them into real
 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.729
real world so we put them into real
situations where they're lying to us or

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739
situations where they're lying to us or
 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.430
situations where they're lying to us or
telling the truth and we secretly record

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440
telling the truth and we secretly record
 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.590
telling the truth and we secretly record
their faces and later on we can take

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600
their faces and later on we can take
 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.270
their faces and later on we can take
that video get into this plug it in

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280
that video get into this plug it in
 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.559
that video get into this plug it in
they're so cool

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569
they're so cool
 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.420
they're so cool
but what happens if someone lies with a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430
but what happens if someone lies with a
 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.190
but what happens if someone lies with a
neutral face I mean it's not that hard

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200
neutral face I mean it's not that hard
 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.160
neutral face I mean it's not that hard
like watch this I in fact did not steal

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170
like watch this I in fact did not steal
 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.930
like watch this I in fact did not steal
the parts of Michael Stern the coolest

parents cannot assess accurately when

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260
parents cannot assess accurately when
 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.440
parents cannot assess accurately when
their own kids are lying but thankfully

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450
their own kids are lying but thankfully
 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.330
their own kids are lying but thankfully
science is here to help us out we

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340
science is here to help us out we
 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.430

recently developed a new technology

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440
recently developed a new technology
 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.870
recently developed a new technology
called chance they're more optical

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880
called chance they're more optical
 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.060
called chance they're more optical
imaging technology so the idea basically

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070
imaging technology so the idea basically
 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.000
imaging technology so the idea basically
is they used literally it has a peel of

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010
is they used literally it has a peel of
 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.120
is they used literally it has a peel of
the skin like this then you see the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130
the skin like this then you see the
 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.240
the skin like this then you see the
blood underneath your skin and then you

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250
blood underneath your skin and then you
 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.910
blood underneath your skin and then you
link up the in the frames of the videos

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920
link up the in the frames of the videos
 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.550
link up the in the frames of the videos
and then you can see the blood flow

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560
and then you can see the blood flow
 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.250
and then you can see the blood flow
changes in different parts of the face

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260
changes in different parts of the face
 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.920
changes in different parts of the face
and by doing so then you combine them

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930
and by doing so then you combine them
 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.110
and by doing so then you combine them
all together and using machine learning

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120
all together and using machine learning
 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.039
all together and using machine learning
again and you can detect the passions in

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049
again and you can detect the passions in
 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.509
again and you can detect the passions in

so one of the studies were wrong and we

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730
so one of the studies were wrong and we
 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.210
so one of the studies were wrong and we
show that about 85% accuracy we can tell
