00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's what statistician do. They choose a random sample.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The sample is the selection of hopefully random withdrawn people from this pool

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that are representative of the pool at large.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In this sample, they might derive an estimate on how people are likely to vote.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They might just report that as estimate,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but in practice, what they do is they report that the estimate plus a margin of error.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In this margin of error, means what's really been given back is not singular number like 60%,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but an interval--we call this the confidence interval.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Look at these numbers for the blue party or party A and tell me

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what do you think is the lower bound and upper bound in the conference interval in percent.
