00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170
economy grow larger and if the answer
 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.039
economy grow larger and if the answer
was yes then we generally decided it was

was yes then we generally decided it was
 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.699
was yes then we generally decided it was
a good idea if we're wise and maybe even

a good idea if we're wise and maybe even
 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.259

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659
10 or 12 weeks studying thinking about
 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.599
10 or 12 weeks studying thinking about
climate change sort of full-on and in

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609
climate change sort of full-on and in
 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.259
climate change sort of full-on and in
that 10 or 12 weeks we've seen record

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269

and really for the last week where
 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.490
and really for the last week where
they've been setting all kinds of

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500
they've been setting all kinds of
 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.349
they've been setting all kinds of
records in Alaska where we've seen

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359
records in Alaska where we've seen
 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.379

for a minute so I'm for a moment we'll

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390
for a minute so I'm for a moment we'll
 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.420
for a minute so I'm for a moment we'll
just do virtual PowerPoint and I'll just

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430
just do virtual PowerPoint and I'll just
 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.670
just do virtual PowerPoint and I'll just
say things in the picture will come into

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680
say things in the picture will come into
 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.730

your head you know if I do it correctly

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740
 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.570
those are just now the kind of daily

those are just now the kind of daily
 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.640
those are just now the kind of daily

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650
manifestations of a planet that we have
 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.960
manifestations of a planet that we have
managed to begin to upend and up and in

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970
managed to begin to upend and up and in
 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.420
managed to begin to upend and up and in

else and that's by far the biggest thing

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110
else and that's by far the biggest thing

degree Celsius okay which doesn't sound
 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.960
degree Celsius okay which doesn't sound
like that much and in some sense it

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970
like that much and in some sense it
 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.600
like that much and in some sense it
isn't that much it's only the carbon

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610
isn't that much it's only the carbon
 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.240
isn't that much it's only the carbon
we've put in the atmosphere is trapping

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250
we've put in the atmosphere is trapping
 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.760
we've put in the atmosphere is trapping
that a little bit less than

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770
that a little bit less than
 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.010
that a little bit less than
three-quarters of a watt of extra solar

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020

energy per square meter of the Earth's
 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.780
energy per square meter of the Earth's
surface you know so less than one of

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790
surface you know so less than one of
 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.970

those small white Christmas tree lights

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980

per square meter of the Earth's surface
 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.800
per square meter of the Earth's surface
the trouble is there are a lot of square

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810
the trouble is there are a lot of square
 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.080
the trouble is there are a lot of square
meters on the surface of the earth and

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090
meters on the surface of the earth and
 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.590
meters on the surface of the earth and
hence that adds up to a huge amount of

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600
hence that adds up to a huge amount of
 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.140
hence that adds up to a huge amount of
energy I mean people have tried to

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150
energy I mean people have tried to
 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.480
energy I mean people have tried to
measure it in sort of other terms it's

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490
measure it in sort of other terms it's
 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.180
measure it in sort of other terms it's
the equivalent of about 400,000

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190
the equivalent of about 400,000
 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.390

Hiroshima's sized bombs a day in terms
 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.880
Hiroshima's sized bombs a day in terms
of heat energy but those are kind of

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:38.890
of heat energy but those are kind of
 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.550
of heat energy but those are kind of
pointless measurements really we can

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560
pointless measurements really we can
 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.680
pointless measurements really we can
tell what it's doing how big it is by

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690
tell what it's doing how big it is by
 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.409
tell what it's doing how big it is by
looking at what it's doing by the end of

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419
looking at what it's doing by the end of
 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:48.400
looking at what it's doing by the end of

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200
the sea-ice that was in the Arctic 40
 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.520
the sea-ice that was in the Arctic 40
years ago was gone okay so think about

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530
years ago was gone okay so think about
 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.960
years ago was gone okay so think about
how much energy it takes to melt the

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970
how much energy it takes to melt the
 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.560
how much energy it takes to melt the
millennia old sheets of ice on the ocean

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570
millennia old sheets of ice on the ocean
 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.380
millennia old sheets of ice on the ocean
in a very cold place you know think

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390
in a very cold place you know think
 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.990
in a very cold place you know think
about how much energy that requires and

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000
about how much energy that requires and
 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.360
about how much energy that requires and
then think about I mean I was saying to

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370
then think about I mean I was saying to
 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.360
then think about I mean I was saying to
people earlier this afternoon we should

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370
people earlier this afternoon we should
 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.800
people earlier this afternoon we should
think about that sort of thing more

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810
think about that sort of thing more
 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.140
think about that sort of thing more
often when the destruction of the Arctic

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150
often when the destruction of the Arctic
 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.920
often when the destruction of the Arctic
is not some remote thing I mean we took

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:20.930
is not some remote thing I mean we took
 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.440
is not some remote thing I mean we took
one of the six five six largest physical

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:23.450
one of the six five six largest physical
 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.210
one of the six five six largest physical
features on earth one of the things you

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.220
features on earth one of the things you
 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.580
features on earth one of the things you
can see from outer space and we broke it

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590
can see from outer space and we broke it
 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.710
can see from outer space and we broke it
and we did it in the course of a few

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720
and we did it in the course of a few
 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.810
and we did it in the course of a few
decades and we're doing the same thing

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:31.820
decades and we're doing the same thing
 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.180
decades and we're doing the same thing
to everything else I mean look at the

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.190
to everything else I mean look at the
 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.290
to everything else I mean look at the
ocean it is if you stick a strip of pH

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:38.300
ocean it is if you stick a strip of pH
 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.390
ocean it is if you stick a strip of pH
paper in the ocean now it comes out a

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400
paper in the ocean now it comes out a
 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.090
paper in the ocean now it comes out a
different color than it did 40 years ago

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.100
different color than it did 40 years ago
 

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.760
different color than it did 40 years ago
we managed to take the oceans which are

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:45.770
we managed to take the oceans which are
 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.610
we managed to take the oceans which are
our metaphor for vastness and so far

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:48.620
our metaphor for vastness and so far
 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.620
our metaphor for vastness and so far
we've made them about 30% more acidic

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:50.630
we've made them about 30% more acidic
 

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.440
we've made them about 30% more acidic
over the course of 40 years that's a

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:53.450
over the course of 40 years that's a
 

00:07:53.450 --> 00:08:01.330
over the course of 40 years that's a
pretty large change on solid ground the

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:01.340
pretty large change on solid ground the
 

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.540
pretty large change on solid ground the
thing we noticed most to think is

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:03.550
thing we noticed most to think is
 

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.730
thing we noticed most to think is
changes in hydrology in the way that

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:06.740
changes in hydrology in the way that
 

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.220
changes in hydrology in the way that
water moves around the planet the basic

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:09.230
water moves around the planet the basic
 

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.350
water moves around the planet the basic
physical fact of this century is going

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360
physical fact of this century is going
 

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.110
physical fact of this century is going
to turn out to be that warm air holds

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.120
to turn out to be that warm air holds
 

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.300
to turn out to be that warm air holds
more water vapor than cold so the

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:16.310
more water vapor than cold so the
 

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.340
more water vapor than cold so the
atmosphere is about five percent wetter

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:18.350
atmosphere is about five percent wetter
 

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.620
atmosphere is about five percent wetter
than it was 40 years ago that's a

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:20.630
than it was 40 years ago that's a
 

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.620
than it was 40 years ago that's a
staggering change in the most basic of

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:23.630
staggering change in the most basic of
 

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.800
staggering change in the most basic of
physical parameters on earth and what it

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:26.810
physical parameters on earth and what it
 

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.690
physical parameters on earth and what it
means is that the drought that the dice

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:28.700
means is that the drought that the dice
 

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.910
means is that the drought that the dice
are loaded for drought and for flood and

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:30.920
are loaded for drought and for flood and
 

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.550
are loaded for drought and for flood and
so now we just see them routinely on an

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560
so now we just see them routinely on an
 

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.940
so now we just see them routinely on an
epic scale on mob money epic last summer

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:36.950
epic scale on mob money epic last summer
 

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.300

in this country we managed to make it

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:40.310
in this country we managed to make it
 

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.400
in this country we managed to make it
hot and dry enough that we could not

and flooded to the point where a quarter

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:03.570
and flooded to the point where a quarter
 

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.540

want to talk about today just how that

00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:08.089
want to talk about today just how that
 

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:11.139
want to talk about today just how that
fight is going and how we're trying to

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:11.149
fight is going and how we're trying to
 

00:12:11.149 --> 00:12:19.179
fight is going and how we're trying to
build it and let me say that you know

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:19.189
build it and let me say that you know
 

00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:21.550
build it and let me say that you know
since we're in a university here which

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560
since we're in a university here which
 

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.220
since we're in a university here which
is a kind of happily a sort of temple of

Reason let me say that it took me a long

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:30.259
Reason let me say that it took me a long
 

00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:33.009
Reason let me say that it took me a long
time to figure out that reason was not

00:12:33.009 --> 00:12:33.019
time to figure out that reason was not
 

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:36.129
time to figure out that reason was not
going to be what would carry the day in

00:12:36.129 --> 00:12:36.139
going to be what would carry the day in

going to be what would carry the day in
this fight I'm a writer by trade and so

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:40.850
this fight I'm a writer by trade and so
 

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.759
this fight I'm a writer by trade and so
you know my thought my contribution this

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:42.769
you know my thought my contribution this
 

00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:45.400
you know my thought my contribution this
would be to write a book and I did I

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:45.410
would be to write a book and I did I
 

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.199
would be to write a book and I did I
wrote a book and a lot of people read it

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:47.209
wrote a book and a lot of people read it
 

00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:49.540
wrote a book and a lot of people read it
and when I wrote the book I was 27 my

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:49.550
and when I wrote the book I was 27 my
 

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.059

will read my book and and they will

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:53.240
will read my book and and they will
 

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.780
will read my book and and they will
change you know um that that's what it

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:55.790
change you know um that that's what it
 

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.759
change you know um that that's what it
would take and that clearly wasn't gonna

00:12:57.759 --> 00:12:57.769
would take and that clearly wasn't gonna
 

00:12:57.769 --> 00:13:00.519
would take and that clearly wasn't gonna
happen but still one imagined that the

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:00.529
happen but still one imagined that the
 

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:02.620
happen but still one imagined that the
kind of sum total of all the books and

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:02.630
kind of sum total of all the books and
 

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.840
kind of sum total of all the books and
scientific reports and things would be

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:04.850
scientific reports and things would be
 

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:09.009
scientific reports and things would be
enough that every year heroes of the

about it and there are a lot of answers
 

00:14:27.009 --> 00:14:29.579
about it and there are a lot of answers
to that question but I think by far the

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:29.589
to that question but I think by far the
 

00:14:29.589 --> 00:14:32.579
to that question but I think by far the
biggest answer to that question is has

certainly that's been the story in this
 

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:19.290
certainly that's been the story in this
country and in this world and so at a

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:19.300
country and in this world and so at a
 

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.639
country and in this world and so at a
certain point some of us began to think

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:22.649
certain point some of us began to think
 

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:27.139
certain point some of us began to think
about how it was we might be able to

00:15:27.139 --> 00:15:27.149
about how it was we might be able to
 

00:15:27.149 --> 00:15:32.280
about how it was we might be able to
counter the power of that industry we

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:32.290
counter the power of that industry we
 

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.509
counter the power of that industry we
knew we weren't going to do it with

00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519
knew we weren't going to do it with
 

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:36.240
knew we weren't going to do it with
money because there isn't never going to

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:36.250

um they have I'm no theologian but they

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:49.870
um they have I'm no theologian but they
 

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.870
um they have I'm no theologian but they
have more money than God you know they

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880
have more money than God you know they
 

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.480
have more money than God you know they
they have all the money and if you only

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:54.490
they have all the money and if you only
 

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.460
they have all the money and if you only
gonna fight it they come they're gonna

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:56.470
gonna fight it they come they're gonna
 

00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:00.380
gonna fight it they come they're gonna
win so what do you do in that situation

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:00.390
win so what do you do in that situation
 

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.930
win so what do you do in that situation
well historically what you do is stop

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:03.940
well historically what you do is stop
 

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.630
well historically what you do is stop
relying on reason alone and start using

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:06.640
relying on reason alone and start using
 

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.660
relying on reason alone and start using
that reason to build movements and

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:09.670
that reason to build movements and
 

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.750
that reason to build movements and
movements are in essence a way to find

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:12.760
movements are in essence a way to find
 

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:18.030
movements are in essence a way to find
other currencies to work in that aren't

other currencies to work in that aren't
 

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.880
other currencies to work in that aren't
the currencies of the powerful their

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:20.890
the currencies of the powerful their
 

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.520
the currencies of the powerful their
currencies like passion and spirit and

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:23.530
currencies like passion and spirit and
 

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:28.320
currencies like passion and spirit and
creativity numbers and we have to figure

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:28.330
creativity numbers and we have to figure
 

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.810
creativity numbers and we have to figure
out how to make those add up to more

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:30.820
out how to make those add up to more
 

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.580
out how to make those add up to more

listened to me
 

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:38.980
listened to me
okay because 25 years ago we actually

01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:38.990
okay because 25 years ago we actually
 

01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:40.990
okay because 25 years ago we actually
had a series of trajectories that were

01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:41.000
had a series of trajectories that were
 

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.480
had a series of trajectories that were
where we could have done other things

where we could have done other things
 

01:30:43.490 --> 01:30:47.530
where we could have done other things
and and you know we wouldn't have solved

01:30:47.530 --> 01:30:47.540
and and you know we wouldn't have solved
 

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:49.060

okay now the Arctic's melted now the

01:30:57.130 --> 01:30:57.140
okay now the Arctic's melted now the
 

01:30:57.140 --> 01:30:59.260
okay now the Arctic's melted now the
bridge now it doesn't look like a bridge

01:30:59.260 --> 01:30:59.270
bridge now it doesn't look like a bridge
 

01:30:59.270 --> 01:31:01.510
bridge now it doesn't look like a bridge
now it just looks like a gangplank you

01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520
now it just looks like a gangplank you
 

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:04.810
now it just looks like a gangplank you
know and we hacked instead of looking

01:31:04.810 --> 01:31:04.820
know and we hacked instead of looking
 

01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:07.150
know and we hacked instead of looking
for this mythical bridge all the time we

01:31:07.150 --> 01:31:07.160
for this mythical bridge all the time we
 

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.370
for this mythical bridge all the time we
actually have to take the leap you know

01:31:09.370 --> 01:31:09.380
actually have to take the leap you know
 

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:13.510
actually have to take the leap you know
and do the renewables now it's just

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520
and do the renewables now it's just
 

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.310
and do the renewables now it's just
physics the numbers just don't work

physics the numbers just don't work
 

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:35.700
physics the numbers just don't work
anymore in those ways so good question

01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:35.710
 

01:31:35.710 --> 01:31:38.080
well of course going to the oil industry

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:38.090
well of course going to the oil industry
 

01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:39.820
well of course going to the oil industry
one day and there was something to love

01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:39.830
one day and there was something to love

they're good people and I want to

they're good people and I want to

they're good people and I want to
talking about this in a way that doesn't

talking about this in a way that doesn't
 

01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:48.430
talking about this in a way that doesn't
make it seem like a personal attack yeah

01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:48.440
make it seem like a personal attack yeah
 

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:51.310
make it seem like a personal attack yeah
I think I mean there's no way to get

01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:51.320
I think I mean there's no way to get
 

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.020
I think I mean there's no way to get
around the fact that the oil industry is

around the fact that the oil industry is
 

01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:55.600
around the fact that the oil industry is
now a ruinous industry and that one you

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:55.610
now a ruinous industry and that one you
 

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:57.820
now a ruinous industry and that one you
should try to persuade people not to go

but that is I mean you can do that

but that is I mean you can do that

without saying you're a criminal for
doing this you know it's just that the

doing this you know it's just that the
 

01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:31.390
doing this you know it's just that the
it's just that physics calls the tune

here you know we're up against a problem

01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520
here you know we're up against a problem
 

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:38.230
here you know we're up against a problem
of physics of numbers and when people

01:32:38.230 --> 01:32:38.240
of physics of numbers and when people
 

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:40.630
of physics of numbers and when people
realize that as scientists in general

01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:40.640
realize that as scientists in general
 

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:43.360
realize that as scientists in general
have realized as the scientific and even

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:43.370
have realized as the scientific and even
 

01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:46.780

now geologists I got into some the gold

01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:46.790
now geologists I got into some the gold
 

01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:48.209

medal there's the presidents
or something of the American Society of

01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:49.960
or something of the American Society of
 

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.680
or something of the American Society of
geologists last year and it was quite an

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:52.690
geologists last year and it was quite an
 

01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:54.680
geologists last year and it was quite an
interesting thing because you know this

01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:54.690
interesting thing because you know this
 

01:32:54.690 --> 01:32:58.830
interesting thing because you know this
this is in a discipline that for years

01:32:58.830 --> 01:32:58.840
this is in a discipline that for years
 

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.390
this is in a discipline that for years
the biggest employer has been the

01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400
the biggest employer has been the
 

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.189
the biggest employer has been the
petroleum industry and things but people

01:33:02.189 --> 01:33:02.199
petroleum industry and things but people
 

01:33:02.199 --> 01:33:04.200
petroleum industry and things but people
are beginning to understand that that's

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:04.210
are beginning to understand that that's
 

01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:05.520
are beginning to understand that that's
got to change

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:05.530
got to change
 

01:33:05.530 --> 01:33:08.430
got to change
so without being I mean I have no animus

the political process so that they can
 

01:33:17.949 --> 01:33:19.650
the political process so that they can
keep doing what they're doing that's

and there's a problem of numbers and

01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360
and there's a problem of numbers and
 

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:46.590
and there's a problem of numbers and
questions thank you all right thank you
