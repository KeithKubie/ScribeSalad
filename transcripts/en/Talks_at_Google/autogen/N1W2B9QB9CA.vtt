00:00:02.275 --> 00:00:03.150
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.070
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.870
Thanks for joining during
your lunch break and over VC.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.100
I'm really excited to
introduce Myra Strober.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.020
She's a Stanford
professor and author

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.150
who's here to share some
really great tips on how

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.832
to juggle your work
life and your home life.

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:19.540
I'm going to jump
right in, because we're

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.517
a few minutes behind.

00:00:20.517 --> 00:00:22.850
And she's going to read an
excerpt from one of her books

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.433
and go over some slides and then
answer any questions that you

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:25.940
may have.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.930
So Myra is a labor economist
and the professor emerita

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.049
at the School of Education
at Stanford University.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.990
She's also the
professor of economics

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.590
at the Graduate
School of Business

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.330
at Stanford University.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.950
Her research and consulting
focus on gender issues

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.800
at the workplace
and work and family.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.520
She is the author
of numerous articles

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.770
on occupational
segregation, women

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.790
in the professions
and management,

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.930
the economics of child
care, feminist economics,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.120
and the teaching of economics.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.710
She was the founding director
of the Michelle R. Klayman

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.200
Institute for Gender
Research at Stanford,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.810
and she was also the first
chair of the National Council

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.990
for Research on Women, a
consortium of US centers

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.930
for research on women which
today has more than 100 member

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.290
centers.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.980
Over the years,
Myra has consulted

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.720
with several corporations
on improved utilization

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.250
of women in management
and on work family issues.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.980
She has also been
an expert witness

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.380
in cases involving
the valuation of work

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.562
in the home, sex discrimination,
and sexual harassment.

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:28.270
So with that, I'll
have you take it away.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.950
MYRA STROBER: Thank you.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.380
Hello, everyone.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.900
I'm going to start by
reading from my memoir, which

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.120
was published
recently by MIT Press,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.630
and it's called
"Sharing the Work."

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.550
So I'm going to read from the
very beginning of the memoir.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.440
Then I'll talk a little
bit about how partners

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.860
can balance family and careers.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.750
And then we'll take questions.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.070
You'll be able to tell in just
a minute when this takes place.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.160
"It's because you
live in Palo Alto,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.010
the chairman of Berkeley's
economics department tells me.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.190
I can't have a regular job here
because I live in Palo Alto?

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.940
He nods.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.270
Chairman [? Brake ?] is tall
with football player shoulders

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.280
and although I'm tall, too, his
massive frame towers over me.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.510
He's a big shot in one of the
most prestigious economics

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.370
departments in the country.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.990
I'm the assistant
professor wannabe.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.180
If this meeting
doesn't go well, he

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.090
could decide not to
hire me for next year.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.170
Under my jacket
rivulets of perspiration

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.270
are making their way down
my dress-for-success blouse.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.820
You have to live in Berkeley
to be on your tenure track?

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.890
Again, he nods.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.200
I'm baffled.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.590
I never knew that.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.810
My husband Sam is a medical
resident at Stanford

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.240
and works incredibly long hours.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.490
Often he goes back to
his lab late at night

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.470
to check on his experiments.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.750
We have to live in Palo Alto.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.740
OK, I say softly,
getting up to leave.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.770
Thanks very much.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.970
When I get to my office,
my hands are shaking.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.880
I can hardly insert
my key into the lock.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.510
I feel drained, disoriented.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.040
Did I take something out of my
freezer for tonight's dinner?

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.060
Lamb chops?

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.300
Hamburger?

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.900
I dial home but Margie, my
babysitter, doesn't pick up.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.880
She's probably taken
the kids out somewhere.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.160
I leave my office and
walk across Sproul Plaza--

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.070
surprisingly quiet after
all the years of student

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.410
demonstrations.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.020
It's 1970 and the Vietnam War
is beginning to wind down.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.730
I slide into my
full-sized blue Chevy

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.890
with a trunk large
enough to hold

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.060
both a stroller and a
carriage and review my meeting

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.340
with [? Brake. ?] I spend a lot
of time in Big Blue these days.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.010
It's about an hour between
Palo Alto and Berkeley

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.910
in the morning and longer
in the late afternoon,

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.700
and I do the commute
three days a week.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.480
Gradually crawling in
stop-and-go traffic

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.740
toward the Bay
Bridge, the absurdity

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.620
of [? Brake's ?]
answer registers.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.850
My first response is to cry.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.850
I grope around in my purse,
pull out some tissue,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.770
and dab at my eyes.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.899
But now the road is blurry.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.709
I switch my thoughts
to my children.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.990
Mommy, Mommy-- Jason,
my three-year-old,

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.010
will scream with delight when
he hears my key in the lock.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.270
And Liz, 11 months,
will follow his lead.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.920
She'll speed across
the living room

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.600
on all fours, tug on my
leg, and make joyful noises.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.100
Suddenly the traffic
starts to move.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.460
I can never tell why
the snarls dissolve,

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.420
but I'm always grateful.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.880
As I drive at normal
speed, my thoughts

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.740
turn back to [? Brake. ?] But
this time instead of tears,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.610
I'm aware of growing
anger-- at myself.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.780
What's wrong with you,
I scream inside my head.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.050
You let him intimidate you.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.010
Let him make you mute.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.340
You're a smart woman and you
let him make you look stupid.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.550
Faculty don't have
to live in Berkeley

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.440
to be on the tenure track.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.820
He fed you pure bull
and you bought it.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.170
You want to know why you
can't have a tenure track

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.680
job at Berkeley?

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.410
Look at what's real.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.320
There are no women except
Margaret in the whole economics

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.080
department faculty.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.160
And although she's been
there for more than 20 years,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.010
she's still a lecturer.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.820
Wake up.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.200
The difference
between a lecturer

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.030
and an assistant
professor is monumental.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.830
Assistant professors
have a regular job

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.590
with an opportunity for
promotion and lifetime tenure.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.752
Lecturers, on the other hand,
are on a road to nowhere.

00:05:44.752 --> 00:05:46.210
They're appointed
from year to year

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.550
generally only a few months
before their teaching

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.330
is to begin and have
no chance of advancing.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.790
I've worked too hard
for too many years

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.790
to be content with
second class citizenship.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.250
I intend to get the
real deal at Berkeley.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.020
When I finally get onto the
Bay Bridge, my anger changes.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.280
Now I'm furious
with [? Brake. ?]

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.350
How dare he tell me I
have to live in Berkeley?

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.970
The radio is tuned
to a talk station,

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.140
and I register Joe Carcione,
the popular Green Grocer,

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.620
instructing the whole Bay
Area about choosing pumpkins.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.140
Ah, Halloween is coming.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.180
Maybe I should revisit
[? Brake's ?] office

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.550
in costume.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.860
Witch?

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.100
Skeleton?

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.610
Big Bird?

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.070
Surely, some costume
could shake him out of his

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.580
we all have to live
in Berkeley routine.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.780
With my sheath skirt and
matching man-tailored jacket,

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.200
I'm wearing stockings
and high heels.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.770
The stockings feel
sticky and the shoes

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.160
pinch every time I accelerate.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.160
How I would love to
kick off those shoes.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.470
Whoever invented
high heels definitely

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.870
didn't have driving in mind.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.220
I'm getting angrier by the
second-- at the traffic which

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.860
has snarled again, at my
gluey stockings and too tight

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.580
high heels, and
at my own naivete.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.190
But most of all, I'm
angry at [? Brake. ?]

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.870
Slowly I begin to understand
what people mean when they say

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.900
their anger makes them see
red, because a swelling

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.270
fury-- a deep scarlet
anger-- now floods the car.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.820
The steel frame and glass
windows can't contain it,

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.880
and it bursts onto the road
like a flaming oil slick--

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.400
a torrent sliding over
the bridge's girders

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.870
and thundering across the bay.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.810
As the lights of
San Francisco begin

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.780
to flicker against the darkening
sky, I feel a flicker of light

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.890
within myself.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.740
I become a feminist
on the Bay Bridge."

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:57.790
So the follow up to that story
is the morning afterwards,

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.360
I called [? Brake's ?]
office again

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.620
and asked for
another appointment.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.290
And his secretary told
me he was very busy.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.710
It would be several weeks
before he could see me.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:13.490
So I had a second meeting
several weeks later,

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.140
and I asked him the
same question again.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.440
And he asked me if I
wanted him to be frank,

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.410
and I said, yes, I did.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.620
And basically he
told me that they

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.510
knew that I had both a
three-year-old and an infant

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:34.059
and that they didn't know what
was going to happen to me.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:35.919
I said, happen to me?

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.710
What do you think is
going to happen to me?

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.770
If you give me a
position, in six years

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.710
I'll come up for
tenure and promotion,

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.760
and we'll all see
what happens to me.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.820
He said, no.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.750
He said, I could never sell
that to the department.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.370
Well, in the mean
time-- having nothing

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.840
to do with me-- the
women faculty at Berkeley

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.470
filed a complaint with
the Labor Department

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.080
under a new executive order.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.210
And investigators from the Labor
Department came to Berkeley.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.260
And I thought to
myself, you're going

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.630
to have to sell that
to the department.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.990
And I was right.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.910
Because after two years, I got
an assistant professor offer

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.920
from Berkeley.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.350
And if anybody ever tells
you that the law doesn't make

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.090
a difference, argue with them.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.610
I also got an assistant
professor offer

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.450
from the Stanford
Business School.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.440
Because although
Stanford had not

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.020
had a complaint
filed against them,

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.040
they were nervous that
there might be one.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.200
And so in 1972, I was hired as
the first woman at the business

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.200
school.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.390
The first woman at the
law school was hired.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.400
The first woman in engineering
was hired, and on and on.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:55.640
So I wound up teaching at
Stanford and not at Berkeley.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:01.460
And I have had as one of my
fields of study all that time

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.870
how partners can balance
family and careers.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.040
Because as you see, my
experience at Berkeley

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.050
was that they didn't believe
that I could possibly

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.000
balance a career at
Berkeley or presumably

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.480
anywhere else and also
have young children.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.080
So what I want to do now is
talk about the main issues

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:30.250
that I see for people who do
want to balance two careers

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.030
and a family-- two demanding
careers and a family.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.890
So let's take a look
at these slides.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.500
You can't have it all.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.210
As an economist,
I'm always perplexed

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.940
when people ask me the
question, can you have it all?

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.710
Economists are into trade-offs.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.640
Nobody can have it all.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.940
Something has to be traded off.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:11:00.060
So you can have two demanding
careers and a family,

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.060
but something has to give.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.640
Maybe it's no longer cooking
five gourmet meals a week

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.230
or playing tennis or
exercising regularly

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.920
or seeing your
friends as frequently.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.490
But something is going
to have to change.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.310
However, if two
people are committed

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.840
to two careers
and a family, it's

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:25.630
possible to achieve all
of that if they understand

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.250
what they have to give
up in order to do that

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.320
and if they're fully
committed to two careers.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.240
What does it mean to be fully
committed to two careers?

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.020
It means that each
spouse has to--

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.710
or partner-- has to be committed
not only to their own career

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.090
but to the other career as well.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.840
That's not easy.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.160
And there are challenges
all along the way.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.130
The most important career
decision you're going to make

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.540
is not really a career decision.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.870
It's about who you're going
to marry or partner with.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.720
And if you're already married
and things are not working out,

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.890
well, make sure you have
a conversation about this.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.720
Make sure you
understand what it's

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.235
about to be committed
to two careers.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.100
The first challenge is
where are we going to live

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.990
and where are we going to work?

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.120
And the answer to
these questions

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.880
are different for each
couple, because the specifics

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.660
are different.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.150
So, for example, if one
partner is much more mobile

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.160
than the other
partner, then that

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.140
suggests that the couple should
locate where the person who

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.430
needs more mobility is.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.330
Should we take turns
advancing our career?

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.630
Should we move here in the
first instance for one career

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:53.100
and then five years later
move for another career move?

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.530
Sometimes that works out well.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.020
Sometimes it doesn't.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.870
Sometimes if you keep switching
careers and nobody has

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.440
priority, then you wind
up with two careers

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.940
that aren't working well.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.400
So you have to really
think about these issues.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.650
They're tough.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:11.050
Should we choose only locations
where both people can flourish?

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.980
Usually that works well.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.190
And usually that means
a fairly large area.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:20.870
So you know the Bay Area, Los
Angeles, New York, Chicago,

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.940
Atlanta-- places where
both members of a couple

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.790
can find jobs and move up.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.970
Should we have a
commuter marriage?

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.770
That's tough.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.890
The literature seems to suggest
that a commuter marriage works

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.700
for a while if
it's time limited--

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.770
if both people know that it's
not going to last forever.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.900
And, of course, if there
are children involved,

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.050
then a commuter marriage
is really tough.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.310
How about dividing housework
and home management?

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.250
Well, you may be
able to outsource

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.640
a good deal of housework.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.950
But unless you are extremely
rich, you and your partner

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.420
will be managing your home.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.860
How long will you divide
the management work?

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.150
People often forget about
the management function.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.870
You know, they decide
who's going to cook

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.150
and who's going to clean up.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.700
But they forget,
you know, somebody

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.950
has to be involved in who's
going to call the plumber.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.150
But somebody has to know that
a plumber has to be called.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.770
OK?

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.520
Somebody has to
know that you have

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.710
to sign up the kids for camp
before all the slots are

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:28.710
filled.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.790
Those are all
management functions.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.420
Are you going to be co-CEOs?

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.540
Or are you going to
divide up the function?

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.460
If you're going to
be co-CEOs, then you

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.370
have to have a lot
of communication,

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.770
as is always the
case when there's

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.790
more than one CEO involved.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.310
Deciding when and
if to have a child.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.350
Well, people always
ask me, when is

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.310
the best time to have a child?

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.620
The answer is that it's
always the best time

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.570
and it's always the worst time.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.670
If you want a child,
it's the best time

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.650
whenever you have a child.

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.900
But a child is likely to slow
your career to some degree.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.620
And if both members of the
couple are sharing childcare,

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.470
then it may slow both careers.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:17.630
So, again, this is
a tough decision.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.210
How are you going to
care for your children?

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.060
Well, leaving the
workforce-- one member

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:28.160
of the couple leaving the
workforce-- is one possibility.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.220
And more and more dads
are leaving the workforce.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.270
But that is a very
costly decision.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.050
The person who
leaves the workforce

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:40.930
generally loses a good
deal of his or her network,

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.130
unless they make a
really conscious effort

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.780
to maintain that network.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.000
Often their skills depreciate,
unless-- again-- they

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.630
make a very conscious effort
to keep those skills going.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.540
And the literature shows
that when you come back--

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.230
when women come back-- there's
not enough men coming back

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.890
from childcare to study it yet.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.930
But when women come
back, their earnings

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.300
are permanently lower
by as much as 20%.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.020
Now this could be because
of the jobs they choose,

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.710
or because their new
bosses don't see them

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.820
as good material for promotion
because they've taken time out.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.890
But in any case, the
combination of factors

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.710
leads to an earnings decrement.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:27.090
Also people lose insurance
in case of divorce.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.530
Because if you have to come
back to the workforce in case

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.680
of divorce, and you haven't
been in the workforce

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.700
for a long time, you're going
to have a lot of trouble

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.230
getting back in.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.180
Part-time work is another
potential solution.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.010
But often it's not a
very good solution.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.220
It can be the worst
of all worlds,

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:53.300
because often employers don't
pay per hour what you would

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.390
get if you had a full time job.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.970
Benefits are often lower.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.030
Often employers
don't see people who

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:04.349
work part time as good
candidates for promotion.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:06.319
And the other problem
that people tell me

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:08.869
about all the time is
that even though they've

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:14.190
negotiated a part-time schedule,
they wind up working full time.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:16.740
So now it is the
worst of both worlds.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.300
Because you are
working full time,

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.599
but you only have
a part time salary.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.640
So where part time
seems to work best

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.000
is when you've already
been a full-time person

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.340
and you negotiate for part
time in a limited way.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.840
So you say, you know, I'm
coming back from having a child.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.450
And I want to work part time
for the next six months.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.490
Can we work that out?

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.310
So that seems to be a
good solution there.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.290
Inform yourselves about
childcare options early,

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.030
like when you know you're
going to have a child.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:56.050
Because it's often difficult
to find good quality childcare.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.810
And we know that good
quality childcare

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.980
is beneficial to children,
but not all childcare

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.540
is good quality.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.580
And inform yourselves about
what to look for in terms

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.940
of the quality of childcare.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.900
Now people always talk about
balancing work and family,

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.280
but that could be not
the ideal metaphor.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.970
Because if you think of
balance as, you know,

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:26.570
the scales of justice with
equality, for most people

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.050
work and family is not equal.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.670
For some work is higher.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.810
For some family is higher.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:41.440
But it doesn't mean that
the balance has to be equal.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.480
I think the better notion
is the jar of life.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.170
So figure out what things
in your life are the rocks.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.260
What are the things that
really should go into that jar?

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.140
And put those things in first.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.160
So after the jar is
filled with rocks,

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.930
then the pebbles
can all-- pebbles

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.030
and the sand can all
fill in around the rocks.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:09.780
But you know that you've fit
in the most important stuff.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.490
And I think in
striving for balance,

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.950
it's probably
fruitless to imagine

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.680
that your work
and family life is

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.980
going to be in balance
every day, every week,

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.120
maybe not even every month.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.190
But what's important is that
you both continually work

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:34.460
to move back into what you
decide is the right balance.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.650
And I like to think about
a band of acceptability.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.160
OK?

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.960
So my work family is in
balance within this band.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.970
And if I'm out here or
my family is out here,

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.420
then we agree that
we've got to get back

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.250
into our band of acceptability.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.130
We've got to change
some things to get back.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.050
So I like that notion
of work family balance

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.070
rather than the
scales of equality.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:07.230
And finally, let me just say
that work family balance is not

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.640
just about you and your family.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.780
Many of you are or
will be in a position

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.720
to help other people to
balance their work and family.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.960
And when you make decisions
with your employees-- people who

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.600
report to you--
about how they're

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.500
going to be able to
balance work and family,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.770
think about the
power that you have

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:32.530
to make their life more livable.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:38.640
And also think about how we can
jointly put more flexibility

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.740
into the entire system.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.650
As you probably know,
the United States

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.060
is the only
industrialized country

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:51.650
without paid leave for
maternity, let alone paternity.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.690
We need to change that.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.210
And we have no childcare system.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:59.460
The last time there
was a bill in Congress

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:05.100
for a childcare system was 1971,
and Nixon vetoed that bill.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.450
And no bill has come
to Congress since then.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:13.490
So Hillary Clinton now has a
plan for a childcare system.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:17.980
But it's been 45 years
since Congress took up

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:22.360
the notion of a childcare
system for the country.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.520
So there's work to do,
obviously in your own family,

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.800
in your workplace, and in
the society as a whole.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.354
Thank you.

00:21:31.354 --> 00:21:33.146
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.410
AUDIENCE: I've
always put about 30%

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:43.700
on-- as the figure
for how much extra

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.880
our family spends that it
wouldn't if one parent stayed

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.400
home full time.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:54.430
And that's for house
cleaning, take out,

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:57.710
guilt gifts for the kids.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:59.980
Is that an accurate figure?

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.930
Have you got any stats on that?

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.050
MYRA STROBER: I don't
have stats on that.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:09.130
But I think that as families
make decisions about

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.630
whether both parents
should work or not,

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.970
you don't want to make a
decision based on short run

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.130
factors.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.550
So what some people
do is they say,

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.330
this is the salary
that the second earner

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.370
could earn in the workplace.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:30.490
And here's what we have to pay
for all the factors you talked

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:34.390
about-- childcare, extra
cleaning, take out,

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.960
often an extra car.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.460
OK.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.420
So does it pay?

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.860
Is my salary or the other
person's salary high

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.830
enough to cover all those costs?

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.310
So I don't think
that's a good way

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:54.310
to think about this, because
this is not a short run issue.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.610
This is a long term issue.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:01.910
And if you take into account
the decrease in salary that's

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.270
going to take place when the
person who left the workforce

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:10.830
comes back, then over a lifetime
of-- well, not a lifetime,

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:16.570
but a work lifetime-- those
childcare costs and guilt

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:19.980
gifts-- I love that, guilt
gifts-- and extra cleaning

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.590
and whatever are
going to be minimal.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.130
It's really an
economic investment

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:31.780
to pay for those
things in order to keep

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.850
a person in the workforce,
keep those skills current,

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:38.620
keep those networks
up, and get the income

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.700
from the second person.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.980
And also it's not a good
idea to think about will

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.870
the second person's salary
cover these expenses?

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:52.650
Because really these
are family expenses.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.620
And you don't want
to think about them

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.080
as having the second
earner needing

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.530
to cover those expenses.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.850
Both people are responsible.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.020
AUDIENCE: I have a
question around kind

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.160
of the lean in movement
and having women

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.530
who are going on maternity
leave coming back,

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:12.880
reporting in to me.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.450
Everyone has different
experiences around it.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.827
For me I read the book
at a very powerful time

00:24:17.827 --> 00:24:18.910
when I had my first child.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.300
And it kind of inspired me to
really come back and come back

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.280
full force.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.710
But I have a lot of women
who when we talk about it,

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.190
they feel that there's
almost double pressure.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.700
So I've had a
different experience.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.241
I actually think
the lean in movement

00:24:31.241 --> 00:24:34.470
and all the research has
been helpful in my career

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.110
on sticking with the workforce.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.760
But there are people
that report to me

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.968
that say it's put too much
pressure on them as women.

00:24:39.968 --> 00:24:41.750
I'm curious in your
research at Stanford

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.585
and your engagement
how you address it.

00:24:44.585 --> 00:24:46.460
And I know it's not one
size fits all, right?

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.330
But ultimately, how do you
respond to women that feel,

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.870
god, there's so much
pressure to be amazing moms,

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:56.894
to be full throttle
into our career as well?

00:24:56.894 --> 00:24:58.310
MYRA STROBER: So
I think the point

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:03.420
you make that no one
size fits all is the key.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.830
And we have very interesting
discussions in my classes.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.620
I teach a class at
the Stanford Business

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.600
School on work and family.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.420
And 40% of the students are men.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.170
And some of them have
had a fair amount

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.839
of work experience, because
they are back for what

00:25:18.839 --> 00:25:21.380
used to be known at the business
school as the Sloan program.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.070
Now it has some other
name-- MSX or something.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.210
And so a lot of
those men are very

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:31.330
proud of the way in
which they helped women

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:35.260
to handle coming back
to work after pregnancy.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.830
And so they talk
about what they did.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:41.640
And invariably, some woman
will raise her hand and say,

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.710
that's not what I
want when I come back.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.120
So your point that
different women

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.130
want different things--
one women will say,

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.910
when I come back I
want to be full force.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:58.470
I don't want anybody to
change my travel schedule.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.430
I don't want anybody to
change my number of meetings.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.760
I want to be there full force.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.190
And others will say what
some of your reports say.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.420
No, I can't handle
that right now.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:14.350
I need to move over a
little bit, take away

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.580
some of my responsibilities,
and in a few years

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.170
I'd like to be
able to move back.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:21.760
That's the key.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.610
It used to be that the
so-called mommy track took away

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.110
responsibilities, but
then you were gone.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.710
You were gone from the screen.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.570
And when you said you
wanted to come back,

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.860
the answer was too bad for you.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.630
You've missed the train.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.510
You can't get on
that track anymore,

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:41.490
which is really a foolish way
to think about human resources.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.470
You were out for a few
years, so now we're

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.260
never going to use
you full force again.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.820
But the manager
really has to have

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:55.910
a conversation with the report
to find out what's desired.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:58.330
And the second thing
about that is people

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.080
can change their mind.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.060
So you have that conversation
before the woman-- or even

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:09.000
the man-- leaves for family
leave, and then they come back

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.070
and they have a
different perception.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.620
I mean, so many
things can happen.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.590
They might have a child
with special needs.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.400
Well, they didn't anticipate
that when they told you

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.460
they want to come
back full force.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.190
Or they might find that
their own health is not

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.390
as strong as they
thought it was going

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.180
to be for whatever reason.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.110
So yes, it's good to have a
conversation before the person

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.480
goes out on leave.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.130
See what they're thinking.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:39.020
But then the real
key to conversation

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.000
when they are
ready to come back.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.020
And I think lean in
is very important,

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.140
because it says try
to do your best.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.210
I think Sheryl Sandberg's
main message is

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.950
don't leave before you leave.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.150
That's critical.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.010
Keep going full force
for as long as you can,

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.320
assuming your health is good.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:04.450
But I think that leaning in
is only part of the story.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:09.649
I think that you need to have
employers who meet you halfway.

00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:11.190
Otherwise, I always
tell my students,

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.750
if you keep leaning in and
nobody is there to meet you,

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.930
you're just going to fall over.

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.830
So that doesn't do
anybody any good.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.780
So yes, you need to work hard.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.400
But employers need
to have policies

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.620
that meet people halfway.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.820
I think that Deloitte has done
a really good job of trying

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:36.570
to figure out how to have
lots of different pads

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:41.370
after people leave the workforce
or come back part time.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:46.500
And then as they are
ready to resume full tilt,

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.740
then they're
welcomed to do that.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.320
I think that's really ideal.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.010
SPEAKER 1: What is
a real world example

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.330
of a band of
acceptability agreement

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.680
a couple could have in
place in their relationship?

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.540
MYRA STROBER: Well, one aspect
of the band of acceptability

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.930
might have to do with how many
nights a week the family eats

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.960
dinner together.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.490
So seven is one possibility.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:15.290
But you might say,
look, it's fine

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:20.200
if one partner misses dinner
with the family one night

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.350
a week and a second partner
misses dinner with the family.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:26.510
So now the family is going to
have dinner five nights a week.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.440
Or maybe the couple
is going to go out

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.580
for dinner by themselves
one night a week,

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.550
so now the family eats
together four nights a week.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:38.760
When children get older,
that may be impossible--

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.930
not because of the
parents' work schedule

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:43.870
but because of the
kids' sports schedules.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.880
So then you might say,
OK, every Sunday morning

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.740
our family is going to have
a pancake breakfast together.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:56.020
And nothing can
interfere with that.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.050
So that would be a
band of acceptability.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:04.460
Or you could have acceptability
rules about travel.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:10.190
So how many nights a month is it
OK for one or the other partner

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.520
to be outside the city,
in some other city?

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.390
OK.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.180
Is it fine five nights a week?

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.890
Four nights a week?

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:20.960
10 days a month?

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.060
Whatever your family
decides is right, then

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:29.060
if things begin to move toward
more and more nights away,

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.391
you can sit down and say to
one another, wait a minute.

00:30:31.391 --> 00:30:31.890
Look.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.850
This isn't what we
said we wanted to do.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.810
Something has to change here.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:38.450
So that would be an example.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.200
SPEAKER 1: It's common
for working mothers

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.769
to be asked why
they have children

00:30:41.769 --> 00:30:43.810
if their children will
spend most of their waking

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.300
hours with someone else.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.560
How do you think about the
role of a working parent

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.610
and, in particular, how best
to measure your contribution

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:54.810
to your children if you can't
win on, quote unquote, "time?"

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.820
MYRA STROBER:
Although you may be

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:02.570
away for many of the child's
waking hours, you as a parent

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:05.240
are going to be
right there for other

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:09.330
of those working--
of the child's hours.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:12.510
Certainly on the
weekends, in the evening,

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.460
in the early morning.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.850
And I think parents
have a tremendous effect

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:21.200
on their children even if
their children are in childcare

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.180
or if they're raised
by a third parent

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.540
like a grandparent or a nanny.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:31.030
One of the interesting
ways to think about this

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:37.950
is when a child is cared for
not only by his or her parents

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:42.640
but also by another person,
and the other person

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.570
has a different
accent, the child

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:49.800
picks up the parents' accent.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:56.640
So over hundreds of years,
English royal children

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.020
were raised by people who
didn't necessarily have

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.170
the upper class English accent.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:03.750
And somehow or
other, those children

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.590
figure out which accent
they're supposed to imitate.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:11.900
And I think that's true
for not just language.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.830
I think children know very
early who their parents are

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:21.010
and the kind of love that
they get from those parents

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.070
hopefully.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:28.880
And there is a bond that isn't
created by a nanny or childcare

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.490
worker or even a grandparent.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.060
There's a different kind
of love with a grandparent.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.440
So I think there's
plenty of hours

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.200
in the week for parents to
interact with their kids

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.740
to show them they love them.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:47.150
And I'm just amazed all
the time by my students

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:51.380
and former students who talk
about ways in which they have

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.780
created to interact
with their children

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.800
even when they're traveling.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.310
So now we have Skype.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:01.550
I mean that's a phenomenal way
to be involved with your kids.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.060
Before that we had
phone conversations.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.560
So I just think
that children know

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.910
who their parents are
and know the kind of love

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.010
that they get from
those parents.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:16.190
And you know, also
students tell me

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:20.790
that when they can't be at
their child's ballet recital,

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:24.330
they have somebody
there who videotapes it.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:28.240
And then they sit with the
child and watch the videotape.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.280
And they say that's
even better than having

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.030
been in the audience, because
now we can stop the tape.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:36.020
We can talk about what the
child was doing and feeling.

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.070
So I think with technology and
with a little bit of thinking

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:43.670
about this, parents can have
very fruitful relationships

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.840
with their children even
if they're working hard.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.050
AUDIENCE: My question is
about the body of work

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.400
available on this subject.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.160
How much research is
available with children

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.172
being the subjects?

00:33:58.172 --> 00:33:59.880
MYRA STROBER: There's
a tremendous amount

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.720
of research available.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.990
My daughter-in-law,
Joanna Strober,

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.370
and a co-author
Sharon Meers have

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:13.790
a book called "Getting to
50/50," which was published,

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.540
I think, 2009 maybe.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:21.260
And that has a review of the
research up to that time.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:25.310
For beyond that really you
can go onto the internet

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.790
and find a tremendous
amount of research.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:31.964
If you want to, Google
Scholar is terrific on this

00:34:31.964 --> 00:34:36.260
to find the serious journal
articles but also government

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.250
publications.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.020
There's just an enormous
amount of stuff out there.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:40.770
Too much.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:42.719
It's hard to sift through it.

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:45.340
AUDIENCE: This kind of
gray area where men--

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.770
they're not leaning out.

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:48.750
They're not the
primary caregiver,

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:51.870
but they are potentially
taking a little bit of a valley

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.679
in their career to
support potentially

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:56.239
a woman, their partner,
who's really full force.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:57.210
It could be a new job.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.630
It could be a move.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:01.460
And just the way-- is
our society evolved

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.940
enough to accept it?

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.710
And it comes from
a personal example.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.430
I've moved from New York
for this Google position.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:08.920
It's a fairly big job.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.220
My husband's kind of leaning
in and supporting me.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.655
And it's interesting.

00:35:13.655 --> 00:35:15.280
He shares with me--
he's still working.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.220
He's running his business, but
it's not at the New York base.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.120
And a lot of
parents and school--

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.444
he does more of the drop
offs-- kind of always

00:35:23.444 --> 00:35:25.860
hint to him, like, hey, when
are you going to get back in?

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:27.600
When are you-- and
he's like, I'm in.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.430
I'm just not in at 120% like
where Lena is right now,

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:31.480
because Google's new.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.720
It's intense.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.940
It's interesting-- this
gray area that maybe people

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:35.830
don't want to talk about.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.910
And I'm curious if you see
this, when the men are kind

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.670
of supporting their
wives, but then society

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.420
thinks that they've
completely leaned out.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.620
I don't know.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:43.600
Just curious.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.880
MYRA STROBER: I think it's
really tough for men who are

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.150
trying to make these changes.

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:52.710
Because they do get
those kinds of comments.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:57.020
And they have to be not
only strong in terms

00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.200
of their career, they have
to be strong in facing

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.480
all these other--
usually mothers-- who

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:08.540
have all these words about
what they should and shouldn't

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.510
be doing.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.900
And I've often thought
it would be fun

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:16.920
to have a class for men
who are, as you say,

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.000
leaning in to support
their wives to give them

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.260
some comments that they
might offer in return

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.500
for these negative
comments about when are you

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.530
going to get back in and so on.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:36.390
I just think that whenever
you are a pioneer,

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:42.140
you have to face these societal
norms that haven't changed yet.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.190
And in my book "Sharing
the Work," you know,

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:46.370
I was a pioneer.

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:49.080
I was the first woman at the
Stanford Business School.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.300
And the book is filled with
these kinds of discussions

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.320
about what I had to face.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.970
Now the pioneers are
people like your husband

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:04.960
who are really bucking
the trends and are saying,

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.140
no, my wife has gotten
a great job at Google.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.030
And I'm going to support her.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.950
And she's going all the way.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:14.070
And I'm still
staying in, but I'm

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.630
doing more childcare than I
might have done otherwise.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:22.410
And I think you
have to be a pioneer

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:26.144
and you have to be strong.

00:37:26.144 --> 00:37:27.810
SPEAKER 1: Can you
talk about challenges

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:31.770
taking care of aging parents and
family members and any nuances

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.240
to what you've
covered with regard

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.920
to partnering balance on this
topic-- sorry-- with regard

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.100
to partnering slash
balance on this topic

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.560
versus childcare balance?

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:44.390
MYRA STROBER: That's a
really important question.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:50.950
I didn't have a section on elder
care in my work family course

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:53.600
until maybe seven
or eight years ago

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.600
when one of the men in my class
did a paper on elder care.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.400
And at the bottom of
his paper, he said,

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.700
I think this topic
should be in the class.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.180
And I thought to myself,
yes, it really should.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.700
And so since that time we do
have the topic in the class.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.630
And in many ways,
elder care is more

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:15.620
challenging than childcare.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.530
I mean, even though
children may be rebellious,

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:21.300
basically the parents
are in charge.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.260
The parents make the
decisions and try

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.760
to get the children to go along.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.730
That's not true with elder care.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:32.040
Adult children are not in
charge of their parents.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.110
Adult children have to wait for
their parents to make decisions

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.150
that they can support.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:40.690
They can try to influence them,
but the parents are in charge.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:45.080
The other thing is
that children grow up.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.600
So childcare is only
for a few years,

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.380
and then they become
teenagers, which

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.880
is a whole different story.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.280
But you know, then they
stop being teenagers

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.010
and they grow up more.

00:38:55.010 --> 00:39:00.160
With elder care you don't
know how long your parent

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.210
is going to need care.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.330
You don't know
whether the situation

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:09.000
is going to get better
or more likely worse.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.690
It's much less predictable.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:15.440
They often don't live in the
same city where you live.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.890
And the statistics seem
to show that more days are

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:25.900
lost from work by adults doing
elder care than childcare.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.380
Because childcare
is predictable.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.330
So you can line up help.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:34.370
But elder care, particularly if
you have to go to another state

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:37.480
to take care of your
parent, is not predictable.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.000
And I think elder care
is still not talked

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.880
about much in the workplace.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.870
A lot of people don't
want their manager

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:47.410
to know that they're involved
in elder care, because they're

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:50.790
spending a lot of time
at work doing this.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:53.500
And so I believe
this is the topic

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.940
for the future with regard
to work family balance.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.020
And if there's an
emergency with your parent,

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.710
there is no balance.

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:03.060
None at all.

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:07.250
150% of your time and
effort is involved

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.440
in trying to deal
with this emergency.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.080
And then you have to make
all the other arrangements,

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.310
especially if you're in the
so-called sandwich generation,

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:17.530
where you not only
have elder parents

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.270
but you have young children.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:22.510
So then you're really
running from one to the other

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.320
to try to get the
balance that you need.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.710
Interestingly, more
and more studies

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:33.110
show that men are more
involved in elder care.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:36.950
So it used to be when
wives were at home and not

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:40.010
in the workplace that
they did the elder

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.250
care, not only for
their parents but also

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:44.050
for their husband's parents.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.500
But that's not so true anymore.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:51.260
So more and more men are doing
the care for their own parents

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:54.410
and really stepping up to that.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:59.620
So, again, that's a whole
new sort of pioneering.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.120
SPEAKER 1: Can you
give any guidance

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.340
on the proper timing
and method to start

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.860
speaking with your manager
about your decision

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.380
to start family planning?

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.300
MYRA STROBER: So
I think this idea

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:16.790
of when you should talk to your
manager also is very specific.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.570
The specifics of the situation
are really important.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:29.640
If you know that your manager
is going to be helpful

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.540
and isn't going to say to
you something like, oh god,

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.760
why did you go and do that?

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.380
You could have had
a great career.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.850
Then you might want to talk
to your manager early on.

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:44.490
If you think your manager is
not going to be supportive,

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:48.320
you might want to wait a little
bit more before you talk.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.920
But pregnancy has a way,
particularly for women,

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.170
of showing.

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:57.940
So your manager's going to find
out at some point or other.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:01.760
And it's probably better
if you talk to your manager

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:06.420
before he or she can see
that you're pregnant.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:10.500
And so I think
the best example I

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.830
know is a former
student of mine who

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.330
was in strategic planning
at a tech company.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:17.210
This was years ago.

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:22.410
And she went into her
manager early on and said,

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:24.960
this is the plan.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:31.200
This is the strategic plan for
my pregnancy and childbirth.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.610
So here is a flow chart.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.350
And here's what I'm going to be
doing for the next six months.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.060
And then I'm going to
take some time off,

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:42.050
and I'm going to check in
at each of these points.

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:47.570
And then after six months,
I'm coming back full time.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:51.490
And she said, you
can't find anybody

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:56.000
to do this job better than I
can given this strategic plan I

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.590
just gave you.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:02.020
And he sort of said, bless you.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:05.190
So you know, if you
say what you want

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:08.730
and how you're going to do
it, and you're confident--

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.880
and, of course, everybody
has to understand

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.400
that things might not
quite work out that way,

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.740
depending on what happens.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:19.150
But you can say with
90% confidence perhaps

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:22.260
that this is what
is going to happen.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.197
Here's what we're going to do.

00:43:24.197 --> 00:43:25.780
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you could

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.910
share some of your
suggestions for how

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:33.620
to make that dip in a
career for a couple, two

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.720
young professionals
with, let's say,

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.304
relatively successful careers.

00:43:38.304 --> 00:43:39.720
When I took your
class, I remember

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.620
you talked about one
suggestion, which

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:45.479
was hiring a night nanny even
though it's quite expensive.

00:43:45.479 --> 00:43:47.270
But there's actually
quite a lot of benefit

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.020
of getting a good night's
sleep for both partners

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.644
and then having a
more productive day

00:43:51.644 --> 00:43:52.560
and the psychological.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.680
So I was hoping to get a
refresher on things like that.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:03.610
MYRA STROBER: Well, of course,
if you have a lot of money,

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.480
then there are lots of
solutions like a night nanny.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:14.690
If you are not in such a
great financial situation,

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.040
then, of course,
you're more limited.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.780
And you have to
be more creative.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:23.870
When I see graduate students at
Stanford who, by definition, do

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:27.032
not have a lot of money--
well, unless their parents have

00:44:27.032 --> 00:44:28.240
a tremendous amount of money.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.350
But they don't have
a lot of money.

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:33.020
They use a co-op method.

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:36.800
So when they want
to go out to a movie

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.610
or they want to go
out for dinner or date

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:40.470
night or something--
they probably

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.550
won't go out for a movie--
but out for dinner,

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:45.440
just the two of them.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.410
Instead of hiring
a babysitter, which

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:53.440
can cost more than the
dinner, they will trade off.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.296
So they'll say, you
know, tonight we're

00:44:55.296 --> 00:44:56.420
going to go out for dinner.

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.190
You watch both your
children and mine.

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.380
And then tomorrow night you
go, and I'll watch yours.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.270
I think there's lots
of ways of cooperating

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:09.450
with other people who also have
young children that work out

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:10.410
very well.

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:14.440
Even would you take my
child for the afternoon

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.900
so I can get a nap-- if your
child is not napping anymore.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.761
Otherwise try to nap
when the child naps.

00:45:20.761 --> 00:45:22.870
That's always a good thing.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:26.860
But I think your
question is wonderful,

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:31.570
because it shows you that
you have to think creatively

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:33.670
about how to do this.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:35.680
It was easier in
the old days where

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.800
you had lots of family
living around you,

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.820
and you could just
drop your kid off

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.590
for a few hours with
somebody in your family.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:48.430
Now you have to arrange
those kinds of new family

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:52.290
arrangements with people who
are actually friends by choice

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:54.920
rather than family members.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.460
But truly if you have a
lot of money-- I mean,

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.420
I know people who hire
more than one nanny.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.850
Some nanny comes
from 8:00 to 6:00.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:11.090
Another nanny comes
from 5:00 to 9:00.

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:14.160
And then if the child is
a newborn and not sleeping

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.830
through the night, they
might hire a night nurse.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:21.270
So all of those things are
possible for a very few people.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.570
SPEAKER 1: So this is sort
of adding on to the co-op

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.510
question, but how
important is it

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:27.700
to have a network
of women at your job

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.770
once you come back that
are sort of experiencing

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:31.585
the same experiences as you are?

00:46:31.585 --> 00:46:32.960
MYRA STROBER:
Well, I don't think

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:38.830
it's necessarily necessary
to have it at your job.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:44.600
Some women prefer to have
a network of women doing

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.650
the same thing they're
doing but at other companies

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:52.000
so that they can be 100%
frank about what's going on

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.280
and not worry that somebody
is at their own workplace.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:00.970
Other people like to have a
network at their workplace.

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:05.610
But no matter how you
slice it, a network is key.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.930
I know when I was
raising my kids,

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:10.990
there were very few
professional women.

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:17.410
And my network consisted of
my kids' friends' mothers

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:19.200
at their nursery school.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.750
So they weren't
professional women at all.

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:27.400
But they were so helpful
to me in so many ways.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:31.320
If my babysitter couldn't
come because she had a family

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.700
emergency, I would
call one of them.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.530
And they would take my children
home with them at lunch time.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.140
You can't do this
just by yourself.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.300
And, of course,
the luckiest thing

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:50.950
is if you can get your parents
to move near where you are.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:52.530
Or you move back.

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:55.650
I mean, I had a student
who-- she and her husband

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:58.199
moved back to Shanghai,
because that's

00:47:58.199 --> 00:47:59.240
where their parents were.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.650
And they could not imagine
doing this kind of thing

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:04.530
without their parents' help.

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:07.210
So you know, the
geographic location

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.100
had nothing to do with
their two careers.

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.202
It had to do with where
their parents were.

00:48:11.202 --> 00:48:12.410
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so much.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:13.618
MYRA STROBER: You're welcome.

00:48:13.618 --> 00:48:14.940
[APPLAUSE]
