Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday. Fucking June 27th June. What stuff? What happened to this month? My goodness. Where's it going? You know what? I think July 18th. That's my half day. July 18th I think we'll be wrapped. We'll be done with the writing of the 10 episodes of efforts for family. Then all we gotta do is look at the drawings and edit them for the next fucking 10 months. But the heavy lifting will be out of the way. Um, would you guys like to know on an animated show works well? You sit in a room and you come up with fucking whatever. Yeah. You have figured out how the whole season is going to go. Then you fucking write it and then it changes like 50 fucking times. You rewrite, you rewrite, you rewrite your record, you write more, you do table reads, you do all his fucking shit.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       Then once you get all of that done, what starts coming in as the animatics, which is basically the rough drawings of a, of the shit, you know that you recorded and then you say, ah, well you know, why is he standing next to that chair? He should be over in the kitchen. You've got to do all of that shit. He's not moving enough. Have him take his glasses off their of heaven. Fucking be. You got to do all of that. And then they fucking draw it and then you look at it and then it still might not be funny. And then you gotta be like, all right is what we wrote. Not Funny or is the way it's executed here? Not Fun in that. That's why it takes so fucking long in case you wondering, cause you're like, well shit, you recorded. I mean you wrote them.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       Why don't they just take out some magic markers and fucking put them on a piece of paper? And then somebody stands there and they flip through it like they used to in the old days. So they used to do, they'd have somebody, a the village idiot, go up on stage with a giant fucking notebook and he'd sit there going from just going through the thing and people would sit there and they enjoy it and the guy screwed up. They A, they shot him cause everybody had guns back then. At least that's the way it was in America. Um, speaking of America, what's going on in Ireland, I decided I was going to start looking to see what the fuck is going on in these countries and we're going to be going to, uh, evidently might know Neil Martin O'Neill, the Republic of Ireland's Martin O'Neill there, there, Bill Belicheck. He was fucking pissed because Ireland just lost to France in some game where you're not allowed to pick the ball up with your hands for whatever fucking recent, you know, you'd figure if you're only allowed to use your feet or your hands, or let's say you use your fucking hands. I mean, there's no style of fighting where you just use your feet, right. Maybe taekwondo, but they didn't, you know, if you fucking come at them, they're still gonna Punch you in the nose, right? I just don't understand it. I'm fucking with you. It's actually, it's a beautiful game. I went in to get my head fucking shaved the other day. Right now. What to this blob

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       of shop? A real barber shop when? Where you walk in and there's fucking men in there, right? Rubbing their hairy chest. And I'm kidding. There's men in there and you just fucking go at and you sit down until it's your fucking turn. Unlike these fucking Goddamn hips to fucking things, whether they got the little fucking, what do you call that barbershop? Little swivel thing that goes around to me that says I can just walk in. Right? And then you walk in again. There's nobody here. Can you shake my head? I'll do Hilton appointment. Dude. Look at me. How long is it gonna fucking take? You want to make an extra fucking 20 bucks? Huh? You don't, I can go fuck yourself. You know, you fucking 28th president of the United States fucking haircut. Who is that by the way? Who is the 28th president? Nobody ever talks about the 28th presidents. Let's look it up. Let's look it up. Uh, 28 president. You know, if I, if I had to guess, I'm going to say Grover Cleveland, uh, 28th, President Calvin Coolidge, the Fuck Oh, oh, oh, the content itself. Woodrow Wilson, Woodrow Wilson, who signed the fucking Federal Reserve Act and uh, and we're all still paying for it today. You know, it's a good one to look up Woodrow Wilson's letter of regret. What are the fucking odds I would've said that sent me down this conspiracy theory. Woodrow Wilson Letter of regret.

Speaker 2:          00:04:30       All right, where is it? Where is did Wilson w did Woodrow Wilson regret handing America to the Federal Reserve? Woodrow Wilson, after creating the Federal Reserve, said, uh, let's see. Here we go. I have unwittingly ruined my country. I don't know how to pronounce that word, so maybe he didn't. All right. This is what he wrote. I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly, unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. See, they always got to write it. So sophisticated. Sophisticatedly I can't even understand what the fuck they're talking about. Like that thing, Dwight d Eisenhower, when he gives that speech about the industrial military complex itch, I watched that over and over again. I have no fucking idea what he's talking about. Even it's explained to me before I watched the speech and by the end of it I, I don't understand it and I feel like he said it that way either because he was so fucking smart.

Speaker 2:          00:05:32       He couldn't relate to the common man, which I don't understand because he had all those soldiers or he said it that way because he had to say it in a way that he wouldn't get off. Right. I don't fucking know. Anyways, he said the growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. This is a president. A former president wrote this. Okay, so I don't want to hear any guys saying, oh conspiracy, go fuck yourself. It's just like when I told you that the NBA was fixed and then there was the mobbed up ref and you guys all tried to wiggle out of it. And what did they say? Oh yeah, there was just one of them. Oh yeah. Was there, there was just one of them. All right, we have to come too. We have come to be one of the worst, ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated, govern governments in the civilized world. Lone longer a government by free opinion. No longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men. Oh, there you go. He still didn't quite fucking say what he did.

Speaker 3:          00:06:37       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:06:39       Jesus Christ.

Speaker 3:          00:06:41       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:42       Oh God. They got, they got fucking, you know what they did Woodrow? They put woody from cheers. Their version of chairs or their version of woody from fucking chairs. They put them in the office. Well, what am I even talking about right now? I didn't want to talk about this. I was talking about soccer. How the fuck do I go from soccer to that? So anyways, it's Martin O'Neill who I would not fuck with some of it at an Irish brogue in those fucking glasses, you know, you know, just some, somehow we teach Xapi to the throat. Um, he said they got the short end short straw when they played France for whatever fucking reason. I never even finished the story. So I wanted to get my fucking head shaped. And a, they had that European champion was championship, was on the highlights, the whole fucking thing.

Speaker 2:          00:07:24       Everybody in there was into the game. So I automatically got into it. So, oh, hope you guys know, I'm just fucking with you when it comes to that. It's just that when the world loves something as a comedian, it's just so easy to make fun of it and to get the feedback that you want, which is totally people losing their minds typing at you and all capital letters. It's just fun. Um, so anyways, for some reason France got an extra three days to rest their tired legs in their swollen feet before they got to play the little footy game again in Ireland. Didn't like it. You know, it's funny, the guy, the guy like trashes them and says, uh, you know, we got fucked over three days is an incredible amount of time. Uh, one side could have as an advantage over another, uh, Blahblahblahblahblah that said, France friends who are really, really fine team and good luck to them and the tournament. I love that shit. After you fucking trash him. I'm just completely unfair. Go Fuck Yourself. But I haven't said that out. You've got a hell of a team now. [inaudible] good shot. Chia. Matey alright. Irish news headlines March going on in Ireland. Roy Foster, Britton Co's signed a margins by this stupid party. I don't know what that means. Mary Robinson is, that's not a real name. Mary Robinson.

Speaker 3:          00:08:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08:42       Is that an alias? [inaudible] Brexit could have a domino effect. What the fuck is Brexit? Isn't this shit Trump got in trouble for, that's what I loved about Trump this week. When he fucking went to Scotland and it, yeah, just like

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       Scotland, we're going to take our country back. Cause I guess Scotland was voting about whether they still wanted to be a part of the European Union and uh, Scotland overwhelmingly agreed to stay part of it. Evidently, I dunno. And Trump went there and didn't know it. And I was reading like what everyone was saying and it was, you know, trashing Donald Trump. And it was so similar to what people write to me every week. John, Sally isn't dead. You fucking moron. I said the wrong name. I didn't mean John. Sally, you know what? What do, what do you want from me? All right. A former president, president or what?

Speaker 4:          00:09:35       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       Mary Robinson. She was president of Ireland. You know what? She's a lovely lady. I'd vote for her when the, when the fuck was she president, former president. Mary Robinson has said that young people in the UK must feel very let down by the outcome of the Brexit Brexit modal referendum. And she appealed to the EU to remember its core values. One of the vague shit that she say, Jesus Christ, can you help out an American here? What the fuck's going on over there and that crisis, there's some bullshit I have to know when I go over there

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       some sort of referendum. Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union? What's going on with the European Union, the EU? What happens? You guys formed a super group, but now all the egos are getting in the way. What happened? How Greece is fucking economy went down and all of a sudden it's fucking with you guys. You'll never do that. Never join a fucking group. Take it from a complete loner who does stand up, right? You don't join a group. You know what I mean? You use the group, okay, what do you guys do? Oh yeah, you cater parties. All right, I'm having a party. I don't want to join your party operation. I'd like you to come over here and a Tyson balloons to some fucking lampposts. Could you do that and how much would that cost and here's your check and get out of my life. That's how you do it. Why the fuck would you go, hey, it's actually amazing that they got it done. You know what I mean? Considering all the fucking wars they've had over the years, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:11:12       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       Fascism, communism, fucking, whatever the fuck we're called. I don't know what the fuck we are.

Speaker 4:          00:11:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       How the fuck did they do all that and why did they do all that? That just all comes down to bankers. What was wrong with having the pound and then the fucking Ireland had this Shell Ailey, right? What they have in Sweden, I don't know what the fuck they had. Some sort of thing. A leg of that design the way a little shrinker. I don't fucking know. I don't understand why everybody has to get in bed with everybody yelling. It's going to be better. It's going to create more jobs. No, it isn't. No, it isn't. It's just going to make the people at the top make more fucking money. It's just like, you know, can we have more people to fuck in the ass? Can we have some of your people? What

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       a, if we would, if we combined all the people, right? We fucking microchipped them. We phased out fucking money. What if we did that right? And now, yeah, everything's on your little microchip here, right? People getting mugged in the future. It's going to be fucking hilarious. It's going to be some fucking nerdy kid getting dragged in by a football player and you're going to grab a bunch of Dr Peppers and some fucking Sag nut bars, and then they're going to grab the nerds risks and fucking just keep swiping it, making them pay for all this shit, right? If you're fucking rich, you're gonna. You can't even go out of the fucking house. Someone's going to grab you and take you to a Lexus dealership. Civil fucking grabbed the guy. Just fucking, just start scanning. Oh, that'd be great. You know, it's not going happen. They're gonna have, you're gonna have like 50 men.

Speaker 2:          00:12:45       Oh my God. This is this going to be some shit going down. If you get, if you're going to have a microchip in your fucking body that has every fucking cent you ever earned, that you didn't blow on fucking bud lights and hookers, you know, doesn't that make you like, what's going to stop somebody from just coming up and just sucker punching you and then carving your fucking microchip out of your arm? Right. And then it's like they got an extra life and then they just have this fucking thing and they just start running around with tweezers, just scanning a bunch of shit. Why wouldn't they just, you know what they're gonna do? They'll fucking chop your arm off, right? And then fucking hide your body. Okay. You know, like how they used to do that, like allegedly the, uh, the Westies, they chop some guy's arm off and then they would go around committing murders and then they'd take the arm out of the fridge and they put the fingerprints on the gun and then they just put the arm back in the fridge.

Speaker 2:          00:13:44       It's, if you get past the fucking humanity, you know, it's really brilliant and slash borderline fucking hilarious. Um, man, I bet those guys could tell a story. Jesus Christ, you know the shit they did. Horrible Shit. But Jesus, you have to be a funny Bastien on some fucking level. I know you're out of your mind, but there is something fucking hilarious about that. You know? And then the cops, you know, when they were drinking, the cops are just like, that's fucking guy struck again. You know, they will laugh and go, dude, you realize we're inventing a serial killer. And they'd all be sitting there laughing their balls off and then at some point the laughter would died down is that they then realize like, wait a minute, where we're kind of serial killers. Well, we're all doing it. It's a group effort. You know, it's not like it's one person.

Speaker 2:          00:14:35       So yeah. You know, whatever, go to another Jamieson. Um, anyways, I have no fucking idea what I'm talking about and I have no idea what's going on in the world and I evidently I need to learn it. I need to learn it before, you know, I go to Scotland, they start handing up, fuck those signs. You know, Trump is a cunt. I just all of that Shit, Donald Trump is fucking, he's back to being fucking hilarious again to me because I know he's not going to win. He's not gonna win. The whole world can fucking relax. Everybody knows Hillary's getting in. Okay. And what's funny is everybody's going to relax, relax. Like, oh, thank God we dodged that fucking bullet. Like Hillary isn't a fucking bankers wet dream coming down like a fucking freight train. Um, now cheesy. She better not get elected. I'm getting a fucking audited.

Speaker 2:          00:15:23       Do you want to times I've trashed her. Oh my God. Oh God. That fucking, ugh. Some of the Shit I want to say. I can't fucking say it because in this day and age, you just, you just cannot say that. You understand why a certain person did what he did. Um, age is Christ just coming home to that fucking air raid siren every fuck he can. He at least fucking, you know, doll yourself up a little bit. Jesus Christ with the fucking the paper chase. Look over here. I mean, what, what, what, what was the guy's supposed to do?

Speaker 2:          00:15:57       I'm just kidding. Bill Clinton would fuck a hole in a tree and he would do it with his fucking pants down with this, the fucking secret service standing with their backs to them like five feet away. They could literally film, don't feel the wind of his hips as he was pumping the tree. Guys at Animal Day in and fucking day out, that guy is a fucking animal. God blow. You know what? God bless him. God bless him. You know, it's just how he's wired. Did you guys ever see that episode of cheaters? Remember that show they'd catch people cheating, right? And that lady cut the fuck. Can anybody find this clip from me? This Liz Lady, a southern Belle. She catches her fucking redneck guy stepping out on it, right? And this fucking guy, she, you know, he was supposed to be embarrassed, but he was hammered.

Speaker 1:          00:16:52       She usually like, oh my God, if I can pacy shit, I could cheat. Dude is cheese, you know, slap rat fuckin two dudes. And he goes, well honey, did it ever dawn on you? Then maybe just maybe I was tired of fucking you and I wanted to fuck someone else

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       and he said it. The wiz delivery of that epic line was just, it was like, he was saying like, like hello, you know, fucking get your shit together. The fucking answers right here. Like he said, it was such, he was putting it on her. It was one of the, one of the, one of the more amazing things I've seen a human being do in that situation, you know what I mean? Um, anyways, let me get back to the fucking, what's going on here in Scotland? What's going on here? Oh, by the way, uh, so Belgium has been added. Germany has been added even though, you know, I'm making, I think that paying me, like with a couple of steins of beer, which I don't give a fuck. I just want to go over there. I want to, I'm that close. You know, I'm going to do Germany, some weird fucking town I never heard of.

Speaker 2:          00:18:02       And then I'm driving over to Belgium and I'm not doing a, what the fuck was the fucking capital of Brussels? I don't, fuck it wasn't, no, it is Brussels, right?

Robinson was inaugurated as the seventh president of Ireland under the well, how many fucking dumb along to you stay in office seven presidents since caveman days. She proved a remarkably popular president earning the praise of Brian Linehan himself. Well, shit, if Brian says it well then fuck you know, before his death, five years later, sorry, Brian in the Linehan film. Uh, so that she was a better president than he ever could have been. Oh, that was the guy that went after your can let fucking hire. All right. I'm Saturday. She was great. Uh, that was every fucking I accident over there. Okay.

Hormoze Rashidi that's how I'm saying it about the Middle East. It's hilarious and informative. Uh, this dude was born in Iran. So rather than listening to bill O'Reilly talk about the Middle East, even though he's never fucking been there, or fucking Wolf fucking bullets, all these talking heads with the books, you know, and the aligns of suits right from the bill O'Reilly collection from the earliest is a wolf blitzer tie, right?

Speaker 2:          00:24:15       Whatever the fuck it is that they do to get the XD or extra hor money, you know, who you think has a better walk in closet. Bill O'Reilly, a Wolf Blitzer, you know though, they're fucking shiny loafers, you know, set. Just so you know, all their suits all lined up, their pocket squares and all of that shit. You know what I mean? He fucking take you downstairs to the wine cellar and show you these bottles of wine that fucking hundreds of years old. He see that, look at that. Look at that. I get this for lying everyday on television. Isn't that amazing? Come on. You do cocaine. Want to do some coke? All right. I'm just saying with Downey, I just figured I'd ask you.

Speaker 2:          00:25:04       It's a rough one. You know, um, I got this new thing that I, that I'm into, man. And uh, you'd think it wouldn't be a big deal. I like, uh, I like fucking tennis and golf shirts. I like them. They're comfortable, they're breathable. It's a collared shirt. People let you into restaurants when you wear them and she fucking hates them. I like the Izod tennis wear. So today I'm walking out the house to go meet a buddy of mine and I got one of those on and I got these fucking a, I got these Phil Mickelson shorts, whatever the fuck they are, just, they're just black shorts or whatever. So as I'm walking out, I go, I need lcls. She goes, all right, she goes till tiger woods. I said, what's up?

Speaker 2:          00:25:54       She fucking hates how I dress. And this is one of these things where you know, as much as you want to remain your own person, when you're in a relationship, when you're the person you fucking says you're not, you don't look good, it affects you. But there's some I have, this is how comfortable these fucking shirts are. I don't think I give a shit. I think for the first time ever, I don't care that my wife doesn't approve of what the fuck I'm wearing. They had that fucking comfortable. You never have to iron them. They're great. They're fucking great. So I was a, I was at the mall there. Um, I really should fucking, this is just like free advertising for all these fucking people. Um, what's the shit that the uh, the honor roll student wears? What's it called? Barnet and body armor. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       We're not taking that shit in our house. Clothes. Whatever was over the top fucking sports thing. Armor wear underarm, whatever the fuck it is. You know what it is? Defense shields some fucking space odyssey shit. You know the fucking thing, the thing that Steph curry wears is on underarm under armor. That's what it is. Under arm's deodorant. Bill a under armor. Right? They got some fucking, they got some great clothes. So I, I knew, I knew she didn't like that shit cause I said to her for my birthday, I go, I don't, I don't fucking need that. You know what I would love though this the summers here and the tab is rat for wearing some golf clothes. Um, so I told her that, uh, you know, I told you, just get me a couple of those shirts and pairs of shorts and I'll be fine.

Speaker 2:          00:27:36       I'll be good. She's like [inaudible] usually she such into fashion, she gets excited when I tell her the clothes and you know, my fucking birthday comes along and I gotta tell you there was not a hint of any of that shit. So I called her on it like a couple of days ago. I said, hey, you know, uh, I noticed, you know, I asked you for those things. They're not expensive. You were right there and it was an easy, it was an easy gift to get me to pad, you know, make it look like you actually spent time shopping. You know, which is why I always go and I get her a little, some workout clothes. That's always an extra fee. He would go right there, friend. Do you give him a couple more? It looks like you give a shit, you know more than, you know. Not saying you don't give a shit, but who the fuck wants to shop? Nobody. All right. I don't want to do it, therefore nobody wants to do it. That's how I, that's my worldview. Okay. I'm really starting to learn from Trump. If I feel something then um, everybody else also feels it and if they don't, then we should ram it down their throats. It's somewhere in there. We take their coats is, isn't that how it works?

Speaker 2:          00:28:41       Have you ever seen a guy like less tough in your life talk so fucking tough. Like I dunno, I don't understand why he's mistaking having money with actually being physically intimidating, um, with that stupid scowl on his face. I don't know if like Gene Simmons had a brother that didn't make it, that wasn't in a band. That's what he looks like. He looks like he's related to Gene Simmons and he resents gene success. Um, anyways, plowing ahead here. So my wife fucking hates this shit. And I called her on and I was just going like, you didn't like that stuff, did you? And she just fucking started smiling and looking down at her food. And, um, I was over there today and I, I was gonna stop and go in and buy some and uh, I didn't. And the only reason why I didn't is because it's Sunday and it's a mall. And um, that's just like, I dunno, I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is about the weekends and malls. Now I understand kids go in there, teenagers going there because then you run into other teenagers and you fucking go like,

Speaker 1:          00:29:49       Hey, will you go out with me?

Speaker 2:          00:29:51       Do that shit. At least that's what we did when we were of that age. But like parents, like I just don't understand what, why would you go there? Especially if you get like some little kid and you got to fucking push them around and that damn stroller trying to weave in and out of all those people, I just can't imagine the fucking misery of that, you know? That's definitely a Wifi idea. You know, we should go to the mall today. I don't want to go to the mall. You know, I have all these theories as to why men die before women. And uh, you know what it is. Women have to include you in their shitty day. You know, I fucking, um, this my sister in law's birthday this weekend, right? So we ended up going to a, uh, to a movie. I was all excited and we saw, what did we see? We saw, uh, independence day. Whew. It was actually so bad. It was good. We actually ended up having a great time and uh, I don't wanna ruin the movie, but like the fact that the white guide precedent has to come back, you know, and get shit done is a little fucked up. You know, Hollywood tries to be liberal, you know, they'll have a chick president, they'll have a black guy flying a fucking jet and all that type of shit. But at the end of the day, they bring back the old founding father to come in and save the day.

Speaker 2:          00:31:18       Anyway. So I had a great time doing that. Right. So the next night, you know, my wife's going to go meet some friends. I think it was actually, it was a continuation of the birthday celebration and I was actually tired so I wasn't going to go. So, um, I was just like, you know what, I'm gonna hang in. Um, I have a ton of shit to do cause you know, I sit in a writer's room all fucking day. She goes, fine coat. I'm like, great, this is perfect. I'll get a bunch of shit done and blah, blah blah, Blah Blah and all that type of stuff. So right around the time it's time for her to go right. And I'm

Speaker 1:          00:31:51       about ready to have a beer or anything and she just goes, can you try me over? She didn't say it like that, but that's what she probably said, honey, can you drive me over? But like, cause I didn't want to do it. That's what it sounded like.

Speaker 2:          00:32:02       And I was just like, you can't, why don't you drive yourself over?

Speaker 1:          00:32:08       Just like [inaudible] me. And so I go for fucking Uber. He's like, put a one take me,

Speaker 2:          00:32:17       you know, and I, I just went like, why can't you know I'm home? Why do you got to drink? You're the one who's going across fucking town. You're going across town. Why do I got to go across town to you know why you don't fucking know. Why is it the end of the fucking day? They,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       if they have a something shitty to do, they can't do, I can't fucking do it on their own. Somehow you gotta be, that's, it's like when they have a fucking kid now they dragged the husband in there. What the fuck is he doing in there? What the fuck is he doing in there? He's not a doctor. Do you know, I know a guy went in there where you fucking saw what was going on. He passed out. Now they got two patients. The fuck is that, you know? Well, if I have to go through the equine and well fuck it, talk to God. Talk to God for once, for once, for once. This shit ran your way and now I gotta go in there too. So you get to hold my fucking hand and break my God damn finger. That's fucking, that is the defect that fucking men gave into that shit that you got to fucking be in there. Is that if you were getting fucking gallbladder surgery, would I be standing in there holding your fucking hand? I don't know, but I guess if fucking them gave him gallbladders I, I don't know that gallbladder kidney stones is some shit. I guess you'd have to be. That's the dumbest shit in the fucking, it's the stupidest shit ever. My wife has talked to, if we have ever kid, you're going to go in there. I was like no, she got so fucking mad at me over a hypothetical child. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:34:09       if I was smart I just would've said I'm getting smarter though. I if I was smarter, smart married guys go lapse allele and I'll have to go at that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:15       Yeah. [inaudible] your way to put the baby in me. I would fucking shit it up my ass daddy. Thanks for you sweetheart. Right. Oh, I'm getting heated here. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:34:28       I'm getting smarter though as a married man, cause I'll tell you this right now, the other, when we went to go see the movie, I got there first. Okay. And uh, I got there, it was seven o'clock show. I got there by like six 30 and I was like fuck, you know I get time. Maybe I'll, you know, it was a place to get a sandwich. I didn't want to eat movie food. So I got a wrap and then they fucking had a beer too. And by the way, I, every fucking time I ordered this beer from Mexico, it fucking sucks. I'm not saying all their beer stinks, but I gotta tell Ya, I didn't want, let me tell you that fucking bear steaks. I'm going to get you the name of this right fucking, this can be a reverse commercial. There it is.

Speaker 1:          00:35:09       The fuck is that shit called Modelo.

Speaker 2:          00:35:15       Hang on a second. I think that's what it's called. It is the fucking most bitter hoppy fucking, it's like a job trying to get the thing down. But I was still a beer. So it's at the end of the day, it's not all bad. So I'm sipping this beer, I'm having this sandwich. I got plenty of time to eat it. A fucking relaxed. My wife, the lovely Nia, she, yeah, she

Speaker 1:          00:35:34       texts me. She goes, Hey, I'm almost there.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       And I like a dope. I started to text, Hey, I'm already here. I mean, I'm having a sandwich and a beer. Okay, now this is the deal for all you youngsters out there. One of the things women hate the most is when their guy is having fun without them. All right? So any fucking time you're having a good time and they're not there, you gotta. How's it gone? Eh? You know, it's kind of crowded. Y'All always say it sucks. Okay? If you're having a good time, [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:36:09       fun, you're

Speaker 2:          00:36:12       gonna have to fucking deal with that shit, right? This is the thing my wife is, is, is cool as it gets. All right. I still have to go through this shit. So I almost fucking texted her. I'm sitting here having a rap, enjoying a fucking beer, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then, you know what? I was like, what the fuck am I doing if I say this, she's going to then say, can you get me one or she's going to tell me to go over and go get the fucking tickets. She's going to give me a job. There is no fucking way she's going to allow me to just sit here and relax and enjoy this sandwich and this beer that I fucking pay for. I've worked all fucking day. What am I a fucking asshole? So I just erased all of it. And rather than saying all of that, you know, I'm on my way over here.

Speaker 2:          00:37:06       Oh, I'm sitting here having a sandwich and a beer. I erased all of that and I just wrote, okay, send, that was it. I didn't say I was there. I didn't say I wasn't there. And I sat there and I enjoyed it even though that beer was not my favorite. And then, um, I ended up walking over and, uh, I ran into my sister in law and then I, and then look at dope. I texted my wife gone yet, I'm just uh, you know I'm here with your sister in law, blah blah blah, blah blah. And then she immediately texts back, okay, buy the tickets immediately. Fucking is a job for you is a fucking job, you know? And she always goes, why Nike's trying to streamline our life? No you're not. No you're not. You're treating me like your fucking assistant. I'm 37 minutes.

Speaker 2:          00:37:58       Holy Fuck. What am I doing here? So that's one for you. Okay. This is what you, you kiss him. You tell him you love him. You tell him that beautiful every fucking day. But I tell you this, okay, when you're having a good time and they're not there, you never ever tell them you having a good time. No fucking pictures. None of that shit. Cause they will sit there and they'll either, they'll, you'll, you'll sit there, you'll be that guy. You know that guy on the phone while everybody's having a good time. The guy in the corner was on the phone talking to his girl. Why is he talking to his girl? Cause he told her he was having fun. Stupid, stupid, stupid. It's your fucking head in the game. All right.

Yeah, advertising is all right. Where the fuck is the reeds for this week? Um, okay. Lab grown food. All right. Hey Bill, wondering if you've heard of lab grown meats. Basically scientists have figured out a way to make plants tastes like meat. Why aren't they fucking with the food supply? I don't understand what they're doing. This could eliminate our need to raise and kill millions of cows a year and help stop the ass gas coming from these cows from continuing to ruin our planet.

Speaker 2:          00:45:35       I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I like the idea of it. Here's an example from the article. The impossible burger is more than just peas and carrots smashed together. It's the result of some pretty high tech research. Brown's team analyzes meat at a molecular level to determine what makes a burger tastes smell and cook the way it does. He wants his burger to be squishy while raw gross. Then from up and Brown on the grill, he believes everything from an animal, from an animals fat tissue to muscle cells can be replicated using plant compound compounds. Before starting the company, Brown had a hunch that a certain ingredient made meat tastes different than other foods. I had a strong suspicion early on that I don't want to say that h e m e him would be the magic ingredient for flavor, not hemp.

Speaker 2:          00:46:28       A said Brown. Here's a link to the whole article. Would you eat this? Thanks. Come back to Boston. No, I try not to fuck with that type of shit. No, I would not eat that. If I want meat, I eat meat. If I want ice cream, I get ice cream. I don't get low fat ice cream. I don't try to eat ice cream. That doesn't make me fat cause you're gonna pay the price somehow. All right. And the reason why there's so many fucking cows shitting and farting into the fucking air is because there's so many people. The problem, time and time again, there's too many fucking people. That is the fucking problem. So, okay, we all switch to these fucking plants, then what are we gonna do then? We're gonna need all this water to grow all these fucking plants. We are too much of a fucking burden on the natural resources of this planet. We need to thin the fucking herd. That's the deal. That's it, everybody. If you want a kid, you have one too, at the fucking most. So you know you're not creating more people than there is you. Right? But that workout, no, that wouldn't work out because then they both have two than you.

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       Two people and the who then go create two each. Now it keeps getting bigger. One Kid, right? Everybody has one kid, two creates one and another to meet and they create one. That's the only way to reverse. Fuck our way out of this thing. And if you never have kids, you ought to get some sort of massive tax break. Um, I think that that's what you should do. So then scientists don't have to sit around and like, you know, well, you know, at some point there's going to be no more state cause there's gonna be too many fucking people. You know, I don't wanna live on a planet with no steak, you know, and I would like to go back to just the way cow has just sort of ran around chickens ran around then every, I don't know where he just gave me all right there for it as opposed to I having miserable lives, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:48:13       I don't know. Anyways, let's blow ahead. I don't know how I feel about the whole fuck. I fucking love animals and I hate when people torture them and treat them like shit and all that. I also like eating them. I love chicken. I love steaks. I love fish. I like all that shit. So like, you know, if we could just get somebody to get out from underneath these corporation cons and just get everybody on the same page and be like, look, this is what we're doing. Okay, this is the problem. This is what everybody needs to do to try to at least keep it at bay, you know? But there's none of that, you know what I mean? It's just this, I don't know. It doesn't come from the right fucking people. All right. Getting through college. Fuck a Mr Burr. Um, how do I get through this college shit.

Speaker 2:          00:48:56       I'm currently taking anatomy and physiology one in the summer since they failed it and it fucking blows ass. But why are you taking it? Did you ever feel like when you were going to college, you just couldn't do it because maybe there was that one class that was impossible to pass? If so, how did you get through it? You know, it's hard for me to even imagine passing this class ever getting a, I didn't know what that it, I can't even say at k I n. E s I ology kinesiology degree. Same kinesiology. Sam Kinison degree. Thanks by the way. Uh, I saw on your Wikipedia page that you died and I felt horrible. I know you don't care, but just thought I'd tell you. Oh, you know. Well, that's good. Well, I guess I don't have to pay taxes this year. Um, anyways. Uh, all right. Do you ever think that you're in the wrong major or maybe you're in the wrong school?

Speaker 2:          00:49:56       Like life shouldn't be that fucking hard dude. It's not like you're dumb if you taking these kinds of classes. Um, I would say that, um, the turning point in my college career was when I decided that I wanted to be a standup comedian and, um, I still wanted to get a college degree for whatever reason. It was important to my parents and I don't know, I just want to be a college graduate. I don't know why. Um, so I got out of the college I was at and I transferred to Emerson College, which was more of a performance school and people made movies and it was acting and radio and all of this shit. And, uh, all of a sudden my grades went up cause I was doing shit that I was into, um, there, but there was a couple of fucking classes that just sucked.

Speaker 2:          00:50:50       There's always going to be a couple of those. How do you get through, you know what you do? Don't blow it off cause if it's already hard, you get three days behind in that thing. It's, it's going to be like being a month behind four years. So what I would do is I would just stay on that shit and just be like, all right. Plus Dude, this taken over the summer as a joke. Dude, it's practically impossible. You know, I was so old by the time I fucking graduated college, like Matt transferred to Emerson. I was like, I forget, I was almost 23 years old and I was still just beginning my sophomore year. I transferred there in January of whatever year. Um, by December of the following year I had done three years of college. I just fucking, I just, I just said fuck this. And I did. I finished my sophomore year, the January to April.

Speaker 2:          00:51:43       And then in the summer I picked up a semester. So I finished that. Then the next year was my junior year and then I went to summer school again, picked up another semester. And then the following fall was my second semester, my senior year. And that was it. I gave it the old right there, Fred and fucking out of here. But what you have to do is when you're going straight through like that, or if you're doing like the summertime shit is, you got to stay on it. Just treat it like a fucking job. It's actually a good exercise. It's something that sucks. It's something that you hate and you just, you know, rather than running from just turn around and face it and get through it if this is the degree you want. Um, but sometimes if it's that fucking hard, it means that you're a square peg trying to go into a round hole and you need to go after what you really want to fucking do. Cause you know, when you do what you want to do, you have a passion for it and it's, it's easy. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:52:34       cheap hill. That was original. Well, whatever that, that it fit, that advice fit. Alright. Would you consider a Vegas residency, a deer country, McCann face at this point in your career? If offered, would you accept a comedy residency in Las Vegas or would you be offended as there's plenty of life in that old dog yet? If not, how bad would you, your career have to be going before you accepted and which hotel would you like to work in next time you come to Australia? Play a Gig

Speaker 2:          00:53:05       in, uh, Adelaide. I Dunno,

Speaker 1:          00:53:10       we're not all backwards Fox. I mean, I never thought you were take it easy, your cunt. Um, what I do that well, I couldn't, well if I didn't have efforts for family or anything like that,

Speaker 2:          00:53:22       um, I don't think that that's for, I think my ACC would dry up if I just stayed in the same venue.

Speaker 3:          00:53:32       Um, [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:53:33       having said that, the way you're, the way you're, uh, framing that Gig as if it's a sad thing that happens to comedians do, those are multimillion dollar contracts.

Speaker 3:          00:53:47       And, um,

Speaker 2:          00:53:48       anybody who's ever done one of those, as long as they didn't go to the crap table after this show every night,

Speaker 3:          00:53:54       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:53:56       rides off into the sunset, like with bags and bags of cash.

Speaker 3:          00:54:02       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:54:04       that's just something that I have no interest in at this point in my career and doing, I still like traveling in that type of stuff. I do have to tell you though,

Speaker 3:          00:54:14       um,

Speaker 2:          00:54:17       if she, if it just wasn't Vegas, it just, that town does nothing for me just sitting there in the fucking desert. I would go nuts. But I do have to say that, you know, if I could,

Speaker 3:          00:54:27       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:54:28       You know, all of a sudden just get off the road. I totally understand why comedians do that after a while. Um, all right. So there you go. All right. And I'll, I'll tell you fucking town. I'll try to get close to it next time. All right. Okay. Built getting people you hate fired. All right, this already sounds evil. Hey Bill, love your shit. I'm almost 30 mistakes are made and now I work at a shit factory. I shovel literal shit with a pay loader, a for about 10 hours a day, which isn't so bad, but it's made worse by my terrible coworkers. It's a small operation. Everyone is about twice my age and for the most part they are pretty average blue collar guys. We all hate our boss and his yes man. Aaron boy, a about Aaron boy. He's the kind of guy who is always right.

Speaker 2:          00:55:19       Uh, done his way. Run and tell the boss what the rest of us are doing. Rat bastard tight. All right. Uh, he's also the kind of guy who says the n word to let the rest of us know. He's a no guff taking no shits given type of guy. He's not, uh, he's white as the driven snow and think he's Indian because he purchased a tee shirt at Walmart and with wolves on it too. This is fucking pretty random so far. Well today I took my stand. I snitched to human resources. A you fucking rat bastard. He goes, I told them how one black employee knows Erin. Boy, a racist to you. You're pumped. You have no punctuation in this.

Speaker 3:          00:56:10       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:56:11       this is the thing I, you know, I didn't like how in the beginning you just fucking played the victim. Like I'm almost 30 mistakes were made and now I work at a shit factory. Like you just glossed over all your stuff and then you saying you got terrible coworkers

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       or, well, what about, what are you, what about you? You fucking off a punctuation here. Mistakes were made. Mistakes are continuing to be made, sir. All right, let me try and get through. I told them how one our one black employee knows Aaron boys are racist and that he's pissed. I also told them about the weird sexual shit. He says like fisting his girlfriend. All of this is true and the, the guy's a complete asshole who knows the boss won't fire him and he takes complete advantage of that by making our lives. Hell. Is this like animal house is the guys named Niedermeyer. Anyway, I come home and smoke some weed because that's what you do when you shovel shit and now I'm feeling shitty myself. I hate the guy and I really hate my boss. But sure enough, human resources called me and I could sense their panic. My money's on their fire on they're firing him. Everyone else at work, once I'm gone and is hoping he gets fired. But now I'm starting to feel bad. He's an asshole who I hate and I feel like I'm sticking it to the man, but that I go too far. I don't, I'm not big on rat and people out to be honest with you. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       was there a way that you could have gone to him and just said, hey, listen, not for nothing. I don't want to listen to you dropping the n word. You know, and I don't want to listen to you talking about fists and your girlfriend that has nothing to do with the job. Okay. And then he would make your life unbelievably and, and then I would, I, that's what you should've done. You should have [inaudible] come in. All you guys should have just approached him, right? Like Mickey Rourke at the end of Pope Bridge of Greenwich Village, cause of f tape. I took off a fucking dead cop. Right. You'd just come up to him and just say, listen, here's the deal. Okay, you're still our supervisor, but no longer are you dropping the n word and no longer you talking about fist and your girlfriend around us. We don't want to hear it anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:58:19       You understand us? If you do, we're going to human resources. All right? A fucking creepy name. Human Resource. So fucking disgusting. Yeah, that's what you should have done. But you know, you live and you learn. This guy sounds like a condo. You know what I mean? Uh, just do that in the future. Oh. And then you could say, and by the way, if you try to get any of his fired, that's going down too. So basically what we're saying is you've lost all control to intimidate us now. Uh, but we'll still do what you say. As long as you're not a, all right, go fuck yourself. Run A lot. Uh, why don't you do that? You like what I just pitched there. That's like when the cast of friends all got together and negotiated together, right? They got their money. You could do that at your shit factory. All right. Laying off the booze. Hey, Billy blunts. After hearing you talk about drying out, you really inspired me to do the same. I drank entirely too much. Right now after about eight days of daily commitment, I'm up to about a half a fifth a day with the odd beer mixed in

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       a wait. I thought you said after about eight years of daily commitment. I thought that eight days I thought he was like drying out and then all of a sudden he's boosting that confused me. All right. After about eight years of daily commitment, I'm up to about half a fifth a day and with an odd beer mixed in. I know it's a lot, but I've worked up my tolerance so much that I don't really get drunk anymore. I just lose an hour here and there. No big deal, right? Yeah. The two that's called blacking out. Anyways, I was able to quit smoking weed after five years of heavy daily use. No problem. I was even able to quit using oxycotton Jesus after about three years of eating and sniffing pills all damn day. I've been able to maintain a normal life while going through these ups and downs.

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       I'm married with a kid and a house and a great job. If you make more than a million dollars, I probably manage your retirement account, but despite being able to put the hard shit down, boos has been the hardest so far. Last week I decided to jump off the wagon with you. It's been hard as hell, but I've been able to stick to it better than I ever had. I'm trying to limit beers to two a day and only drink liquor on the weekends. I've slipped once, but I'm doing my fucking best. I don't have a question. More of a requests. Please keep us updated on your progress. It's helping me with my own journey because none of my friends really drink at all much less the way I do and my wife doesn't even know the extent of my issue, which is an issue on its own. Yeah, it is.

Speaker 2:          01:00:50       It makes my struggle a bit easier to hear you having the same troubles as, um, I have was sticking, uh, to my resolution. Thanks for giving me the kick in the ass. I need to get my shit together. All right, two, this is what you need to do. All right. After just saying don't text your wife that you have in a good time, you got to let you know. You gotta let your wife know about this. This is a major thing. You're not sitting there eating a fucking Turkey rep having a fucking bitter Mexican beer. Whatever the fuck it was called. Um, I would talk to her about it because then she can, she can watch it. Dude. I can't fucking watch it. I can't, I can't do this for you. You need to have your wife involved in this and just say, listen, I've been drinking entirely too much and I need your help. All right,

Speaker 3:          01:01:37       so, um,

Speaker 2:          01:01:39       I gotta be honest with you, dude. I try. Like right now I have a beer a day. And that's the only, because my wife had some people over and they left a bunch of beer in the fridge and it's taken up all this space and I don't want to dump it down the sink, you know, I'm not dumping out a bunch of beers. I just have one a day. And what sucks is that corona light, which are fucking horrific. Um, so I don't even enjoy them. Um, but I just have like one a day. Uh, but last night, you know, it was Saturday night, I'm home, you know, I got the best fucking bar in town, I got high end booze and you know, I had a couple of home pores, which know, as I've mentioned before, there's the bar pour in, there's the home pour. Cause you can lie to yourself that you have in two scotches a night.

Speaker 2:          01:02:26       But you know, when you go out to a bar and you see what their scotches are, you like, oh wait, did I say two? I met nine. Um, so, uh, yeah, like last night, you know, I had a couple of two, three of those after having the beer during the day and I woke up today, I felt like I got hit by a truck, you know, it was awful. I walked my dog around the block and I shook it off and I was just like, like, you know what it is at nighttime, it's brutal. Being sober at night sucks, but being sober in the waking up the next day, stone sober is the greatest. It's, it, it feels better than getting shit faced. Um, so, you know, and my wife, you know, she stays on me. She stays on me about it. It's weird. Like I don't want like you sound like, you know, you've, you, you've had some Harcourt.

Speaker 2:          01:03:14       Luckily I don't have like an addictive personality. My thing is I have time, I have free fucking time and I get into like, and I am a creature of habit. Like if I can't, if I like, this is how I work. Like if I was to go out and buy a fucking pint of ice cream, right. And I was the wolf, that fucking thing down one night, I would start doing that. That's what I would do. So like if I, you know, and, and all these fucking addicts who go to AA and all that shit, they always trying to make sure that they try to make, like everybody's a fucking addict, you know, I'm not dude, I don't have like a fucking bottle in the back of my fucking toilet and shit sitting there shaken drink and fucking mouthwash and shit. You know what I mean? I just like drinking. I enjoy it, you know what I mean? But as I get older, like just paying for it the next day is making it not fucking worth it. So I just don't do it. And whenever I decide to stop, I just stop and it sucks for a few days and then what it is is it's not part of my daily routine and then I literally just forget about it. Um,

Speaker 6:          01:04:24       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:24       You know, but I don't know, you seem like a little bit, uh, beyond that. So I would definitely reach out to you, your wife and uh, see if she can help you and maybe if she can help you, you stop there and if you need more help, I would go do that. But, uh, don't depend on me because I don't have any kids and I live like a fucking 14 year old, so I'm not a good person to use. I mean, having said that, I'm just doing a bare day if that helps you. All right. Okay. S t d o Jesus. S t doe Jesus. Alright, Bill Billy, what's that red mark? I don't know what that means. Is that something else I need to be self conscious about? All right. This is a gnarly one. Um, I recently found out that I have HPV Aka genital awards and he then he

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       says gross. Uh, it's actually very common and it's just a few small bumps, but it fucking sucks anyways. It can show up f years after you've received it. So I have no idea who I got it from. And once again, another great reason to get married to stay out of that fucking world. Here's my question. I recently met an amazing girl. We have a lot of the same interests. She's a hard 10, Yada, Yada, Yada. Point is, I really like her. I'm getting treated for the HPV, but I respect her enough to tell her of the risks. Uh, she's getting into in the case, in case it goes that far. So Bill, how do I tell her that I have an STD and that there's a small chance she could get it? Uh, I don't want to mess up this opportunity, but my other options are basically to move to a cabin in the woods for six months until this is completely gone.

Speaker 1:          01:06:10       Uh, thought it'd be funny to hear your advice. Oh Dude, fuck you. Yeah, you've got to tell her totally 100% teller and then just don't just say, listen. So I can't do anything for six months other than to get to know you better. You know? And this is the thing, if she doesn't want to stick around for that gay, God bless her. Who gives a fuck? You know what I mean? You got to look at it like, well what else wouldn't she stick around for it? But then again, you're also coming out of the gate saying, you gotta fucking STDA. You know, there's no right or wrong answer other than to not, you got to tell people that shit, you know, don't you watch the person that had it told you? You don't want it. You don't want, you ain't gotta. You gotta break the chain there.

Speaker 1:          01:06:51       Women are so much more advanced emotionally, so much more. They understand love, they understand emotions, they understand so much more than guys do. And it's not our fault. It's not their fault the way that they are and all that type of shit. It's just how we're fucking wired. I don't fucking understand it. Um, it is what it is. But I, you know, if she really likes you and she's understanding, and then you're sitting there saying, you know, if she's a hard 10, people are trying to fuck her all the time. So you're gonna be going like, listen, here's something embarrassing, but it's going to be cleared up in six months and I respect you enough to tell you, you know, we can hang out, get to know each other better and all that type of stuff. But you know, there's no way I'm having sex with you or anybody else.

Speaker 1:          01:07:38       You'll come off responsible. You'd come off as honest. And if that's what the fuck she's looking for, she'll stick around. If she doesn't, then fucking lay low for six months. Lay Low for fucking six months and then, you know, whatever, go to the gym and get fucking shredded. No, don't do that. You'll get more ladies coming up to you. Stay away. Um, anyways, let's, uh, let's, uh, let, let me, uh, let me finish off this fucking podcast. What are we up to here? Hour and eight minutes. All right. Is there anything else I wanted to talk about? Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       okay. Fucking Billy red faces. Uh, finally gonna get himself a car. Okay. I'm gonna order it this fucking week cause they don't have the color that I want. And if I'm going to buy a new car or Frugal Freddy's getting the fucking color that he wants and I'm not going to tell you guys what kind of car that I'm getting because I, cause I want to enjoy the process. I don't want listen to who to bug you. Good yet with pull. You fucking get this one. You go get the one you want. But I fucking looked at everything. I looked at the January, I looked at the fuck, I looked at a BMW, I looked at Alexis, I decided that I want one of those fucking four doors sedans at fucking cruises. Um, I found the BMW to basically be a, you know, I love the German, like push precision and precision back at my kids.

Speaker 2:          01:09:02       Say that precision. There you go. But I don't think I can speak. Um, you know, you could just sit in there and you just fill the German. All of it's no wasted movement. CF, this suspension as stiff as he wants a comfortable ride, you get the seven series. Um, I looked at Alexis, I don't like that grill. It looks like Darth Vader's mouth on his fucking helmet. And um, I dunno. I Dunno. I think I found the one though. Oh, I, I literally looked at everything. Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, Lexus, the whole fucking thing. You know, I'm not getting the sick ass model. I'm getting the one debt decking debt has the right and this is what, this is what I'm going to get a four door sedan that has the biggest fucking engine I in, in the, that I can get in it, right? And, but I'm not going to buy a high end car so I can still take it to the fucking grocery store.

Speaker 2:          01:10:02       And when some fucking opens that in my car, it's not going to kill me. You know what I mean? Cause I don't get, I just don't understand having a high end car like psycho high end. Like I'm buying a mid range, you know, car, Amy, all of them seem fucking high end to me because I've driven a Prius for nine fucking years. Do you guys know I'm on my fourth car of my life? That's all. I had an 83 Ford ranger. Then I had this funny, I bought a used, I bought that used. I drove that for fucking 10 years and then, and then it burned down to the side of the road. That's a long fucking story. Then I bought a a

Speaker 2:          01:10:44       in like 96 at 97 I bought a 1988 Honda accord. Four to a five speed. Fucking love that car. And it was the top of the line, Honda accord, the DX, whatever the fuck it was. It was fun. That was a great fucking car. Um, and then I got a, then I moved back to New York, so I didn't need a car. Wait a minute. Yeah. And then I bought my Prius and then I got the f 100. That's all I've had. That's pretty fucking good. Right? Almost 50 fucking years old. I've been driving since 1984 Jesus Christ, mom and driving for 32 fucking years. I've had basically, I've had three cars, right? One, two, three, four, four cars. That's pretty fucking good. How frugal, Freddie. So I've had enough of the Prius and I had enough of it. You know what's funny about that car? Cause it's a Toyota and I've changed the oil and I've maintained it and everything.

Speaker 2:          01:11:40       Like there is a major part of me that wants to drive that car for the rest of my fucking life. Cause it's hilarious to me because I know I could get a million miles out of that car because at the end of the day all these fucking dopes whose cars shit the bed unless like you remember like the BMWs a few years ago when they were just designed to fall apart at 50 to 60,000 miles. Um, you know, unless it's being done on purpose, at the end of the fucking day, the engine block, it's made out of fucking steel like that. That thing's not supposed. You're not supposed to have any problems with that. That thing. In theory, all of that Shit's should last for fucking ever granted thing here. Thing there will come loose or something like that. But the engine itself, when people just have the, when your engine is just fried, the valves are fried.

Speaker 2:          01:12:22       And all that shit. You weren't maintained in the fucking car. And for the life of me now when you can go to all of these fucking places, I still never go to Jiffy Lube. I still take it to the dealership. Um, Jiffy lube cause it's so getting in and out of there. I always get nervous as you always see those stories that, you know, they drain the oil out and they forget to put it back in. Basically the poltergeist, you know, you move the headstones but you didn't move the bodies. It's basically the car version of that. Like they take the fucking oil out and you know, whoever's supposed to put it in up top doesn't do it. The guy down the bottom, it's, he just drains the fucking oil. Right? Then he puts the plug back in and then he's got the fucking grease gun.

Speaker 2:          01:13:00       He lubes the chassis all up, hits all the points. Right? Like he fucking knows like he even knows what model you have and where, where they all are. Right? He's just fucking looking for those plugs to fill up. Right. And meanwhile, some other con at the top is supposed to drop, you know, four, five, six quartz, oil, whatever it takes to the top of your engine. And sometimes they forget, then you drive away, right? And then we'll, then when are you going to do, you're going to go down there and they're not going to give you your, they're going to give you the amount of money that your car is worth, which is the total fuck over. Right? Cause if it's a, you know, like my car, I, I can't imagine what my car is worth right now. I mean it has to be worth like maybe $1,200.

Speaker 2:          01:13:44       But the thing is, is for me to replace it to go out by another car. I mean, I, I can't buy a $1,200 fucking car. You see what I'm saying? So I was taken down to the goddamn dealership. So anyways, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Some weeks I got diarrhea of the mouth and this is fucking one of them. Um, that's it for the podcast. I'm still trying to figure out a way to bring a couple of listeners. I decided that a, a contest isn't the right fucking way to do it. Um, I want to have a couple of podcasts, maybe a couple of two, three podcasts. Listeners come in for the final table read, um, of the year provided you don't tell everybody what happened in the script, which could also be a fucking problem. I think this whole idea was stupid.

Speaker 2:          01:14:28       I think it was a stupid idea. You know what? Fuck that. You know what? Fuck it that offers off the table. I'm sorry. I just, this day and age, everybody's gonna fucking go high. I won't fucking say anything. And then you know what? They're going, they're going to go right away. And what did she do after all the yeah, yet bullshit. You're gonna go right fucking down. You're going to fuck me over. I know things. It's too much of a risk. I'll come up with something else. Alright, here we go. Hour and 15 minutes. Say you go, you guys enjoy your Monday, you're fucking cunts and a, I'll check in on you on Thursday. Um, I have put guys, have a nice couple of days there. All right. See Ya.
