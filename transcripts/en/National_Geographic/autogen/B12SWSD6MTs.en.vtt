those species in the wild is critically
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.259
those species in the wild is critically
endangered which means that it's

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269
endangered which means that it's
 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.000

and in the wild you hardly ever have a
chance to see it some of the

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890
chance to see it some of the

giant catfish course it has a huge head
 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.519
giant catfish course it has a huge head
much larger than its closest relative

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529

the river catfish the eye is almost on

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550
the river catfish the eye is almost on
 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.330
the river catfish the eye is almost on
the lower part of its head has a very

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
the lower part of its head has a very
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.420
the lower part of its head has a very
large mouth with no teeth so you can put

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430
large mouth with no teeth so you can put
 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.060
large mouth with no teeth so you can put
your fingers right in there and also the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
your fingers right in there and also the

whiskers and so that's something a

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360
whiskers and so that's something a
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.700
whiskers and so that's something a
little bit different than we're used to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710

this specimen here is probably only

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
this specimen here is probably only

this specimen here is probably only
about four feet long weighs

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739
about four feet long weighs
 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.170
about four feet long weighs
approximately 50 pounds so this is not

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
approximately 50 pounds so this is not
