00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's the rest of the data.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We increase the force and the time it takes to go 10 m goes down.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We keep mass fixed at 10 kg the entire time.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is a 2-part quiz.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I want to know how acceleration depends on force and mass.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I want you to choose the best option.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The way you're going to do that is by completing this table,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
though you don't have to enter anything in,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and determining how does acceleration scale with force.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I think it's a tricky problem, but you can do it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You'll probably need this equation to calculate the acceleration,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and once you've filled this out on your own, you should be able to calculate

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
how acceleration scales with force.

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Is it proportional to 1/F, proportional to the force itself, or something else.
