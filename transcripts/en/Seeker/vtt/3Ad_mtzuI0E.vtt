00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.310
A long time ago in a small midwest town, an
intrepid hero named Kevin Bacon taught a whole

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.310
town how-ta cut loose… and kick off their
Sunday shoes.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:16.440
But, did he actually make a difference in
their love lives?

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.280
Hey dancing queens, young and sweet thanks
for tuning into DNews.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.220
I'm Mixmaster Trace and this one is for all
you lovers out there.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.140
Movies, music videos, even classic Jane Austen
stories all imply dance is essential for two

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.320
people to have cake by the ocean.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.910
But is this for real?

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.010
Did dance evolve to be part of our mating
rituals?

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.350
Lots of animals use courtship displays and
dances to attract mates.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.239
Some scientists argue if you look at hunter-gatherer
societies you'd see dancing associated with

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.880
fitness and sexiness.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.050
But that being said dancing is rare in the
animal world, scientifically speaking.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.100
By science's definition, dancing has to do
with synchronizing movements to a beat; it

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.539
can't be a trained behavior, it has to be
spontaneous!

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.920
When Willy and the Poorboys are playin', you
bring a nickel and tap your feet.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.360
No one told to do that, you just… do!

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.140
And humans are in a small club of animals
that can do this.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.850
According to a study in Frontiers in Systems
Neuroscience and a couple pieces in Current

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.140
Biology, only species which can practice vocal
imitation can learn to dance!

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.310
So, that includes some species of parrot,
some cockatoos, the California sea lion, and

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.539
Asian elephants… among others.

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.829
All these animals can imitate and have all
been observed "dancing" to a beat.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.170
Not well… but they can.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.930
Humans on the other hand, we're the dancing
machines of the animal kingdom!

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.429
You might think Peter, you suck, but trust
me, you can dance.

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.770
You're 9 Ladies Dancing and 10 Lords-a-Leaping
above animals … they are the loneliest number.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.659
And that's good, according to a study in Evolution
of Human Behavior, when humans synchronize

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.989
our motions, it raises our pain threshold
by releasing endorphins -- feel good brain

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:56.899
chemicals -- and this also encourages social
closeness!

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.429
This happens even without music… other research
has been done with rowing teams!

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.989
And a study from Plos Genetics even identified
two genes associated with creative dancing

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:08.600
and paired that with a need for social communication!

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.660
But, just because you have a chance do your
dance at the Space Jam, doesn't mean something

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.049
happened and you're head over heels, or that
you're an MF Starboy, amirite?

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.069
Or put another way, dancing doesn't automatically
equal romancing…

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.480
Music plays a big part too.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.000
Tons of studies show listening to music triggers
a flood of reward chemicals in the brain -- making

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.040
us feel happy!

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.400
And when it comes to mating, "music," argues
author Daniel Levitin, "would insinuate itself

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.349
into the mind of a potential mate."

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.560
implying this sick beat turns into a sexual
earworm…

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.230
So, putting all this together: music makes
us feel good, synching behaviors makes us

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.939
feel good and adds social closeness, and dancing
is associated with sexiness and fitness…

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.000
It seems like dancing to the music is a pleasure
double-whammy!

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.780
If you can do that, you're well on your way
to the bedroom hymns.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.749
The problem here is no one knows why dancing
makes us feel this way, we just know it does.

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:08.379
Hopefully, we do more research on this because
Please tell me something, I need answers man,

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.739
I wish there was a "more research is needed
song…"

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.290

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.310
All dancing and mating aside, do animals even
like music?

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.650
Find out here.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.700
How many song lyrics did you hear in this
video?

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.819
List them in the comments.
