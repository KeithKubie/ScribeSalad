00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.370
In the last video
on quasars, I think

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.800
I sparked some interest when I
threw out the idea of the Milky

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.440
Way galaxy actually
colliding with the Andromeda

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.010
galaxy, which people think will
happen in 3 to 5 billion years.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.260
And I threw out in
the context of maybe,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.020
maybe the super
massive black holes

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.777
at the core, the galactic
cores of each of those galaxies

00:00:21.777 --> 00:00:23.860
will start getting a little
bit more material when

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.530
that collision happens, and
maybe quasars will happen.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.072
I don't know.

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:29.405
But given the interest in
that, what I wanted to do here

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:31.860
is kind of an unconventional
thing for the Khan Academy,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.944
and actually show a video.

00:00:32.944 --> 00:00:34.401
And before I play
the video, I have

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.065
to give credit
where credit is due.

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:39.320
This is a supercomputer
simulation made at the National

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.210
Center for Supercomputing
Applications in NASA,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.460
and it's by B.
Robertson of Caltech

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.100
and L. Hernquist of
Harvard University.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.934
And what I want you to remember,
this is super sped up in time.

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:52.600
Just to give an idea,
the amount of time

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.470
it takes for a star about
as far away as the sun

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.610
to make one orbit
around the galactic core

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.730
is 250 million years.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.060
And you're going to see
that this is happening

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.970
multiple times over the
course of this video.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.754
So this video is actually
spanning billions of years.

00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:10.670
But when you actually
speed up time like that,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.130
you'll see that it
really gives you

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.570
a sense of the actual dynamics
of these interactions.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.820
The other thing I want to
talk about before I actually

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.640
start the video is
to make you realize

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.510
that when we talk about
galaxies colliding,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.830
it doesn't mean that
the stars are colliding.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.000
In fact, there are going
to be very few stars that

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.708
actually collide.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:28.372
The probability of a star
star collision is very low.

00:01:28.372 --> 00:01:29.830
And that's because
we learned, when

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.780
we learned about
interstellar scale,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.080
that there's mostly free
space in between stars.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.740
The closest star to us
is 4.2 light years away.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.430
And that's roughly 30 million
times the diameter of the sun.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.490
So you have a lot more free
space than star space, or even

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.290
solar system space.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.220
So let's start up
this animation.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.214
It's pretty amazing.

00:01:51.214 --> 00:01:52.880
And what you're gonna
see here, so these

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.130
are just the-- obviously--
so one rotation is actually

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.980
250 million years, give or take.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.060
But now you see these
stars right here

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.210
are starting to get
attracted to this core,

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.004
and then they're actually
attracted to that core.

00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:06.420
and then some of
the stuff in that

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.650
core was attracted to
those stars, and they get

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.199
pulled away.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.920
That was the first pass
of these two galaxies.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.300
Some stuff is just being thrown
off into intergalactic space.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.990
And you might worry maybe
that'll happen to the Earth,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.950
and there's some
probability that it

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.616
would happen to the
Earth, but it really

00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:22.950
wouldn't affect what
happens within those stars'

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.805
solar systems.

00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:25.930
This is happening so slow,
you wouldn't feel, like,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.160
some type of acceleration,
or something.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.680
And then this is
the second pass.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.094
So they passed one pass.

00:02:31.094 --> 00:02:32.510
And once again,
we're doing this--

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.430
this is occurring over
hundreds of millions,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.490
or billions of years.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.337
And on the second pass, they
finally are able to merge.

00:02:39.337 --> 00:02:40.920
And all of these
interactions are just

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.420
through the gravity over
interstellar-- almost

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.220
you could call it
intergalactic distances.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.110
You can see they
merge into what could

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.229
be called as a Milkomeda,
or maybe the Andromedy Way.

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.770
I don't know.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.227
Whatever you want to call it.

00:02:53.227 --> 00:02:55.310
But even though they've
merged, a lot of the stuff

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.180
has still been thrown off
into intergalactic space.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.670
But this is a pretty
amazing animation to me.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.370
One, it's amazing to think
about how this could happen over

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.680
galactic space scales
and time scales,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.894
but it's also pretty neat
how a supercomputer can

00:03:11.894 --> 00:03:13.560
do all of the
computations to figure out

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.560
what every particle, which
is really a star, cluster

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.350
of stars, or group of stars
is actually doing to actually

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.570
give us a sense of the
actual dynamics here.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.637
But this is pretty neat.

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:25.470
This is pretty neat.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.610
Look at that.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.250
I mean, these are--
every little dot

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.800
is whole groups of stars,
thousands of stars,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.350
potentially.
