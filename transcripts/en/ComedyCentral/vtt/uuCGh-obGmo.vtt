 DC.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:11.377
Should be called
Desperate Clams.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.079 size:88% position:44%
  That's what DC is.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:14.747 size:84% position:42%
  I mean, not a hot
  one in the bunch.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.084 size:88% position:44%
 You gotta go all the way to
 Annapolis to find any puss.

  Hey, hey, ho, ho!

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:24.891 align:start position:0%

 traffic, way more than normal.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.859 align:start size:88% position:13%
 These people wandering
 around, yelling,

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:29.162
 "No tax, tax this, tax that."

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.763
 I thought we already did this?

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:33.833 align:start size:88% position:13%
 What's everyone still
 complaining about?

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.435 size:88% position:44%
 - [Donald] So many hippies.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:36.736
 Hey!

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.105 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Excuse me, you old
 hippie, you're wrong.

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:43.176 align:start position:0%
 You're totally wrong, and
 you're totally self-involved.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.110
This is perfect.

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:45.278
 Stop the car.

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:47.947
- Unbelievable.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.082 size:88% position:44%
 Look at these guys.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.617
 Where's your husbands,
 where's your husbands?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.219
 You shouldn't be free.

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:55.288 size:88% position:44%
  It's the weekend,
  it's laundry time.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.756 size:88% position:44%

- Knock off the
secrecy, Mr. President,

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:08.401
 and publicly release
 your own tax return.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:12.305 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  - [All] Knock it
  off, knock it off.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.109 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You don't know what
 I'm gonna release,

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.544 align:start size:88% position:13%
but it's gonna be a full
release when I do it.

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:21.314
 Haven't you ever been
 to a massage parlor?

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:26.119 line:0%

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:32.525
You wanna take a
picture with me?

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.062

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.571 size:88% position:44%
 (audience cheering)

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.840
Well today, across the country,

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:50.243
Americans are calling bullshit.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.279 size:88% position:44%

- [Donald] Typical
self-involved protestor.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:57.650 size:88% position:44%
  I don't like them.

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:01.621 size:88% position:44%
  We need to get rid
  of these people.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.089
 - Next, I have the
 honor of introducing

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.524
 a warrior progressive

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:06.125 align:start size:88% position:13%
 who fights daily
 for an America where

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:07.360
 we have an equal say.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.362 align:start size:88% position:13%
 An advocate on the
 front line in Congress

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:10.796 size:84% position:42%
  to stop Trump's
  dangerous agenda.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.265
 - Excuse me.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.166
 Hey!

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.100 size:88% position:44%
  Excuse me!

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:14.901 size:88% position:44%
  You idiot.

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:17.770 size:88% position:44%
 I'm here everybody.

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:20.173
 (crowd roars)

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.709 size:88% position:44%
  Thank you so much.

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:25.145 size:88% position:44%
  Thank you so much.

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:28.314 size:84% position:42%
  So many wonderful people.

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:30.316 size:88% position:44%
 Such a large crowd.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.284 size:88% position:44%
  And it's so great.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.351
 It's so great.

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:34.720
 And so many of you support me.

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:37.123 size:88% position:44%
  And you're here to see me.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:38.357 size:88% position:44%
 And I'm so pleased.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.292
 (crowd boos)

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.128 size:88% position:44%
 Is the wind dying down now?

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:45.231 size:84% position:42%
  What's the big deal about
  releasing my tax returns?

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:50.136 align:start position:0%
 First off, I claimed
 Ivanka as three dependents.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.172 align:start size:88% position:13%
 My daughter, my
 mother, and my wife.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.476
So what.

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.212 align:start size:88% position:13%
I owe 50 million dollars
to Deutsche Bank.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.713 size:88% position:44%
  Who cares?

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:01.547 size:88% position:44%
  Who cares?

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.182
 That's publicly known.

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:05.017
 But what you don't
 know is I know where

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.986
 all the Nazi gold is hidden.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.221 size:88% position:44%
 (inaudible)

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:09.222 size:88% position:44%
  I have it.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:10.756 size:88% position:44%
  I have it.

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:11.657 size:88% position:44%
  I have it.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.458 size:88% position:44%
  I have it.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.194 size:88% position:44%
  I have it.

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:18.664 align:start position:0%
  Just because I have
  dirty ties to Azerbaijan,

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.366
I have so many ties Azerbaijan.

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.368
 I have ties to Russia.

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:24.203 align:start size:88% position:13%
 But what you don't
 know in my tax returns

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:26.239
 is I have the original, uncut,

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:29.208
 David Hasselhoff video
 of him eating a burger

00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:30.243
 off the floor.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.178
 Remember that?

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:34.113
 Remember that?

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.449 align:start size:88% position:13%
So if we want to
release the tax returns,

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.383
 we can do it.

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:38.618 size:88% position:44%
  Boys, let's get the taxes.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.620
Where are they?

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:45.024
Aren't you glad I'm not
in Mar a Lago today?

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:46.626
So we have these taxes,

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.361
and we're going to release them.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:49.862
 And I want you to know

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:52.265 size:84% position:42%
  that everyone can
  look at them now.

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.066 size:88% position:44%
 And we're all equal, right?

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.768 size:88% position:44%
 So let's release them boys!

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:57.803 size:88% position:44%
  Release the taxes.

00:03:57.836 --> 00:03:59.272
 There we go.

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:00.373
 There we go.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:02.208
 Releasing the taxes.

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:04.744
I told Jerry to shred my taxes,

00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:10.083 align:start size:88% position:13%
but I thought 'shred'
was Yiddish for collate.

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:15.087 align:start position:0%
 We're going to make
 America great again, folks.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.789 size:88% position:44%
  Thank you so much!

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:18.090
 - [Crowd] Lock him up!

00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:19.125
 Lock him up!
