JOSH BERNSTEIN: My name's
Josh Bernstein.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.240
I am a Brooklyn-based journalist
and author, and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.650
I've been writing about beer,
food, spirits, and travel in

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.680
New York City for about,
gosh, 12 years now.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.540
And that really wasn't my
original career trajectory.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.870
I didn't really end up wanting
to come to New York

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.900
City to be a writer.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.535
But after I graduated college,
I went on a road trip across

00:00:24.535 --> 00:00:25.220
the country.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.940
And it was one of those failed
collegiate road trips.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.040
I ended up getting dropped
off in the middle of

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.430
Great Falls, Montana.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.930
And which was really poetic--

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.820
first day of fall.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.830
So being 21 years old, I was
like, this is awesome.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.370
And so, the rest of my life
is in front of me.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.990
But I didn't really
know what to do.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.770
And so, I had two choices--

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.300
I could call friends in--

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.810
where was it--

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.900
they were in Albuquerque,
and friends in Boulder.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.535
So my friends in Boulder picked
up the phone first, and

00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:49.700
I went there for a few weeks.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.970
But living in someone's
basement, drinking beer all

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.670
day long is awesome, but
also not really a

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.470
great career path.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.195
And so my friend in New York
City called me up, and he's

00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:00.000
like, Josh, we got a spare
bedroom in Astoria.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.630
Do you want to come live there
for free for two months?

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.560
And I was like, sure.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.130
So I got on a bus, travelled
across the country.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.660
And then got to Astoria.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.130
And then I didn't really
know what I was

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.090
going to do, either.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.670
I went to school.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.910
I had a magazine journalism
degree, but that doesn't

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.240
really mean anything at all.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.590
And really, it means you've
graduated from college.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.170
And then, as I quickly found
out, a journalism degree

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.550
didn't really matter worth
a darn in New York.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.050
I went to Ohio University,
which is supposed to be a

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.500
prestigious journalism school.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.450
But in New York, people are just
like, I don't really care

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.980
what you did, Ohio boy.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.690
And so I temped.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.260
And I temped, and I temped,
and I temped for, gosh,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.110
several years.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.390
I was a temp receptionist,
then I was--

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.420
well, back track a little bit.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.250
Do you want the real story?

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.730
So basically, it's mildly
embarrassing, but it's like

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.180
the foolhardy choices you make
when you're in early 20's.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.200
And so I got a job at "American
Baby" magazine for a

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.980
few months, basically
filing papers.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.730
And so I was like, journalism,
"American

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.790
Baby," this is great.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.310
But it wasn't very
rewarding at all.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.080
And so at the time, my friend
was working for a porn

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.200
publishing company.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.470
And he was like, Josh, do you
want to work at this porn

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.770
publishing company
as an editor?

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.280
And I was like, why
the hell not?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.720
I'm 22 years old.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.250
So I spent the next eight months
working for a porn

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.480
publisher, which, I mean, the
initial hilarity of it all

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.420
kind of fell away.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.700
I mean, the job was built
on three parts.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.100
One was about--

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.930
there was a magazine, "Hot
Chocolate" and "Cuddles." One

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.000
was young black girls.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.340
One was young white girls.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.790
So I was in charge of
interviewing porn stars.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.920
And then the other part was
there's all these books called

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.440
chapbooks--

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.070
basically 5 and a 1/2 by 8 and
1/2, black and white newsprint

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.730
books filled with all
this really terrible

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.440
writing about porn.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.940
And my job was to go through
them all and modernize it.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.570
It was thematically oriented to
horny housewives, naughty

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.560
neighbors, family secrets--
terrible,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.510
terrible, terrible stuff.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.700
And so it was my job all day
long to modernize it, and also

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.930
find the pictures
that go with it.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.550
And so after about--

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.850
which this is a really terrible
job back then.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.930
I was getting paid-- it was like
fifteen bucks an hour.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.050
But I was like, I'm making,
$15 an hour.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.640
But you'd be in this small
office with eight people.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.310
And it was run by this
Caribbean woman.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.310
She'd want to come
and hug you.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.010
And you'd have to review porn
on VHS in her office.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.380
And it was just really wrong
in so many ways.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.500
But then I didn't really realize
it how long it was.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.050
But then, after-- our
offices were below

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.180
Canal Street on Broadway.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.650
But then after 9/11, basically
we couldn't go to

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.410
work for two weeks.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.940
So I came back to work.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.780
And then, my boss was like,
oh, it's sucks you

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.440
couldn't go to work.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.870
Let's take it out of
your vacation time.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.820
And I was like, out of
my vacation time?

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.080
I mean, there was this
natural disaster,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.300
everything terrible happened.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.010
And it was my vacation time,
because we are obviously

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.210
drinking pina coladas all day
long when this is happening.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.630
And so, I started looking
for other jobs.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.535
My boss found my resume
on my computer.

00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:45.240
And then I came back from work--
or from lunch one day,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.750
then all my files
are wiped off.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.160
And I was like, I'm not going to
get fired from a porn job.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.270
And so she called me in her
office, so I quit right then.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.460
Got me two weeks notice there.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.580
She gave me a severance check.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.745
So kind of from that moment
forward, I was like, you know

00:03:56.745 --> 00:03:58.520
what, I'm really going to
make the writing happen.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.950
So I started temping.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.350
I was the world's worst
receptionist, making like $10

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.720
an hour, answering phones,
wearing the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.510
same tie all day long.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.480
But then I was--

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.270
kept on trying to pitch
magazines, newspapers--

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.670
no one cared.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.510
And I really started thinking
what I was really passionate.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.150
I've always been a big--

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.640
I've always loved food, always
been adventuring in the city

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.890
to try to find delicious
stuff.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.089
And I also liked
going to bars.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.779
And so, after pitching
[INAUDIBLE], which was an alt

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.420
weekly that, unfortunately,
expired last year, for a

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.810
number of years they gave me a
weekly column where I got to

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.090
write about my food and drink
adventures in New York.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.765
And so that led to working for
"Time Out New York" as their

00:04:31.765 --> 00:04:32.430
bar reviewer.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.090
Then, like, slowly, bit by bit
by bit, I started getting more

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.480
and more and more gigs.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.140
Started working for "Gourmet"
as their beer writer.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.490
The magazine in Portland called
"Imbibe," they hired me

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.140
to be their beer writer.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.880
And so my career track kind of
slowly, steadily started going

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.540
into getting drunk and
writing about it.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.470
Which wasn't exactly a bad
thing, but then going to bars

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.590
all night long is really
kind of tough in being

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.380
a reviewer of that.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.510
So as the days went on, I tried
to find a way to kind of

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.340
happen to get out, and go out
before 4 in the morning,

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.210
because 4 in the morning
at 25 is awesome.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.080
4 in the morning at 29, and 30,
31, when you have a wife,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.510
it's just really not as
cool as it used to be.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.810
And so, I kind of started moving
in to writing more

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.140
generally about craft beer.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.100
And this was maybe about 2005.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.080
And at that time in America,
we'd gone through, in the

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.200
'90s, craft beer--

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.020
there was this really big push
toward craft beer in the '90s.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.140
There was brands everywhere.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.620
Sierra Nevada was really
going gangbusters.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.320
Dogfish Head came on line.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.855
All these great breweries, but
then everything kind of burst.

00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:35.090
And everyone thought that
this was a big trend

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.350
that was going away.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.180
And that craft beer is just
another fly-by-night fad.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.150
But what started happening in
the early 2000s was people

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.980
came into it with much
better business plans

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.140
that, instead of--

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.540
and the market was really
flooded with all this extra

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.330
equipment, because everyone that
failed, they spent all

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.305
their money on really great
equipment, and then they

00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:54.430
didn't need it anymore.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.610
And so all these better
entrepreneurs bought all this

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.080
used equipment with the lower
barrier to entry.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.420
And so craft beer really started
taking off all across

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.870
the country.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.720
And so I started writing
about it.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.810
And then, what I soon found
out about what I really

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.370
enjoyed about writing about
craft beer is that you get in

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.870
on honest story from people.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.750
I mean, when I was younger,
I used to do celebrity

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.650
journalism, too.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.570
You'd have to do dumb stuff that
sounds really great, like

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.430
interviewing Hugh Hefner,
the guys from "Jackass."

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.050
Which, ostensibly,
is a dream thing.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.620
But the more I did that, the
more I realized that you would

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.860
never really get true
conversations with people.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.950
And there was really
just a lot of--

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.100
it was like going to do an
interview, and having--

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.260
pushing a button, and people
will recite everything to you.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.360
And it was really
disheartening.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.515
I mean, as someone that really
wanted to talk to people, get

00:06:36.515 --> 00:06:39.120
great conversations, and tell
their stories, it just--

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.010
it never worked out.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.490
And so what I found with craft
beer, though, is craft brewing

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.890
is such a passionate industry.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.640
It's something that's really
about-- it's your personal.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.750
It's DIY.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.680
It's blue collar.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.590
It's something that people are
really proud about it.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.990
And the people that are out
there doing craft brewing,

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.380
they're putting everything
on the line.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.860
I mean, these are people that
have found a way to turn their

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.020
hobby into a career.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.430
And it's something they're so
incredibly proud of, and they

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.710
want to share their stories.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.670
And so, what I started realizing
was it wasn't as

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.740
much about the hops, the ABV,
the geekiness about these

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.440
beers, and more, really,
about the people.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.210
And so whenever I decided to
write about craft beer, I

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.430
always think about craft beer,
the people behind the beer,

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.880
behind the beer bottle.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.370
And that's really what
I started focusing on

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.020
feature-wise.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.660
So then, the book came about
in a totally random way.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.520
This publisher, Sterling--

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.620
I kind of wanted to
write a book.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.160
But writing a book and actually
doing it are two

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.660
different things altogether.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.360
And you have to pitch people.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.790
You have to get queries
out there.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.455
You have to get a publisher
interested.

00:07:37.455 --> 00:07:39.280
I luckily didn't have to do
any of that, which I feel

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.780
entirely lucky.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.610
What basically happened was this
publisher, Sterling, they

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.160
were looking to write some--

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.090
they were looking to hire
some beer book authors.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.490
And they originally
came to me.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.880
They found my columns in New
York Press I swear to God, I

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.570
mean, the guy, that publisher
that picked up my alt weekly

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.872
things was sitting on the subway
or something, and saw

00:07:55.872 --> 00:07:57.360
my column and then
wrote to me.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.880
I think it was as
random as that.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.230
And then, originally they're
going to have me do a book

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.920
about stouts, which
it wouldn't be the

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.810
most exciting thing.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.480
But it was really this
great opportunity to

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.320
kind of do a book.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.490
But then I was--

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.130
I was kind of a yes man.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.670
I was like, sure, whatever
you want me to do.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.110
You're going to pay
me to be a writer.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.530
This is awesome.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.500
But the more I thought about
that, with so much change

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.740
going on in the country, and so
much change going on craft

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.550
beer, that actually writing a
book about stouts is really a

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.030
disservice to what's
been happening.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.030
And so I came back with
another idea.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.060
And that was really to tell the
story about what's been

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.490
happening all across the
country, traveling from

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.370
Portland to Portland, small
towns in Iowa, Texas.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.340
And just talking about the
flowering of craft beer, and

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.720
showing how America--

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.980
America, in a way, we don't
make a lot things that the

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.250
world cares about anymore.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.169
The cars get slagged,
electronics--

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.420
but craft beer, in this really
weird way, has been something

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.990
that's been a guiding
light for people

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.460
all around the world.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.040
You have--

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.390
I was on the radio last
night with this

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.130
guy, Yeppi, from Denmark.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.720
And basically, he was
totally inspired by

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.170
American-style beers.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.380
And so he decided to make an
entire business plan of

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.680
emulating American beers, and
making really wild, delicious

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.330
flavorful things.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.260
And you see this echoed
in Norway.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.380
You see it echoed in England.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.080
And so America, in a great way,
is really leading the

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.650
world with this product that--

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.280
it seems silly, and
seems frivolous.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.300
But what I like about beer is
beer brings people together.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.020
And that-- what craft
beer does, more

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.200
than anything else--

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.080
it used to be you'd go to a bar,
if you talked to someone,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.410
they'd be like, what're
you drinking?

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:23.970
Beer.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.070
Beer was beer.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.380
But now, what craft beer is
great about, I think, it

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.180
really helps people start
a conversation.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.390
Because there's so much--

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.035
and people want to share
their passion it.

00:09:32.035 --> 00:09:35.280
And craft beer has such a
low barrier to entry.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.270
You can spend two bucks and
be transported to a really

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.080
flavorful world.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.300
Like, the best beer in
the world can be

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.330
bought for two bucks.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
You can't say that about
many other things.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:43.870
Wine?

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.630
Two bucks-- that's Two
Buck Chuck is a joke.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.620
You can't even buy-- like two
bucks will buy a little

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.900
airplane bottle of liquor.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.510
But I mean, beer--

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.240
$2.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.270
And that's the thing about it.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.910
It's a great democratizing
beverage.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.340
And so that was it.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.000
So I traveled across the
country, and really told the

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.470
story of all the brewers, their
passion, creativity.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.880
And really, their struggle to
change the way that America

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.420
drinks one beer at the time.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.890
So the beer--

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.650
the book on beer came out
at November 2011.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.500
So I've been on a book tour
pretty much for the last 14

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.370
months, give or take.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.470
Which is--

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.480
the one thing that no one ever
tells you that, when you write

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.170
a book is that you have
to become a salesman.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.880
You stop being a writer, and
you have to go out and

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.710
actually do those things.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.670
So I had to go there, go
to beer festivals.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.340
Be behind the counter
smiling, and hoping

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.130
people want take a look.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.840
But it's really been a totally
rewarding ride, and it's--

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.090
you know, I wouldn't give
it up for anything.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.060
It's been really great.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.220
And writing a book is not fun.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.220
Doing the selling is not fun.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.290
But what's really excellent is
to see the book in people's

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.320
hands, to see the responses,
and just get

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.460
all this great feedback.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.430
And people emailing
me, telling me how

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.020
they feel about it.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.010
That really makes it
all worthwhile.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.000
The year and a half of writing
and editing, it just doesn't

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.770
feel like anything.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.290
So that's kind of it
in a nut shell.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.320
And one of the other people
we have here today is--

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.580
the New York craft
beer scene is--

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.150
used to be kind of crappy.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.930
I'll be blunt.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.270
There were more craft breweries
in the '90s in New

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.380
York City than there are now.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.580
I mean, you had this place
called Nacho Mama's in SoHo.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.500
There was a brewery in
Rockefeller Center.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.860
There was even a Times
Square brewery.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.810
But all these people, they
really failed because they

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.580
were terrible beer, bad business
plans-- everything

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.480
conspired together.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.460
And so, we had Brooklyn Brewery
as one of the few

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.570
leading lights in the city.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.350
And then we also had--

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.110
Sixpoint came along in Brooklyn
a few years ago.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.550
And besides that, there
was really not much

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.300
of anything at all.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.330
But what's really great is, in
the last few months, you've

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.820
seen about four or five
breweries open up in Queens.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.440
You have Rockaway Brewing based
in Long Island City.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.310
You have--

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.080
oh gosh--

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.090
there's a kombucha brewery
in Astoria.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.520
And then, you have SingleCut,
which is actually New York's

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.370
newest and biggest
brewery, too.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.620
And so, they are going to be
here to pour samples for

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.400
everyone, so.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.700
AUDIENCE: What's your
favorite beer?

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.390
JOSH BERNSTEIN: Oh gosh,
that's a question that

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.340
everyone always gets.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.400
You know, the easy, dumb answer
is, whatever is in

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:56.850
front of me.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.415
But if I'm going to be drinking
all day long, I

00:11:59.415 --> 00:12:01.260
usually go for a nice,
crisp pilsner.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.390
Something like--

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.560
I like Victory Prima Pils which
is really crisp, fresh,

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.410
low alcohol.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.800
And also, the secret weapon at
Trader Joe's is Trader Joe's

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.110
actually-- their house brand,
Mission Street, is actually

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.400
made by Firestone Walker.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.170
And if anyone knows Firestone
Walker, they're actually one

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.130
of the world's best breweries.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.025
And so, you're get-- their beers
win medals every year at

00:12:21.025 --> 00:12:22.490
the Great American Beerfest,
which is kind of

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:23.770
the Olympics of beer.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.990
And so, you're talking, you can
get that for $6.99 in a

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.170
six pack there for that.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.420
And it's like 4.6%.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.820
And so, I often drink
that a parties.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.820
That's kind of--

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.141
it's awesome.

00:12:33.141 --> 00:12:35.967
AUDIENCE: On that same topic,
why do we not see more

00:12:35.967 --> 00:12:36.910
consolidation.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.800
I'm always surprised that some
of these bigger breweries

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.444
acquire someone [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:41.444 --> 00:12:43.260
Seems like a really
good target for--

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.080
I'm not saying I want
this to happen.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.943
But like, if I'm InBev or like--
because we see them go

00:12:47.943 --> 00:12:49.910
out and buying other brands.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.780
Like, why not acquire some
of these craft breweries?

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.920
JOSH BERNSTEIN: I mean, we
got to-- you have to--

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.506
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah, I know
Goose Island is like the one

00:12:56.506 --> 00:12:57.690
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:58.270
JOSH BERNSTEIN: You
have to sell.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.000
You have to want to sell, too.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.780
And so, I mean, it's like if
you've built up this project

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.520
from the ground up, it's
your baby, it's your

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.810
dream, it's your life.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.793
And I mean, it's your identity
is wrapped up in it.

00:13:07.793 --> 00:13:08.680
And so--

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.210
I mean, Goose Island was
that they were--

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:11.710
Goose Island was a big
Chicago brewery, been

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.160
around 20-plus years.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.010
They got bought by
Anheuser-Busch recently.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.360
And so, what ended up happening
was, you can say on

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.750
one end that they are sell-outs
for doing it.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.380
But on the other hand, it was
run by a family that worked

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.270
for 20-plus years, and they
wanted to try something new.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.120
And so, they got paid
a fair value.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.690
And the son went on to run--

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.060
start a cider company.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.305
And the dad got out.

00:13:32.305 --> 00:13:33.115
AUDIENCE: I'm not
going to hold it

00:13:33.115 --> 00:13:33.880
against any of the brewers.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.120
It's more--

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.650
JOSH BERNSTEIN: You'd be
amazed-- you'd be amazed how

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.210
much people hold it
against brewers.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.958
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] is that
beer is no longer craft beer.

00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.590
JOSH BERNSTEIN: You know, craft
beer is such a nebulous

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:43.610
term nowadays.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.350
AUDIENCE: Technically that
would be [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.877
That term "craft" just implies
that from small batches, and

00:13:49.877 --> 00:13:50.990
that it's hand-made.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.450
JOSH BERNSTEIN: That's such
an interesting thing.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:53.140
Craft beer--

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:53.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.680
JOSH BERNSTEIN: Yeah, craft
beer, the brewers'

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.820
association, which is kind of
the industry watch-group, has

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.350
really been fighting the
definition of craft beer, and

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.510
what it means for people.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.920
And so, there's a big battle
about what to actually call a

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.570
beer like that.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.900
And, I mean, it's just--

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.790
I like to get to a place where
it's just beer that you don't

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.350
have to make distinctions.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.350
That it's just like that.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.850
But if you think back to the
'90s, it was "microbrew," and

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.850
no one uses the phrase
"microbrew" anymore.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:19.090
So you've seen a generational
shift in the way that people

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:19.650
perceive it.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.990
And what's interesting, as well,
is with the craft beer,

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.190
it's just that there used to
be no differentiation, that

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:26.670
people are like you
just drink beer.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.095
And so now, people that--

00:14:28.095 --> 00:14:30.200
what I've been noticing going
around and talking to folks,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.890
people that like their crappy
beer, they're like--

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:32.880
they call it crappy beer.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.520
Like, oh yeah, I'm drinking
my thirty-pack of Busch.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.220
I'm drinking my crappy beer.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.370
And you would never call
it crappy beer before.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:38.980
It was just beer.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.310
So there is this cut in the
marketplace in a way people

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.330
are thinking about actually
how beer is perceived.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.795
And so, by the way, definitely
how to call crap

00:14:48.795 --> 00:14:49.880
beer, that's a--

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.100
people are fighting
about that.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.333
They will always, so.

00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:54.934
AUDIENCE: I want to get your
opinion on breweries like

00:14:54.934 --> 00:14:57.063
Mikkeller or [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:59.428
gypsy that travel around
and use other people's

00:14:59.428 --> 00:15:00.260
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.730
JOSH BERNSTEIN: [INAUDIBLE],
so basically, there's this

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.090
concept in craft brewing about
gypsy brewers-- which I wrote

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.990
about in "Brewed Awakening."
But anyways.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.300
So what happens, there so
opening a brewery cost

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.060
millions of dollars--

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.470
I mean, cost tons of money.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.420
You're basically sinking--

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.780
you've got to take
out a bank loan.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:16.770
You gotta do everything.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.070
You can easily go broke before
even brewing your first beer.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.300
And so, the thing about
breweries is that they operate

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.320
best like airplanes--

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.570
like the more they are-- they
should be used as frequently

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.610
as possible to the
fullest capacity.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.600
And so, for people-- breweries
have excess capacity behooves

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.380
them to rent out their
extra space.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.860
And so gypsy brewers
have kind of--

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.750
they're finding this loophole
where they're able to go on

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.340
these systems without actually
investing in a big brewery.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.700
But they can go there
and brew the beers.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.840
And I think that allows them
to have a lot of freedom to

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.180
make the beers they want to
do without having to--

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.880
you know, you can try
a one-off batch.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.570
You can do something that
allows for a lot of

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.150
excitement.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.050
And a lot of these gypsy
breweries, they do dozens of

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.040
different styles, travel around
the world, do a lot of

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.880
collaborations.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.380
And, I think, I personally
love it.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.670
What was interesting, Yeppi,
from Evil Twin.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.630
We are basically-- he's
actually-- he moved to

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.560
Brooklyn, actually, all the
way from Denmark to there.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.510
And he's actually starting,
going to be contract brewing

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.270
out of Connecticut.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.160
So you're seeing some of the
gypsy brewers take root

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.970
because, after a while, trying
to find space, and always

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:16.910
trying to find--

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.820
that can be a full time
job trying to

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.060
juggle capacity issues.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.110
And what's to say if a brewery
gets big, they can be like,

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.525
you know what, I can make more
money selling my own beer then

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:25.560
of renting out this
space to you.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.400
So at its best, a
gypsy brewer--

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.760
it's a tenuous proposition
that could

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.336
collapse at any minute.

00:16:31.336 --> 00:16:32.704
AUDIENCE: It's gotta
be short-term, too.

00:16:32.704 --> 00:16:33.620
Gotta get in and get out.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.650
JOSH BERNSTEIN: You've got
to get in, get out.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.540
And you have to have a
distributor set up, and

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.050
distributors that can pick it
up from all these breweries,

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.560
which, if you're working with
great distributors like

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.330
Mikkeller or Evil Twin,
you can deal with it.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.510
But if you're a smaller
person, you have to--

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.530
selling the beer is
the biggest thing.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:48.470
And you have to have people
that are going

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.170
to sell it for you.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.600
You can't just go into
a brewery and do it.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.740
What do people think
about the beer?

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:56.475
What are you guys drinking?

00:16:56.475 --> 00:16:57.725
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:00.806 --> 00:17:02.774
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] did the
custom beer for their

00:17:02.774 --> 00:17:03.770
Christmas party.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.540
Is that a common theme
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.184
companies or individual
[INAUDIBLE] do custom one-off

00:17:09.184 --> 00:17:11.089
batches for like weddings
or parties?

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.000
JOSH BERNSTEIN: I will say,
you know, a lot of--

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.630
you're going to see--

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:14.540
there's a lot of custom one-off

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.890
batches in New York City.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.650
Sixpoint and Brooklyn Brewery
do a bunch of stuff with the

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.079
Danny Meyer chain.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.119
It's pretty common.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.050
It's a way for them to--

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.369
it used to be if you wanted to
have your own brand on there,

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.000
you just by really crappy beer,
and just call it your

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.600
house beer or something like
that, which-- but nowadays,

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.780
restaurants are really
seeing a viable--

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.290
you know, you want to give
your customer the best

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.280
experience possible.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.500
So you're finding that it's
pretty commonplace nowadays.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.080
You dig down, like
Shake Shack.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.320
Shake Shack's got the beer
from Brooklyn Brewery.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.140
And I think Brooklyn Brewery did
some stuff for our Thomas

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.050
Keller's restaurants, too.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.790
And so this is pretty
commonplace all across the

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.540
country now, you're
going to find.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.000
It's a great way to do
a different beer.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.925
But as far as for, like a
wedding, or something like

00:17:57.925 --> 00:17:59.960
that, you have to register
all these brands.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.890
So it depends what-- every
state has different

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:03.900
registration fees.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.870
And so, most people are not
going to brew a beer for your

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.120
wedding, unfortunately.

00:18:10.824 --> 00:18:14.680
AUDIENCE: So you sort of
hinted at that the beer

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.054
distributor network thing, which
I heard-- there's an

00:18:18.054 --> 00:18:21.408
interesting article recently
claiming-- well, it's really

00:18:21.408 --> 00:18:23.280
the road to high barrier
to entry.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.100
But it was saying it also helps
protect the distribution

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.389
channel for small breweries.

00:18:28.389 --> 00:18:31.742
If we didn't have the regulation
with all the

00:18:31.742 --> 00:18:34.616
distributors, that it would be
really be harder to get your

00:18:34.616 --> 00:18:37.020
beer into stores.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.050
But of course, barriers to
entry are often that, so

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:40.530
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.795
So do you think it's
good or not?

00:18:42.795 --> 00:18:44.060
AUDIENCE: All you have to do is
watch where the lobbyist's

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.122
money is coming from.

00:18:45.122 --> 00:18:46.930
It's not coming from
the little guys.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.660
JOSH BERNSTEIN: So the barriers
to entry can be--

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.980
the barriers to entry to
get your-- to go with a

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.700
distribution chain can
be really crazy.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.310
One of the great things is, for
smaller breweries, you're

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:56.150
able to do--

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.630
I think it's up to--

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.530
I can't remember what it is in
New York-- where you're able

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.730
to self-distribute up to a
certain amount, so you get to

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:01.630
bypass that.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.800
And so, ideally, once you grow
big enough, you'll jump into

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.190
that chain because, you know,
distributing beer yourself

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.530
gets you more money per
keg and all that.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.420
But you also have to distribute
it yourself.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.610
And so, you have to figure out
what the best use of your

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.400
resources are.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.920
Is it getting into a truck
and driving it someplace?

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.470
Or is it paying someone
else to get in a truck

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.860
and drive it someplace?

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.600
But I really believe
if you're--

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.810
distributors are snapping up
brands left and right, because

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:24.910
they want to have variety.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:25.870
They want to have scope.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.450
They want to have the hot,
new brand in New York.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.570
And especially in New York City,
I think of how New York

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.980
is kind of a weird
show pony city.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.660
That we do have 8 million people
in town, 19 million

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.970
metro area, 50 million tourists
coming through.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.590
And you can reach a lot of
eyeballs with your brand if

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.000
you get your beer into
New York City.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.190
And people-- what Mark was
talking about, where you out

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.970
before the morning people come
to New York to go out and

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:48.820
enjoy themselves.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.950
And so, I mean, it's a market
where you push a lot of beer.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.340
And the other interesting
about the New York City

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.580
market, though, is that we're
not really a town that buys

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.630
beer and goes home as much
as we drink most of

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.350
our beer out in public.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.290
And so, with the city as our
living room, and the bar as

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:04.860
our living room.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.620
And so that's really
been a big--

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.570
a lot of brands that come into
New York City, it's kind of

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.760
rude awakening that they're
not going to sell beer in

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.870
bottles as much as they're going
to sell beer on draught

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.120
and in growlers, so.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.810
AUDIENCE: Do you homebrew?

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.810
JOSH BERNSTEIN: I'll answer
your question first.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.550
No, I don't homebrew
I know, it's like

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.250
I'm a terrible person.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:30.290
But you know what, I I've been
doing these homebrew tours for

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.230
3 and 1/2 years now.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.800
And everyone's always like,
why don't you homebrew?

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.230
And I'm like, do you know how
much of my days to beer-- and

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.050
I have a very lovely,
tolerant wife.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.870
But you know, I spend all
of my days writing

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:40.840
about beer and food.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.340
And at the end of the day,
I just don't have it.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.060
And it's just like--

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:45.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
one more thing.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.820
JOSH BERNSTEIN: It's like
one more thing.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.490
It's like, I want to relax
and have a beer.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:49.950
But you know what, I've
homebrewed with friends

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.990
before, and it's pretty
awesome, but I just--

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.900
I'm not doing it right now.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.630
But it does, it makes
me seem like a bad

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.350
person to some people.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.370
You're not really authentic.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.120
It's truly is.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.850
And things are like--

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:02.590
it's wild.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.570
But I'm always, like, does
everyone who writes about

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.910
spirits make their
own bourbon?

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.170
Do wine writers crush all
their own grapes?

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.350
But it's kind of like, I think,
that it's just because

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.460
homebrewing is something
everyone can do, that people

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.580
expect you to do it, too.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.240
Because they can do it, you
should be doing it.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.590
You should be doing it
better than them.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:18.900
But I don't.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.800
So, that's one of
the ways I fail.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.375
Your hand was up?

00:21:24.375 --> 00:21:29.899
AUDIENCE: So between a good
craft beer [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:29.899 --> 00:21:32.304
Have you seen this happening for
other foods, like cheese

00:21:32.304 --> 00:21:34.710
and bread, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.020
JOSH BERNSTEIN: Oh, I mean,
it's like, yeah.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.290
I mean, I can just--

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.150
I live in Crown Heights, and
I've been there 10 years, back

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:40.810
when it was just--

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.090
your corner bodegas, you're
lucky to get a $0.99 can of

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.140
Coors Light, and you're
just like,

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.240
awesome, this great variety.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.780
Nowadays, their stocking Bear
Republic IPAs, and like a

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.120
really good, sprouted
organic bread.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.420
And I mean, it is a general
upswing, this idea that we--

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.260
people are understanding that
great products don't cost a

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.700
lot of money, and there are
stigmas in a way that's--

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.540
you're paying $2 for a loaf of
Wonder Bread, and $4 for a

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.260
loaf of great bread.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.320
I mean, it's people are
realizing that like these

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.360
little luxuries really make
a big difference in life.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:15.380
And so I think they really
do go hand in hand.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.004
AUDIENCE: It seems somewhat
common, too, but I'd like to

00:22:18.004 --> 00:22:20.792
just know what your thoughts are
on limiting distributions

00:22:20.792 --> 00:22:22.268
as a marketing technique.

00:22:22.268 --> 00:22:25.895
I mean, the Heady-Topper
is a perfect example.

00:22:25.895 --> 00:22:28.592
It's a number one-rated
beer around the world.

00:22:28.592 --> 00:22:30.074
You can only get it in
northern Vermont.

00:22:30.074 --> 00:22:30.568
I've had it.

00:22:30.568 --> 00:22:32.840
I'm not saying it's not
an amazing beer.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.316
But I think there's some element
of hype to that.

00:22:35.316 --> 00:22:36.390
JOSH BERNSTEIN: Oh,
that's all.

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.100
That's why was I
talking about--

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.130
preaching locally, drink.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.570
I mean, there's a million
great beers

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:42.450
out there right now.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.110
And I mean, there's these things
they call the white

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.580
whales, which every
goes after them.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.320
Like, Three Floyds has a beer
called the Dark Lord, an

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.150
imperial stout.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.000
And Russian River's got
Pliny the Elder, this

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.920
amazing double IPA.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.230
It's almost like a geek feedback
loop, like the more

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.730
people rave about it, the more
people want to get it, and

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.640
everyone wants to drink
it and so--

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.540
They're great beers, but never--
you know, I've got

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.480
this thing, I'd never wait
in line for a beer.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.010
I mean, that's a
terrible thing.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.640
And I never jump through
hoops for that.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.430
They're great if you can try
them, don't get me wrong.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.700
But it's just there's so many
other beers out there that are

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.540
worth trying I think.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.780
Like, I was up in Vermont.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.306
I did get some Heady-Topper,
but it was a pain

00:23:18.306 --> 00:23:19.070
in the ass to get.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.220
And I was like, why the hell?

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.380
I'm not going to drive to
the brewery 40 minutes

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.470
just to get his beer.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.710
And I had to go to the co-op
right when they got the

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.360
shipment in.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.500
I'm like, this is silly.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.540
I did it anyway.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.540
But I was in Vermont.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.960
I was like, I have to do--

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.910
and it was actually a snow--
there was a blizzard that day.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.180
I'm like, I have to get
drunk in a hotel room.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.220
But anyway, yeah, don't
ever go after it.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:42.880
That's my advice.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.210
If you get it in your
hands, great.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.500
If not, there's a lot of other
beers that are going to make

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.750
you really happy.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.155
AUDIENCE: You're going to a
new city, how do you find

00:23:52.155 --> 00:23:52.830
local beers?

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.810
Do you do your research
beforehand?

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.420
Or just kind of contact
friends there?

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.690
JOSH BERNSTEIN: A little bit A
and B. For finding great local

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.240
breweries, I do a fair
amount of research.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.020
And I also go into my network
of friends, and

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:05.950
just check it out.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:09.480
I think craft breweries, in
a sense, really get a--

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.570
you really get a great flavor.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.970
The little brew pubs in town,
the great flavor of people.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.330
And so you can find out so much
by bending elbows at the

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.420
bar, and just talking
to people.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.670
So I do a ton of research before
I ever get to a city.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:22.380
I use a lot of social
media aspects.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.490
I go on Twitter, and that's
great for crowd-sourcing

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.230
suggestions, and so on.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.600
Which I did for my
trip to Vermont.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.400
And then also, it's like I reach
out to brewers that I

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.450
know, and I ask them like
what's worth seeking out

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:32.700
there, and so.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.660
My trips now are basically
beer and food-based.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.280
Which is not a bad thing, but
I try to round it out a bit.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.620
But really, it is, it's so
exciting to go to these new

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.180
cities, and try all the beers.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.030
And I want to--

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.050
it really just gives a great
scope of what's been happening

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:47.810
across American.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.590
And I really enjoy it.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.330
Beer tourism is growing by leaps
and bounds everywhere.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:53.010
And I think--

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.600
I mean, cities are smart, and
they're doing great things

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.360
like having ale trails
that are doing--

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.850
and gosh, Vermont, you can get
a punch card for all the

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:02.690
breweries you should go to.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.560
Same thing in Portland,
Maine--

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.560
Oregon, I mean.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.490
Beer tourism is really--
it's an awesome way

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:08.740
that things are going.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.700
I don't have a beer in my
hand and everyone's

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.520
drinking around me.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.470
This is like the exact
opposite of how

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:16.015
things usually are.

00:25:16.015 --> 00:25:16.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.670
JOSH BERNSTEIN: I'll start
with the Olympic White.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:18.495
Thank you so much.

00:25:18.495 --> 00:25:19.247
AUDIENCE: You know where
you can get one.

00:25:19.247 --> 00:25:19.734
JOSH BERNSTEIN: What?

00:25:19.734 --> 00:25:20.710
AUDIENCE: You know where
you can get one.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:21.190
JOSH BERNSTEIN: I know.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.697
We got 'em.

00:25:22.697 --> 00:25:27.080
So how did you come up with the
path that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.020
JOSH BERNSTEIN: Oh yeah.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.455
If anyone hasn't-- if anyone
picked up a book, and saw, we

00:25:32.455 --> 00:25:34.900
actually have a--

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.150
we'll do with that.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:40.707
Which, actually the cover comes
out, becomes a map, so

00:25:40.707 --> 00:25:42.020
look at that.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:42.810
Oh.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:46.210
The cover comes off,
becomes a map.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.780
And so, the idea of was,
it's this company

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.320
called Pop Chart Labs.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.480
At Pop Chart Labs, they
basically do information-based

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.210
hierarchical charts like this.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.300
And so, they were the ones that
designed the cover of the

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.740
book, as well.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.105
And they'd done a previous
version of this map, and so we

00:26:01.105 --> 00:26:03.550
were really trying to find
a way to maximize

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.780
space on the book.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.960
Because in this day and age,
if you're going to have a

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.720
printed product, that you should
have something that's

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.375
going to be something you want
to hold that's going to be a

00:26:11.375 --> 00:26:13.410
bit more permanent than
just another thing.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.470
And design was such an important
thing for us on the

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.770
book, and so we tried to
maximize every last inch.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:21.110
And so, what we did was, these
are basically all the beers--

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.470
I wish we could do the entire
chart, but you only have the

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.480
upside down part
of a book over.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.050
But it's basically my favorite
picks and styles, and how they

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.210
kind of go to one another.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.240
And it was a really--

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.880
I will tell you, I about
went crazy making

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.570
this with the guy.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:37.880
And it was not fun.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.190
But at the end--

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.040
because it was like totally
crazy, jibber jabber

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:41.850
scrabbling.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.250
And I was trying to show him to
do and where to go, and I

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.610
was like, yeah.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:47.260
It was fun.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.600
But in the end, it turned out
great, and I'm very happy

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.030
about that.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.190
But yeah, the book actually won
at the New York Book Show

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:58.770
awards, it won second place
for a graphic design.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.490
Which was something
really rewarding.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:01.970
And people were like, I
like the fact that it

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:02.790
has pictures in there.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.150
And so I didn't realize
pictures were

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:06.120
such a boon for people.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:06.920
I don't know if that's
supposed to make me

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.850
feel good or bad.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.810
I was like, I wrote all
these words, but you

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.490
really like the pictures.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.084
That's great.

00:27:14.084 --> 00:27:16.370
AUDIENCE: What's your favorite
beer bar in the city?

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.180
JOSH BERNSTEIN: My beer
bar in the city?

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.700
Since I'm a cheap bastard, I
like Beer Craft, because you

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.980
can buy a growler of beer, and
then you can share with

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.380
people, and it's like--

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:30.370
as far as in the city, beer
bars I like going to--

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:32.170
you know, Blind Tiger is
nice, but I can never

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:33.120
actually get in there.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.340
And I don't like--

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.880
it's always so crowded
on that.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.340
Yeah, I don't like Ginger
Man at all.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.410
Rattle &amp; Hum's is OK.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.730
Yeah, if you're nearby.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:42.250
Other things--

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:45.980
Barcade's still a classic,
I think, for that.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.170
And then, because I live in
that I neck of the woods,

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.760
sometimes I'll go down to 4th
Avenue, go up to Pacific

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.980
Standard, or Mission Dolores,
which are over

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:53.760
there in Park Slope.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.130
And those are actually where
that 4th Avenue no man's land.

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:57.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.547
JOSH BERNSTEIN: Yeah, The
Gate's good, too.

00:27:59.547 --> 00:28:00.800
AUDIENCE: You been
to City Swiggers?

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.470
JOSH BERNSTEIN: I've been
to City Swiggers.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:02.230
It's nice.

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.960
But living in Brooklyn, going up
to Upper East Side, for a--

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.950
JOSH BERNSTEIN: Oh,
so easy for you.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:07.850
For me, I got to--

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.180
I work out of my house, so it's
like, Upper East Side for

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.594
a beer, it's not exactly my--

00:28:12.594 --> 00:28:13.560
AUDIENCE: We go to Pony
Bar now, too.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.590
JOSH BERNSTEIN: You
go to what?

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:15.130
AUDIENCE: Pony Bar.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:15.790
JOSH BERNSTEIN: Oh, Pony Bar
is open open up there, too.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.670
Yeah, Pony Bar is
great, as well.

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.360
And that's the thing, the fact
that we can have a discussion

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.730
about what a great beer bars
there are in New York City.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.770
It used to be 10 years ago, it
was The Gate, Blind Tiger,

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:29.150
Ginger Man and a few
other places.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.000
But it's just that things have
been going gangbusters in such

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.260
a great way.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.540
I always liked, too,
New York City--

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.480
sometimes, they get behind
in certain fields.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.860
But New York City always plays
catch up in a big way.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.760
So I think that's why you're
going to see craft beer really

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.080
take off here, that you're
going to see so many bars

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.850
popping up, and I mean--

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.590
I can't even tell you how many
projects are coming online.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.810
The folks behind Heartland just
opened up a new brew pub

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.580
over on West Houston Street a
couple days ago, where they're

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.490
brewing a new line up of beer
specifically for that.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:58.380
And so--

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.980
AUDIENCE: Is that part of the
Heartland diner thing that's--

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.330
JOSH BERNSTEIN: Heartland
Brew Pub yeah, a chain.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:03.980
But those are more--

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.410
Heartland Diner, they did the
Heartland Brew Pub chain.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:07.205
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:07.205 --> 00:29:10.700
serve food and stuff,
too, right?

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.420
JOSH BERNSTEIN: Yeah, there's
a bunch of them.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.620
There's like six of them.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.160
They're in [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.520
South Street, Seaport, Times
Square and stuff.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.850
Just one of the few ones
that's not so overly

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.230
touristy-based, so.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.100
Yeah, but it's every--

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.580
like, every week, a
new thing pops up.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.860
And we're going to
see a ton new--

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.910
a ton new breweries coming
online, too,

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:26.640
this year, I think.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.900
Especially within
the New York--

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.980
not just in New York City, but
around in Long Island,

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.180
breweries coming in upstate New
York that are going to be

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.510
coming into the city.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.480
It's a pretty great time
to be a craft beer

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.086
fan in New York City.

00:29:37.086 --> 00:29:38.336
Let me tell ya.
