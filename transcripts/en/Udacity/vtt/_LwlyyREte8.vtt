So the results of the Hart and Risley study, first we see that all the children

00:00:04.086 --> 00:00:09.595
started to speak at around the same time. They also developed good structure

00:00:09.595 --> 00:00:14.583
and use of language. And together these findings help confirm when language

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:20.313
generally occurs. But I saved the most interesting results of this study. And

00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:23.526
these results are based on the type of family environment the children were

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:27.459
exposed to. So let's move forward with those results.
