00:00:00.577 --> 00:00:02.290
(whooshing)

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.610
- [Narrator] This program is presented

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.240
by University of California Television.

(upbeat music)

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.510
- Good afternoon, my name is Marvin Cohen.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.860
I'm a Professor of
Physics here at Berkeley

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.310
and I'm pleased to
introduce Dr Ralph Cicerone

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.423
who will present the second
Hitchcock lecture today.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.270
Yesterday when he introduced Dr Cicerone,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.340
Professor Vincent Resh
reviewed the background

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.230
regarding the creation of the
Charles and Martha Hitchcock

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.140
Lecture Series.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.760
I won't repeat what he said
except for echoing his statement

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.130
that we feel that the
Hitchcock Fund has been one

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.960
of the most cherished endowments

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.860
of the University of California
recognizing the highest

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.883
distinction of scholarly
thought and achievement.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.490
Dr Ralph J. Cicerone is president

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.270
of the National Academy of Sciences

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.853
and chair of the National
Research Council.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.480
His research, which focuses
on atmospheric chemistry

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.420
climate change and trace gases,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.430
resulted in his making
fundamental contributions

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.430
to our understanding of greenhouse gases

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.123
and ozone depletion.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.230
In addition, he has been credited

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.070
with shaping science and
environmental policy,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.223
both nationally and internationally.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.967
His achievements in research

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:19.560
and in his public policy leadership

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.870
in protecting the global
environment have been recognized

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.650
with many awards such
as the 1999 Bauer Award

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.330
and the prize for achievement in science

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.813
from the Franklin Institute.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.810
In 2001, he led a National
Academy of Sciences study

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.070
on the current state of climate change

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.223
requested by President Bush.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.630
After obtaining degrees from MIT

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.680
and the University of Illinois,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.010
Dr Cicerone was associated with
the University of Michigan,

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.090
our sister university, UC San Diego,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.940
and the Scripps Institute,
the National Center

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.130
for Atmospheric Research
in Boulder, Colorado,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.663
and, in 1989, he joined another UC campus.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.560
He joined the faculty at UC Irvine

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.370
where he served as a
professor, a chair, a Dean

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.570
and then the Chancellor

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.990
and he did it very rapidly.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.620
That's where I first met Ralph,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.680
during my visits to Irvine to do physics

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.713
with the faculty there
and to sit on committees.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.150
I recall how happy I was when
he agreed to run for election

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.690
and was elected in 2005 as president

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.803
of the National Academy of Sciences.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.300
Throughout his years as
president of the NAS,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.940
I've watched Ralph handle
an incredibly large number

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.290
of complex problems and issues,

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.863
many going well beyond science.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.480
For those of you who heard his
wonderful lecture yesterday,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.460
you will understand what
I mean when I describe him

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.833
as knowing all the facts,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.070
using sound arguments and logic,

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.263
presenting information in a
non-confrontational manner

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.330
and slowly showing you the correct path.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.430
And you end up thinking
that's the only correct path

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.880
because he does such a good job.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.300
His yearly speeches at
the NAS annual meetings

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.443
on the state of science are marvelous.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.180
Yesterday's lecture
focused on a discussion

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.140
related to up-to-date
data on climate change.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.633
Today, he will compare
successful initiatives

00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:52.030
that protect the ozone layer

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.820
and, this is a subject where a great deal

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.110
of the basic science was
done here at Berkeley,

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.430
with unsuccessful, at
least to date, initiatives

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.960
to stabilize global climate.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.751
So, please join me in
welcoming Dr Ralph Cicerone.

00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:10.751
(audience clapping)

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.970
- Well, thank you, Professor Cohen.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.900
I look forward to today's time with you

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.380
because I'm going to take
a rather different path

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.800
than I did yesterday.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.530
As Professor Cohen said, I
focused a lot on field data,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.170
things that are being
measured around the world,

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.130
temperatures and
precipitation and so forth,

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.830
sea level and ice loss and so forth,

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.080
fairly factual, although,
very stunning too

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.800
how much has been learned
and what it all adds up to.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.210
But, today, I want to focus on the topic

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.110
which is summarized there in the title

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.940
because a lot of us wonder
what are the differences?

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.540
Why was the world able
to come to an agreement

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.250
that's old enough now that
some of you in the room

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.840
are not as old as the agreement is,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.110
let alone the phenomenon that preceded it.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.870
But, nonetheless, it's quite striking.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.160
A lot of books have been written

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.870
about what's called the Montreal Protocol

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.300
and how well it has acted to protect

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.470
the atmospheric ozone layer
and, subsequently then,

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.190
things that are affected,
living things that are affected

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.063
by increased ultraviolet light.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.160
And then why it's been so difficult

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.090
to reach any effective agreement
on limiting climate change.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.090
And when I received this
wonderful invitation

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.650
to come to deliver a Hitchcock lecture,

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.180
I thought I'd really
like to try that topic.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.580
Some opinion is mixed in.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.270
You'll see that this is not so much facts.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.490
There haven't been
really any serious books

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.143
written on the subject,
but let me give it a try.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.150
So, what I'll do quickly is
to sketch out the similarities

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.840
between these two global
international situations

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.340
where human activities
are demonstrably affecting

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.310
the environment in largely harmful ways

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.190
and how it is that the
public reacted to them.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.683
What were the ingredients?

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.470
Why did the political
action go the way it did?

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.800
Why did the corporate world
behave the way it did?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.300
Why do we end up with such
an effective protection

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.870
of the ozone layer and
we're still struggling

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.360
with climate change quite mightily?

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.440
I'll give you a hint, though.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.780
When I wrote down this
title, I hadn't yet studied

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.080
what came out of Paris in December

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.130
and, after I've thought about
the Paris Climate Agreement

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.810
of 2015, I'm more optimistic.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.490
There are some extremely
intelligent provisions

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.560
written into that, what
will become a treaty.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.990
So, I'll make some contrast

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.570
and then I'll talk about each
of these issues a little bit

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.310
and then give you my score sheet of why

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.640
it's turned out so differently.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.580
And part of it has to do with cartoons

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.763
that appear in newspapers and magazines.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.860
So, the outline is I'll
give you a quick sketch

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.380
of these two global
environmental problems,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.930
the rudiments of them, and
then to start to compare

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.920
public and governmental responses
and then talk at the end

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.500
more about the international
framework we have to deal with

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.120
the climate issue and what
just has come out of Paris

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.283
and where it stands.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.190
So, the ozone layer.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.130
Professor Cohen just mentioned that some

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.720
of the most important
research on this topic

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.420
happened here at Berkeley.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.270
Certainly, not all of it, but
some very important things,

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.730
largely due to Professor Harold Johnston,

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.020
now a deceased faculty
member in chemistry,

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.680
but, at the time all
this started around 1970,

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.340
we didn't know much about
ozone in the atmosphere.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.070
It had been discovered
a hundred years before,

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.620
but what it was doing there?

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.700
How it got produced?

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.533
What limits?

00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:07.533
It was not known, but it was
known that the natural layer

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.030
of ozone exists up in the upper atmosphere

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.870
and that it absorbs, as a gas,
it absorbs ultraviolet light.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.870
And the Sun sending us sunlight
does emit ultraviolet light.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.900
So, the ozone layer plays a major part

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.530
in absorbing ultraviolet
light from the Sun,

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.980
which if were not absorbed
up in the upper atmosphere,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.880
would come down to the
surface of the Earth

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.410
where it can interact, not
only causes skin cancer

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.040
in light-skinned people, but
other kinds of skin damage

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.820
and surface damage to plants

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.250
and it makes cracks in your
windshield wiper blades

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.140
and car tires.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.120
That's why modern rubber
today has UV stabilizers

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.490
built into the rubber, things like this.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:53.323
Nuisance.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.000
Just about that time, though,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.010
the first laboratory studies
of typical biochemicals,

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:06.010
including small organisms
and cells, were being studied

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.200
and found that ultraviolet
light of the same wavelength

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.480
that is absorbed by ozone, breaks down

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.100
typical protein molecules and
causes skin cancer in humans

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.040
and in some animals.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.730
And as a kind of secondary
part of the climate system,

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.410
when ozone absorbs that ultraviolet light,

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.510
it heats the upper atmosphere and creates

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.630
the temperature structure
of the upper atmosphere.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.933
These things were all kind
of known qualitatively,

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.350
but not too much was known.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.450
So, a couple of us who were moving

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.520
from one scientific field to another

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.230
decided to look into the ozone layer

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.390
because it sounded interesting
and not much was known

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.730
and we could get going
on something quickly.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.630
And, rather soon, we came up with an idea

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:00.293
that, if somehow chlorine atoms
could enter the ozone layer,

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.040
several reactions would occur.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.720
And we had to do a lot of
sorting out to get here,

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.270
but a chlorine atom reacts with ozone

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.420
and makes a chlorine monoxide molecule

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.300
plus, at normal oxygen, the sunlight

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.640
is always hitting ozone.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.370
For example, visible light to
release an oxygen atom and O2

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.420
and the third reaction closes this,

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.760
what's now seen to be a chain.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.170
The CLO that was produced
in the first reaction

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.020
now reacts in the third reaction

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.380
and you'll see that this is like a cycle.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.280
You can add these up and the net result

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.910
is that two ozone molecules
and a photon of light

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.430
have become three oxygen molecules.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.340
So, this is a neat way to destroy ozone.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.650
It's a principle of catalysis.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.340
Industrial chemists use it all the time.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.650
It's used in car exhausts now

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:58.200
to catalytically destroy nitrogen oxides.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.170
So, we knew we had found
something interesting

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.640
and the trick was is there any chlorine

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.113
in the upper atmosphere.

00:12:07.364 --> 00:12:08.870
At the same time, Mario Molina,

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.920
who had just finished graduate
school here at Berkeley

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.430
and had moved down to Irvine

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.980
with his colleague, Sherry
Rowland, came up with an idea

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.360
that there was a class of
chemicals that humans had created,

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.803
purely synthetic chemicals
called chlorofluoromethanes,

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.680
that are inert enough
that they're building up

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.810
in the lower atmosphere
and that, in normal course

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.680
of events, they could drift upwards

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.280
into the upper atmosphere,
intact, not being destroyed,

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.290
where they could be broken
apart and chlorine atoms

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.010
would fall out of them and
then they would proceed

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.060
to destroy ozone.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.530
So, these people discovered

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.640
what we had just discovered
several months before,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.340
but they had a much more important story,

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.820
namely that humans were
doing something already

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.030
and, in the amounts being
used, these chemical reactions

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.410
are so effective that there
could be significant harm

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.480
to the ozone layer.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.770
So, they published this
in a British Journal

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.773
and everybody paid attention immediately.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.720
These chemicals, the
chlorofluorocarbons as I said,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.210
were synthetic.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.410
Even though they were produced

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.743
by only a few companies worldwide,

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:31.190
their sales growth rates were
about 15% per year worldwide.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.580
The U.S. aerosol spray can market

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.020
was about a billion cans a year,

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.120
hair sprays, deodorants.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.010
There was even a product
that delivered catnip

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:48.010
in a spray can with CFCs and
these were very popular items.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.030
They had originally been
invented, these chemicals,

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.700
as refrigeration fluids to replace

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.990
what were really some
nasty and toxic fluids

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.310
in old time refrigerators.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:02.100
So, these chemicals were
seen as a success story

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.903
and their sales and market
were just taking off.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.210
You'll see the chemical names
of a couple of them here.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.750
They were essentially inert.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.280
They were designed to be inert.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.220
They were built to be inert.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.810
If you put a propellant in a
spray can, with say, perfume,

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.990
you don't want the propellant to interact

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.240
with the perfume and
change its color and smell.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.640
You want the propellant to be inert.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.100
They were designed to be
that way and they were,

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.480
but what Molina and Roland pointed out,

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.800
and they came up here to Berkeley
to visit with Hal Johnston

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.770
to see if he could poke any
holes in what they had proposed,

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:44.240
was that the ultimate
fate of these chemicals

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.700
in the Earth's atmosphere
is they would survive rain.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.100
They would survive clouds.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.080
They would survive attack
by other chemicals.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.450
They wouldn't be oxidized,

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.660
but they would go up into the ozone layer,

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.820
be torn apart by that same
kind of energetic UV light

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.170
and release chlorine atoms
and that then would trigger

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.120
this catalytic cycle against ozone.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.670
Well, when this idea was first proposed,

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:15.220
we knew virtually nothing
about this whole system

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.260
and a lot of people just scoffed

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.780
and said, you've got to be crazy.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.140
This little spray can that I'm using

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.240
is somehow gonna be dangerous worldwide.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.120
It was a completely unacceptable notion,

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.650
but the public reaction
turned out to be very strong

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.410
over the next few years.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:35.350
Incidentally, these CFC
molecules were discovered

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.240
to be strong greenhouse gases in 1975

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.090
and, when that was discovered,
nobody believed it either.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.223
This is just a sketch of what happens.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.850
So, just like with climate change now,

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:52.500
there were very common claims being made.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.370
In fact, I gave a seminar
in a physics department,

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.670
I think it was the University of Michigan,

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.940
where the faculty basically
scoffed at these ideas

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.160
using some of these phrases
that are about to follow.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.900
I've put them all in quotation marks

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.090
because they're not facts.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.370
They were what people
were claiming at the time.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.800
First of all, these chemicals
are heavier than air.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.180
They won't rise into the stratosphere.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.460
Well, we had learned in
the 1940s, for god's sake,

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.900
that the lowest 100 kilometers
of the Earth's atmosphere

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:25.100
is fully mixed, gravitational separation

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.870
has nothing to do with it,

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.850
molecules like argon and carbon dioxide

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.900
were found high in the
atmosphere in the same fractions

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.910
as the third surface.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.440
So, that's just an example of how people,

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.650
their knee-jerk reaction, was this idea

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.480
cannot possibly be right.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.280
They will not rise into the stratosphere.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.410
That there are large
natural sources of CFCs,

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.360
such as volcanoes.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.720
There weren't.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.500
Many of us went out into volcanoes

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.300
and actually tried to find this stuff.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.133
There weren't.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.470
There are large natural sources

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.693
of similar chlorine-containing gases.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.090
That's virtually wrong,
but there's one exception.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.790
That, even so, chlorine
will not destroy ozone

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.330
and the CFC source is too small to matter.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.950
There were more of these things.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.590
Stratospheric ozone behavior

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:17.270
is too complicated to calculate.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.100
Why do you even do these calculations?

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.810
They're gonna be wrong.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.870
That there are other causes of skin cancer

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.070
besides ultraviolet light.

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:28.290
And ultraviolet light is good for you.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.380
All kinds of statements like this.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.510
Chemicals are innocent
until proven guilty.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.830
Consumers want aerosol spray products.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.900
Well, that was an interesting one

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.900
because there was a book written
about the aerosol industry

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.380
that documented how much,
quote, consumer resistance

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.110
there was to aerosol spray cans.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.210
And some of the examples given

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.560
were with underarm spray deodorants

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.400
that people really didn't
like being hit in the armpit

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.570
by a spray of cold air.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:03.340
So, there had to be massive
advertising campaigns mounted

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.540
to overcome that resistance.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.780
Yes, some people liked these
products for their convenience,

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:13.140
but the fact that the consumers had voted

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.800
that they wanted these products,

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.740
turned out not to be right

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.370
because, far long before there
were government regulations

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.240
and edicts, the market for these compounds

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.800
started to drop off largely
due to people speaking

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.220
and saying, you know,
if there's any chance

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.920
that these scientists are right,

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.800
why don't we just quit using these things?

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.090
We can have a pump bottle
with hairspray in it.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.120
We've got substitutes.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.160
We don't need these things.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.610
And then the one of the
silliest ones of all,

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:45.090
Molina and Roland are computer modelers.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.830
Well, they were both
laboratory physical chemists.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.930
I didn't know what a computer looked like.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.570
Now, an important fact
that will come out later,

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.333
is that this success story
of these synthetic chemicals,

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.660
which really were useful as refrigerants

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.310
and air-conditioning fluids, were produced

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.430
by only a few companies around the world.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.440
I'll just list their names here,

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.400
six largely in the United States,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.883
where most of the market was.

00:19:15.224 --> 00:19:20.224
Now, when this story became widespread,

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.760
I was told at one congressional hearing

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.610
that Congress was receiving more mail

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.830
on this chlorofluorocarbon ozone problem

00:19:31.707 --> 00:19:34.370
than they had ever received on any subject

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.560
since the second World War.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.710
So, there was great public
awareness and Pogo cartoon

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.180
picked it up in three
or four different ones.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.490
I don't know if you can read that,

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.130
but it says the ozone layer is up there,

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.400
between eight and 30 miles,
and it's being depleted by man,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.420
and the turtle says, how?

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.010
Oh, by exhaust from jet
planes, high altitude testing

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.960
of nuclear bombs and inert
gases from spray cans.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.990
How can anything way up there be harmed

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.040
by a little old spray can?

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.900
Billions of them, Churchy.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.270
So, it goes on and on.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:13.270
So, there was a tremendous
uptake and illustration

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:17.610
of the principles in daily
and weekly magazines,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.420
year after year.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.179
Another one was Jim Berry
who was a famous cartoon.

00:20:23.179 --> 00:20:24.370
The previous one you'll recognize

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.000
was the Kelly family who did Pogo.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.960
This one from Jim Berry, the
boy's telling his father,

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.643
you realize, of course,

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.923
what does that say?

00:20:35.923 --> 00:20:38.320
That what you're doing to the ozone hole,

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.213
what you did to the passenger pigeon.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.160
Bill Mauldin, who was the cartoonist

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.470
who invented GI Joe in
the second World War,

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:51.020
was very popular and showing
all these atomic bombs,

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.690
I guess, and he says,
oh, so the aerosol bomb,

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.890
that's the one that's
most likely to get us.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.940
And then, an important feature,

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.740
was cartoonists started to criticize

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.823
the chlorofluorocarbon
chemical manufacturers.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.680
True, the fluorocarbon industry's
threat to the ozone layer

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.930
may very well be serious,
but the ozone layer's threat

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.763
to the fluorocarbon
industry is equally serious.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.990
And this begins to pick
up an important point.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.360
From the public's point
of view, they could blame

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.523
this problem on a few producers.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.700
Nobody else, no other natural process,

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.490
was producing these chemicals,

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.810
but you could point to
a list of six companies

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.560
in the United States that were producing

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.010
most of the world's chlorofluorocarbons

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:43.093
and that made it easy
for people to say, well,

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.910
I wouldn't be harmed if
we just got rid of these,

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.743
if I could keep my refrigerator
and my air-conditioner.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.443
Let's get rid of all the rest.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.760
Then later, another
important element is in 1985.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.050
A discovery was made
looking down on the Earth

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.700
from a remote sensing satellite

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.440
and, looking up from the
Earth from Antarctica,

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.660
it was discovered that
there was a big hole

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.300
in the ozone layer over Antarctica.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.490
There aren't even any people there.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:14.600
So, it illustrated the
point, on the one hand,

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.210
that chemicals do survive
journeys around the Earth,

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.320
but it also showed that
there were surprises.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.240
And this was very much a scientific issue.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.730
And, by the way, the
scientists missed this.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.410
The scientists did not predict this.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.210
They did not understand
this sudden appearance

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.140
of the ozone layer.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.140
So, from a public point of view,

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.443
very much an element here of the unknown.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.090
This was not a political issue.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.590
They could see that science was involved.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.490
Discoveries were being made.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.720
In fact, the first people who
should have seen the ozone,

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.710
all threw away the data.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.300
They didn't believe the data
and it took other groups

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.940
to come along who actually
made this discovery.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.513
So, there was an element
of discovery and science.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.470
I'm just talking a little bit about

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.830
what we learned about the ozone hole.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:07.830
Another cartoon, this is a
take-off on Little Orphan Annie.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.480
The Sun will come out tomorrow
and then the Sun comes out

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.020
because there's an ozone hole

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.400
and all the ultraviolet comes
down and scorches everything.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.510
These cartoonists had a big impact.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.500
I cannot tell you how much mail I got,

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.403
people responding to cartoons.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.560
A lot of what I'm saying
is well-documented.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.970
This is one of the best books

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.970
ever written about a saga like this

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.570
and how the international
negotiations came into play,

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.540
written by a United States
State Department Ambassador,

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.540
Richard Benedict, who
was one of the key people

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.230
in negotiating the
international agreements.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.890
This was during the Reagan administration.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:50.880
Ronald Reagan was president

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.870
and Reagan supported these
international negotiations.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.400
In fact, helped to lead the way toward

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.120
the international agreement
to ban chlorofluorocarbons.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.403
But this book, called Ozone
Diplomacy by Richard Benedict,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.933
I think it's published
around 1992, it's good.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:11.800
There a couple of other
books that can document

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.640
pretty much everything I'm saying.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.550
Although, I think they
miss the tremendous impact

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.383
of local consumer groups.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.800
My wife Carol and I will remember

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.670
that there was a young
man, about 23 years old,

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.950
who took on a crusade of getting rid

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.990
of aerosol spray products.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.110
He called it the clean air movement

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.010
and he went around giving
demonstrations to people

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.920
that the cans of aerosol
products they were buying

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.460
were 85 to 90% by weight, propellant,

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.660
and they weren't getting much product.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:48.110
So, he pointed to this
danger to the ozone layer

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.690
and, in many states, there
were local and state movements

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.360
to get rid of these chemicals.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.860
People had said we don't
need this chance anymore.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.230
These unpredicted things are happening.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.120
We're getting afraid.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.890
We don't need these products.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:07.730
So, that was the genesis of
how the federal government

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.650
could enter the situation.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.380
In many states, state
governments were threatening,

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.320
including California, to unilaterally ban

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.290
the sale, distribution and
production of these chemicals.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.490
So, some of the chemical
manufacturers decided

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.280
that it would be better for them to accept

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.700
a well-founded federal
regulation rather than trying

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.590
to fight the tattered fabric

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.400
of 50 different state regulations.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.650
And these books describe
all of these things.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:43.550
So, in late 1987, in
Montreal, there was a meeting

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.470
that brought people together
from all over the world

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:51.520
who had been discussing this
issue in their home countries

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.100
and they actually agreed to a protocol

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.400
which became an international treaty.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:01.400
The first step was a schedule
to phase out the production

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.690
and consumption of these
chlorofluorocarbon chemicals

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.070
with an agreed-upon schedule

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:12.633
that the first two compounds
listed, or the first three,

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.270
would be phased out slowly.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:21.270
After two or three years,
their production and sales

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.760
would be limited to, I don't
know, something like 75%

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.200
of what it had been
and then this agreement

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.090
provided for subsequent reviews.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.760
So, the countries of the
world actually agreed

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.620
that they would limit and
police this production,

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:42.200
make it illegal, but they
would come back together,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.950
three or four years later,
to see if the information

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.960
still justified it or did they overreact,

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.380
in which case, you could
cut back on the regulations,

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.440
leave the chemical manufacturers alone,

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.880
continue to use the chemicals.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.130
But, if on the other hand,
the scientific information,

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.340
every two or three or four
years, would become more definite

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.020
and, perhaps, more
threatening, then the agreement

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.080
could be tuned and tightened.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:12.080
Well, by 1990, I think it
was Prime Minister Thatcher,

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.320
in London, demanded a
reconvening because the evidence

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.130
had come in that things were worse.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.700
The evidence that the ozone layer

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.160
was being degraded by
these CFCs got stronger.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.836
So, they modified this
protocol in all of these years,

00:27:29.836 --> 00:27:34.836
1991, 1993, 1995, '97,
signed by 190 nations

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:39.490
and there is now a complete ban

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:44.490
on the two or three major
compounds and a pretty strong ban

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.090
on all of the others including
some compounds that contain

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.763
bromine that have the
same characteristics.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:55.820
So, because the scientific information

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.050
kept getting more certain
and more threatening,

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:03.970
this protocol had this revision provision

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.870
that would allow a complete review

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.610
of whether the situation
looked less threatening

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:13.730
or more threatening with a
schedule for making it tighter

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.590
or looser and this was a brilliant,

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.300
and I think Ambassador Benedict

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.200
deserves a lot of the credit,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.560
although, it was President
Reagan who really permitted

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.600
and authorized the State
Department to enter

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.253
into this kind of Montreal Protocol.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.480
Before the protocol, though,

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.540
there had been international
scientific meetings

00:28:36.545 --> 00:28:40.130
that the phrase, the term
of art, is assessment

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.000
where all the information
is brought together,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.360
peer-reviewed scientific publications

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.770
from all over the world.

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:48.910
People were supposed to
become familiar with them

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:53.893
and criticize them and adopt
some common understanding.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:59.720
And that kind of cycle had
been undertaken several times.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.750
I think it was 1984, 1986, 1989, 1991,

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.480
every three, four, five
years, there would be more

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.410
of these international gatherings

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.230
with some really top notch scientists

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.210
arguing with each other.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:18.730
I remember, this is a
little bit off the point,

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.970
but, originally, the British
were a little put out

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:23.750
because they hadn't
discovered the problem.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.500
So, they were a little slow
to agree with everybody else,

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.310
but when their scientists started making

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.040
important contributions,
including the discovery

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.190
of the Antarctic ozone hole,
they changed their mind

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.690
and this had now become something
that they had discovered.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.290
So, they agreed.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.820
And there were language
problems with scientists

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.280
from other countries before, basically,

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.170
everybody was speaking English.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:48.480
I mean, before that happened,

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.930
but there were language problems.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:54.860
An interesting point is the
protocol with all of its teeth

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:59.860
was enacted before there was
any evidence of actual harm

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.663
to humans or to any living thing.

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:06.510
There's a minor exception to that,

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.500
but this point is mostly right.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.510
So, this entire international agreement

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:15.420
with binding legal
requirements was enacted

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.523
before there was any evidence of damage.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:19.700
Think about that.

00:30:20.826 --> 00:30:24.840
And it was enacted before
this chlorine mechanism

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.960
was proven to cause the
Antarctic ozone hole.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.210
So, it was really very far-reaching,

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.840
but maybe the provision
of it that was important

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.140
was that everybody agreed you
can come back and re-argue it

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.423
every two or three years.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.150
If we're wrong, take it away.

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:43.770
If we're right, make it stronger.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:47.260
So, that provision was a stroke of genius.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.840
So, this is just a
graphical way of showing you

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.483
that the protocol has worked.

00:30:54.496 --> 00:30:56.940
For this chemical chlorofluorocarbon 11,

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:01.210
the year is 1990, '95, 2000, 2005.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.200
The amount that's
measured in the atmosphere

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.160
is decreasing with time.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.180
That particular chemical will survive

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.210
in the atmosphere, 75, 80 years.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:14.220
So, it takes a long time
for nature to destroy it.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.480
So, we're not putting
any more into the air,

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.250
but it's coming down
slowly just as predicted.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.530
And the same with the other two.

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:23.353
So, it's evidence that
the protocol has worked.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:27.120
Now, yesterday, I talked somewhat

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.070
about what's observed
about climate change,

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.530
but this graph is a kind
of iconic symbol of it,

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.700
the increasing carbon dioxide
in Earth's atmosphere,

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.480
which many of you are very familiar with,

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.010
but now I want to talk a
little bit about climate change

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:44.200
and what we know, in less detail,

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.900
and then some of the
similarities and dissimilarities.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.670
So, the major driving force, of course,

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:54.120
is the worldwide usage of fossil fuels

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.010
and the result being that
we inject a great deal

00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:01.300
of carbon dioxide as carbon,
10 billion tons a year now,

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:06.300
into the air worldwide and
it comes from the burning

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.160
of coal, the burning of
petroleum, natural gas,

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.280
and the production of cement and so forth.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.000
The point is that this
is a major disturbance.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.180
The numbers have been
quantified pretty well

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:23.070
and their impacts, they're
being estimated, of course,

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.820
but the estimates are
converging on what looks

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.273
to be a serious problem.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.160
So, the driving force is human activity.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:35.130
There's lots and lots and
lots of evidence to present,

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:38.540
to show, why that's true
for this greenhouse gas

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.640
carbon dioxide and several others,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.200
but I want to skim over that today.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.590
We've had a series of serious
international assessments.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.930
Each one of these booklets,
a cover of which I'm showing,

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.330
runs to be about a thousand pages

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:57.010
and there are a
thousand-page additions to it

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.910
that look not only at the
physical science basis,

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:04.910
the one that I'm showing here,
but also what humans can do

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.890
to mitigate and to
decrease climate change,

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:10.580
how to adapt to it.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.320
And these assessments have been done

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.220
fairly carefully now since 1990.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.510
The last one was released in 2013,

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:23.510
but 1990, 1995, 2001, 2007 and 2013.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.670
And, after these four or
five dress rehearsals,

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.160
I would say that they're
pretty high quality.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.110
They are as good a survey
of the published literature

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:34.780
as probably any one of you
could find in any field

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.500
that you've worked in.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.840
Thousands, thousands of
scientists do the work

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.600
and every single critical argument

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.470
and criticism of the draft
versions are addressed

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.303
and made public.

00:33:48.303 --> 00:33:51.000
So, it's done about as
well as we can do it.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.010
So, in that respect, these
two problems are the same.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.403
They've had tremendous
international attention,

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:01.310
probably not enough, but
still about as much as people

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.660
could bring together.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.920
It's been done repeatedly.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.443
So, it's not just a one-shot affair.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.970
The ozone assessments look like this

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:12.300
and they happened every four years or so

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:17.300
over the last 30 years,
but now let's compare

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.110
the solutions a little bit.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.023
In the case of ozone depletion,

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.710
and here's where my opinion
is gonna start to come out,

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:28.833
I think the framing of the
issue has been very different.

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:34.290
I'll start on the right
side with climate change.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.480
Pretty much every time you see a story

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.450
written about climate change,
it might have a headline

00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:43.370
that science is questionable,

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:45.570
but then within six
words of the beginning,

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.580
it starts to talk about politics

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.570
and economic costs, for example.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.850
So, the framing of the issue,

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:57.840
in the case of ozone depletion,
was as a scientific issue.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.550
There are a lot of unknowns,

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.680
a lot of things to be discovered.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:06.380
There are surprises, but in
the case of climate change,

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.550
it's as if everybody's an expert

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:12.420
and we can just jump
off to political action

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:16.230
and assume that regulations
are going to be unbearable

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:20.930
and we're supposed to talk
about politics and regulations

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:23.670
and ignore the scientific part of it,

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:28.493
but this is what public relations
people would call framing.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.910
What is the first instinct
you have when you hear

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.910
about a new issue?

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:38.450
If it's been framed as a
mystery or a scientific issue,

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.840
you'll have a different set of reactions

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.860
than if it's been framed
as a political one

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.083
where you're gonna have
to make bad choices.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.970
The second thing is how, from
a scientific point of view,

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.180
do you test this theory?

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:59.180
Well, in the case of the ozone
layer, the ozone depletion,

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.433
there was what was called a smoking gun.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.910
The scientific community agreed in 1974

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.840
that the smoking gun of this theory

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.430
would be if you could
simultaneously measure

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:15.270
these two chemicals,
chlorine monoxide and ozone,

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:17.360
and they were roughly
in the right amounts,

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.630
what was predicted,
everything else was solid,

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.680
and everything else would follow.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.280
But, in the case of climate change,

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.260
we're talking about many variables
that are important to us.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.720
Temperatures, wind, sea
level, precipitation.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.153
Are the seasons going
to stay where they are?

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.040
Is the growing season going
to be extended or shrunk?

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.230
Things like that.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:43.010
So, there is, inherently,
a longer list of variables

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:45.040
that have to be measured
and it's hard to come up

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.193
with a smoking gun.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:52.140
How can you, with one
observation, or one variable

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.870
test everything that's being
said about climate change?

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.950
I don't think you can,
especially, if you think

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:02.690
about the indirect, but still
potentially serious effects,

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:04.513
like public health matters.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.560
Health effects.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.310
The ozone depletion layer
was framed immediately

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:11.823
in terms of a cancer.

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:15.650
This is what caught people's attention,

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.210
especially, amongst white-skinned people

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.500
because they're the
ones who are vulnerable.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.660
Darker-skinned people have
more melanin that absorbs

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:27.970
the ultraviolet before it
hits the internal cells.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:31.770
So, this issue was framed
as a skin cancer issue

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.410
and many, many of the
articles and discussions

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:37.350
were about human cancer.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:40.113
That's pretty scary and it had an impact.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.130
Even though it's true
that ultraviolet light

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.860
and sunburn does not
cause all skin cancers,

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:51.200
it still is a demonstrated
cause of many skin cancers

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.700
With climate change, I
think it's hard to come up

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.133
with a direct health effect.

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:00.710
You have to get into the arguments,

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.610
in a pretty sophisticated
way, to say, you know,

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.500
there are going to be health
effects of climate change.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.490
I'll give you one example which
has those characteristics.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:15.150
In 2003, there was a major
heat wave around Paris

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:19.500
in, I think, it was July,
and when this heat wave

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.300
broke after six weeks,
the Parisian officials

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.160
and the provinces around there,

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.920
estimated that something
like 40,000 people,

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.900
I think it was, 30 or 40,000 people,

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.450
had died under heat stress and dehydration

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:36.410
during that heat wave.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:37.910
And it's pretty well-documented.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:41.810
It largely had to do with elderly people

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.010
living in flats and apartments

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:47.280
that didn't have good
circulation and air-conditioning

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.200
and they were being put under
respiratory and heat stress.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.030
So, I would say that's a
pretty big health impact,

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.563
but it's pretty subtle.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:59.580
It's only happened under
these extreme conditions.

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.280
There was a heat wave in Chicago in 1995

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.230
that caused similarly pretty
well-documented deaths,

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:08.530
but for the most part, when
we think about climate change,

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.570
we're not talking about health effects

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.000
and what do you expect the public to do

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.327
when they hear about one issue
that has a cancerous impact

00:39:17.327 --> 00:39:20.090
and the other with
maybe no health effects?

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.060
That was another reason why we've ended up

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.780
with different solutions
to these problems,

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.960
at least, in general.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.133
The complexity.

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:30.010
We now look at the ozone layer

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:32.283
and realize it was really pretty simple.

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.380
There are some people here in the audience

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.720
who are working on much
more difficult problems

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.450
in atmospheric chemistry,

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:42.650
but, at the time, the ozone layer was,

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:46.270
turns out to be pretty
simple, less complex,

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.430
and pretty much a global picture.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.490
Worldwide, everything was
gonna be roughly the same.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.900
In the case of climate change,

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.220
we've got natural and
historic variability.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.710
We know there have been
big climate changes before

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:06.210
that have resulted in big
impacts in certain regions,

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:07.780
certain periods of time.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:11.820
It's been natural and,
therefore, climate change

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.440
is playing out against that background.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.140
That is, the human-caused climate change

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.280
is being superimposed on a system

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.920
where there's already natural
and historical variability

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.853
that humans have been subjected to.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:28.050
That there are local differences.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.270
In fact, we have this
urban heat island now

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:33.520
where it's hotter in the middle
of the city, day and night,

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.930
than it is in the surrounding areas

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.480
and a major source of complexity

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.680
is that, in the climate
system, part of the system

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.680
is living organisms,
plants, microbes and humans,

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.670
for that matter, whereas
with the ozone layer,

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.870
to a first approximation,
it was a physical system.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:56.910
When you introduce life into a system,

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:58.643
things become more complicated.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.890
Another one, guilty parties.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.150
I've already more than hinted at this.

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:06.333
In the case of the chlorofluorocarbons,

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.860
I could name the companies
even after all these years.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.430
There's so few of them.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.050
They were producing the chemicals.

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:15.260
They had invented them.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.570
They were selling them.

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:18.120
They were making lots of money,

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:21.730
but in the case of climate change,

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.140
to take the major source of
climate change, carbon dioxide,

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.130
it's every single user of
fossil fuels around the world.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:29.523
That's seven billion of us.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:33.110
When you wanted to know
who the guilty party was,

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.920
in the case of the ozone layer,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.390
you could point to those companies.

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:40.040
Who's the guilty party in
the case of climate change?

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.760
You know, you can look in the mirror.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:48.460
To continue, how big was
this need in the first place?

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.680
In the case of the chlorofluorocarbons,

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.433
we didn't really need
them in aerosol products.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.840
There was one exemption given
in that ban that I remember,

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.540
producers of aerosol
products that carry fine

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:08.430
diamond dust in it for highly
specialized applications

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.910
in cleaning of jewelry
and things like that,

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.910
but for the most part,
these chlorofluorocarbons

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:14.980
were unnecessary.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.600
They could be replaced by spray products.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.290
You know, handheld pumps and so forth.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:23.610
The CFCs as refrigerants
and air-conditioners,

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.560
for goodness sake, Florida
wouldn't have anywhere

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.160
near the population it has now,

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.010
if it weren't for air-conditioners

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.200
and parts of California for that matter.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.593
Electricity use in California
is driven by air-conditioners.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.280
You can go to the Public
Utilities Commission

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.580
and see the data on electrical consumption

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.740
on hot days in California.

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.730
But, for fossil fuels, we're talking about

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:50.010
more essential issues.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:53.900
For generating electricity,
which until recently,

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.710
has been dominated by coal,
generation of electricity.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:00.340
And, fortunately, some renewable fuels

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:02.090
are helping out on that front now

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.520
and natural gas, which is less dirty,

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.430
but the point is heating,
lighting, electricity

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:11.060
and transportation are pretty essential.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:14.260
So, it's harder to find substitutes

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:17.990
and it's especially hard to
find substitutes that can handle

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:20.790
the electricity needs
and transportation needs

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:24.420
of the whole world, let's say, next year.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.270
We had a nice discussion here yesterday

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:30.670
with some people over when
will we see mass substitutions

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:35.670
for gasoline and diesel
fuel, and it's in sight,

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:39.660
but it's not gonna be in
the next five or 10 years.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.980
Are substitutes available?

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.110
Well, as it turned out,

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:48.360
there are now substitute
aerosol propellants

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.910
and there's substitute refrigerants.

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:53.350
They're slightly more
complicated chemicals

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:57.980
that have a hydrogen atom or
more in each of the molecules,

00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.880
instead of just chlorine and fluorine.

00:44:02.803 --> 00:44:05.090
Some of them are so successful

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:10.090
that they can be seen to cause
no damage to the ozone layer.

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:12.350
There's some greenhouse gas effect.

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:13.660
They're cheap.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.830
They've been able to
use the same compressors

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:19.720
and cooling units in car
and truck air-conditioners

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.553
and so forth.

00:44:20.553 --> 00:44:23.700
So, the substitutes have
been a major success,

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.670
and here, I think the DuPont company

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:28.530
deserves a lot of credit for developing

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:32.310
these substitutes in a hurry
when the Montreal Protocol

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.890
really was looming, coming
down the road at them.

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:38.153
And the substitutes for climate change.

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:41.880
The substitutes are in
sight like renewable energy,

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.880
wind and solar and hydro power
and maybe safe nuclear power,

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.210
not so clear, but not to
the scale that we need,

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:51.773
at least, not immediately.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:57.310
So, people in responding what
to do about these two issues,

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:59.160
they think about all of these things.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.740
The first question economist would ask

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:05.150
is there a substitute for the substance

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:08.000
that you're talking about, for example.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.010
These international
assessments, I just said,

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:12.590
were roughly the same, high-quality,

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:17.210
international involvement,
subject to rigorous peer-review.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:18.350
Roughly on par there.

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:21.420
So, that's one of the reasons
why a lot of scientists ask,

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.610
look, we've done a good
job on these assessments,

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:25.800
why can't we just have an
international agreement

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.000
on climate change.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.040
Well, it's all of these
other things are involved.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.120
How many defenders were there of the CFCs?

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.180
Frankly, only a few manufacturers

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:38.780
and a few aerosol spray can people,

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:43.160
whereas, there are some serious
defenders of fossil fuels,

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.510
the petroleum and mining interests

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:49.530
and, more modern, these
anti-government attitudes

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.860
thinking that any kind
of regulatory action

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.840
is somehow not acceptable.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.700
So, and you've probably seen analyses

00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.300
of how much resistance there
is, organized resistance,

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:04.050
that try to undercut the
science and try to oppose

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:06.693
any kind of organized action.

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.690
There was a cartoon on that 2001 report

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:13.900
that Professor Cohen mentioned,

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:18.303
the White House didn't respond
very well to our report.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.870
There was a Berkeley faculty member

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:22.730
on that committee with me, Inez Fung,

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:25.440
who I don't think is here
today, but she will remember,

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.310
and this was a great cartoon that,

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.200
we got the original of it, didn't you?

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.233
You got it from that guy in Akron, yeah.

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.793
Now, where do we stand on climate change?

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.480
The original United Nations
Framework Convention

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:45.370
on Climate Change signed
by President Bush,

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:50.370
George HW Bush, the first
Bush, stated right up front

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:55.740
that the ultimate objective of
this convention is to achieve

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.560
stabilization of greenhouse
gas concentrations

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.650
in the atmosphere at a
level that would prevent

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:03.730
dangerous anthropogenic interference

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:05.560
with the climate system.

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.890
It's a pretty clear statement
of what the goal is.

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:13.820
However, since 1992, it has
not been possible to agree

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:17.720
on what is a dangerous level

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.800
of greenhouse gas concentrations

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.843
and then to devise actions to achieve it.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:29.140
This group, the official
delegates of all the UN Nations,

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:34.140
190 nations, has met
about 20 times since 1992,

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:38.270
15 or 20, and they haven't
made much progress.

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:41.460
In the 1990s, they
agreed on what was called

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:45.540
the Kyoto Protocol from a
meeting in Kyoto, Japan,

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:49.390
and it was never accepted
in the United States.

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:52.750
President Clinton didn't even
take the treaty to the Senate

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.000
where he had to get it confirmed.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
I think the assumed vote was
gonna be about 95 to nothing

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.160
against his proposal, had he done it.

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.040
So, he never even took it to
the Senate, as I remember,

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:10.040
but the original goal was clear, as I say,

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:13.040
and it's hard even from a
scientific point of view

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.560
to define with a simple
number what is the safe level

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.170
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:21.990
We might agree that whatever there was

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:24.720
before the Industrial Revolution was safe.

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.330
We know what those numbers
are, but this assumes,

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:29.810
and the fact is we're already
well above that number.

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.810
So, it's hard to know what to shoot for,

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.610
but now the Paris agreement,
which the more I got into it,

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:38.980
the more optimistic I began to come.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.500
Of course, your reaction
to a document like this

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:44.220
depends on your original expectation.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:47.950
My expectation was low,
but after thinking about

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:51.070
all of these things, I
feel more optimistic.

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.810
First of all, the goal.

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:55.610
The goal continues to
be the original goal,

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:58.360
to prevent dangerous
anthropogenic interference

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.060
with climate stability,
but they've come up with

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:03.830
a specific line, to limit the global

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:07.140
average temperature rise
to two degrees centigrade

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:10.480
and this is largely a
European-driven target.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.890
There's been, I would
say, more work in Europe

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:16.690
and the scientific
community to try to estimate

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:20.180
what the impacts would be and, of course,

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.790
it's not the global average temperature

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:27.660
that really causes all of
this, but as a proxy measure,

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.588
the level of greenhouse
gases can be specified

00:49:32.588 --> 00:49:36.430
as those that would cause the
global average temperature

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:38.320
to rise two degrees.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.440
So, what I'm saying is you
don't have to agree with this,

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.550
but it is a real step forward
in terms of specifying

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.683
what a dangerous level should be.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.340
The way they propose, in
the Paris Climate Agreement,

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:56.973
to reach that level of stability
is not legally binding.

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:03.830
The treaty does not say the
United States shall do this

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:06.840
and shall not do that
or China shall do this

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:07.850
and shall not do that.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:11.540
Although, the word shall
was apparently a source

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:14.000
of great argument amongst the diplomats.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.270
Every time there's a treaty to be written,

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:20.380
they argue over whether things
should be shall or should,

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:24.050
but, in this case, the
principle is different.

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:26.880
Before the meeting, they
agreed that every country,

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.070
participating in the Paris discussions,

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:34.400
would bring to the table
voluntary national commitments

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.920
to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.570
and the greenhouse gases
are very sensibly defined

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:45.067
as carbon dioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide, some CFCs,

00:50:45.067 --> 00:50:47.470
and a few others, the so-called basket

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:49.470
of six or seven chemicals.

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:53.170
So, if a nation comes forward,
like say, New Zealand,

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:55.680
whose principal emission
of greenhouse gases

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.423
is through methane from sheep,

00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:01.110
if they could propose to limit that enough

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:02.420
that could be an acceptable,

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.010
I'm just picking that out of the air,

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:06.850
that could be an acceptable contribution,

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:10.380
if they could voluntarily
commit to limit the emissions

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:13.253
of that particular greenhouse gas.

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:18.810
I do have what the United
States committed to

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:20.230
and we can talk about it earlier,

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:22.130
but in the treaty language,

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:27.130
these are called
nationally-determined contributions.

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:32.370
So, the leaders of the
countries like the United States

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:35.393
can tell the public and the Congress,

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.000
we determine this contribution.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.050
The other nations of the world
didn't tell us what to do.

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:45.170
These are nationally-determined

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:47.680
and all 190 nations delivered

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.580
these nationally-determined contributions.

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:53.590
Now, the fact is what
was delivered to Paris

00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:56.520
is not going to stabilize
the climate change

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:00.580
to less than two degrees,
but what's very interesting

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.070
is they've adopted some of the features

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:08.070
of the Montreal Protocol,
whereby, there will be assessments

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:13.270
and estimates by experts,
without political interference,

00:52:13.303 --> 00:52:15.100
of the numbers.

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:18.900
Are your estimates viable?

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.840
You're saying that
you'll cut your emissions

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:25.840
by a certain fraction compared
to the year 2010 or 1990.

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:29.260
Well, how well can you
establish that baseline?

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:32.530
So, this third point, assess
each nation's progress

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:35.550
towards its nationally-determined
contribution.

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:40.210
All 187 nations, everyone has now agreed

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:43.600
that their assessment and their
estimates will be reviewed

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.720
by technically-competent
people internationally

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.110
on a periodic basis, every two years,

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:50.750
something like that.

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:55.750
This is real progress because
the Kyoto Protocol from 1997

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:59.823
did not have any requirements
on developing countries.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.770
The entire burden was on
so-called rich countries.

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:06.900
They had to achieve all the goals

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:09.510
that were set to them legally,

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:12.870
but there were no requirements,
even for reporting,

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:14.640
from the developing countries.

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:18.350
So, in this one, the richer nations won

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:20.810
by getting all the countries to agree

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:24.060
that there will be a
technically-competent assessment

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.350
of how much progress you're making

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:29.250
toward your nationally-determined
contribution.

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:31.240
I think this is really progress

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:35.500
and the estimates
themselves will be analyzed

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:40.500
for quality and fidelity and
honesty by technical experts.

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:45.420
This whole process will
be iterated on a schedule

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.500
roughly every five years, if not sooner.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:52.320
There will be new efforts
and the assumption

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:57.320
and the commitment is you
will now lower your emissions

00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:02.650
to achieve a tighter bound
of 1.5 degrees centigrade

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:04.350
on the global average temperature.

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:09.340
Something that the poorer
nations insisted on

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:11.830
is they want money from
the richer nations,

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:14.140
but this has always been the case,

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.060
but the goal now is to create a fund

00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:19.320
of a hundred billion dollars per year

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.510
that the poor developing
nations can draw from

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:26.860
to do two things, to buy and
purchase new energy technology

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:31.860
such as renewable energy
and for adaptation purposes.

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:36.420
For example, the island nations
that are facing consequences

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:39.390
from sea level rise
will now be able to draw

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:42.350
on technical help from
the advanced nations

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.020
as well as money.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:47.760
And then, finally, there is
nothing in this agreement

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.220
called Annex One and Annex Two.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.460
In 1992 agreement, that
I mentioned earlier,

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:57.130
had a definition of, okay,
who's supposed to achieve

00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:59.780
this objective and what it said was,

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.490
all nations of the world have common,

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:05.620
but differentiated responsibilities.

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:07.150
And for 20-something years now,

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:10.130
the diplomats have been
arguing what does that mean?

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:14.880
So, now there was an Annex One in 1992,

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.580
which was the nations that have capital,

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:21.120
that have technology, that
have an educated public,

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.343
they were given all the responsibility.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:27.270
So, it's hardly a
differentiated responsibility

00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:29.610
if all the responsibility was on the backs

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:31.080
of the rich people.

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:35.170
The common part of it says that
even the developing nations

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:37.930
have to look ahead and,
while they're developing

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:39.480
their own economy, they have to take

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.720
some of this responsibility.

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:45.130
But the feature of creating
this hundred billion dollar fund

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:49.020
and, by the way, it's annual,
it's not a five-year fund,

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:52.510
is that there will be help, technical help

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:55.720
and advisory help, to
these developing countries.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.740
So, on the whole, I think this is a very

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.590
intelligent document.

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.570
Now, will it succeed?

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:04.510
For example, there's a lot of discussion

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:07.070
around the rest of the world right now

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:10.000
that Obama's term has ended

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.330
and he's committed to this agreement,

00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:15.010
but will the next president
of the United States

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:18.470
honor these voluntary
contributions or drop out?

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:20.830
Of course, I don't know the
answer to that question,

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:25.770
but I think the, and from
an economist point of view,

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:29.930
this probably isn't as
good as a firmer agreement

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:32.710
that has, for example, trade implications

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:36.340
or something like this,
market implications

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:38.120
that are enforced.

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:42.030
But I think abolishing the
Annex One and the Annex Two

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:44.320
and embracing the rest of this agreement

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.810
is a real step forward and I think

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:48.720
there's a good possibility
here that public opinion,

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:52.810
worldwide, will draw
nations to stay with it.

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:54.170
Now, to trigger the agreement,

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:56.620
it's called a to-trigger process,

00:56:56.620 --> 00:57:00.033
by April 15th or 16th or 18th,

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:04.410
for this treaty to go
into international effect,

00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:09.410
there have to be 55 nations
or more to sign, finally,

00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:12.850
and they have to represent 55% or more

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:16.330
of all the global greenhouse
gas emissions from humans.

00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:20.270
So, maybe we can argue about whether

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:22.240
it's really meaningful or not.

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.750
One other thing is six years ago,

00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:27.590
at the National Academy of
Sciences, we released a report

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:30.330
called Verifying Greenhouse Gas Emissions,

00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:32.150
and I'm kind of proud of it 'cause,

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:34.300
I think I framed this one,

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:37.170
the idea was what if there
were an international agreement

00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:40.463
on climate change, how would
we know if people are behaving?

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:44.070
Remember what President Reagan said,

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:47.040
trust but verify on nuclear weapons.

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.000
So, we thought maybe other people

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.860
will take the same attitude

00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:53.650
that we're gonna have
to have verification.

00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:57.780
Okay, how well can we verify
greenhouse gas emissions?

00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.170
And so, this committee,
and again Professor Fung

00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:03.220
here from Berkeley, was on the committee,

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:10.170
scratched their brains and
looked at existing technology

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:14.450
and they made estimates of
how well we are now estimating

00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:16.800
the release of greenhouse gases

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.850
and I won't bother to
give you their answers,

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:21.870
but they came up with a second proposal,

00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:25.390
that paper estimates are very valuable

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:28.920
and they're not being done as
well as they could be done.

00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:31.350
So, I think now to this Paris Agreement,

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:35.380
that requires these paper
estimates and will subject them

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.840
to international review by experts

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.970
and I think this is progress.

00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:40.510
I think it's quite realistic

00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:43.900
and I'm happy that our report in 2010,

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.760
this report will now become
famous six years later,

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.940
is my prediction.

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:49.650
So, I think I'll stop here.

00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:51.710
I've given you a lot of my own opinions,

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:53.483
but we'll see where we go next.

00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:56.840
This was the committee that created

00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.883
that last report that I mentioned.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.982
Okay, thank you, again.

00:59:02.982 --> 00:59:05.982
(audience clapping)

00:59:08.973 --> 00:59:10.530
- Thank you very much.

00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:12.720
We're really glad to
hear about your optimism

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:17.450
with regard to the Paris situation.

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:22.420
I can remember when Al
Johnston felt so frustrated

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:25.670
because people didn't
believe what he was saying

00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:28.640
and I know you must
have felt the same way.

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.150
I told him that, being
a theoretical physicist,

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:32.020
we're used to this.

00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:34.730
Whenever we come up with a new theory,

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:36.020
and we tell a colleague,

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.210
there was only two answers you can get,

00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:40.573
it's wrong or I thought of it before.

00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:43.760
Well, thank you again.

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.843
Questions?

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.780
- Anybody who would like to ask a question

00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:49.420
can come up to the microphone.

00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:52.280
Questions only please and
please keep them brief

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.113
and to the point.

00:59:53.113 --> 00:59:53.946
Thank you.

00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:58.250
- [Man] Thank you very
much for the presentation.

00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:02.280
I have a question about how much heat

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:07.280
already in the global system will cause,

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:12.360
through inertial processes
and equilibrium processes,

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:16.190
an inexorable increase
in global temperature

01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:21.190
and the point I'm trying
to ask is, in your opinion,

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:25.430
is it still possible to stay
within one and a half degrees

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:30.430
Celsius of temperature increase
above pre-industrial levels?

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:34.220
- I don't think so, but that assumes

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.290
that the world consumption of fossil fuels

01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:40.313
like petroleum and natural gas and coal,

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:46.427
if you go into the numbers from
a scientific point of view,

01:00:46.427 --> 01:00:50.550
to freeze things where
we are now would require

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:53.740
a reduction of about 70 or 80% of all

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.363
of our greenhouse gas emissions.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:59.160
If we just held them constant,
things will continue to rise

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.020
for the reasons that you indicated.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.890
We would have to have a drop of 70 or 80%

01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:06.670
before the natural processes,

01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:08.440
that removal of the greenhouse gases

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.470
would begin to have any effect

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:12.790
and I don't think that's possible.

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:14.440
- [Man] Do you think it's still possible

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:17.070
to stay within two degrees?

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:20.610
- Maybe, maybe, but it
depends on the speed.

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:23.183
So, I mean, maybe some people here

01:01:23.183 --> 01:01:25.520
have already done the
numerical calculations,

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.210
but if you could begin
to cut the emissions

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:32.540
by, let's say, half in the next 20 years,

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:35.240
maybe you could reach it,
but it's gonna be a stretch.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.090
It will be very difficult.

01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:37.923
- [Man] Thank you.

01:01:37.923 --> 01:01:42.923
- So, will the Paris Agreement
work the way we want it to?

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.200
Probably not, but I think it
really is a couple of steps

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.350
in the right direction.

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:54.930
- [Man] I too thank you
for this wonderful lecture.

01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:58.010
I was in Paris and was
thrilled with the outcome

01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:01.230
when they announced it
on that Saturday night,

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:02.790
but I also paid close attention

01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:04.790
to what Jim Hansen was saying.

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:08.530
He was there too for
his first COP conference

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:13.350
and was calling it a fraud because the UN

01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:16.160
can't put a global price on carbon

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.900
and, without a global price on carbon,

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.300
he doesn't see how individual nations

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.970
reducing their consumption of fossil fuels

01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:25.320
is really gonna change
the course of things

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:28.790
and, as I mentioned yesterday,

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:30.940
I work with Citizens Climate Lobby,

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:35.940
I'd like to know your opinion
of the role of carbon pricing

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.640
in trying to achieve
these very ambitious goals

01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:48.350
that were set in Paris and
how the U.S. could lead

01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:51.570
and, by doing so, engage
the rest of the world

01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:54.193
since there's nobody that runs the world?

01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.490
- Well, I will say that
I don't know anybody

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:02.850
who's become rich by
betting against Jim Hansen.

01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:05.080
He really knows what he's talking about

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.280
and he knows the numbers
as well as anybody,

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.860
but I think how we deal with it,

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:13.160
involving human choices
and what will work,

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.463
is probably beyond all of our capability.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.900
For example, the United States and China

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:24.400
really kicked off this
approach, this framework,

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.773
when Obama met with Xi,
in what, November of 2014.

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:32.300
They agreed that they would
come up with a structure

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.870
like this and that they
would both participate.

01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:36.950
That is unprecedented.

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:38.520
Those are the two biggest emitters.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.110
So, whatever they do is
gonna have a big impact

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:42.360
on the rest of the world.

01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:46.063
Carbon tax.

01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:49.350
Do we have any economists here?

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:50.183
Yes.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.450
I would appreciate it if
you would take a minute

01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:56.520
and summarize the opinions of economists

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.860
as to what's the most effective method,

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:02.470
for example, a cap-and-trade market

01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:04.380
and what you mean by effective.

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:08.700
My understanding is the
application of a simple carbon tax,

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.900
which is empirically derived,
would be the simplest

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:15.080
and most efficient way to achieve results,

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.870
that a cap-and-trade program,
probably, involves a lot more

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:20.950
management and less effective mechanism,

01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:23.450
but I do appreciate it, Professor Edlyn,

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:24.500
if you would comment.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.320
- Well, I'm not prepared,

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.620
but it's not my field of expertise,

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.400
economics I suppose is, but not--

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.233
(woman whispering)

01:04:35.233 --> 01:04:36.066
What?

01:04:36.066 --> 01:04:38.313
Okay, I'll stand up.

01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:43.993
So, I think what you said
is, probably, largely right,

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.880
that is a carbon tax,
particularly, if it's implemented

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:56.100
at the source where oil is
taken up out of the ground

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.963
is, probably, the easiest to manage,

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:04.523
either a carbon tax or cap-and-trade

01:05:04.523 --> 01:05:08.243
is infinitely better than nothing,

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.110
if you're worried about climate change,

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:19.620
but both of them have the
feature, unlike pure regulation,

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:27.483
that you can lower emissions.

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:33.310
You can equalize the cost
of lowering emissions

01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:38.310
so that countries that find
it cheaper to lower emissions

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:46.450
will do most of the reductions.

01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:50.460
And so, that's one of
the most important things

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:55.460
if we're going to move forward
is to minimize the cost of it

01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:00.800
and both of those, both
cap-and-trade and taxes,

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.960
allow some flexibility as
to who does the reductions

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:12.960
and allow the possibility
of shifting money

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.350
and lowering costs.

01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:20.670
Well, that's the best
I can do on the spot.

01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:22.288
- Thanks.

01:06:22.288 --> 01:06:23.530
(audience clapping)

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:24.900
Thanks.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.730
Maybe I can add one thing,

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:29.300
that there are economists who are looking

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:32.710
at this situation empirically,
trying to figure out, okay,

01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:36.030
if there would be a tax on
carbon, what should it be?

01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:38.750
Should it be a penny a
pound or two dollars a ton

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:40.220
or what should it be?

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.730
And there's also an organized effort now

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:44.910
in the federal government and, on behalf

01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:49.910
of some investment firms, to
try to figure out what this,

01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:52.310
what they call the social cost of carbon,

01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:55.140
should be set at and there
are lots of uncertainties,

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:57.300
but smart people are working on it.

01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:01.240
So, that if there were some
kind of political momentum

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:05.010
or agreement towards a tax
or even a cap-and-trade

01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:08.240
with a set price there will
be some grounding empirically

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.373
on what the dollar value would have to be,

01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:13.070
but I don't think we can predict

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:15.130
how this is gonna come out.

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:15.963
Yes sir.

01:07:15.963 --> 01:07:18.773
- [Man] Yes, thank you
for your presentation.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:23.370
My concern is that if
you step back and look

01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:26.960
at what's happened since 1990,
the science has been clear

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.660
and the efforts to respond to the science

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:32.780
have fallen further and further
behind the objective process

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.260
of global warming.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:38.170
In Paris, I think, at best,
I mean I'm with Hansen,

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:42.100
it was both in terms of
catching up to the reality

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.473
of what we've got to do.

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:50.580
The difference between
the ozone layer and this

01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:54.730
is that the ozone layer
was a relatively minor part

01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:56.940
of the global economy .

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.010
Fast-burning fossil fuels is at the core

01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:04.090
and I would just urge
that people have to think

01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:07.610
outside the framework of
capitalism or we're in deep trouble

01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:09.410
and I would encourage people to talk to me

01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:11.860
about Bob Avakian's new
synthesis about that.

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:12.693
Thank you.

01:08:12.693 --> 01:08:14.010
- Well, that's pretty much at the core

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:16.480
of a lot of society too
whether you like it or not.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:19.620
So, I don't think you've
made the problem any easier

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.553
is what I'm trying to say,
with your final solution.

01:08:23.610 --> 01:08:25.760
- [Man] I don't think
it's an easy problem.

01:08:26.716 --> 01:08:28.790
That's what we have to confront, how deep.

01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:29.948
- Okay, got it.
- And how wrenching

01:08:29.948 --> 01:08:30.870
it actually is.

01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:32.630
But there is a way out.

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:35.480
It's just outside of
conventional thinking.

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.313
- Thank you.

01:08:40.230 --> 01:08:42.300
- [Ron] Let me add my thanks, Ralph.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.530
I have two questions for you.

01:08:44.530 --> 01:08:47.910
First is, what's your sense of the success

01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:51.520
we can have state-by-state or city-by-city

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.700
in approaching this problem
and in meeting the U.S.

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:56.460
or other international targets

01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:00.990
and, the second is, can you
comment on where you think

01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:05.980
research to support
renewables and new approaches

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:09.660
to avoiding fossil fuels
is going with your hat on

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:11.063
as chair of NAS?

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:15.740
- First of all, the
state and local actions,

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.400
I think they really do deserve attention

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.090
for several reasons.

01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:24.970
One is it shows what the
public has a proclivity to do

01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:29.310
and commit to, but also
every success that is gained

01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:32.340
by a municipality or a
state in the United States

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:35.010
then becomes an exhibit.

01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:38.080
When somebody says it can't
be done, it cannot be done,

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.330
and California's already done it

01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:42.310
that's a pretty strong case.

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:45.260
So, I think these state and
local actions are very important

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:47.620
and, by the way, it's
similar to what happened

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:49.193
in the ozone layer business.

01:09:53.835 --> 01:09:57.440
One example I'll give is,
on my birthday in 1975,

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.440
I had to testify in the State
Senate of New York about CFCs

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.490
and there was a company there who claimed

01:10:05.490 --> 01:10:10.420
that they would suffer
huge financial losses

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.000
and they would lay off thousands of people

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.500
if they had to give up their products

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:18.020
and I brought with me a
letter from a similar company

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:20.870
from another state who said
they had already achieved it.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.040
There was the exhibit
and those came from local

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.670
and state actions.

01:10:26.670 --> 01:10:29.250
So, I think they're very important.

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:32.240
What was it on the research
front that you said, Ron?

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.160
- I was wondering if you would comment on

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:34.993
where you are going--

01:10:34.993 --> 01:10:37.690
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- In creating alternatives

01:10:37.690 --> 01:10:40.720
and what we need to do as
a scientific community.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.430
- Yeah, well, there are
some really bright spots.

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:47.130
For example, that 100 billion
dollar fund I mentioned,

01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:50.450
that's committed to with
this Paris Agreement,

01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:52.070
there are already commitments, I guess,

01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:53.987
of about $20 billion to it

01:10:53.987 --> 01:10:56.460
and some of them are for private concerns.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:57.820
There's a billion dollar commitment

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.530
from the Gates Consortium and it's largely

01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:03.000
aimed at energy technology, I believe.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.090
They're funding early stage
and scientific concepts

01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:08.803
on new energy technologies
using renewables.

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:12.620
ARPA-E, in the Department of Energy,

01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.300
that a former Berkeley faculty member

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.513
was the first director of, Arun Majumdar,

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.480
they've got some fantastic
development projects underway.

01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:28.060
Energy storage, of course,
you need energy storage

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:31.790
to be able to use electricity
for transportation.

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:35.710
So, if you could produce
electricity using renewable fuels

01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:39.410
or even nuclear power
and you could store it

01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:42.770
and you could store large
amounts of it in a car battery

01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:45.090
then you could drive around
with an electric vehicle

01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:46.160
better than we can now.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:49.960
So, the point is on many
projects like energy storage,

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:54.960
battery capacity, charging
rates, energy density of storage,

01:11:55.050 --> 01:11:58.140
on windmill designs, on improvements

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:02.280
to the electric power grid,
that can distribute electricity

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.960
without major losses over more time zones

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.730
to make the wind power
more accessible and useful,

01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:12.037
on all of those fronts,
ARPA-E under Arun Majumdar,

01:12:12.037 --> 01:12:16.010
and it continues, has created targets,

01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:18.410
of not only of technical capability,

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:20.580
but financial trade-offs,

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:23.190
at what point does the
price of solar voltaics

01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:29.530
enter into competition, with
say, coal-generated electricity

01:12:29.530 --> 01:12:31.260
and they can show you the progress

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.520
just through this one
government agency, ARPA-E,

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.163
inside the Department of Energy.

01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:39.940
First of all, it's being
managed beautifully.

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:42.990
They've got investors
involved giving them advice

01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:45.610
and trying to buy up
some of the technology.

01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:47.470
They've got benchmarks
that they're achieving,

01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:49.860
milestones that they're achieving.

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:53.720
So, because of the scale
of the issue, though,

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.660
I think private industry
has to be involved,

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:58.440
if not leading it.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.420
You can just have so many demonstrations

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:03.860
by the federal government,
but you have to have adoption

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:07.130
by technology with worldwide sales.

01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:10.350
So, that adds to the
complexity of this issue.

01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:12.190
Regardless of the economic system,

01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:14.460
I think somehow private concerns

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.860
have to be helping out here.

01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:20.770
- [Woman] Thank you so much
for being here Dr Cicerone.

01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:23.780
I'm wondering if you could
speak to what you think

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:27.050
the implications of sort
of growing scientific

01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:31.080
and political interest in
climate engineering research

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.410
might play in sort of the structuring

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:35.830
of the climate change problem
and proposed solutions,

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:38.780
especially, given the
Academy's reports last year?

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:40.450
- I'll try, by the way, that connects

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:43.023
with what Professor Cohen
was just getting at.

01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:47.950
One part of the solution
to the climate issue

01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:51.990
could possibly be carbon
capture and sequestration.

01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:56.760
That is the intentional
capturing of CO2 emissions

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.360
and putting them somewhere else

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.270
than in the atmosphere, for example,

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:05.280
and, to just pursue that example,

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.050
there are several technologies
that are now being explored,

01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:10.710
it may be premature to
call them technologies,

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:15.710
but concepts by chemical
capture, by biological capture,

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.750
by burial of carbon, by
doing what some of the people

01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:24.750
here at Berkeley are doing
on capturing carbon in soils,

01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:28.530
which are known to have
had higher carbon contents

01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:31.450
in the past, so it wouldn't
be like tricking nature

01:14:31.450 --> 01:14:33.400
to do something that's impossible,

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.380
but, instead, to restoring certain aspects

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:39.360
of natural capacity to store carbon.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:43.860
Certain kinds of
reforestation can contribute.

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:47.330
So, a little bit of this
and a little bit of that.

01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:50.650
Energy efficiency is
usually what I start with.

01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:53.860
There are still huge
opportunities in energy efficiency

01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:56.580
to be to be gained here.

01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:00.760
McKinsey &amp; Company, a
global financial analyst

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.740
for analytical firm, said
five or six years ago,

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:07.870
that if they were advising clients,

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:11.830
the typical client of McKinsey
would have a bigger return

01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:14.540
on investment by
insulating their buildings

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:16.890
than by making any other
financial investment.

01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:20.220
So, there are still
potentially huge energy savings

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:23.540
to be had and when the price
of electricity goes up,

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:26.650
people are more willing
to do those things.

01:15:26.650 --> 01:15:30.730
So, there is not going
to be a silver bullet,

01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:33.330
a magic bullet, that
solves the whole problem,

01:15:33.330 --> 01:15:36.090
but it's going to be everything
from energy efficiency,

01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:39.160
some conservation, some lifestyle changes

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.163
and a lot of technology, I think.

01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.300
- [Mark] Well, thank you again

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.140
and thank you for all your questions

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:49.173
and let's thank Dr Cicerone again.

01:15:49.173 --> 01:15:52.173
(audience clapping)

01:15:53.491 --> 01:15:56.158
(upbeat music)
