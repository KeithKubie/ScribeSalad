(dramatic music)

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.680
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.910
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.260
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.010
Our guest today is Martha C. Nussbaum,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.060
who is a philosopher and Ernst Freund

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.890
Distinguished Service
Professor of Law and Ethics

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.750
at the University of Chicago.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.060
She is on the Berkeley campus to deliver

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.880
the 2006-07 Forester Lectures.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.770
Professor Nussbaum has made
significant contributions

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.740
to an array of disciplines,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.000
working within the fields
of philosophy, law,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.810
classics, and political science.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.260
She has advanced the
inter-disciplinary study

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.690
of ongoing problems in areas
such as cognition and emotions,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.930
feminism, democracy, religion,
and education, among others.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.107
Some of her publications
include "Upheavals of Thought:

00:01:16.107 --> 00:01:17.987
"The Intelligence of Emotions",

00:01:17.987 --> 00:01:20.877
"Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense

00:01:20.877 --> 00:01:23.457
"of Reform of Liberal Education",

00:01:23.457 --> 00:01:26.087
"The Fragility of
Goodness: Luck and Ethics

00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:28.090
"in Greek Tragedy and Philosophy",

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.077
and "Women and Human Development:

00:01:30.077 --> 00:01:32.400
"The Capabilities Approach".

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.300
Professor Nussbaum, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.918
- Thanks very much, Harry,
it's really great to be here.

00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:38.659
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.280
- Well I was born in New York
City, but then soon after that

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.330
we moved to suburban Philadelphia,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.830
so I grew up on what
was called the Main Line

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.430
in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.990
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.530
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.120
- Well, you know, I didn't
really like Bryn Mawr.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.200
I thought it was elitist and snobbish,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.620
and so I got an interest
in breaking out of that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.410
and looking at the wider world

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.200
and thinking about inequalities
of race and class and so on.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.210
But also, in a more positive way,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.580
my father was a very
determined, hard-working person

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.410
who had actually brought
his way up from poverty

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.900
to be a partner in a big law firm,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.580
and he was a tremendous influence,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.680
'cause he loved to work
hard and he thought

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.360
you should get the maximum
out of whatever abilities

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.250
you had, and so he just taught me,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.750
never let down, and
just always get the most

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.580
out of whatever you're doing.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.570
- [Harry] And your mother?

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.300
- My mother was a very unhappy woman.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.332
She had given up a career
as an interior decorator,

00:02:41.332 --> 00:02:44.980
and she was very bored and unhappy.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.330
She was a very loving woman, and I feel

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.720
that she was a great
source of love and emotion.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.510
In fact, once I wrote a
philosophical dialogue

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.160
that my parents figure
in, and she's the one

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.963
who speaks for the emotions.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.650
But I also learned that
women who are forced

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.890
to give up their careers
don't always have happy lives,

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.318
and that was important to me.

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:10.318
- Before you take off to
college, what in your training,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.580
your education, made you
think that you might wanna

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.880
be a philosopher, or did
that only come later?

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.610
- I went to this very
intense feminist school

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.790
where we thought a lot about ideas,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.330
and I had great, great teachers.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.650
I didn't call it philosophy at the time.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.570
I thought about literature,
but I wrote about Dostoevsky,

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.350
I wrote about Shakespeare,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.520
and I was thinking about
a lot of the same issues

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.230
that I think about now, about
emotions and vulnerability.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.340
I was also reading Greek tragedies,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.670
so you know, it was very continuous with

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.460
what I'm doing now, but I just didn't hear

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.220
the word philosophy very much.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.320
And, actually, not for a long time,

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.020
because, you know, I first
went to graduate school

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.730
in classical literature,
and I switched to philosophy

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.810
only during graduate school.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.550
- And were you a debater,
just out of curiosity,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.770
as a young person?

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.169
- No, I was an actress.
- An actress?

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:03.990
- I did a lot of acting and I wanted

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.850
to be a professional
actress and I actually was

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.630
in two summers and then one whole year,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.240
I did professional
repertory theater acting,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.760
and it was only when I realized

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.900
that I really wanted to
think about the plays

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.050
and not to act in them that
I went back to regular school

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.380
and finished undergraduate school,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.933
but I got a lot out of
that, and I still enjoy

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:25.940
performing my own scripts,
but as a lecturer,

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.940
you can write the script yourself.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.860
- And the,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.410
your admirable style as a lecturer

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.596
really comes out,

00:04:36.596 --> 00:04:40.983
and this maybe points
us into an understanding

00:04:40.983 --> 00:04:43.960
of how that came about.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.600
- Well, and you know, in
teaching, I always try

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.060
very hard to dramatize
the philosophical issue,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.300
make it seem like a real human problem

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.640
that people are actually worried about,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.124
because I think philosophy can seem

00:04:55.124 --> 00:04:57.290
to undergraduates very dry.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.340
But it isn't, it's the
most urgent questions

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.160
about human life, and so I
feel some dramatic ability

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.020
helps when you try to bring that out.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.905
- And so as an undergraduate,

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:09.580
you majored in theater
arts and then literature?

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.850
Is that what was your path here?

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.330
- Well, you know, I was
in the School of the Arts

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.020
for one year at NYU.
- At NYU.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.823
- Yeah, and then when I
went back to regular school.

00:05:16.823 --> 00:05:19.780
And so, I mean I'd left
Wellesley for this acting job.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.510
I went to NYU School of the Arts.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.280
Then I just went back and I
majored in classics, actually,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.270
and then I went on to
graduate school at Harvard

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.070
in classics, but very quickly got into

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.790
the philosophical side of it.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.690
Because that was where the excitement was

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.800
right then at Harvard.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.210
- And was that because of the instruction

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.103
you were getting, or it
was just what drew you,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.660
what really attracted you?

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.960
- Well, you know the people
who were teaching tragedy

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.540
were not really
intellectually challenging.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.610
And they weren't interested
in the ideas in it,

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.540
and G.E.L. Owen, this great scholar

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.320
who worked on Plato and Aristotle,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.930
he was challenging and exciting,

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.210
and so it was the whole circle around Owen

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.690
that was very rigorous, very challenging.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.720
And so I got into that circle,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.230
but I still felt that there was something,

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.323
talking about emotions,
talking about ethical issues,

00:06:07.323 --> 00:06:09.180
that was missing there.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.610
And when Bernard Williams came to Harvard

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.940
to teach for a year,
then I saw that that's

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.040
possible to do that within philosophy.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.660
And that's what I really wanted to do.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.510
I mean, what I wanted
to do was not to talk

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.710
about these things in the way
that a classical scholar did,

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.720
just editing the text or
whatever was being done

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.500
at the time, I wanted to talk

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.630
about the philosophical issues,

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.330
about moral dilemmas, about
the emotions and so on.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.070
So Williams gave me a
tremendous sense of possibility

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.270
and permission in the sense
that if he could do that

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.970
within philosophy, then it
could be done within philosophy.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.430
At the time, it was tough,

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.560
because people, if you
talked about emotions,

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.220
or even about friendship,
especially if you were a woman,

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.627
they thought, "Oh, you softie,

00:06:52.627 --> 00:06:54.860
"you're not really a philosopher."

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.170
But Williams was an iconoclast,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.790
and because he was so respected,

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.380
he gave other people permission
to follow and do that.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.510
- So this would've been in the 70s,

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.350
so it was an ideal time
for a woman to be entering

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.873
philosophy and raising these issues.

00:07:11.873 --> 00:07:15.410
Is that a fair statement,
or was it still a struggle?

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.100
- Well, it was a struggle.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.530
I actually have written
a piece for a volume

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.950
of memoirs of women in philosophy.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.520
I think there were a lot of problems

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.430
about sexual harassment, and
I certainly encountered that.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.460
There were a lot of
problems about child care.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.470
I had a child when I was only 25,

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.450
when I was in my third
year of graduate school.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.500
No one knew what to do about that.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.270
All the department colloquia were held

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.640
at just the hour when the
child care centers closed

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.380
and no one understood
that, so I felt that I was

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.450
the first one kind of blazing
the trail for these issues,

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.990
and it was very, very tough.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.900
I was tired a lot of the time,

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.690
and I did encounter a tremendous
amount of discrimination.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.390
But probably less than
other women at other places,

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.700
because I think that some
of the people at Harvard,

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.910
like Hilary Putnam, John Rawls,

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.610
were extremely fair-minded
and great voices for women.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.010
So was Bernard Williams,
long before there was

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.230
the term sexual harassment, he
was telling women to protest

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.280
when men on the faculty harassed them.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.770
- Our program goes out
to a general audience,

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.750
and I wonder if I could ask you kind of

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.190
a naive question here, which
is what does a philosopher do?

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.646
Help us understand what that's all about.

00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:36.646
- Well, you know, I think
philosophy has only some unity.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.580
I mean, philosophers do
many, many different things,

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.320
but if I just stick with moral
and political philosophy,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.080
I think that there are
some very general questions

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.241
about the basis of the moral life

00:08:48.241 --> 00:08:52.710
where laying it out in a reasoned way

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.370
can actually help us.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.120
It starts from Socrates.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.300
Socrates thought that
if you didn't examine

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.750
your ethical beliefs, then
you probably were just a mess.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.820
I mean, you were
inconsistent and that meant

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.910
you could be self-serving.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.330
You could do what you felt like
and rationalize it some way.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.010
But if you really examined your beliefs,

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.140
then you had to put
yourself on a short leash.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.050
And if you said that you were all for X,

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.110
well, you had to do that consistently.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.730
And so I think, you
know, in our moral lives,

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.100
one of the great problems is this kind of

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.347
self-serving partiality, where we think,

00:09:25.347 --> 00:09:27.497
"Oh, well, yes, of course that's a rule,

00:09:27.497 --> 00:09:29.640
"but it applies to other
people and not to me."

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.850
Or we don't even think that far.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.450
So, philosophizing gives you a set of,

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.880
as it were, guidelines and guardrails.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.280
It won't be any good if you don't start

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.330
with basically healthy
ethical convictions.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.090
I don't think philosophy can
conduct a radical reform.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.740
So that's why I think the
feminist movement didn't,

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.570
couldn't have much role for philosophy

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.160
until it had already
progressed a certain distance

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.290
through a kind of radical evangelizing

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.390
and consciousness-raising,
but then once that happens,

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.310
it's good to lay it out
more systematically,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.153
and say, "Where are we now,

00:10:03.153 --> 00:10:07.927
"and how can we actually be
fully fair and inclusive,

00:10:07.927 --> 00:10:11.650
"and get the best out of our convictions?"

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.440
So I think what a philosopher does is just

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.990
try to think through the convictions

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.150
and think through in a more
rigorous and systematic way,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.620
which sometimes can
involve quite elaborate

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.740
and formal kinds of
reasoning, but not always.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.730
And then often what that shows you is that

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.730
a certain area that is
calling out for attention

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.730
has not actually been well addressed.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.270
And so I think you always
have to be responsive also

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.350
to the world and the new problems in it.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.990
I mean, I've just now been
writing about global justice,

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.366
and I think that theories of justice,

00:10:46.366 --> 00:10:49.550
up until recently, did
okay when they're talking

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.930
about a single nation, but
they didn't really think

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.150
very well about the larger
world and the different kinds

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.770
of institutions that are in it,

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.740
the role of multinational corporations,

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.630
the role of international agencies.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.819
So you have to know something
about the world also

00:11:02.819 --> 00:11:04.330
and care about that.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.330
- What, you said you've
covered so many important areas

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:14.160
in your work, which we can't
all cover in this hour,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.610
but I'm curious what, help us understand

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.500
the synergies involved in
your picking your agenda

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.100
at particular times.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.110
Is it events in the world,
is it your background,

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.927
is it your readings,
is there something that

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.990
you can tell us about that?

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.610
- Well, I think if the
work is going to be good,

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.990
it has to come from someplace deep in you,

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.070
and in my case, I think the driving issue

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.400
is human vulnerability
and trying to understand

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.250
what that means for the conduct of life.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:58.060
The fact that we are such
that we can be robbed

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.000
of the things we love most in an instant,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.040
and that if we're gonna plan for a life,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.410
we just don't know whether
that plan can be carried out.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.520
I mean, that plan has
preoccupied philosophers

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.600
over the ages, and not surprisingly.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.160
But it's what got me going,
and I wanted to think

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.200
about the emotions,
because I think of them

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.140
as our ways of registering how things are

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.280
with our uncertain projects
out there in the world,

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.470
our attachments to people
beyond our control.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.840
But then, also, that led
me to political philosophy,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.820
because, all right, here are people

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.270
who are more vulnerable
than they should be

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.550
because they don't have enough food,

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.100
they don't have enough health care,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.570
and surely, one of the main
jobs of political arrangements

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.920
is to bring the things
people need more securely

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.610
within their control.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.840
And of course, you don't want a life

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.780
in which you control everything,
because that would be

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.174
a life without love and a
life without friendship.

00:12:51.174 --> 00:12:54.840
But a life in which you
have enough to eat, drink,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.410
and which certain central
goods are securely guaranteed

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.060
to you by the society that you live in,

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.740
that I think is a reasonable expectation.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.368
Now, I got to that in my mind,

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:09.010
but I was also catapulted
into it by events,

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.370
because I came with the
economist Amartya Sen.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.470
I think you've interviewed him,

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.970
and he won the Nobel Prize in 1998.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:21.350
I came to co-author a paper
with him to a U.N. institute

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.280
in Helsinki, which was the World Institute

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.990
for Development Economics Research,

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.670
and then I saw how
fascinating and how urgent

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.581
and compelling the problems
of developing countries were,

00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:37.470
particularly problems of
women and their inequalities,

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.410
and I just became a research
advisor at that institute,

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.680
and I stayed there, talking to people

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.710
from lots of different
countries, and for 10 years,

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.878
I did that kind of work
one month every year

00:13:46.878 --> 00:13:49.260
to learn about the world.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.610
So that kind of immersion in
an international institute

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.790
was very, very crucial for me.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.520
- Let me show this book.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.390
It's one of the many that you've written,

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.020
but we will be talking about it,

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.407
and you just touched on it,

00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:05.540
"Women and Human Development:
The Capabilities Approach".

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.889
And it probably is a good focal point

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:14.889
as our discussion proceeds.

00:14:15.429 --> 00:14:19.160
This book drew you in

00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:22.590
in a way, metaphorically,

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.120
I guess I could say, it drew
you away from the library

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.120
because you really had
to go into the field

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.570
and encounter

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.770
the lives of women as you went to India

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.150
on several trips and traveled there

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.563
and lived there and so on.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.370
Talk a little about that,
because one of the points

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:49.370
that you're making is that
experience of women's rights

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.190
and being denied rights
that you experienced,

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.520
we just talked about, in graduate school

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.840
was very different when you come to

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.320
a developing place like India.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.270
- Yeah, well, I saw
already at the institute

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.370
that I was very ignorant.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.650
That my education had been very bad,

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.420
because it was only a Western education.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.910
And so I started trying
to learn about conditions

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.930
in other countries, and I went to India.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.460
But when I was going to write this book,

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.960
I thought, well, I don't
wanna pull in one example

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.950
from China and one example
from Iran, and so on,

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.840
but I wanna get to know
one country pretty well,

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.960
because I think that
only when you understand

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.400
these issues that people are fighting for

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.360
in their historical and regional context

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.240
can you say anything reasonable.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.010
Well, I already loved India,

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:36.050
and I've been more and more
drawn into India all the time,

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.627
so I said to an activist friend of mine,

00:15:38.627 --> 00:15:41.817
"Please help me", I
mean she works in India,

00:15:41.817 --> 00:15:43.027
"Please help me learn.

00:15:43.027 --> 00:15:46.047
"And just set me up with an
itinerary where I can go around

00:15:46.047 --> 00:15:48.517
"and meet with women's
groups all over the country

00:15:48.517 --> 00:15:50.960
"and see what women are
really fighting for."

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.840
And what I found was that, of course,

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.610
the issues are continuous with issues

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.370
that feminists talk about in the US,

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.493
sexual harassment, domestic violence,

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.040
adequate rape law, these are big issues.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.330
But they're also quite other issues

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.450
that we don't think so
much about because maybe

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.800
we take them for granted,

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.560
like girls being able to go to school,

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.000
girls being able not to be married at six,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.500
girls being able to have some access

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.130
to employment opportunities,

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.690
being able to have equal property rights.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.100
And so these things are very
connected with the others.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.610
Because in fact, one main way that women

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.550
can stand up to their husbands
against domestic violence

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.130
is by having a job so
that the husband knows

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.510
that they can exit if they want to.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.494
They can take that money
out of the household.

00:16:39.494 --> 00:16:41.610
And also by having land, you know,

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.637
if they have land, then
he knows, "She can go

00:16:44.637 --> 00:16:46.020
"and then I'm losing."

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.890
So to think about the
interconnections of all those issues

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.480
was very, very important, because I think

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.730
you just can't even have
an adequate proposal

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.180
in one of these areas unless
you see the whole layout

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.700
and how the problems mesh together.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.410
Also to see a different political culture,

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.017
because I think we think,
a lot of Americans think,

00:17:05.017 --> 00:17:07.450
"Oh, thriving Western democracies."

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:12.450
But actually, to me, India is
a much more thriving democracy

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.830
because there's a great
deal more voter turnout.

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:18.300
The rural poor are very
invested in politics.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.081
Gandhi set up rural village councils

00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:23.840
that bring people in to
the political process

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.505
even if they can't read and write.

00:17:25.505 --> 00:17:29.510
They get very involved
in shaping the nation,

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.530
and often decide the results of elections.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.230
So I like the Indian democracy.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.720
I like people's passion for justice.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.370
When I would go to the
poorest places, you know,

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.360
women were not just moaning and groaning,

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.390
they were really making plans,

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.770
they were excited about
what they were doing,

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:49.420
and they would often sing
songs and use the arts

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.581
to dramatize their optimism.

00:17:52.581 --> 00:17:57.581
- And so how did this
experience in this thinking,

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.340
in what way did it lead to a formulation

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.880
and what is that formulation that you,

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.660
you emphasize capabilities?

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.750
- Yes, okay, let me tell
you what that idea means.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.760
And it's actually
something that Sen had been

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.650
working on already
before, and I developed it

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.270
in a more philosophical way,

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.530
but the international agencies,

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.370
when they looked at
countries in the old days,

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.080
they used to ask just one question,

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.840
that is, how is the economy doing?

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.920
How much growth is there?

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.730
And they would measure that by looking at

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.100
the gross national product per capita.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.890
Well, you can see that
if you're really trying

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.150
to find out how people are doing,

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.750
and what their quality of life is,

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.360
that's very crude, because
it doesn't even look

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.510
at distribution, and
it would typically give

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.260
very high marks to
nations like South Africa

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.960
under apartheid that
had huge inequalities.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.970
It also doesn't identify and separate

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.240
the different aspects of the human life;

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.890
Health, education, bodily integrity,

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:55.060
all these things are separate,

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.920
and you might have a nation, for example,

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.670
the United States, that does pretty well

00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.780
on some of these indicators,

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.880
but does very badly on domestic violence.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.560
So you wanna look at each
one of these separately.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.070
And so the idea of capabilities is

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.440
that you ask the question, what are people

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.270
actually able to do and to be?

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.410
And then what I've done
that Sen doesn't do

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.520
is I specify 10 central things

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.530
that I think are central indicators

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.120
that any decent society
would make quite pivotal,

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.240
and would guarantee to all citizens

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.390
up to an adequate threshold level.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.960
So I look at life,
health, bodily integrity,

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.430
development of senses,
imagination, and thought

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.919
through education, practical
reason, affiliation,

00:19:36.919 --> 00:19:40.460
access to recreation and play,

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.860
because I think that's
too little talked about.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.870
But women who have to do all the housework

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.190
and all the, and have an outside job, too,

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.400
one of the things they
often lack is recreation.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.570
I talk about control over
material and social environment,

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.240
and also about access
to a good relationship

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.140
with nature and the environment.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.827
So those are the ones that I focus on,

00:20:00.827 --> 00:20:03.700
and then emotional health is the last one

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.010
that I've added because I
think that that's, again,

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.700
that's something that
women, even women who seem

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.040
to be doing well and they've
got enough money and so on,

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.780
they're often living with a lot of fear

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.280
and a lot of anger that's perhaps produced

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.100
by the inequalities and
pressures upon them.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.250
So that, too, seems to me to
be an important indicator.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.050
And then, what I think is,

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:31.280
you have to find some way of,
of course, measuring these,

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.580
and that's the challenge for partnership

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.630
between philosophers and economists,

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.190
but that it puts the
question in the right place.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.890
It really is looking at the
thing you need to look at.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.390
The human development
reports of the United Nations

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:47.640
Development Program have been
measuring quality of life

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.490
in countries by looking at
capabilities since 1990,

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.550
and it's made a difference to
the way politicians do things.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.690
They care now much more about
education and health care,

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.430
because they see that they're
separate from economic growth.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:05.120
Just raising economic
indicators does not deliver

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.913
a more adequate level of
health care and education.

00:21:07.913 --> 00:21:10.400
So, it's an approach that's having

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.980
some real practical impact
and the intellectual work

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.890
has to keep being developed further,

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.470
and keep being pushed further,

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.420
but now we have an
international association

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.160
called the Human Development
and Capability Association

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.550
that has 700 members
from about 40 countries.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:31.690
And to me, it's thrilling
to see young people come in

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.680
and contest my formulations, mix it up,

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.670
have a good argument, and then also,

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.520
think about ways to translate
this into actual policy.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.550
So it's a movement now.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.670
- Was this experience
unusual in the context

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.980
of your other work in the
sense that you're really

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.500
going out into the field
and, I guess, one would say

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:57.285
doing empirical research about the ideas

00:21:57.285 --> 00:22:00.680
that you were developing?

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.960
Was this a unique
experience in that sense,

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.050
or do you do it more often
than not in your other works?

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:10.250
- Well, you know, I think
any real empirical research

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.650
requires partnership with
people who know how to do that,

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.140
and what I did when I
went out into the field

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.780
was just educate myself to
raise the right questions,

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.480
but if I really want to
know what correlations

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.420
are there between, let's say, land rights

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.180
and domestic violence, I'll ask somebody

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.210
who does empirical research.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.670
And I've made a network of partners

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.990
and I can consult them and
that's one of the things

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.750
our association is about too.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.030
But I guess, I think,
that's something I do also

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.370
when I write about the emotions.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.740
That I'm very interested in
what experimental psychology

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.037
tells us about emotions.

00:22:43.037 --> 00:22:45.480
I'm very interested in
what biology tells us.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.200
What I contribute is something different.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.690
In both cases, what I'm
mainly contributing, I think,

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:54.330
is a kind of thinking through,
laying out systematically,

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.493
offering the justifications, and so on.

00:22:56.493 --> 00:22:59.720
But, no good unless you
have adequate contact

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.270
with the empirical stuff.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.030
- In your work in India,
you come up against

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:11.030
the importance of religion
as a defining feature

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.500
of the environment that makes
implementation of some goals,

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.230
if not impossible, then difficult.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:25.660
Talk about that, the
insights you developed

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.840
about religion and the way one had

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.844
to really lay out the conflict
between religious rights

00:23:33.844 --> 00:23:37.000
and this new agenda of women's rights.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.220
- Yeah, well, of course,
I think it's obvious

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.610
that traditional
religions have given women

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:49.440
a second-class status in
pretty much every case,

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.670
and it's only very recently that you have

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.430
reform movements within all
the major religions, really,

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.760
that are trying to give
women a more equal status.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.450
Now, I guess it's a cliche of feminism

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.860
that religion is, per se, bad for women.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.230
I don't actually believe that.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:07.839
I think that women, you know,
as religion was a source

00:24:07.839 --> 00:24:10.380
for social justice in our
civil rights movement,

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.530
I think it can also be a
source of energy for feminists,

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.240
and it has been, but I think

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.700
religion is a part of culture,

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.277
and all traditional
cultures have been sexist,

00:24:20.277 --> 00:24:24.190
and so all traditional
religions have been sexist.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:28.230
So I think what one has to ask is

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.120
how far do we make concessions to people

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.230
who maintain sexist practices just because

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.890
they cite a religious basis?

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.610
So that was a question
that I pose in the book.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.440
Now, I think there are two extremes

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.690
that you could go to.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.900
One extreme would be to say, well,

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.520
we don't pay any attention to
the fact that it's religion.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.542
It doesn't make any
difference to us at all.

00:24:51.542 --> 00:24:55.090
I think that's wrong because I think

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:59.870
that very often, our knowledge
of religious persecution

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.720
is such that we see that people very often

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.096
are too inattentive to religious claims

00:25:05.096 --> 00:25:08.462
and even when things are not,

00:25:08.462 --> 00:25:12.230
mistakes don't seem to
be high for public order

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:13.710
and other people's rights.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:18.710
So for example, work days,
people will work on Saturday,

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.400
but they won't work on Sunday.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.790
And if somebody has a religious reason

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:23.970
for not working on Saturday,

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.330
they often have great difficulty

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.170
maintaining a job, getting
unemployment compensation

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.003
and so on.

00:25:30.003 --> 00:25:31.640
So I think in those cases,

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.150
the religious reason should
be taken very seriously.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.960
I also think when somebody
doesn't want to do

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.300
military service because
a of religions reason,

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.380
that should be taken seriously.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.360
I think these claims are often very deep

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.720
in people's lives and they
should be listened to.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.720
In India, for example, the
drug laws are routinely

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.900
suspended for the
religious holiday of Holi

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.060
because you are supposed to use marijuana

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.620
and hashish on Holi.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.530
And it's easy to do that because Hinduism

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:02.840
is the majority religion.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.570
But if it was some minority,
like the Native Americans

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.230
have had this problem in the US,

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.387
well, you can bet people would say,

00:26:08.387 --> 00:26:10.470
"Oh, drugs, this is really terrible."

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.708
So I think these religious claims,

00:26:12.708 --> 00:26:16.030
wherever the rights of
others and public order

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.480
and safety are not at stake,

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.770
they should be taken very seriously.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:23.960
So the other extreme however
is to say that religion

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.000
always trumps other concerns.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.200
And so what I try to argue in the book

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.750
is that my capabilities list,

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.760
which is, I mean, what I say is that the,

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.140
a certain threshold level of these

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.400
10 capabilities on my list is essential

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.930
for a life with human dignity.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.620
And if I've successfully argued that,

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.720
then we certainly don't
think it's a decent society

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.360
unless people are allowed
to have all of those

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.880
because it's been argued
that that's not a life

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.090
with human dignity.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.760
Well, then I would say those 10,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.410
if the argument has been well made,

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.470
trump religious reasons.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:06.120
So for example, any
practice of child marriage

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.530
which is a great offense
to women's education,

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.060
to their bodily integrity and so on

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.650
would be ruled out by
that kind of principle.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:20.650
On the other hand, the woman
chooses to wear a veil.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.650
Well, then the issue of
choice becomes very complex

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.060
and we have to start having
to ask about parents' rights

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.670
over their children, but up to a point,

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:34.780
I think that one can defend that practice

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:39.070
so long as there's sufficient
guarantees of education,

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.800
employment options, property rights,

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.070
and exit options from that religion.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.760
So those are, I think, are the
things that make it a choice

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.030
if a woman is going to
have a life of veiling.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.750
And so this is the way I think about it,

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:58.590
that you just look at the
overall menu of the opportunities

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.310
that the woman has, and if she really has

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.207
the 10 capabilities on my list,

00:28:04.207 --> 00:28:07.140
and then she leads a
life that we don't like

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.150
because we think it's too authoritarian,

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:12.590
she submits herself to an
authoritarian religion,

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.350
an authoritarian relationship.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.300
Well, if she really,

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.970
if the political situation
that she lives in

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.900
has really provided her
with those 10 capabilities,

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.670
which would include primary
and secondary education,

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:28.430
political rights and liberties
and health care and so on,

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.640
then I think that's her choice.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.710
And of course, some
people do choose to serve

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.190
in an authoritarian
group like the military,

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:40.640
and we don't think that
the people who choose to be

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.440
career military people
are always not choosing,

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.460
although of course, they are too.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.140
There's an issue of economic constraint,

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.410
and if they're constrained into that life

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.520
because they don't have any
other options, that's bad,

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.510
but if they choose that
life, then that's not so bad.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.510
So that's the way I think about it

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:00.210
and I think what I see in India is that

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:03.710
that's basically what the
women's movement is working for.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:08.550
They do not want to portray
themselves as hostile

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:12.510
to Hinduism, or in the
case of Islam, to Islam,

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.870
but in fact, women are
working within these religions

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.570
to achieve changes.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:21.130
Hindu women in India this
year just succeeded in

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.150
reforming the unequal property law

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.750
so that women have equal
shares in agricultural land,

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.290
which was a big deal.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.800
And it really is highly correlated

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.322
with other rights and opportunities.

00:29:33.322 --> 00:29:36.180
So, those are the sorts of
things that they're working for,

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.158
but they don't say, "We
have to junk Hinduism",

00:29:39.158 --> 00:29:43.270
they just reform the Hindu property law.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.160
The difficulty doing
this is that actually,

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.740
male clerics play a big role in society,

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.250
as in every country.

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:56.610
And so for example,
Christian women in India

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.550
got the right to divorce
on the grounds of cruelty

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.250
only in the year 2001 because

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.960
the different kinds of Catholic priests

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.798
and Protestant ministers and so on,

00:30:06.798 --> 00:30:09.730
they resisted change for many years.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.270
And then when they decided
change might be good,

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.720
then they had to all get together

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.750
and agree on some formulation.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.300
So the Protestants and the Catholics

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.990
and the ones from Portugal and the ones

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.460
originally from some other place,

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.350
they all had to get together
and it took a long time,

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.110
and it's ridiculous.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.590
Actually, Christian rights of women

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:31.860
have been particularly
slow because they come from

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.840
so many different religions
and so many different origins.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.470
Muslim women had that right earlier,

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.560
but the Muslim women
have a similar problem,

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.670
which is that there's a thing called

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.130
the Muslim Personal Law Board,

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:46.450
which is a bunch of unelected
self-perpetuating male clerics

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.901
who decide what the rules should be,

00:30:48.901 --> 00:30:51.380
and because they're not accountable,

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:55.070
they don't really listen
enough to the voices of women.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.590
So there are these
struggles in every religion,

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.620
and then of course after that,

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.010
they have to persuade Parliament

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.257
to pass the right, reform law,

00:31:04.257 --> 00:31:07.100
and that takes another
five years, and so on.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.650
So yeah, so there are these problems,

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:13.443
but I think one should not say,
and I don't see women saying

00:31:13.443 --> 00:31:18.160
that we want to just
junk religion, per se.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.770
- You're raising some interesting points

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.440
and there are two insights that I found

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.350
in your discussion of religion
that I think are useful

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:27.680
in other areas.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.690
One is the role of power, which
you were just talking about.

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:36.690
But also the inability or
incapacity to see diversity

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.449
of thinking within a religion.

00:31:40.449 --> 00:31:43.042
And the two of these together

00:31:43.042 --> 00:31:46.350
can further the possibility of change,

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.320
which is really important
as we deal with religions

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.700
that we don't understand
in our involvement.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.300
- Oh yeah, I mean, I think
when Americans look abroad,

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.160
they often, they talk about traditions

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.810
or the Indian tradition.

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:04.810
Now very often, it's absurd
because to even use the phrase

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:06.910
the Indian tradition makes no sense at all

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.470
because it's a, such a
heterogeneous country

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:13.570
with 350 languages and so many
different regional cultures

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.900
and so many different religions, I mean,

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:19.130
not just Hinduism, Islam and Christianity,

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.930
but also there are Parsees,
there are Jews there.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:26.300
So just, Buddhists, Sikhs, Gaians.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:30.490
So we then, within each
of these, have diversity.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:35.160
And often, I think
people think it's a good

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.637
kind of pluralistic thing to do to say,

00:32:37.637 --> 00:32:41.060
"Oh well, it's their tradition,
so we mustn't criticize it."

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.410
But often what that means is

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:44.270
you're just conceding that the voices

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.470
of the currently powerful men should rule

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:51.560
and you're not even listening
to the voices of women

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.540
who probably haven't
learned to read and write

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.020
and therefore they're not recorded

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.550
as part of the dominant tradition.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:59.230
And interestingly, this
is what the British did

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:00.940
when they were ruling over India.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.086
When native Indian reformers said,

00:33:04.086 --> 00:33:07.390
"We don't want child marriage anymore",

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:12.390
the British judges said, "Oh,
but it's the Hindu tradition."

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:16.150
Now of course, they were
deferring to the powerful men

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:16.983
in the community.

00:33:16.983 --> 00:33:18.180
Why were they doing that?

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.520
Because they had the shrewd idea

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.480
that if you give them that,

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.440
that control over women,
then they might be less antsy

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.270
about rebelling against the British.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:30.770
So the man who can be a king in his house

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:32.360
is less likely to notice

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.070
that he's not a king
the rest of the world.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.860
So the British played up
cultural relativism as a tool

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.000
of their own power,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.960
and I think that's an
example we should think about

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.210
because I think Americans
sometimes make similar errors

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.660
just out of naivete.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.267
They think, "Oh well, the
tradition of Hinduism is X,

00:33:52.267 --> 00:33:55.370
"or the tradition of
Islam", but all of these

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.650
have had argument and debate for years.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:03.230
I mean, Islamic feminism in
India has a very old history

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:07.350
and the wonderful works
and novels and so on

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:12.010
written by women, and so
too with Hindu feminism.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:13.783
I find that some of,

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.082
do you know the recent
movie Water by Deepa Mehta?

00:34:18.082 --> 00:34:18.915
- No.

00:34:18.915 --> 00:34:21.470
- Well, it's a movie
made by a Canadian emigre

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:24.010
who had left India at the age of 20

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:25.860
and then she went to Canada,

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.810
and it portrays Hinduism
as monolithically terrible

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.480
in its attitude toward widows,

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.040
all widows have to go to this ashram

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.860
and live a miserable life,

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.110
and only Gandhi could save
them from this terrible life.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.820
Now in fact, starting in
the 19th century already,

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.880
women themselves were taking the lead

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.570
in rebelling against
the treatment of widows.

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:50.130
There were conferences on widowhood,

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:53.070
there were women who set
up schools for widows.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.310
So all of this is just left out,

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.500
so I think any account of a culture

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.670
really needs to begin by listening

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:01.850
to the voices of dissent within that

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.410
and just understanding that it's always

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:06.260
a scene of contestation.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.230
What would you expect?

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.710
I mean, the family is always
a scene of contestation,

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.850
as we know very well.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.690
Well, why should a
tradition be any different?

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.020
And it isn't, it never is.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.610
- Now, as you're working
through these problems,

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:24.320
you actually put on your
hat as a legal philosopher.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.220
And I want you to talk a
little about that because

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.640
you see the law and the principles

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:35.640
that have evolved over time
even from different settings

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:41.270
as something to think about
as one navigates the movement,

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.270
the aggressive movements of women's rights

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:48.510
as it comes up against the obstacles

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.740
that might be in a religion.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.720
Talk a little about that,
'cause law is central, right?

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.640
- Well, feminism has always in America,

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.110
and in Europe I would say,

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.920
but especially I guess in the US,

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.830
it has relied on law as an
avenue of social change.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:06.640
The first very famous legal
feminist was Catharine MacKinnon

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.990
but there were so many.

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:10.847
And these women thought,
"Well, what we really need,

00:36:10.847 --> 00:36:14.454
"what we can make progress
with is better laws on rape,

00:36:14.454 --> 00:36:16.947
"some laws on sexual harassment,

00:36:16.947 --> 00:36:19.867
"understanding that sexual
harassment is not about

00:36:19.867 --> 00:36:22.597
"being sexy but it's the
practice of discrimination

00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:24.660
"and subordination", all these things

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:28.490
which were put gradually
into the law so that now,

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.340
the most conservative federal judge

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.780
is bound to recognize that
the asymmetry of power

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.300
in the workplace is an ingredient

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.880
of thinking about sexual harassment.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.330
So I think that's something
that has really happened

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:42.480
a lot in the US, and I
think it's happened in part

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.470
because law is a very
high prestige profession,

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.650
people listen to what lawyers say,

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:52.580
and people have pretty, pretty good access

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.690
to the legal system.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:54.930
I mean, it's not perfect,

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:57.460
we need better public defenders and so on,

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:01.150
but as the movie The Accused shows

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:04.960
where that woman who was
gang-raped got an adequate lawyer

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.910
through the public defender
system, that was a real case

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:08.760
and that really happened.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.850
And when my law students see it,

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:12.900
they understand that there's something

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.650
that they're involved
in that is progressive

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.360
and that can really change the law.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.400
That was the case that
established that no means no,

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.005
that if you're wearing sexy clothes

00:37:23.005 --> 00:37:25.693
and you say no, that's no.

00:37:25.693 --> 00:37:29.403
Now, I have to say that
it's not the same in India.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.690
That is in India, people
think it's a little naive

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:36.160
and starry-eyed to think that a main way

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.510
of making change for women
is to work on law reform

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:42.530
in the way that I'm
used to doing in the US,

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:43.970
and that's partly because law

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.890
is not such a respected
profession nationwide

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:50.030
because legal change is very
slow and very cumbersome,

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.773
and because the access to the courts

00:37:52.773 --> 00:37:55.070
is compromised by corruption.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:56.950
A woman who registers a rape complaint,

00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:00.090
that case will average take
nine years to get to court.

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.420
And so until you fix that, I mean,

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.950
there's no point in changing a law because

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:06.730
the most fundamental thing is

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:08.440
she needs to get on with her life,

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.430
and so she needs prompt adjudication.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:14.430
So what I think is badly needed,

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:16.380
and so I've worked with a legal

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.460
non-governmental organization
in India that works

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:22.820
on feminist issues, they think too reform,

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.920
massive reform of legal education,

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.240
they would like to try to
start a private law school

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.250
because the state-run
ones are just very poor,

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:32.870
they don't teach feminist approaches,

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:34.760
they don't teach all this new stuff.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.070
The judiciary is very good nonetheless,

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:40.470
so if you ever manage to
get up to the Supreme Court

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:42.853
and even the high courts of the states,

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:45.740
then that's okay, and this organization

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.430
that I've worked with has
a wonderful woman named

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:51.009
Indira Jaising who's
brought some extraordinary,

00:38:51.009 --> 00:38:55.520
important cases on sexual
harassment before the court.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.820
But it's the lower levels where
women are just floundering

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.770
and doing very badly.

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:05.690
So I think one first has
to have the rule of law

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:09.260
and a smooth, efficient legal system

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.500
before feminists can hope

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.143
that that's the way they'll change things.

00:39:14.143 --> 00:39:17.580
- Does this problem of
the role of religion

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.910
and the role of the state,
their interactions and so on

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:25.180
is a problem that you
are grappling with now?

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.390
Is that correct?

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:30.280
And tell us a little about
that research of thinking about

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:36.280
what it is to have freedom of religion

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.020
and religious practice.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:43.230
- This is a rare case
where I'm focusing on

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:46.610
the American tradition,
and I did it because,

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:48.540
after the election of 2004,

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.520
I felt I wanted to make an intervention

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:55.077
into the public debate because
I think that people are

00:39:55.077 --> 00:39:58.200
increasingly polarized
around religious matters,

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.440
and they misunderstand
often certain things

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.840
about the tradition.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.110
I think the religious people think

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.640
that the idea of separation
of church and state

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.550
is an idea that means that
religion is being marginalized,

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:15.970
it's being trivialized, it's
being said to be unimportant.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:20.260
And so what I set out to show

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.500
is that there is a long tradition,

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.440
you could associate it
particularly with Madison,

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.280
although I think it goes back
further to the 17th century

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.010
and Roger Williams that
says no, the issue,

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:31.920
the central issue is one of fairness.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.620
We want all to be
citizens of equal standing

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.860
in the public realm.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.780
We want not just adequate
liberty, but equal liberty.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.956
Now what that means is that any kind

00:40:43.956 --> 00:40:47.100
of religious establishment
or religious orthodoxy

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.260
in public life is a problem

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.480
because it jeopardizes
that equal standing.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.740
Madison was thinking
about a law in Virginia,

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.380
which seems very benign,

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.600
and it's what lots of
European countries have now

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.150
which is that there would be a tax

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:00.700
for the benefit of the Anglican Church,

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.980
but if you have some other church,

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:05.170
you could always choose to
give it instead to your church.

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.327
And he said, "No, by
making the Anglican Church

00:41:07.327 --> 00:41:10.887
"the central one, this makes
a statement that that's,

00:41:10.887 --> 00:41:14.247
"our society is basically
an Anglican society,

00:41:14.247 --> 00:41:17.167
"and other people don't enter
the polity", as he put it,

00:41:17.167 --> 00:41:19.030
"On equal conditions."

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:21.940
So that line has been very important

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.030
in the Supreme Court's
thinking about establishment

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:26.060
and why establishment is bad,

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:30.700
and I think that equality line
is really the one to press

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.420
when we think about why
school prayer might be bad.

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.857
It's not like we think,

00:41:34.857 --> 00:41:37.540
"Oh, children are contaminated by prayer",

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.800
but it's just that any prayer you choose

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.210
is going to include
some and exclude others.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:45.836
It's going to, and one
of the landmark cases was

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:49.250
a young boy in Pennsylvania
who decided on the day

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.600
of required Bible reading
that he was gonna bring in

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.970
a copy of the Quran, and
he read from the Quran.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.190
Well, he got sent to
the principal's office

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:58.520
and his principal took half out after him,

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.480
wrote to every college
he had ever applied to

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.883
and got to admit this--
- This was a recent case?

00:42:02.883 --> 00:42:06.490
- This was 1960s, Abington versus Schempp.

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:07.970
It was this kid Ellery Schempp

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:10.000
who's now a distinguished physicist,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.450
and he's obviously a brilliant kid.

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:14.530
It's one of the rare cases

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.120
where the kid actually brought the case,

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.470
the parents were only
kind of helping him out,

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.777
but he sent $10 to the ACLU and he said,

00:42:20.777 --> 00:42:22.390
"Will you take my case?"

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:26.470
And they did, and what emerged
from that was that of course

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:27.333
the public schools,

00:42:27.333 --> 00:42:29.610
oh, and they thought that
they were being neutral,

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:32.190
but they were really Protestant schools.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:34.720
They were choosing of
course the King James Bible,

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.979
not the Catholic Bible, and in his case,

00:42:36.979 --> 00:42:41.430
just the Quran just
filled them with horror.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.270
There were no Muslims,
he wasn't the Muslim,

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:45.430
he was just trying to make
a point about pluralism.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:49.500
And so the point is that any
kind of religious observance

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.370
you choose is always
going to be somebody's

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.640
and not somebody else's,

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.110
and fair to some and excluding of others.

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:00.920
And I want people to think about
that and what that implies,

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.990
and if we want to separate
religion from the public realm,

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:06.840
it's not because we hate religion

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.840
or because we think that it
doesn't belong in human life,

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.100
it's because it just can't be done

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:16.200
in a way that's fair to all
and gives all equal liberty.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.870
Now I think that also
means that we shouldn't

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:20.970
impose special burdens on religion.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:24.520
I mean for example, suppose
we had a situation in which

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.236
the public sewer system
didn't serve the churches,

00:43:28.236 --> 00:43:31.790
and the fire department
wouldn't come to put out a fire

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:32.623
in a church.

00:43:32.623 --> 00:43:34.620
Now you might think
separation of church and state

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.000
requires that situation, right?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.420
Because we want, the state
is the fire department,

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.100
and here's the church, well,
then they shouldn't be mixed.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.250
But see, that's why I
think separation is not

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:45.660
a very helpful idea, but equality is

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.210
a much more helpful idea.

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:49.100
And well, what we can see is

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.300
it just would not be
fair to religious people

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.735
if they didn't get these
basic life protections

00:43:53.735 --> 00:43:56.689
of the sewer system and
the fire department.

00:43:56.689 --> 00:43:59.820
Now then, of course,
there's a lot of gray area

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.653
in the middle.

00:44:00.653 --> 00:44:03.410
Do they get transportation
to parochial schools

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:04.760
on the public buses?

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.560
You know, all these
things are very contested,

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.650
but I think that when we think about them,

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:10.330
the right way of thinking about it is

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:12.610
we don't want to have a state that's,

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.300
that burdens religion in a way

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.220
that the non-religious are not burdened.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.020
We also don't want to have
a state that favors religion

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:21.330
or any particular religion.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:24.620
So that's the line and I mean,
it's the line that the court,

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.540
the mainstream, the kind of
center of the Supreme Court

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.480
has been pushing for a long time,

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.530
but these things have change
and I think right now,

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:34.530
it is in jeopardy.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.310
And so I think it's a time to reaffirm

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:41.529
the tremendous importance
of that equal status idea.

00:44:41.529 --> 00:44:45.590
- Your career, just the little
bits that we've talked about

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:50.590
really strike me as
offering us a lot of thought

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:56.603
about how students might
train for the future.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:03.120
The kinds of curriculum,

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.090
the kinds of worldviews
that they should have.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.600
I know you've worked a lot on this.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.507
I actually have that one, that book here,

00:45:12.507 --> 00:45:15.417
"Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense

00:45:15.417 --> 00:45:18.640
"of Reform and Liberal Education".

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.210
Talk a little about that.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:23.480
I mean we, in the brief time we have,

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.740
we can't cover what all it covered,

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.940
but what are the central
features do you think

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:32.910
of an adequate preparation
for a future that

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:37.910
reflects both this, insights
that you've offered us about

00:45:38.074 --> 00:45:41.250
those things that emerge out
of the American tradition,

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:44.930
but also sensitive to
the very great diversity

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:46.640
out there in the world.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.203
- Yeah, well, this is a book about

00:45:48.203 --> 00:45:50.150
higher education in America,

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.980
and it's about the liberal
education part of it,

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.290
which is something that we're,

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:56.320
I think we're lucky to have that

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.890
because most nations don't have that

00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:58.960
in their university system.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.550
They just go in and they study one thing,

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.320
but we have an opportunity,

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.080
we're at an age where young people

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.030
are already pretty independent
and pretty sophisticated

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:12.100
to give them a general preparation
for citizenship and life.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:14.560
So my question was focusing now

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.900
on the role of the humanities
and the social sciences

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.280
because I think other people
can talk better than I can

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.620
about the science part.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:22.340
What should that involve?

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:25.850
And I argue that there are
three abilities above all

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:29.370
that we need to cultivate
to be adequate citizens

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.580
of this very interlocking
and complicated world.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.440
The first is the Socratic one,

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.610
the ability to examine your own beliefs

00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:41.590
and just ask what are your reasons

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:42.920
for believing what you believe?

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.790
And I want to say that that's essential

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:47.180
for a reasoned public culture,

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:50.480
for a culture where it's not
just sound bytes on talk radio,

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.266
but it's really serious
deliberation and reasoned debate.

00:46:54.266 --> 00:46:58.460
Then learning about other countries.

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.160
So the whole part with,

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.300
I call the citizen of the world part

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.230
means a lot more knowledge
than people used to get

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:08.260
than what I got about
non-western cultures.

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.240
I want to include in that the knowledge

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.730
of at least one foreign language

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:14.880
because I think even if it's,
let's say French or Italian,

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.730
you still learn something
from that about how

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:20.570
another group of people sees the world

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:23.490
and how difficult it is to translate that

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:26.820
so neatly into your own language.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.990
But I also think you need
to learn about minorities

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:29.823
in your own country.

00:47:29.823 --> 00:47:32.300
So I devote some time to women studies,

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:36.070
African-American studies,
studies of human sexuality.

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:39.880
Then the third one which
goes closely with the second

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.340
is the cultivation of the imagination.

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.830
Now, I think it's not enough,
although you have to do it,

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:48.520
to learn historical facts
and facts about economics,

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.820
but you need to be able to
think what it might be like

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.960
to be in a position
different from your own,

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.380
so that the arts, not just literature,

00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:00.400
but also drama, also dance, music,

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.430
these have a big role to play

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:04.410
in cultivating the sort of person

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:06.360
who's prepared to go out into the world

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.750
and think well about these problems.

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:10.920
Now, I did this for higher education

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.650
simply because that was what I knew

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.830
and there were all these debates
raging at the time about it

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:19.920
but now I feel I want
to return to it again

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.010
and write something
about earlier education

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:24.300
because I feel that these things

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.220
are increasingly in
jeopardy all over the world,

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:28.870
the things I care about because

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:32.107
people are so eager for
success in the global market

00:48:32.107 --> 00:48:35.880
that they want kids to learn
what will enrich the nation.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.640
And everyone is talking about
technology education now

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.400
and science education.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.100
I don't think these are bad things,

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:45.420
but I think they're just not sufficient.

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:48.740
And certainly in India,
it's gone very, very far,

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.300
so parents will, their glory will be

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.440
if their child gets into

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.770
the Indian Institute of
Technology and Management.

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:56.940
They'll be ashamed to have
a child who's an artist

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.060
or a writer or a humanist.

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:02.080
And that part, even the
critical thinking part

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.840
is sorely lacking because
kids are being stuffed

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.100
with all the things they
need to pass these exams

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.380
and not taught to think for themselves.

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.780
I think in the US, this is happening.

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:18.370
I mean, when we hear all kinds
of people in our leadership

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:20.070
talking about education,

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:23.040
and certainly preparing reports about it.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:26.110
it's all about science and technology,

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:28.500
nothing about humanities and arts.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.450
So I'm getting more and more into this,

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:33.260
and the Association of American
colleges and Universities

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.780
has produced a very good report

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.800
that I've been kind of advising on

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.540
about the complex set of skills

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:43.420
that kids really do
need, and then of course,

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.150
they're focused on higher education too,

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:49.970
but it has to begin
earlier if people are to be

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:53.080
adequate citizens by the
time they get to college.

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:56.490
So this is an important thing to harp on

00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:58.768
and I'm getting more and more worried

00:49:58.768 --> 00:50:03.460
that we're gonna have
nations of docile engineers

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.500
who won't know how to examine the claims

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.110
of a political leader.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:11.790
In India, the state that
has particularly gone down

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:13.700
this road is the state of Gujarat

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.093
where kids for generations now

00:50:16.093 --> 00:50:18.390
have not learned much critical thinking,

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:21.660
and they're stuffed
with this rote learning,

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:23.160
and that is the state that's had

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.280
the largest amount of religious violence,

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.220
there's no public criticism,

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:31.910
or not enough in the state
that is of the leadership,

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:34.250
although plenty of criticism from outside

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:35.610
and national media.

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:39.770
But I think the education
system is part of the problem,

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:42.770
that people have to learn to be critical

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:45.710
and to do it respectfully and publicly.

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:48.610
And only then will we have
the kind of journalism,

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:51.110
the kind of political
culture that we really need.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:53.810
- One final question.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:57.950
You have assumed a role
as a public intellectual,

00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:02.560
and one has to comment on

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:08.830
the poor state of that
role in our country today,

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:12.970
which then affects our public
debate on global issues,

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:15.700
it affects our debate
on education and so on.

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:20.160
You're unique in the
sense that you still bring

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.300
the thoughtful reasoning

00:51:27.091 --> 00:51:30.700
that you employ in your field.

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.230
Talk a little about that.

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:35.710
What can we do about
that public discourse?

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:40.710
Is it training people more in
philosophical ways of thinking

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:45.730
and introducing a program
like you've just described?

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:50.730
What can make the difference
so we elevate the discourse?

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:54.510
- I think it's very, very
difficult in this country.

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:57.220
I think the first thing
we ought to notice is

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:59.570
that we're pretty isolated in this regard.

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:01.760
I've just come back from
Holland, and in Holland,

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.590
philosophy is big news
in the popular culture.

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:07.180
There's a popular magazine, Philosophie,

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.940
that presents accounts of
issues for the general public.

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.880
It's not a gossip column magazine.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.590
And if you give a lecture,

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:17.970
I mean, I gave the Dutch
translation of one of my books,

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.730
and of course the very fact
that a book of philosophy

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:22.070
would be translated into Dutch

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:25.750
when anyone who is an
academic reads English

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:27.530
is itself quite interesting.

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:29.700
Well, people are all
coming to these lectures,

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.690
they want to know about
the philosophical issues.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:34.570
So my belief is that human
beings are not that different

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:35.880
from one country to the other.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.430
Issues about grief and warning,

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:39.920
issues about social justice,

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.150
these are issues that
people really care about.

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:45.041
And in America, they
just don't get the access

00:52:45.041 --> 00:52:47.400
to discussion about these issues

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.940
because the media have decided

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.920
that that just isn't interesting.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.120
Now, why is that?

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:56.340
Now I think part of it is the
increasing corporate control

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.370
of the media.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:00.750
The fact is that even when
they want to do something more

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:01.720
in the public interest,

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:05.180
and CBS is owned by Viacom,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:08.950
so you get all of this top-down control

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:12.380
which produces focus on short-term profit,

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:14.640
and therefore on sensationalism.

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.411
I think major national newspapers

00:53:17.411 --> 00:53:20.110
have certainly gotten worse.

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:21.630
I think The New York Times Book Review

00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:23.130
and The New York Times op-ed page

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:27.620
have gotten measurably worse
in the last couple of years.

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.950
The Post is much better,

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:31.450
but that's always been America-focused,

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:34.460
so it's not one of my main venues,

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:37.570
so I find that it's through
the Book Review only

00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:39.450
that you can get out
to the general public.

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.650
And even there, I mean, the New Republic,

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.430
which has a brilliant literary editor,

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:47.100
he has fewer pages now
because of financial issues

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.000
than he had before.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.840
So where can one get
access to this public?

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:55.390
I think if young people thought

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:57.730
that there was a way that
they could get their thoughts

00:53:57.730 --> 00:53:59.430
about issues into print,

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:02.300
I mean, my graduate students
would work much more on that,

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:05.010
but since it's so hard, then they have,

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.630
almost an incentive not to do it

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:10.300
because it also jeopardizes
their career in philosophy.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.590
I'm the chair of the
Committee on Public Philosophy

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:14.470
in the American Philosophical Association

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:17.480
and I know that there's tremendous
passion for these things

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.250
and there are a lot of good efforts

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:21.700
at the community level going
on that we don't hear about.

00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:25.610
There are a lot of philosophy
cafes, public discussions,

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:28.280
local newspapers, local TV.

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.400
And then of course there
are people like you

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.640
who do things that have a larger audience,

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.350
and I would mention the
show Philosophy Talk

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:38.100
that John Perry and Ken
Taylor do out of Stanford.

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.560
I think that's a wonderful program.

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.880
And so there are rays of hope,

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:46.040
but it is so much easier
for me to talk to the press

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:51.040
in India, in Holland, in Italy, in Germany

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:52.860
than it is in my own country,

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.540
and I think that's pretty weird.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.760
And I mean, we are a nation

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.380
that has always had
suspicion of intellectuals,

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.670
and that's part of it,

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:03.313
but I think the media are to blame.

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:10.050
- Well on that note, we
hope that more people

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:13.900
will read what you have written,

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:16.950
and we hope to have you back at Berkeley

00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:18.280
to give another lecture.

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.470
And at that time, we'll
do another interview

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:23.467
and can talk about another
dimension of your work.

00:55:23.467 --> 00:55:24.821
Thank you very much.
- I will.

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:25.980
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:28.060
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:30.456
for this Conversation with History.

00:55:30.456 --> 00:55:33.289
