&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.540
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Good evening.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.420
&gt;&gt; Good evening.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.400
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.710
And welcome, welcome to the
Library of Congress' celebration

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.130
of Women's History Month.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.970
It's so nice to have
you here with us.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.280
It's such a pleasure.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.920
And to our live stream
audience out there,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.560
welcome to the Library
of Congress,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.720
the beautiful Jefferson
building,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.810
the historic Coolidge
Auditorium,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.830
in which we're putting
on this program.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.750
Welcome to all of you.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.530
My name is Marie
Arana, and I am a writer

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.070
and the literary director of
the National Book Festival,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.720
if you ever come out for
that, and the Literary Adviser

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.800
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.000
And I'm so sorry to say,
Carla Hayden, Dr. Hayden,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.720
our Librarian of Congress,
the first woman Librarian

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.510
of Congress in the history of
the United States of America--

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.120
[ Applause ]

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.180
-- is home with a strep throat.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.820
So you're going to have to deal
with me as the interviewer.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.500
But she sends all her best
and a big greeting to you

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.580
on Women's History Month.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.900
So here's the big question
that we're posing today.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.720
Now, you heard the names, right,
of John Glenn and Alan Shepard

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.020
and Neil Armstrong, but
what about Katherine Johnson

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.940
and Mary Jackson and Dorothy
Vaughan and Kathryn Peddrew

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.220
and Sue Wilder and Eunice
Smith and Barbara Holly?

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.440
We're here to throw a very
bright light on a wonderful book

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.720
and a wonderful movie.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.470
Margot Lee Shetterly's book
Hidden Figures is the remarkable

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.930
story of three pioneering
African-American women at NASA.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.040
And as it happens, that story
sits smack dab in the middle

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.860
of some of the most defining
moments of the 20th century,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.290
the Cold War, the Space Race,
the Civil Rights Movement,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.630
and the ongoing quest
for gender equality.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.610
Though they did the same work
as whites hired at the time,

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.330
these women were kept apart,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.960
not only in gender-segregated
offices,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.080
but in racially-segregated
offices,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.940
in NASA's Langley campus.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.450
And despite the hardships
of working

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.050
under strict Jim Crow laws,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.520
they went on to make significant
contributions to aeronautics,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.460
astronautics, and
America's victory

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.320
over the USSR in the Space Race.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.480
By now, Hidden Figures has been
published as a young adult book

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.450
and as a children's
book so that a universe

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.240
of young girls can be inspired
by this story of grit, grace,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.270
perseverance and excellence.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.380
And now I'm told
there's even a doll

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.050
of Katherine Johnson,
which is amazing.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.870
I'll have to get that
for my grandchildren.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.360
And to let you know that Hidden
Figures will actually be on sale

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.270
after this program, and Margot
will be signing her books.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.110
So just last week, Margot Lee
Shetterly published a wonderful

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.840
essay for Women's History Month

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.060
in the Library of
Congress Magazine.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.960
Now, if you don't know
this magazine, you should.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.540
On the back page is
this wonderful essay

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.730
in which Margot says, when I was
growing up in Hampton, Virginia,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.820
the face of science
was brown like mine.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.210
My dad was a NASA lifer,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.890
a career Langley
research premier--

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.440
sorry, a career Langley
research scientist

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.520
who became an internationally
respected climate expert.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.700
Five of my father's seven
siblings were engineers,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.580
or technologists.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.160
My father's best friend was
an aeronautical engineer.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.880
Our next door neighbor
was a physics professor.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.560
There were mathematicians in
our church, sonic boom experts

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.400
in my mother's sorority,
and electrical engineers

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.080
in my parents' college
alumni association.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.110
And then she writes in
big capital letters,

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.550
why don't we know more
about these people?

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.030
Well, let's you don't know
enough about the person asking

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.030
that question, let me tell
you a little bit about her.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.120
Margot Lee Shetterly was
born in Hampton, Virginia.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.810
Her father was a
research scientist,

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.390
as I've said, at NASA.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.180
Her mother was an
English professor

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.680
at the historically
black Hampton University.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.210
She graduated from
the University

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.970
of Virginia's McIntire
School of Commerce.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.590
After college, she moved to New
York and worked several years

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.800
in investment banking; J.P.
Morgan, and then Merrill Lynch.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.730
She began researching and
writing Hidden Figures in 2010.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.280
In 2014, she sold the book and
film rights to William Morrow,

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.370
a division of HarperCollins.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.880
And even as a proposal, not even
a manuscript, it was published,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.670
it was auctioned, sorry, by the
other guest we're going to hear

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.260
from tonight, Donna
Gigliotti of Levantine Films.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.200
Margot is also the founder of
the Human Computer Project,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.180
an effort to recover the
names and accomplishments

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.770
of all the women who worked
as computers, mathematicians,

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.390
scientists, and engineers at
NASA, and its predecessor, NACA,

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.590
from the 1930s through
the 1980s.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.340
Who was Donna Gigliotti?

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.230
The woman who brought
us the Hidden Figures

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.210
on the big screen?

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.480
Donna is an American
film producer.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.630
She is best known for producing
the Academy Award-winning film

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.530
Shakespeare in Love.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.980
She also produced the Academy
Award-winning films Silver

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.080
Linings Playbook and The Reader.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.670
She began her career as an
assistant to Martin Scorsese

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.800
on the film Raging Bull.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.050
During the 90s, she worked
as an executive producer

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.120
on several films, including
Emma, Talk of Angels,

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.160
and Devil in a Blue Dress.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.890
Currently, Donna serves as the
President of Tempesta Films.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.060
She developed and
produced Hidden Figures,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.310
the film which stars, as
you all know, Taraji Henson,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:04.530
Octavia Spencer, Janelle
Monae, and Kevin Costner.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.520
The film won dozens,
literally dozens of awards,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.280
and was nominated by the 2017
Academy Awards for best picture,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.140
best screenplay, and
best supporting actress.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.590
To remind you of the film,

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.920
my colleague Solomon Haley
Salasy [phonetic] at the Library

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.770
of Congress, has
produced a short video,

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.820
and we'd like to
share it with you now.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.680
It's not meant to
be biographical

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.560
or documentary in any way.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.640
It's a tribute to the
African-American women who,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.330
despite great odds, played
a groundbreaking role

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.220
in American scientific progress.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.020
Solomon?

00:07:44.020 --> 00:08:18.880
[ Music ]

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.300
&gt;&gt; I need a mathematician
that can look beyond a number.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:27.550
&gt;&gt; I never knew there were
women working on engineering

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.340
and aeronautics at NASA
during the Space Race.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.850
&gt;&gt; They were all these smart

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.540
and brilliant-minded
women who were hidden.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.210
&gt;&gt; But they had really
next-level jobs.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.020
&gt;&gt; Shall we launch this rocket?

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.170
&gt;&gt; We're putting a human on
top of a missile shooting him

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:43.400
into space, and it's
never been done before.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.560
&gt;&gt; Do you have the
numbers that can get us

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.990
up there before Russia?

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.380
&gt;&gt; These women changed the game.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.450
&gt;&gt; It's wonderful to
play a strong woman.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.290
But they have vulnerabilities.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:02.020
&gt;&gt; You've been gone
for 300 hours.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.040
&gt;&gt; Was mama gone
for 12 1/2 days?

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.530
&gt;&gt; No, but it felt like it.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.000
&gt;&gt; It felt like it to me too.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.060
&gt;&gt; These ordinary women
did extraordinary things.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.880
&gt;&gt; It's crunch time.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.820
In 14 days, astronauts
will be here for training.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.010
Everything we do can matter to
their wives, to their children.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.390
I believe it's going to matter
to the whole damn country.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.710
&gt;&gt; Think about what that
struggle must have felt like.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.010
&gt;&gt; There is no protocol
for women attending.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.310
&gt;&gt; It's the protocol for
a man circling the Earth.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.610
&gt;&gt; Hidden Figures is about
how black and white men

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:28.910
and women put a man in space.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.210
That's empowering.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.510
&gt;&gt; There's a real
fireball outside.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.810
It's getting a little
hot in here.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.610
&gt;&gt; We're in the fight
of our lives, people.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:46.310
[ Applause ]

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.100
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Pretty
wonderful.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.970
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like you

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.920
to welcome the award-winning
wonderful writer,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.130
Margot Lee Shetterly, and the
award-winning marvelous film

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.510
producer, Donna Gigliotti.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:20.010
[ Applause ]

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.000
So glad to have you here
at the Library of Congress.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.910
Thank you for making the
trip, Donna and Margot.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.350
Wonderful to have you here.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.930
I want to start with we
were talking backstage

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:37.400
about exactly how this
movie came to be made.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.390
And I, in fact, had in
my notes that it had come

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.340
after you had read
the manuscript.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.830
But no, that's not the story.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.750
Tell us the story,
Margot and Donna.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.210
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly:
Well, I started working

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.130
on Hidden Figures, what would
become Hidden Figures, in 2010,

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.840
and started doing research.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.790
I grew up in Hampton, Virginia.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.760
I knew Katherine Johnson
from the time I was a child.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.040
My dad worked at NASA.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.920
And anyway, started
working on the book.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.190
2013, started, had written a
book proposal, found an agent

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.700
who then sold it
to HarperCollins

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.250
to be published in 2014.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.680
And really kind of
unbeknownst to me.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.100
It wasn't very clear.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.610
And maybe we can talk about
how it actually happened.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.230
It's still kind of a mystery.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.520
My book proposal
ended up in the hands

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.140
of someone named
Donna Gigliotti.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.540
And I, you know, remember
being in Hampton, Virginia,

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.300
and getting a phone
call, and I pulled

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.540
over into the parking
lot of the Food Lion.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.340
If anybody here is
from Virginia.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.720
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: It's my
favorite part of the story,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.270
that she pulled into
the Food Lion.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.930
That specificity tells
you she's an author.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.870
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: Yeah, so,
you know, my Virginia people,

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.430
I pulled into the Food
Lion, and, you know,

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.630
Donna introduced
herself, and she said,

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.070
on that first phone call,

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:10.650
we're going to make
a movie of this book.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.470
And I said, well, you
know, it's not a book yet,

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.690
which didn't exist at the time.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:16.990
It didn't exist.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.290
It was a book proposal.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:24.440
And yet this very
intrepid multiply awarded,

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:30.640
gifted filmmaker had a vision
for this 55-page book proposal.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.840
And that was in-- that
was four years ago.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.930
It was this time four years ago.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.500
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: And the
part she's leaving out about

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.470
that story is that I
said to her, when she was

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.970
in the parking lot of the Food
Lion, and we're going to go

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.510
to the Oscars together.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:50.550
[ Applause ]

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.350
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly:
On the first phone call

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.270
in the parking lot
of the Food Lion.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.490
That is what happened.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:57.790
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Incredible.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.090
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly:
It was amazing.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.940
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: But,
you know, it sounds, I mean,

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.340
it's nice that it sounds like
fairyland and all of that,

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:11.350
but the truth was that
Margot, she was onto something

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.050
with that book proposal
that I could feel.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.350
I knew it.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.650
It was in the Zeitgeist.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.670
And it was about women
not getting their due,

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.480
African-American women
not getting their due.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.240
It was about math.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.660
It was about space.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.410
It was a confluence of
things that really caused--

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.590
I never doubted that
it would be successful,

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.050
because you could feel
it in the Zeitgeist,

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.270
and she tapped into it.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.910
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And this was
even before the whole mania

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.430
of Code Girls.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.700
And that didn't actually happen
until the following year.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.000
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti:
No, it didn't,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.780
because what I remember
very clearly is shortly

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.070
after optioning the proposal,
book proposal, Google came out

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.420
and adamant, they
finally came clean

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.780
on what the composition was
of their workforce, right?

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:08.500
And it was astonishing
because it was largely male

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.280
and largely white.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.820
And I thought, okay, now,
I know that this is right,

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.120
it's in the Zeitgeist.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.910
So it was that coupled
with maybe eight

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.940
or nine months later,
Oscar Sir White coming out.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.190
And, therefore, the
confluence was,

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.250
it was undeniable, actually.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.020
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah, yeah,
wonderful, wonderful story.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:36.290
I want to back way up and ask
you about, for the young people

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.810
in the audience who are
watching, and out there

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:45.840
in my stream, what was it about
your youth that brought you

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.680
to this place, or that made
you what you are today, Margot?

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:58.550
What was it about your youth
that actually was the drive?

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.010
Where was it?

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:06.410
Or, you know, how did it happen
that you are who you are today,

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.530
given the child that
you were then?

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.960
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: You know, a
lot of it really does have to do

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.880
with my parents and the
community that I grew up in

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.430
and the people I grew up around.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:22.180
As I mentioned, my
father worked at NASA,

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.900
my mother was an English
professor at Hampton University,

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.760
and there was this expectation.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.180
I mean, you know, I think
I've finally redeemed myself

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.480
with my dad.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.780
He wanted me to become
an engineer.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.860
I didn't. So I think I've
kind of finally done enough

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.050
to redeem myself with that.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:46.010
But from the time I was little,
we would go and see my mom

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.640
at work over at Hampton
University.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.280
We would see James Baldwin, you
know, and Maya Angelou, and,

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.370
you know, all of these
amazing writers and performers

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.520
who would come to
Hampton University.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.910
We would go over to NASA and
get, you know, computer paper,

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.950
like this, you know, I'm so
dating me in such a huge way,

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:10.880
like you would not believe the
kind of huge paper that would,

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.230
you know, get produced
for these calculations

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.280
that they were doing
back in the 70s.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.210
And so the thing
that was so wonderful

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:22.350
about that was being exposed at
a very young age to this entire,

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:29.900
very wide spectrum of
different kinds of people,

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.700
different backgrounds, women
who were working at NASA,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.350
who were professors
like my mother.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.140
And so there was never this
idea that there was anything

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.950
that was really off limits.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.880
And I think having that
exposure from a young age.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.310
And I think particularly,
you know, really to see a lot

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.830
of women working and doing
these jobs as scientists,

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.670
you kind of take it for granted.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.720
And when that is the floor, it
makes it very easy to then say,

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.450
well, you know, well, I
don't want to do that,

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.130
I want to do something
else, which, you know,

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.680
I wanted to work on Wall Street.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.780
That seem like the
new frontier to me.

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:12.410
But having had that very, just
very nurturing, both in terms

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:17.620
of my parents, but also the
community around us, you know,

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:21.800
this is really a love letter in
so many ways to that childhood.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.200
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Your parents,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.630
How about you, Donna, how
did you get to where you are?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.200
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: It's
a very similar story.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:35.160
I grew up in Upstate New
York, in a little tiny town.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.940
And essentially, it was a
tremendous amount of support

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.650
from my family and
the community.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:47.190
But it really was my mother.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.310
I'm old. I was born in 1954.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:55.070
And it was my mother always
saying you can do whatever it is

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.370
that you want to do.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.220
You know, she was
of a slightly--

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.800
that earlier generation, maybe
she was a little frustrated

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.580
and put that all onto me.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.290
I always tell the story
that this is true.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:12.370
I was 18 years old before I
realized I was not the prettiest

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.840
or the smartest girl
in the world.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.460
Because she told me
that the entire time.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.760
It was astonishing to me,

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.510
astonishing that that
was not the case.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.830
[ Laughter ]

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.130
So mom.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.430
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah, mom.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:28.730
Oh, moms are great.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.040
Moms, Women's History
Month, I mean,

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.510
let's hear it for the moms.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:37.120
[ Applause ]

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.060
Paying tribute to them.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:44.360
And how was it, Margot, that you
actually came upon this subject?

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.070
I mean, you've said, and you've
written in this magazine,

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.820
and you've said many
times that it was

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.930
that culture that
you grew up in.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:56.550
But actually, stumbling
on this actual story,

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.450
how did that happen?

00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.750
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: Well,
the thing that's really great

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.690
about it is this story
has very much to do

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.860
with the most important
men in my life.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.200
So my husband and I had
gone home Christmas 2010

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.840
to visit my parents.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.640
And we ran into a woman who
was somebody that we had known

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.060
from church, you
know, growing up,

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.470
she was my Sunday
school teacher,

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.120
and my dad just started
talking about her.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.420
She's since died.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.200
She was 96, I think, but
had worked her whole career

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.200
as a computer in the west
area, computing group.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.150
And I didn't quite know it.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:32.840
You know, there's so
many things that you know

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.940
as a kid, or you hear as a kid.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.530
You kind of just, you
know, you know, whatever,

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.470
it's not important
to me, whatever.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.420
Anyway, and so it turned
into this entire conversation

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.740
with me kind of listening,
right, between my dad

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.090
and my husband, and my husband
listening to this, like,

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.380
oh my gosh, I can't believe
this, like I can't believe.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.610
What? I've never heard
this story before.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.570
And I had heard this story.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:04.020
I had known these women, but
never really took the time

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.070
to think, well, jeez, why
was Katherine Johnson there?

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.900
Why were there black
women mathematicians

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.010
at NASA in the 1950s?

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.310
Why was my, you know,

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:16.390
now 96-year-old Sunday school
teacher, where did, you know,

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.220
how did this all happen?

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.150
And it was really a moment
for me of seeing something

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.560
with fresh eyes, something
that we had really taken

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.580
for granted growing
up in the Hampton.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.880
Because they were just normal.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.080
They got up, they went to work,
they went to the PTA meetings,

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.380
we saw them in the Food Lion.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:38.000
It was normal, you know?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.730
And yet it was a totally
extraordinary thing

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.200
that they had known, an
extraordinary history

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.350
that had happened there.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.670
And that was really
the beginning of it.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.510
My husband is a writer, and he
was like, this is a great book.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.470
And then that was really
the beginning of it.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.510
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Let's
hear it for good husbands.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:02.680
[ Applause ]

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.550
So, but you knew
Katherine Johnson.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.410
And what was she like?

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.680
I mean, the version that we all
have is the version, of course,

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.600
that's in your book,
which is very vivid.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:18.280
And then this vision of a
young Katherine Johnson.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.840
You must have known her, of
course, when she was older.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.510
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: I
remember her when I was a kid.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.910
It was right around the time
that she had retired from NASA.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.400
But she was one of
these extremely active

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.230
in the community, she was the
president of the local chapter

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.750
of the sorority, she
was very, you know,

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:41.510
just an impeccable person, tall
with a pant suit, and, you know,

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:45.340
not the kind of person
that you wanted to kind of,

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.650
you wanted to be on
the right side of.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.950
And she's funny and gracious,
but very serious, you know?

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.860
And as a kid, you know the
people who are very serious,

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:59.520
and you do not jump around
and play around and whatever.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.040
But she was part of this
community, you know?

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.320
And during the course of
the research for the book,

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.230
I realized just how much
had been written about her.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.090
I mean, the first
article that I found

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.570
on Katherine Johnson
was published

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.230
in I think late 1959,
early 1960.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.080
So two years before
John Glenn's flight.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.180
And she's had this sort
of, you know, mythology,

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.740
grow up around her
in Hampton, Virginia.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.880
But, I mean, she was an
active part of the community.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.590
You know, she was part
of a group of people.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.680
So even as people knew
about the achievements,

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.200
she was still part
of a group, you know?

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.060
She did not stand
apart from the rest

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.430
of the people there
in the community.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:50.740
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Do you think
that she realized what part

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.240
in history she had played?

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:58.850
I mean, that she was aware of
the importance of being a woman,

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.270
being an African-American
woman, being a scientist,

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.680
and being at that
place in time in NASA,

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.370
when this was going down,
it was a very big deal.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.920
You know, the Space
Race was huge.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.030
And Yuri Gagarin had
gotten up into space,

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.800
and we needed to get up there.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:22.940
And did she seem like the
sort of person who was aware

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:27.120
of her importance, or was
she sort of dismissive

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:32.800
and not necessarily
strutting it?

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.430
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly:
Well, I think, I think she

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:38.190
and the other women were
very aware of their roles

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.680
in the mission and
what they had done

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.530
and what they had contributed
to the mission and to the work.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:48.720
I think the awareness of history
is something that takes time.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.910
And I think that's something
that now, not just she,

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:54.910
but all of these other
women, and, you know,

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:58.280
the women of Code Girls,
for example, and, I mean,

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.140
there are so many stories about
women having done these things.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.760
So history is recognizing it.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.620
But if you talk to these women,
I mean, Katherine Johnson,

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.180
you know, I was just
doing my job.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.480
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: Exactly.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.660
Very modest, in a lot
of ways, about her role

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.180
and the entire process.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.180
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah, how was
she at the Academy Awards?

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.430
Because she is 100
years old now.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.470
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: Yes,
this year, she turns 100.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.400
She was-- well, we
think she was excited

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.200
because her daughters told
us that she was excited.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.900
But he wasn't having
any of it, you know?

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.200
There was no-- it was like, yep,

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.780
I'm going to the
Academy Awards, yep.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.740
She actually did have
that dress made for her,

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.430
and she went through fittings.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:46.310
But, you know, initially, I
think she was a little befuddled

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:50.310
by all of the hoopla
around the movie.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:57.710
And I remember when Taraji went
down to meet her, Taraji was--

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.610
I don't know if you
watch Empire,

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.760
but Taraji plays a
character called Cookie,

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.020
and Taraji was still in, she was
in full Cookie mode, you know?

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.910
She had the nails and the hat,

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.110
and Taraji's got
a lot of energy.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.200
And I think Katherine Johnson
did not know what to do

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.960
with Taraji P. Henson
in that room.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.330
But ultimately, like they found
the place, and it was so--

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.560
Taraji, if she were here,
would tell you how important

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.830
that meeting was, because she
got to actually understand,

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:35.140
and she listened a lot to
like tapes of Katherine

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.730
so she could get
the syntax right.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.760
There was a lot of research
that went into that performance.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.080
But Katherine, I think,
was a little like, whoa,

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.010
what's happening here?

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:45.310
[ Laughter ]

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.360
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: I
get this picture of,

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.470
I mean, picture this.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.750
You've got a writer who
has sold, in proposal,

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.320
which is rare, I've never
heard of such a thing,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.710
this probably happens
more than I realize.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.010
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti:
But not a lot.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:01.310
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Not a lot.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.490
From a proposal-- so you
haven't written the book.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.400
You have, with great hope,

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.510
sort of put this proposal
forward for publication.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.010
It has been bought.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.860
It has also been
bought for a film.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.170
And the film is turning while
you're writing the actual book.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.470
Imagine that.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.880
And I'm imagining you making the
film on the basis of, I mean,

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.470
it was a 50-page proposal.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.500
This was not a small, this
was not five pages, right?

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.030
It was a substantial proposal.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.760
So you had a lot to work with.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.000
But the picture I have
of you is, you know,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.990
these two women scrambling
to produce it.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.640
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti:
We have no idea.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.340
Essentially, it went like this.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.870
Margot, did you finish
the book yet?

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.170
Have you finished the book?

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.590
The [inaudible] coming up.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:45.890
Have you finished the book?

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.190
The movie's going to be out.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.250
Have you finished the book?

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.550
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: You know?

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.850
I'm like, oh my gosh, I've
got to finish the book.

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.930
I mean, all of a sudden, it
was like, there's the script.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.430
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:58.730
Wait, wait.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.030
I'm looking at the book,
I'm like, you know,

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.000
because everything has to
be, you know, I'm like, well,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.440
I'm writing this book, and it
takes place from 1943 to 1969

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.660
with an epilogue that
goes into the 70s.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.080
How come this thing
is only going to be

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.700
in 1962, this movie, you know?

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.590
Which ultimately was
obviously a very good decision.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:22.700
But it was so interesting
for me to do something

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.440
that I have never done before,
and to go through this other,

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.590
simultaneously, another
experience based on this thing

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:35.060
that I had never done
before and do that too.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:39.430
And it was, it was--
I learned so much.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.730
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: And
the great thing is, though,

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:42.910
that we also came
out of it as friends,

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.120
even though I was torturing
her every day and saying.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.420
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly:
I got tortured.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.720
I got tortured.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.020
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: Margot,
did you finish the book?

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.960
And we really did come out as
great friends, which is a gift.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.310
And she looks very
pretty walking

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.060
that red carpet at the Oscars.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.740
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: That
was, that was a lot of fun.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.390
It was an incredible experience.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.500
But from the very
beginning, you know,

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.860
the thing that I really
appreciated about the movie is,

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.010
you know, Donna came in with
this vision of this, you know,

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:14.810
this story and these women, and
the importance of these women,

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:20.990
and then you really made it your
mission to get the best people,

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.320
and the people who
understood what it meant

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.130
and what it could mean
to girls, to women,

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:31.370
to African-Americans,
to scientists.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:36.080
You know, I was-- it was so
amazing to go in in this,

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.460
you know, in the Food
Lion parking lot,

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.510
and to come out at the Oscars.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:49.250
[ Applause ]

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:54.180
And to-- but to come, to
come away with the experience

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.960
of having worked with
such talented, committed,

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.660
interesting people
along the way.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.960
It was fantastic.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.260
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti:
You know, it was--

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:06.400
but when I say that there was
a kind of kismet going on,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.460
what she's talking
about, one of the people

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.590
that was absolutely integral

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.730
to the whole process
was Pharrell Williams.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.800
And it happened almost
by accident.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.040
His partner, his business
partner is a woman called Mimi

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.340
Valdes, and she came in
to see me just in general,

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.610
and she said, what kind of
things are you working on?

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:27.890
And I said, oh, you know,
I'm developing this script.

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:29.190
It's called the Hidden Figures.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.730
And I told her what
it was about.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.110
And she was silent
throughout the entire thing.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:39.540
And at the end of the,
end of my pitch, she said,

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.260
Pharrell will do anything
to be a part of that.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.560
And I said, why is that?

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.610
And she said, well, you know,
he grew up in Hampton, Virginia.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:51.990
Who knew? Very involved
in the STEM initiative.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.230
Great. And he's obsessed
with space.

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:58.210
I go, okay, that's good.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.460
But, you know, in Hollywood,
people say stuff like that,

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.520
like Pharrell will do
anything to be a part of it.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.920
And you go, mhmm, yeah, great.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.640
The next day, my assistant
comes running into my office,

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.730
and he's shaking, and he's like,

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.580
Pharrell Williams
is on the phone.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.180
And it's true.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.620
Pharrell Williams gets on the
phone the next day, he said,

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.720
because he's southern, he called
me Miss Donna, and he said,

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.590
Miss Donna, I will do anything
to be a part of this project.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:32.400
And I was like, okay,
yeah, good, good, good.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.920
And he said, I'm coming into
New York in another week.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.220
Can we meet?

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.590
I said, sure, no problem.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:43.190
A week passes, I go to meet
him, and he said, I mean,

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.490
there's so many elements of this
movie that are important to me.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.370
What can I do on it?

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.090
Well, you think to yourself, you
know, you're Pharrell Williams,

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.510
I think you could do the music.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.110
[ Laughter ]

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.910
So he said-- I said, I think
you could do the music.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.480
So he said, oh, good,
good, good,

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.860
because I've been
working on some stuff.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.770
Margot hasn't finished the
book, I don't have any actors,

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:10.350
and Pharrell has
written the music.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:12.320
So he said, here,
I'll play it for you.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.270
And I thought, really?

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:18.890
Okay. So he put his iPod into
the speakers, and I listen.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:20.190
I went, that's great.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.820
Listen again, another
song, great.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.600
This is really, this
is the best story.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.020
That's why I'm telling it.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.930
Because he got to
another song, and he said,

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.450
I only have the instrumentals.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.710
And I was like, all right,
dude, it's fine, you know?

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:36.280
And he said, no, no, no,
it's really, really good.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.490
He said, I'll just have
to sing it for you.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.310
I kid you not.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.610
Because if he was
sitting next to me,

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.410
he would recount this
exactly as I did.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:47.040
He sat on the couch,
the Crosby Street Hotel,

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.300
and he sang the song to me.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.390
I thought, you got the job.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:55.250
That's fine.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:58.120
You know, having
people like that,

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.680
Octavia Spencer,
she walks on water.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.750
Not only is she a magnificent
actor, but she was so--

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.520
the first time she came
in to see me, he said,

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.410
I don't know what
part I want to play.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.940
Do I want to play Dorothy
or do I want to play Mary?

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.090
I said, I don't know, which
one do you want to play?

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.020
I mean, having that, what
Margot was talking about,

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:20.570
that was a very special group
of people that we had around us.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:22.090
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: It
sounds absolutely magical.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:24.600
And, of course, it
ended up being, what,

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.390
nominated for Best Screenplay.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:30.180
So something was going on in the
actual writing process as well.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:36.000
Tell us about the research for
the book and how you did that,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.100
because you were talking
about lives and interviews

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.170
and papers and all of that.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:44.540
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: It
was really, you know,

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:50.790
it was so interesting, the
sort of chain of knowledge.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.790
You know, one fact
would lead to the other.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.100
So the first interview,
of course,

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.980
was with Katherine Johnson.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:01.220
And Katherine Johnson
mentioned a number of people

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.520
in that first interview.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.380
One of them was Dorothy Vaughan,
whose name I had never heard of.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.010
Dorothy Vaughan actually left,

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.690
retired shortly before
my father started,

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.910
or shortly after my father
started working there.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:21.130
And she mentioned Mary Jackson,
who actually I did know,

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.350
because she had worked
with my father

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:26.000
in the early part of his career.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.050
She mentioned Christine
Darden, who was in the book,

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.380
who was not in the movie,
because she went to school with,

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.140
and is the next generation
of engineers.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:37.780
So, you know, every time I
got a clue, I would just have

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:42.180
to go and, you know, off and
kind of like an archaeologist,

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.270
sort of excavate
the information.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.510
Because the information
was there.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:47.810
It was really there.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.900
But it had never been
collated into one place.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:55.150
So a lot of work in
the National Archives,

00:33:55.150 --> 00:34:00.050
the NASA History Office, and the
NASA Langley History Office were

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.450
particularly useful.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.750
Interviews with Katherine
Johnson and her children

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.830
and Dorothy Vaughan's
children, and, you know,

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:09.660
Mary Jackson's colleagues,
I mean,

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.240
there was so much information.

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:17.570
And then really this wonderful
opportunity to go into the math

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.810
and the science and the
engineering itself, and spending

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.230
so much time with
the actual reports

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.400
that these women worked on.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.560
And it was such an incredible--

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.880
it was like being in a
time machine, you know?

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.410
Every morning I would get up,
and I'd have my research tasks,

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:36.870
and it was like I
jumped in a time machine,

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:39.640
and I went back to 1943.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.790
And sometimes it
was about airplanes,

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:45.670
because they were working on
airplanes before spaceships.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:51.820
Sometimes it was about the Civil
Rights legislation that opens

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:55.210
up public schools and public
accommodations and, you know,

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:56.600
all of these other things.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.920
Sometimes it was about
the role of women

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.850
and how women made
breakthroughs in World War II

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.560
and what happened after that.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.170
So I got this incredible history
lesson during the research.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.760
And it was really like
the people came back

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.060
to life, you know?

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.850
I wish I had known
Dorothy Vaughan, you know?

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.120
That's like one of my
great regrets for this.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.180
But I feel as if I have
gotten to know her,

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:24.790
just from having spent so
much time with the documents

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.530
and the people who knew her.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:28.810
So it was overwhelming.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:32.830
The hardest part was really
wrestling this information

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.920
into a narrative, and doing it
in a way was really important

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.440
that the people lead the story,
that it wasn't just, you know,

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.150
okay, 1963, John, you know,
Glenn did this, and, you know,

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.280
that really it was always about
these women, that's a story

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.880
that we knew, we know this
story of space, but they got

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.740
to be the protagonists.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.320
And that it was always
a human story,

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.360
that it always connected
back to them as people

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.840
and not just the sort
of historical facts.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.140
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.360
My impression is that a lot
of women went into science,

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.380
correct me if I'm
wrong, went into science,

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:13.260
really during the war when
the, you know, the college

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.290
and universities were-- the
men had all gone to war.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:21.210
And so more women went in, more
people of different races went

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:26.350
in to those educational spots
that were suddenly open.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:30.820
Is this what happened in the
process of these women's lives,

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.320
that they were given
opportunities by virtue

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.610
of the circumstance of the war?

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:36.910
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: It was.

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:39.640
World War II, I mean, World
War II transformed our country

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.290
in so many different ways.

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:45.250
Legally, there was
an executive order

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:49.860
that forbade discrimination
in the civil service.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.460
And that was the thing that
opened the door for these women.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.960
But then just supply and demand.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.800
I mean, the men were
off in the war,

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.670
and these women were
really good at math.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.690
I mean, they were math
teachers, most of them,

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:03.990
before they came there.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:07.490
But they were exceptionally
talented mathematicians.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:12.110
So once that door opened,
those women took a seat,

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.210
and that changed our country.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:18.270
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: There is, of
course, the wonderful scene

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:27.170
in the movie where that
bathroom sign comes down, and,

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.200
you know, the outrage is clear.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.140
It actually, as I
understand it from the book,

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.250
Katherine Johnson was going to--

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:39.730
she was not doing
the 800 meter hike.

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:42.790
She was actually using
the bathroom right there.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:47.230
And nobody dared to say anything
because she was such a proud,

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:50.480
elegant, obviously nobody was
going to say anything to her.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.470
So there are differences
in the movie,

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:57.800
and in the reality
and the movie.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:05.800
Tell us about your decisions
to sort of conflate some people

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.130
into one, for instance, and
change the time a little bit,

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:12.630
and those decisions, which
had to be made obviously.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.930
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: They
do, because, you know,

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:15.990
movies fall into
three-act structures,

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.820
and you need a dramatic arc.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.890
And so, I mean, it is true

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.120
that the bathrooms
had been desegregated

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.310
at NASA before the time period.

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:29.530
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Everybody
knew that it happened, yeah.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:32.110
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: Margot's
father was very clear about this

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:35.830
when we toured the facility, and
he said, Donna, that's not true.

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:38.470
But I said, it's the movies.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:45.280
I mean, that is-- I
take full responsibility

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.260
for putting Katherine
Johnson in mission control

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.730
at the end of the movie.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:52.030
That's not true.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:54.870
There was no woman in
mission control for--

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:58.020
it had to have been another 10
years before there was a woman

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.320
in that room.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.950
But you would have felt--
what would you have done?

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.850
I mean, you have to
have a moment of triumph

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:05.560
for the character on some level.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.920
So you kind of have
to take those leaps,

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:11.080
which is why you will notice it
says inspired by a true story

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.380
on the front of the film.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.680
It doesn't say based on.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.980
It says inspired by.

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.830
And that's there for a
reason, because we did have

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:19.680
to take those kind
of dramatic jumps.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.650
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: So
emotionally true, you would say?

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:22.950
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: Yes.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:24.520
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:28.560
Let's talk about the
culture that has--

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.240
the culture at NASA
has obviously changed.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.090
We have had now African-American
astronauts.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.750
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly:
African-American administrator,

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.050
deputy administrator,

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.120
female deputy administrator,
chief scientist.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.420
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:44.720
Yeah, right.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.020
How was that progress?

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.320
How did that happen?

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.110
And was it tough going,

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.540
or did the doors just
fling open at some point?

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.270
How did that actually progress?

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:55.570
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: Well, you
know, the interesting thing

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:59.550
about NASA is that as
a government entity,

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:04.040
it was always more progressive
than the aircraft industries

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.050
and the contractors
and things like that.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:07.350
And I think, you know,

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:10.270
that's one of the reasons
why I was able to grow up

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:14.300
and see this critical mass
of women of all backgrounds

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.890
who were working there, of
my father working there.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:21.160
It was a more open
work environment.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.910
You know, the doors
were, you know,

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:27.390
more open to different
kinds of people.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:33.010
And so I think in that
sense, NASA, you know,

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:36.970
the DNA was sort of
set way back then.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:42.220
And I do think that there
is a direct relationship

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.390
between what those
women were able to do

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:47.310
and their accomplishments
and the fact

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:51.470
that this agency
eventually had, you know,

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:53.820
an African-American
administrator,

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.760
several female center Chiefs,

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.970
African-American
center directors.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.400
So, you know, I think
there's, you know, when we talk

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.590
about sort of the implications,
the larger implications

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.710
for this story and for
organizations today,

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:15.640
I do think that when you put
that into the organizational DNA

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.940
and you make it possible
for talented people,

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.890
regardless of who
they are, to go as far

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:25.780
as their talent will
take them and contribute

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.260
to the organization, then you
get the people at the top who,

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.600
you know, who are also
able to do that, you know?

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.400
And if you want to
have, you know, CEOs,

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:40.600
C-suite level people, who, you
know, are diverse and female

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.800
and look like America,
well, you've got to start

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.700
with that base level
DNA of the organization.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.000
I think that's one

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.190
of the story's important
takeaways from this story.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.490
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Absolutely.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:52.790
Absolutely.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:56.470
And I'm sure that
you've heard from people

00:41:56.470 --> 00:42:00.570
out there how your book
and your story and the film

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:04.270
and the whole sort of
composite has inspired people,

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:08.980
or young women, girls,
to go into STEM courses,

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.420
which is so important
in this country today.

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.230
What sort of reaction
have you been getting

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.140
on that front from educators?

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.220
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti:
Well, we joke about this,

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:26.720
that Hidden Figures, those are
the magic words to use today,

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:31.120
I had something to do
with Hidden Figures.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.750
But, you know, I
mean, it's almost more

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.280
than the book and the film.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.250
It feels like a movement
on some level.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:42.710
And the thing that's exciting
for the both of us, I think,

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:47.680
is that the only-- I
think this is true,

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.840
that one of the most
important ways

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:55.950
that you can shift the culture
is to portray women or people

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:59.830
of color in a way that
is surprising and new,

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:04.460
and what is engendered from
that is a new way of thinking.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:09.090
And that's what we've seen
in terms of Black Girls Code,

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:11.460
and it goes on and on and on.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:15.190
What were you just telling
me at dinner about India?

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.620
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly:
Well, just, you know,

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:21.670
this thing that Hidden
Figure has become a term.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.990
You know, so I have this
Google alert that sets up for,

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:26.580
you know, Hidden Figures,
and I would just pick

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.870
up all the articles that
mention Hidden Figures.

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:31.330
And it's everything
from, you know,

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:35.560
the local association
wherever in Virginia is going

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.810
to be screening the movie to
like this event, you know,

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.190
will turn up or whatever.

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:44.650
But like the Hidden Figures of
India's agriculture industry

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:46.110
or something, you know?

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:49.420
I mean, but this, this is
something that people, I mean,

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.360
talking about the
movement, people are like,

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.630
I knew there was more
than I was being told.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:55.930
I knew there were people

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:59.580
out there doing these different
things, and I didn't know how

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.800
to find them, I didn't
know where to find them.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.370
And I think that's the energy
that they're like, oh my gosh,

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:09.120
I see the success, and now
I have a completer idea

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.610
of the world and what I
might do in the world.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.270
And the girls, you know, I
don't know if I told you this,

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:20.510
I got this tweet, this was last
year, and this woman, a mom,

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:22.770
she was like, listen, I
have, you know, a daughter,

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:25.210
she's nine years old,
she's in the fourth grade,

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:31.430
and she is very math phobic,
and she tried so hard to get her

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:35.260
to just, you know, because it
wasn't that she was quite bad

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:38.230
at math, she had a phobia,
you know, she had a block,

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:42.890
and she saw the movie, and the
mom said that her daughter said

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:47.170
to her on the eve of a math
test, the numbers are going

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:50.510
into my head just
like Dorothy Vaughan.

Very inspiring for all of us,

I just want to go further
and say about your idea

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.700
about Hidden Figures
and you wrote

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:56.100
about in mathematics,
and NASA, and so on.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.220
Why not to go further?

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:07.250
A lot of hidden figures in
industries and other places,

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:10.270
sometimes women really
don't have a voice,

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:15.600
maybe to go further, is just
an invitation, is just an idea,

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:21.170
to discuss more about woman's
role in different other places,

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:24.510

should consider

like Volume 2, Volume 3.

Sorry.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.540

course of writing the book

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.870
and gathering all the research,

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:53.790
what personal transformation did
you undergo during the process?

&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: Personal
transformation over the course

00:46:55.940 --> 00:47:00.460
of writing the book, honestly,
the biggest transformation is

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:03.510
that I am now a professional
writer.

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:09.050
[ Applause ]

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:10.600
I am a full-time writer.

You know, I've done a
lot of different things.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:15.200
I was an investment banker and
worked in the internet industry.

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.460

job I've ever had.

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.830

I'm working on a new book.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.430
I'm very excited.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:22.730
I've gotten to know
people like Donna.

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:25.870
And I've come to look at
history in a different way.

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:30.010
I have learned so much
about our country's history.

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.460
I feel like I've
gotten to know people

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:35.710
who have influenced the course
of history that have sort

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.580
of disappeared from view.

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:45.900
So that, for me, this thing of
being a writer and the privilege

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:50.530
of getting to do that as a
full-time job is phenomenal.

you tell us about your book,

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:58.960
or will this hex
you if we ask you?

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.750
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly:
Yeah, no, it's not a hex.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:05.550
I mean, the thing is, during the
research, which was, you know,

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:09.730
this wonderful time machine,
I got to visit people in 1943

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:11.940
and 1957, and, you know,
all this kind of thing,

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.320
I really felt like
that's what it was like.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.080
And I just kept coming
across these stories,

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:20.750
these amazing stories of
people like Katherine Johnson

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:22.940
who were kind of
just doing their jobs

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:26.790
and making differences, and
we didn't know who they were.

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:30.550
Anyway, so there are-- I
decided if I got the chance

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.300
to write another book, you know,
I had the little file of stories

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:38.360
that I wanted to work
on, and there are--

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:43.160
and sort of the Hidden
Figures series, non-fiction,

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.870
as I've come to think of
it, but these stories,

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:48.830
African-American
protagonists, same time period,

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:51.760
because I'm really obsessed with
that time, from World War II,

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.200
or really from like
mid-30s through the 70s.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.850
Totally obsessed with
that time period.

00:48:57.850 --> 00:48:59.900
Who were sort of
real protagonists,

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.920
people who did interesting
things.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:05.720
Anyway, so the next book
takes place in Baltimore,

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.330
and it has to do
with business people.

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:09.630

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:10.930

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:12.560
We look forward to that.

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.880
[ Applause ]

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.180
Very good.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:17.480
Over here?

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, hi.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.370
This is a question for Donna.

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:27.370
Do you, did you ever consider
doing this as a documentary,

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:33.770
given that it was a non-fiction
book, and why or why not?

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:36.580
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: No, I didn't
consider doing it as a doc.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:40.520
I thought that it would
have a wider audience

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:46.610
if it was a fictional
film, or a feature film,

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:52.360
but a doc would be interesting,
just because there are things

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:55.300
that we, you know, there's
specifics in the film

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.350
that we couldn't
really dive into.

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:00.510
Are you a documentary filmmaker?

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:03.160
[ Laughter ]

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.650
You missed an opportunity.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:08.470
Commission that doc.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:13.370
[ Laughter ]

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:14.670
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Anybody else?

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:16.410
We had a question
down here, I believe.

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:17.710
Okay.

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:19.440
&gt;&gt; Sorry if I missed it.

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:24.150
Can you tell me again
how you two met?

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:26.270
Can you remind us
of how you two met?

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:27.570
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti:
How the two of us met?

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:28.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:30.170
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti:
Oh, I called her up.

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.640
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: In the
parking lot of the Food Lion.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.370
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: In the
parking lot of the Food Lion.

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:35.670
That was it.

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:39.830
I mean, genuinely, it
was, I read this proposal,

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:43.960
and I said to her agent, I
must speak with this woman.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:46.680
And he gave me a phone
woman, and I dialed it.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.910
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: So through
the agents I guess really.

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:50.210
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: Right.

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:51.510
It was really through
the agents.

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:52.810
That's what it was.

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:56.050
But it's been a, you know, happy
story between us ever since.

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.350
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly:
Very happy story.

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.820
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Over here?

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.330
&gt;&gt; Hi, this question
is for Margot.

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:09.630
&gt;&gt; You're next, okay?

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:16.210
&gt;&gt; One thing that really
struck me was you talking

00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:19.870
about your book being a love
letter to Hampton, Virginia.

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:23.160
I went to Tuskegee
University at HBCUs.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.970
Our islands of excellence,
where we do see people who look

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:30.540
like us, where you do see
examples of black success,

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.420
and that makes such
a huge difference

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:34.560
when you go forth in the world.

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.480
I guess my question
is, HBCUs seem to be

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.780
on the decline in some ways now.

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:43.580
The towns that surround
them aren't doing as well.

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.440
Not as many students want to go.

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.280
And I'm wondering, what does
that mean for the future?

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.960
Where do the Katherine
Johnsons come from?

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.190
And where's the community
that's going to nurture them

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:58.010
and tell them that they can
do anything, especially given,

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:01.670
using your word, the
Zeitgeist of the time?

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:03.590
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: I think
that's a great question.

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:06.580
I mean, my mom went
to Hampton University,

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.420
my dad went to Norfolk State.

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.810
All of these women were the
products of black colleges.

00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:16.080
I was just driving around
Baltimore today doing research

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:20.890
for the book, and Morgan State
is there, and I think, you know,

00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:23.850
there are new buildings
and, you know,

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:25.850
obviously there's
a lot of energy.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:29.120
Coppin State, which is also
there, has less energy.

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.160
You know, I mean, it's sort of--

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:35.720
there are issues that are
facing many, many institutions

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.110
of higher education,
not just black colleges,

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:41.820
but a lot of the black colleges
are really feeling these issues.

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:44.620
And that was, I mean, I went
to the University of Virginia,

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:47.990
you know, so my parents went
to black colleges, I didn't,

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:53.030
and so doing this
research, it was a real,

00:52:53.030 --> 00:53:00.480
just an amazing full
panoramic view of the support

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.440
and the excellence, the
concentration of talent,

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.870
particularly during
that time period.

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:09.250
And, you know, but I
think, for example,

00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:13.570
Spellman is a tremendous success
story, you know, when you talk

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:17.200
about the intersection of
black colleges and STEM,

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.500
they're doing extremely well.

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.940
I think Spellman
College graduates,

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:27.140
or sends more black women
to STEM Ph.D. programs

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.200
than any other school
in the country.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.500
I think that may be true.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.870
You know, and I think this
is also an issue, you know,

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:39.030
women's colleges, which
was another huge feeder

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:42.880
for these jobs at NASA
and many other jobs.

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.800
So I think that is a really,
really great question.

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:53.410
And, you know, the HBCUs I
feel were another character

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:55.170
in this book, and
another, you know,

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:56.540
along with the black newspapers,

00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.920
another hugely important
part of this legacy.

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:05.290
And, you know, and I consider
myself very much the beneficiary

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:06.970
and the recipient
of that legacy.

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:08.270
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: No doubt.

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:13.880
Yeah. We have a question
here, I believe.

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:20.920
&gt;&gt; What did you feel like when
you wrote a book or a film?

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:22.840
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: What did I
feel like when I wrote the book?

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:28.180
&gt;&gt; What did you feel like when
you wrote the book or the film?

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:32.090
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly:
What did I feel like?

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:35.390
Wow. No, this is a
really good question.

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:40.320
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Because
we all felt something

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.200
when we read the book.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.690
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: Well,
you know, I have to say,

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:50.320
the thing is it was really hard.

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:57.380
It was really, it was both
really, really enjoyable,

00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:02.740
and just I loved the research,
and I loved the writing,

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:06.930
but it was really hard,
it was hard, it was hard.

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:08.800
And a lot of it was hard
because I wish I could get

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:13.290
up in the morning and write at
8:00 with a cup of coffee and,

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:16.170
you know, like Graham Greene
I guess supposedly did that,

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:17.740
and just sat down and write.

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:19.040
But you know what?

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.910
I waste the entire day.

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:23.730
And then I don't
really start writing

00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:27.280
until it's like 11:30 at night.

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.170
And that's really painful.

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:30.470
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: That's common.

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:31.770
That's common.

00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:33.070
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: I wish it
were different, but it's not.

00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:34.370
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti:
11:30 in the morning?

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:35.670
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly:
No, at night.

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:36.970
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: Oh.

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:38.380
[ Laughter ]

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.810
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: The
most productive time is

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:42.930
from like 11:30 at night
until 4:00 in the morning.

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:44.230
That is a good time to work.

00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:45.530
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: I
agree with you.

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:46.830
I agree with you.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:48.130
No, but people don't
realize, I think,

00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:51.250
that a lot of the writing,
when you're writing a book,

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:52.960
it's up here, you're
thinking it,

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.250
and you can be doing
the laundry,

00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:58.110
and you're still working
it through somehow.

00:55:58.110 --> 00:55:59.410
And when you actually sit down,

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:01.110
you've already done
a lot of thinking.

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:02.910
So it's okay.

00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:04.240
&gt;&gt; Margot Shetterly: Okay.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.060
But the other thing that
I thought was I really,

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:11.870
I felt an obligation to really
get the stories of these women,

00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:14.120
you know, right, because I
wasn't writing about myself,

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.880
I was writing about them.

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.980
And so I felt a tremendous
amount of pressure

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:22.220
to represent their stories
in a way that was fair.

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:23.590
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: How
about their families?

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:25.130
Thank you for asking
that question,

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:27.770
because it prompts
this question.

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:29.070
How about their families?

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:32.360
How did they feel
when they saw the book

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.200
and when they saw the
movie and when, you know,

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.860
the families of these women?

00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:40.210
Because it wasn't
just the women.

00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.970
It was the families as well.

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:47.370
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: We
went down to Hampton

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:51.110
to show Katherine
Johnson the film,

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:54.450
which is really a
nerve-racking experience.

00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:58.140
Because, you know, you have
her life in your hands,

00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.440
which you're portraying.

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.550
And her two daughters
were with her.

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:06.540
And she gets around
principally in a wheelchair,

00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:08.640
so we had rented out a
movie theater in Hampton,

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:13.790
and her daughters, and she
came and watched the film.

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:16.000
And, I mean, I was
in the back thinking,

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.300
I don't know, I don't know.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:22.790
And then I heard snuffling and
there were a lot of hankies

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:26.620
that were being spread
among these three women.

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:28.230
And that's when I
knew we were okay.

00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:29.530
And she came out, and both

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:33.150
of her daughters were
very moved by it.

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:36.850
And Katherine, again,
I think she's,

00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:39.790
she's not an overly
effusive personality,

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:42.120
but she approved of it.

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:45.440
And that was a big deal.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.880
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah,
generous, actually,

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.130
when someone is recording
your life like that.

00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:50.430
&gt;&gt; Donna Gigliotti: Exactly.

00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:52.100
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Well, I want
to congratulate you, Margot,

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:53.640
and I want to congratulate
you, Donna.

00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:58.250
You have done wonderful work
in bringing these stories to us

00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:00.660
as an audience, as a public.

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.080
And we just want more
of these stories.

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.510
So keep it up.

00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:20.270
[ Applause ]

00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:24.720
You can find Margot out
there signing books,

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:28.480
and I hope you will
take the opportunity

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.400
to meet her and say hello.

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:36.500
Thank you for coming.
