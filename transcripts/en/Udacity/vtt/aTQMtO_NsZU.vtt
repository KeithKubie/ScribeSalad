00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.639
No, eight-tenths is not
less than 16 over 20.

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:07.306
Even though we call
this process reducing,

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:10.130
the fractions are still equivalent.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.570
In this rectangle,
8 out of 10 of the pieces are filled in.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.140
This is eight-tenths.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.980
In this rectangle, 16 out of the 20
of the segments are shaded in.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.020
This represents sixteen-twentieths.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.410
Even though the fractions
look different,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.230
the same area inside the total
box is shaded for both of these.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.320
The process that we've been
referring to as reducing

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.370
is sometimes also called simplifying.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.589
If you are asked to simplify a fraction,

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.994
remember that it's the same
thing as reducing the fraction.

00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:47.999
