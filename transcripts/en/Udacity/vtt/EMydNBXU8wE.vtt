00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, using this equation I can calculate the accelerations.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Notice what's happened.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
When I double the mass, the acceleration is cut in half.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When I got from 10 to 30, tripling the mass, the acceleration is reduced by 1/3.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Likewise when I quadruple it, it's 1/4.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is exactly the idea of inverse proportionality.

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You also could have used the same ratio method we used last time.
