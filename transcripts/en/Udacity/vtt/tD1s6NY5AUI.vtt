00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Well, sine is opposite just 5 meters over hypotenuse which is 13.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Notice I didn't actually include the m when I was writing because

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it's a ratio and the unit will cancel out.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The last ratio we have is the cosine abbreviated cos.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is equal to the adjacent side over the hypotenuse.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The cosine of 22.6 degrees is 12 over 13, so here you have your trigonometric ratios.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
A common way to remember these three ratios is with the following mnemonic--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
SOH CAH TOA--this means that the sine is equal to the opposite of the hypotenuse,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
cosine adjacent over hypotenuse, and the tangent is opposite over adjacent.

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If this helps you remember these three functions, that's great.
