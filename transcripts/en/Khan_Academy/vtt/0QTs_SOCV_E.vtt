00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.350
- My name's Brian Johnsrud,

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.970
and I manage the Arts,
Humanities, and Social Science

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.610
curriculum here at Khan Academy.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.450
So I was the first person in
my family to attend college

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.960
and I remember my freshman year

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.150
the first course I was taking
was in literature and history

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.300
and we were reading a primary source

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.840
and it was talking about
the Norman Invasion in 1066

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.530
and I remember reading,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.420
the Normans took a boat
from France to England

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.060
and I remember thinking,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.810
why would they take a boat,
why wouldn't they just walk?

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.390
And so I went home, and I
opened a map, and I realized,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.170
on my gosh, because England's
an island, and I had just...

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.170
My history education was
so subpar in high school

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.210
here I was, a first
generation college student,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.630
in a class my freshman year,
thinking, I don't belong here,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.253
I don't even know that
England is an island.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.050
So I had two choices in front of me,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.650
I could have quit and acknowledged
that I don't belong here,

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.350
I shouldn't be in this course,
or, I could ask for help

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.630
at least 10 times a day,
which is what I did.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.300
I went to office hours, I
got help from the librarians

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.680
who gave me extra books to read

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.410
and recommended books on course, and...

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.340
I mean, really, I was craving
a resource like Khan Academy

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.860
because I knew I had these gaps

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.600
and I needed someone to help me fill them.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.930
I really struggled with my writing

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.150
and so I was at the writing center

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.500
almost every day in college

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.210
recognizing that I needed to get better

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.730
and I could just avoid
writing or avoid those courses

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.606
or say, I know this is going to be hard

00:01:37.606 --> 00:01:40.400
and the way that I'm gonna get through it

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.790
is by asking for help by
admitting my own humility,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.350
and knowing what I don't know

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.113
and just signing myself
up for the struggle.
