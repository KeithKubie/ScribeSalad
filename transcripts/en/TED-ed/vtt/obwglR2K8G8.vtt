00:00:05.884 --> 00:00:07.478
"Listen more,"

00:00:07.478 --> 00:00:08.946
would be it,

00:00:08.946 --> 00:00:10.470
which is probably good advice

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.238
for my 48-year-old self as well,

00:00:13.238 --> 00:00:15.269
but it would definitely be, "Listen."

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.604
I, it's kind of a trade expression,

00:00:17.604 --> 00:00:22.552
but I never learn by talking.

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:25.276
You know, that's very true.
