00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.009
A bedroom at around 9pm. It’s quiet, save
for the rustle of the leaves in the garden

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:14.070
outside. We’re side by side, each absorbed
in a different world. One of us might be in

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.330
a submarine beneath the arctic ice floe, the
other is flitting through the salons of 18th-century

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.699
Paris. Every so often our toes touch momentarily
but without raising notice. We might briefly

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.820
stretch a hand to touch the nape of the partner’s
neck before turning a page. We can hear our

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.680
partner very lightly breathing. There is – blessedly
– no need to say anything at all. And so

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.960
it goes, for what might be an hour or more.
It’s modest, comfortable and sweet. And

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.760
it is, of course, a pleasure that our society
is almost congenitally prone not to notice

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.210
or respect. When we’re invited to picture
what a relationship might be for, we imagine

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.430
typically colourful scenarios: passionate
sex up against a wall, a celebration of a

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.220
triumph at work, heading for the airport for
a mini-break, the mutual exploration of one

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.140
another’s souls. And yet when the true pleasures
of long-term love are assessed, a rather different

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.890
set of images emerges, far less dramatic,
but also far more real and in their own way

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.720
gratifying: the knowing sideways smile our
partner gives us in the presence of a parent

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.730
who has been tricky in the past, watching
a TV drama episode by episode and bantering

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.800
about the characters and plotlines, sitting
on the floor sorting the socks after the wash,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.920
the chat we have after the friends who came
for lunch have departed, assembling a flat

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.920
pack bookcase and realising we’ve both got
the instructions entirely wrong and that it’s

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.920
almost rather funny.

It’s within such a list of hidden pleasures
that we find the joy of reading in bed together.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.009
It represents in its own way a major psychological
skill. There’s not really anyone else we

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.590
could do this with. If the world were fairer,
we would seek partners not just who can perform

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.170
spectacular sexual antics and look hot in
a bar, but also those with whom we could one

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.890
day turn pages in silence. To read together
is symbolic of being able to share our true

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.720
selves without shame, embarrassment or the
need to perform. We are, as we lie in bed

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.000
together, as we so seldom are in the rest
of life, simply accepted. Long-term relationships

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.250
are, inevitably, deeply complicated enterprises.
Two ambitious, independent authentic people

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.520
cannot hope to join their lives together without
a huge amount of friction and pain. We tend

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.540
to be so much aware of the troubles, we sometimes
take the peaceable moments for granted, failing

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.840
to appreciate their underlying achievement.
It may lack glamour, but being able to read

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.010
in bed together with someone is a major milestone;
and a sign of deep affection. We may be doing

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.800
better than we think.
