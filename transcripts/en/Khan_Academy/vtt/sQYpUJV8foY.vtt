00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.430
These videos were supposed to
be about e, but compound

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.380
interest was the natural
way to introduce it.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.450
And since I've already gone
down this compound interest

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.860
track, let's just keep going so
that I can put these videos in

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.920
both my mathematics and
my finance playlists.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.910
And actually, before I
continue, I just took the Excel

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.030
and I just wanted to show you
how it converges to e.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.000
So this is how many
periods I'm compounding.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.070
So in this formula
right here, this is n.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.220
This column a that I
have, right here.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.710
And then this is essentially
what happens when I evaluate 1

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.060
plus 1 over n to the n power.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.130
You can actually look
at the formula.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.840
My Excel formula.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.750
It's 1 plus 1 over this blue
cell, to that blue power.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.810
That's just that formula.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.800
And I did it for a bunch of
numbers, and I just double

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.540
the numbers every time.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.780
So I go to a very high
number very quickly.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.970
And you see that very quickly
it converges to this

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.610
number: 2.7183.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.180
And this number just keeps
going on and going on.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.160
And that number is e.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.500
And what's interesting is, in
fact, you go to Google, and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.750
you type in search on e.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.630
They give you the number.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.910
Because Google is
actually a calculator.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.250
And you could look
up e other places.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.545
And I think there are
sites that calculate e

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:11.590
to arbitrary decimals.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.460
There's actually some people
who, for whatever reason, they

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.570
see numbers like pi and e.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.430
They can see them.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.020
And they can recite the digits
to arbitrary decimal places.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.800
And I think the more you
realize-- the more you see

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.500
where e pops up in the world,
and pi, and imaginary numbers--

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.200
I think you'll realize that
these numbers, I think they're

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.780
somehow scratching the surface
of something very deep.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.890
I mean we're just touching on
them because they pop up

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.340
everywhere in completely
different places

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.940
in the universe.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.880
And they're all almost
magically related.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.060
And I'll show you that over the
course of the next videos.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.770
I think this will really give
you motivation if you're in

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.290
the mood for starting
a new cult, perhaps.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.590
Well, anyway, let's continue
with the compound interest

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.990
before, because we need to be
able to finance our cult.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.200
Or maybe our cult is
financed by giving

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.260
other people financing.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.700
By being loan sharks.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.575
Well, anyway, the example I
just gave was the situation

00:02:13.575 --> 00:02:16.430
in which I'm charging
100% interest.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.280
So let's generalize it a little
bit, to the situation where

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.400
I'm charging some other
percentage of interest.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.515
So let's say I'm
charging r percent.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.830
Oh, my rate-- right.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.580
My rate is r percent.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.205
That's essentially what
I'm going to charge.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.050
The rate will be
r, as a decimal.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.040
So it'll be 10r%, if
I were to write it.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.870
But as a decimal-- so, for
example, if I'm charging 25%,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.790
my rate would be .25, and
I would write that as 25%.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.790
Just to clarify.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.880
So what would you owe me at
the end of the year depending

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.030
on how often I compounded?

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.200
Well, just going back to what
we said before, you have your

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.510
initial principal, which in
every example we've done so far

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.410
was $1.00, but I'll just write
p so we can get general.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.660
And then the amount that you
owe me after one compounding

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.760
period is 1 times the
principal, plus my annual

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.800
interest rate-- so in this case
it's r-- divided by the number

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.240
of times I'm compounding.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.270
So that's n again.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.610
And I'm raising that
to the nth power.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.380
And just so this makes sense to
you in the terms we thought

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:40.020
about, when n is-- let's say, r
is equal to 10% and

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.520
n is equal to 2.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.635
And this is what you owe me at
the end of a year-- so if n is

00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:48.030
equal to 2, that means we're
compounding twice over a year.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.760
Or that we're charging
essentially half of this

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.680
rate every six months.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.510
So if you were to borrow,
let's say, p is equal to,

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.370
I don't know, $50.00.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.660
That's how much you
initially borrow from me.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.532
So all this formula says is,
after every period you will

00:04:04.532 --> 00:04:08.390
owe-- so, after one period,
how much will you owe?

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.185
This is how much you borrowed.

00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:15.590
Then after the next period,
after six months, you'll owe

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.840
me this p, $50.00, plus the
interest rate divided by the

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.120
number of periods in the year.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.410
So this is essentially kind of
an annual interest rate, but if

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.750
I'm charging you every
six months, I'm going

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.140
to divide it by 2.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:44.070
So it's 10% over
2 times $50.00.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.400
And this is the same
thing as what?

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:52.850
This is the same thing as 50
times 1 plus our rate divided

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.830
by the number of times
we compound, right?

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.650
And this is after 6 months,
as I highlight right here.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.130
And then after another 6
months, I'm going to take this

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.960
number, and then I-- you know,
let's call this x-- and

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:15.650
I'm going to charge you x
plus 10% over 2 times x.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.570
Or I'm going to charge you
x times 1 plus 10% over 2.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.670
And this was x.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.220
So after a full year, I'm
charging you $50.00 times

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:35.260
1 plus 10% over 2, times
1 plus 10% over 2.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.660
And that's the same thing as--
well, going in the opposite

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.070
direction-- as $50.00 times 1
plus-- we could write this is

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.790
a decimal-- .1 over 2
to the second power.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:51.000
Right?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.830
I'm just multiplying
this times itself.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.750
So, in general, when I
compound-- and now I think

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.980
you'll see the relationship
between what I just wrote out

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.100
there-- and experiment with
some numbers on your own if

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.020
you're getting a little bit
confused, or if I'm going

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.260
a little bit too fast.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.470
Hopefully you see that this
is the same thing as this.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.070
So let's see what happens as I
try to compound continuously,

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.795
or as n approaches infinity.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.210
Let me get some space.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.330
So the amount that you owe me--
so we can call that final

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:32.420
payment after a year-- payment
is equal to the amount you're

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.740
borrowing-- I don't like this
color-- times 1 plus the

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:44.290
interest rate over n
to the nth power.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.170
Well, let's just make
a substitution.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.220
Let's say that-- and I think
you'll understand why I'm doing

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.890
the substitution-- let's say
that r over n-- and let's say I

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.790
want to find the limit as n
approaches infinity, as I

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.420
compound continuously.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:08.260
So the limit as n approaches
infinity of 1 plus r

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.890
over n to the nth power.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.920
Let's make a substitution.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.970
Let's say that 1 over x
is equal to r over n.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.360
If 1 over x is equal to
r over n, what is this?

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.290
Let's see, that means
that n is equal to xr.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.540
Right?

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.750
I just crossed multiplied.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:36.030
And then, if n is equal to xr,
what's-- n approaching infinity

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.640
is the same thing, assuming
that r is constant, that's

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.190
the same thing as x
approaching infinity.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.990
Or we could view it the same
way the other way around. x

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.610
approaching infinity is
the same thing as n

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.190
approaching infinity.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:53.740
And so we can make the
substitution here, and we get--

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.610
this is the same thing as the
limit as x approaches

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.210
infinity of what?

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.240
1 plus-- we said r over n is
the same thing as 1 over x,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.460
we just defined it that way.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.610
To the nth power.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.100
But we said n-- this
substitution comes into this.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.510
So n is just equal to xr.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.690
Remember, r is just
a constant, right?

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:22.100
And this is the same thing as
the limit, as x approaches

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:28.990
infinity, of 1 plus
1 over x to the x.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.800
And then when you multiply
exponents like that, that's

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.780
the same thing as that
whole expression to

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.140
the r power, right?

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.950
And this r is a
constant, right?

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.020
We're not taking the limit on
r, or anything like that.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.570
So this is the same thing as
the limit, as x approaches

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:55.350
infinity, of 1 plus 1 over x
to the x, and all of

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.790
that to the r power.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:02.240
And then what did we figure out
that this was in the previous

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.530
two or three videos?

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.630
Well, this is equal to e.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:10.170
So this is equal to
e to the r power.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:18.155
So if I charge an interest rate
of 10%, and I want to compound

00:09:18.155 --> 00:09:22.210
it continuously over one year,
at the end of one year, you're

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.970
going to owe me e to the
10% power times the

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.730
original principal.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.720
So we said that this is equal
to e to the r, so p times

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.490
this is equal to p.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.580
There's a p the whole time.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.590
I'll do it in the blue
so you remember.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.870
I dropped the p somewhere
along the way.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.500
There should have
been a p here.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.820
But it's just a scaling factor.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.040
Should be a p here.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.430
I could have taken the p out,
because it's a constant, put

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.520
the p here, and it would
have stayed there.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.790
But anyway, I'm about to run
out of time and I will see you

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.450
in the next video where we know
how much we're going to

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.920
pay if we continuously
compound for a year.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.630
Let's see what we'll pay if we
continuously compound for

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.480
multiple years, at a rate
of r percent per year.
