00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.820
put it very simply the biggest challenge
is given the kind of business we are in

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830
is given the kind of business we are in
 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.290
is given the kind of business we are in
we are really in the business of as a

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300
we are really in the business of as a
 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.060
we are really in the business of as a
services organization we are really the

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070
services organization we are really the
 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.760
services organization we are really the
business of what I call innovatively

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770
business of what I call innovatively
 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.070
business of what I call innovatively
applying information and communication

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080
applying information and communication
 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.050
applying information and communication
technology in the context of the global

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060
technology in the context of the global
 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.120
technology in the context of the global
thousand level 2,000 kind of operations

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130
thousand level 2,000 kind of operations
 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.270
thousand level 2,000 kind of operations
so so again given the kind of business

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280
so so again given the kind of business
 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.050
so so again given the kind of business
we are in we also believe that

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060
we are in we also believe that
 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.909
we are in we also believe that
innovatively applying ICT can be a key

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919
innovatively applying ICT can be a key
 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.040
innovatively applying ICT can be a key
differentiator in the growth of an

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050
differentiator in the growth of an
 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.610
differentiator in the growth of an
organization so while there are

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620
organization so while there are
 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.990
organization so while there are
technology companies then the technology

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000
technology companies then the technology
 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.909
technology companies then the technology
users we are the people we are-- who are

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919
users we are the people we are-- who are
 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.129
users we are the people we are-- who are
really helping people in applying this

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139
really helping people in applying this
 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.100
really helping people in applying this
one so that as part of that we actually

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110
one so that as part of that we actually
 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.830
one so that as part of that we actually
worked with several technology creators

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840
worked with several technology creators
 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.719
worked with several technology creators
some could be very big platform

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729
some could be very big platform
 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:50.950
some could be very big platform
companies some could be startup

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960
companies some could be startup
 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.110
companies some could be startup
companies etc but I think in our case it

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120
companies etc but I think in our case it
 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.050
companies etc but I think in our case it
really boils down to the timing aspect

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060
really boils down to the timing aspect
 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.460
really boils down to the timing aspect
of that when is

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470
of that when is
 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:04.510
of that when is
a technology right for a solution for

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520
a technology right for a solution for
 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.220
a technology right for a solution for
universally applying in a context so

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230
universally applying in a context so
 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.900
universally applying in a context so
there are so many things going on so

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910
there are so many things going on so
 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.190
there are so many things going on so
many technologies available so many

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200
many technologies available so many
 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.380
many technologies available so many
startup so many big platform companies

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390
startup so many big platform companies
 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.600
startup so many big platform companies
but which are the given that there and

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610
but which are the given that there and
 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.460
but which are the given that there and
so many different kind of challenges

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470
so many different kind of challenges
 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.740
so many different kind of challenges
especially many of them articulated in

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750
especially many of them articulated in
 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.370
especially many of them articulated in
the National Academy of Engineering 14

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380
the National Academy of Engineering 14
 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.150
the National Academy of Engineering 14
Grand Challenges etc so many different

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160
Grand Challenges etc so many different
 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.640
Grand Challenges etc so many different
possibilities many different challenges

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650
possibilities many different challenges
 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.100
possibilities many different challenges
and you have limited bandwidth and

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110
and you have limited bandwidth and
 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.360
and you have limited bandwidth and
limited resources to look at those

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370
limited resources to look at those
 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.790
limited resources to look at those
things so which what are the right

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800
things so which what are the right
 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.350
things so which what are the right
technologies to look at and what are the

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360
technologies to look at and what are the
 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.890
technologies to look at and what are the
right problems to focus on is certainly

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900
right problems to focus on is certainly
 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.570
right problems to focus on is certainly
a key challenge and to today coming to

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580
a key challenge and to today coming to
 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.900
a key challenge and to today coming to
people I think many of these folks are

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910
people I think many of these folks are
 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.310
people I think many of these folks are
very enthusiastic very energetic and I

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320
very enthusiastic very energetic and I
 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.490
very enthusiastic very energetic and I
think the last especially the current

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500
think the last especially the current
 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.420
think the last especially the current
generation they're not afraid of failing

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430
generation they're not afraid of failing
 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.340
generation they're not afraid of failing
they actually try a lot of things they

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350
they actually try a lot of things they
 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.040
they actually try a lot of things they
don't they're not confirm this so when

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050
don't they're not confirm this so when
 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.590
don't they're not confirm this so when
they come up with very very good ideas

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:05.600
they come up with very very good ideas
 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.659
they come up with very very good ideas
and our ideas which they believe are

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669
and our ideas which they believe are
 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:10.570
and our ideas which they believe are
very powerful and very good and when you

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580
very powerful and very good and when you
 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.270
very powerful and very good and when you
have to actually choose from among those

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280
have to actually choose from among those
 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.030
have to actually choose from among those
things if you how exactly do you do that

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040
things if you how exactly do you do that
 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.360
things if you how exactly do you do that
and how do you continue how do you

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370
and how do you continue how do you
 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.360
and how do you continue how do you
basically make them see why you have

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370
basically make them see why you have
 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.570
basically make them see why you have
chosen the ones you have chosen to

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.580
chosen the ones you have chosen to
 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.340
chosen the ones you have chosen to
invest it and the last thing I would say

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:27.350
invest it and the last thing I would say
 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.080
invest it and the last thing I would say
is I think innovation itself has become

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090
is I think innovation itself has become
 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.740
is I think innovation itself has become
a very collaborative thing I think the

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750
a very collaborative thing I think the
 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.950
a very collaborative thing I think the
days of building a product solution and

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960
days of building a product solution and
 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.540
days of building a product solution and
directly taking to market kind of thing

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:37.550
directly taking to market kind of thing
 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.240
directly taking to market kind of thing
is faster now most of the innovations

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250
is faster now most of the innovations
 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.409
is faster now most of the innovations
are probably happening in a ecosystem

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:43.419
are probably happening in a ecosystem
 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:45.010
are probably happening in a ecosystem
environment so I think that actually

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:45.020
environment so I think that actually
 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.640
environment so I think that actually
bring along with it brings a need for

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:48.650
bring along with it brings a need for
 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.860
bring along with it brings a need for
most of the technology people to have

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:50.870
most of the technology people to have
 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.020
most of the technology people to have
not only technology skills but the

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.030
not only technology skills but the
 

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.909
not only technology skills but the
ability to actually work in an ecosystem

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919
ability to actually work in an ecosystem
 

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:56.920
ability to actually work in an ecosystem
the leadership skills the team skills

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:56.930
the leadership skills the team skills
 

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.140
the leadership skills the team skills
etcetera etcetera so how do you make

00:07:59.140 --> 00:07:59.150
etcetera etcetera so how do you make
 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.430
etcetera etcetera so how do you make
them see the need for some of those

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440
them see the need for some of those
 

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:06.760
them see the need for some of those
things and build another very good issue

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:06.770
things and build another very good issue
 

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.050
things and build another very good issue
I said Labs has been so successful

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:08.060
I said Labs has been so successful
 

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.270
I said Labs has been so successful
that's a great answer

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.280
that's a great answer
 

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.930
that's a great answer
your first point is a great lead-in a

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:13.940
your first point is a great lead-in a
 

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.660
your first point is a great lead-in a

technology there's only one you know you

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:49.100
technology there's only one you know you
 

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.840
technology there's only one you know you
to choose one what would that be what

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:52.850
to choose one what would that be what
 

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.790
to choose one what would that be what
would you want to focus on and what

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800
would you want to focus on and what
 

00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:11.650
would you want to focus on and what
problem are you trying to respond to and

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:11.660
problem are you trying to respond to and
 

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.510

which I think will occupy us for the

00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:16.339
which I think will occupy us for the
 

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:20.560
which I think will occupy us for the
next probably 20 30 years can be

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:20.570
next probably 20 30 years can be
 

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.960
next probably 20 30 years can be

Carnegie Mellon I think the easy answer

00:14:30.319 --> 00:14:30.329
Carnegie Mellon I think the easy answer
 

00:14:30.329 --> 00:14:33.199
Carnegie Mellon I think the easy answer
to that question is replicate what we

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:33.209
to that question is replicate what we
 

00:14:33.209 --> 00:14:34.939
to that question is replicate what we
have done in the US and I'm not saying

00:14:34.939 --> 00:14:34.949
have done in the US and I'm not saying
 

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:38.480
have done in the US and I'm not saying
this I'm saying this with a lot of

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:38.490
this I'm saying this with a lot of
 

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.120
this I'm saying this with a lot of
gravity and seriousness and here's the

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.130
gravity and seriousness and here's the
 

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.400
gravity and seriousness and here's the
logic behind this if you look past World

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:43.410
logic behind this if you look past World
 

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.990

the US has created unprecedented wealth

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120
the US has created unprecedented wealth
 

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.090
the US has created unprecedented wealth
I mean never in a 40-year

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.100
I mean never in a 40-year
 

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.769
I mean never in a 40-year
three or a 60 year history has so much

00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:51.779
three or a 60 year history has so much
 

00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:54.079
three or a 60 year history has so much
wealth been created in such a

00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:54.089
wealth been created in such a
 

00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:55.730
wealth been created in such a
concentrated manner number one number

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740
concentrated manner number one number
 

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.449
concentrated manner number one number
two that wealth was not only created by

00:14:59.449 --> 00:14:59.459
two that wealth was not only created by
 

00:14:59.459 --> 00:15:02.600
two that wealth was not only created by
the US but also spread across the whole

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:02.610
the US but also spread across the whole
 

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:03.920
the US but also spread across the whole
world so if you look at this wave of

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:03.930
world so if you look at this wave of
 

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.749
world so if you look at this wave of
economic prosperity that we are looking

00:15:05.749 --> 00:15:05.759
economic prosperity that we are looking
 

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:08.180
economic prosperity that we are looking
at now through Europe through Asia

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:08.190
at now through Europe through Asia
 

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.430
at now through Europe through Asia
through India in fact there's only one

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440
through India in fact there's only one
 

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.139
through India in fact there's only one
continent that's not been touched by it

00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:12.149
continent that's not been touched by it
 

00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:13.939
continent that's not been touched by it
very effectively as it and that's Africa

00:15:13.939 --> 00:15:13.949
very effectively as it and that's Africa
 

00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:15.559
very effectively as it and that's Africa
but it's only a matter of time before it

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:15.569
but it's only a matter of time before it
 

00:15:15.569 --> 00:15:17.600
but it's only a matter of time before it
goes to africa to come back to the US

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:17.610
goes to africa to come back to the US
 

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.319
goes to africa to come back to the US
right and all of this has happened

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:20.329
right and all of this has happened
 

00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:23.480
right and all of this has happened
mainly driven by technology mainly

educated but most importantly in the

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:34.170
educated but most importantly in the
 

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.809
educated but most importantly in the
u.s. they've been created at the

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:35.819
u.s. they've been created at the
 

00:15:35.819 --> 00:15:38.180
u.s. they've been created at the
university right so here's the litmus

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:38.190
university right so here's the litmus
 

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.379
university right so here's the litmus
test so take Google for example where

00:15:42.379 --> 00:15:42.389
test so take Google for example where
 

00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:44.509
test so take Google for example where
was the core idea of creation of Google

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519
was the core idea of creation of Google

I thought I was cutting a melon Carnegie
Mellon created the idea before that

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240
Mellon created the idea before that
 

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.780
Mellon created the idea before that
always happened it we thought about it

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:56.790
always happened it we thought about it
 

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.639
always happened it we thought about it
we thought about it they implemented it

00:15:58.639 --> 00:15:58.649
we thought about it they implemented it
 

00:15:58.649 --> 00:16:02.090
we thought about it they implemented it
right Sun Microsystems the same thing so

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:02.100
right Sun Microsystems the same thing so
 

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.949
right Sun Microsystems the same thing so
there are a lot of mega companies I can

00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959
there are a lot of mega companies I can
 

00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:06.019
there are a lot of mega companies I can
think of that have been created out of

think of that have been created out of
 

00:16:06.029 --> 00:16:08.509
think of that have been created out of
the University now run the same test in

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519
the University now run the same test in
 

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:10.490
the University now run the same test in
Europe does can anybody tell me one

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.500
Europe does can anybody tell me one

cap that was created at the University

00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:16.279
cap that was created at the University
 

00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:19.490
cap that was created at the University
probably not run the same litmus test in

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500
probably not run the same litmus test in
 

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.949
probably not run the same litmus test in
India can somebody tell me one company

education to the people who are in very

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:38.340
education to the people who are in very
 

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.240
education to the people who are in very
dispersed areas and the full spectrum of

distribution of capabilities all types
 

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:46.580
distribution of capabilities all types
of education how do you get modern

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:46.590

styled healthcare to people who are
 

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.730
styled healthcare to people who are
either underserved or non served and you

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:52.740
either underserved or non served and you

can't do it by concentrating doctors and

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320
can't do it by concentrating doctors and
 

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.890
can't do it by concentrating doctors and
sending them to very dispersed

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:56.900
sending them to very dispersed
 

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.580
sending them to very dispersed
populations and it is perhaps also

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:01.590
populations and it is perhaps also
 

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.159

Financial Inclusion so the reason I've

00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:04.169
Financial Inclusion so the reason I've
 

00:22:04.169 --> 00:22:07.039
Financial Inclusion so the reason I've
chosen both these examples is first of

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:07.049
chosen both these examples is first of
 

00:22:07.049 --> 00:22:09.350
chosen both these examples is first of
all they are fundamental problems and

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360
all they are fundamental problems and
 

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.799
all they are fundamental problems and
therefore opportunities and I think the

00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:12.809
therefore opportunities and I think the
 

00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:14.480
therefore opportunities and I think the
way out of that will come out of

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:14.490
way out of that will come out of
 

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.419
way out of that will come out of
innovating new models new ways of

00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:17.429
innovating new models new ways of
 

00:22:17.429 --> 00:22:20.330
innovating new models new ways of
thinking and new solutions which will of

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:20.340
thinking and new solutions which will of
 

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.659

necessity have to leverage technology

00:22:22.659 --> 00:22:22.669
necessity have to leverage technology
 

00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:25.580
necessity have to leverage technology
but think about in new ways and I think

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:25.590
but think about in new ways and I think
 

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.770
but think about in new ways and I think
there are embedded policy implications

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:27.780
there are embedded policy implications
 

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.140
there are embedded policy implications
of these embedded implications excuse me

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:32.150
of these embedded implications excuse me
 

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:35.539
of these embedded implications excuse me
for new ways of thinking so that's my

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:35.549
for new ways of thinking so that's my
 

00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:39.980
for new ways of thinking so that's my

so who do you ever you must have a deep

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:13.049
so who do you ever you must have a deep
 

00:23:13.049 --> 00:23:15.289
so who do you ever you must have a deep
insight into this cuz no actually like

you said there are people have chosen

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:17.340
you said there are people have chosen
 

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.669
you said there are people have chosen
banks or I mean they've chosen to come

00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679
banks or I mean they've chosen to come
 

00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:21.440
banks or I mean they've chosen to come
to Bangalore maybe they can answer but

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:21.450
to Bangalore maybe they can answer but
 

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:29.659
to Bangalore maybe they can answer but
let me perspective anyway I think at

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:29.669
let me perspective anyway I think at
 

00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:34.850
let me perspective anyway I think at
this point of time you you have will

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:34.860
this point of time you you have will
 

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.310
this point of time you you have will
come to why they have chosen separately

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320
come to why they have chosen separately
 

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.560
come to why they have chosen separately
but today if you see there is an entire

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:39.570
but today if you see there is an entire
 

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.720
but today if you see there is an entire
ecosystem of companies which is which

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:41.730
ecosystem of companies which is which
 

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:42.560
ecosystem of companies which is which
are running

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:42.570
are running
 

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.379
are running
out of Bangalore you have and if you

00:23:45.379 --> 00:23:45.389
out of Bangalore you have and if you
 

00:23:45.389 --> 00:23:48.110
out of Bangalore you have and if you
take I'm really talking from a ICT

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120
take I'm really talking from a ICT
 

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.249
take I'm really talking from a ICT
perspective information and

00:23:49.249 --> 00:23:49.259
perspective information and
 

00:23:49.259 --> 00:23:51.499
perspective information and
communication technologies and given

00:23:51.499 --> 00:23:51.509
communication technologies and given
 

00:23:51.509 --> 00:23:53.149
communication technologies and given
that we normally think of these things

00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159
that we normally think of these things
 

00:23:53.159 --> 00:23:58.310
that we normally think of these things
in stacks and layers you have Intel at

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320
in stacks and layers you have Intel at
 

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.700
in stacks and layers you have Intel at
the bottom of the stack then you have

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:01.710
the bottom of the stack then you have
 

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.570
the bottom of the stack then you have
companies like Microsoft which are

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580
companies like Microsoft which are
 

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.549
companies like Microsoft which are
building operating systems and things

00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559
building operating systems and things
 

00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:09.100
building operating systems and things
like that then you have left several

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:09.110
like that then you have left several
 

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.180
like that then you have left several
infrastructure and product companies and

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:11.190
infrastructure and product companies and
 

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:14.539
infrastructure and product companies and
you have to complete you have many

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:14.549
you have to complete you have many
 

00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:17.389
you have to complete you have many
services companies like Infosys IBM PC

00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:17.399
services companies like Infosys IBM PC
 

00:24:17.399 --> 00:24:20.029
services companies like Infosys IBM PC
so I think the complete ecosystem is

00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039
so I think the complete ecosystem is
 

00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:23.450
so I think the complete ecosystem is
there and today you probably can think

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:23.460
there and today you probably can think
 

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.999
there and today you probably can think
of newer innovations and then like I

00:24:25.999 --> 00:24:26.009
of newer innovations and then like I
 

00:24:26.009 --> 00:24:29.659
of newer innovations and then like I
said build them and then take them to

00:24:29.659 --> 00:24:29.669
said build them and then take them to
 

00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:31.490
said build them and then take them to
the customers or consumers without

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500
the customers or consumers without
 

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.360
the customers or consumers without
really going anywhere else now or a

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:35.370
really going anywhere else now or a
 

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.889
really going anywhere else now or a
period of time maybe in the last 15 to

00:24:36.889 --> 00:24:36.899
period of time maybe in the last 15 to
 

00:24:36.899 --> 00:24:39.499
period of time maybe in the last 15 to
20 years this has happened why each of

00:24:39.499 --> 00:24:39.509
20 years this has happened why each of
 

00:24:39.509 --> 00:24:41.299
20 years this has happened why each of
these companies are chosen to come here

00:24:41.299 --> 00:24:41.309
these companies are chosen to come here
 

00:24:41.309 --> 00:24:43.519
these companies are chosen to come here
maybe there are other there are reasons

00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:43.529
maybe there are other there are reasons
 

00:24:43.529 --> 00:24:44.930
maybe there are other there are reasons
like talent and weather and stuff like

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940
like talent and weather and stuff like
 

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.159
like talent and weather and stuff like
that but whatever may be the reason

00:24:46.159 --> 00:24:46.169
that but whatever may be the reason
 

00:24:46.169 --> 00:24:49.039
that but whatever may be the reason
today this ecosystem got established and

00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:49.049
today this ecosystem got established and
 

00:24:49.049 --> 00:24:52.669
today this ecosystem got established and
you are able today you can actually come

00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679
you are able today you can actually come
 

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:54.080
you are able today you can actually come
up with an innovation and build the

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.090
up with an innovation and build the
 

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:58.159
up with an innovation and build the
entire thing and to it and take to take

00:24:58.159 --> 00:24:58.169
entire thing and to it and take to take
 

00:24:58.169 --> 00:25:03.049
entire thing and to it and take to take
to the market crack of that in fact we

00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059
to the market crack of that in fact we
 

00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:04.190
to the market crack of that in fact we
were having this conversation just

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200
were having this conversation just
 

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.930
were having this conversation just
yesterday at ISC Bangalore I was

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:05.940
yesterday at ISC Bangalore I was
 

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.759
yesterday at ISC Bangalore I was
visiting bulky and Balram was the

00:25:07.759 --> 00:25:07.769
visiting bulky and Balram was the
 

00:25:07.769 --> 00:25:10.009
visiting bulky and Balram was the
director so if you look at Silicon

00:25:10.009 --> 00:25:10.019
director so if you look at Silicon
 

00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:12.769
director so if you look at Silicon
Valley for example I think without maybe

00:25:12.769 --> 00:25:12.779
Valley for example I think without maybe
 

00:25:12.779 --> 00:25:14.779
Valley for example I think without maybe
with some argument people would merely

00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:14.789
with some argument people would merely
 

00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:19.519
with some argument people would merely
agree that the creation of HP was the

00:25:19.519 --> 00:25:19.529
agree that the creation of HP was the
 

00:25:19.529 --> 00:25:22.249
agree that the creation of HP was the
seed the big bang that created Silicon

00:25:22.249 --> 00:25:22.259
seed the big bang that created Silicon
 

00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:23.419
seed the big bang that created Silicon
Valley right I mean there were other

00:25:23.419 --> 00:25:23.429
Valley right I mean there were other
 

00:25:23.429 --> 00:25:25.190
Valley right I mean there were other
companies around it but I think

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200
companies around it but I think
 

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.950
companies around it but I think
approximately everybody agrees that so

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960
approximately everybody agrees that so
 

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.440
approximately everybody agrees that so
I've posed this question to balky

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:30.450
I've posed this question to balky
 

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.119
I've posed this question to balky

IOT I said what was that seed I mean
what was a big bang that happened in

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:37.110
what was a big bang that happened in
 

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:39.200
what was a big bang that happened in
Bangalore that created this universe

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:39.210
Bangalore that created this universe
 

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.419
Bangalore that created this universe
