00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.300
 This is Lilly, also known as SuperÅ¾ena on YouTube. And as a female member 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.790
 she experiences her menstruation every month. You know, when I first got my period 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.050
 I had no idea what was going on. I went to the laundry, tra la la la, undressed my underwear 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 and I said, "What is it?". Because I didn't talk to anyone about it, so I was concerned. 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.750
 My mind was ruby. "Did I fall on my bike today?" I didn't have a couple what was happening. 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.080
 I'm sure most girls will go through the way you hate it, but you can't look elsewhere. 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.870
 So I thought, "I'm dying, I'm dying." What you may or may not realize 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.800
 is that every time a woman is menstruated, it is because her body is preparing 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.460
 to get pregnant and have a baby. Do you know what keeps our species? 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.920
 Yes. Every month the female body goes through incredibly complex and fascinating 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.610
 transformation called the menstrual cycle. It all starts in the ovaries that everyone contains 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.090
 over 100,000 eggs. Once a month one egg is released which takes about 3 days 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.200
 the way to the uterus and during the journey, the uterus begins to form the lining 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.479
 which is rich in nutrients and everything necessary to create life. Under certain circumstances, 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.969
 sperm fertilizes the egg and starts pregnancy in the uterus. However, before this, female 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.200
 the ovaries increase the production of estrogen and progesterone hormones and these hormones 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.600
 support and maintain a certain lining. But hormones also enter 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.200
 into the blood and travel through the whole body including the brain. It's obvious that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.859
 and progesterone tends to collide with other chemical linkers in the brain 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.979
 called neurotransmitters. And this can lead to a known premenstration syndrome or 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.979
 also called PMS. "WHY is MENSTRUACE so FUCKING ?!" ... science. 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.179
 So here are the different substances in my brain and they're all completely deranged, playing with my mind every month. 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.950
 I mean, science plays with me with my consciousness. I'm annoying and anxious, and that's what I am 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.659
 she hadn't even started menstruating. Which brings interesting knowledge: PMS is not the same 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.470
 like menstruation, which is probably one of the greatest myths ever. It actually starts 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.910
 7-14 days before the girl has any signs of bleeding. This is because the levels of estrogen and progesterone 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.970
 as they build the lining they rise. About 50-80% of women have experienced 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.750
 some degree of physical or psychic symptoms of PMS, but many are not even aware of it. 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.390
 PMS may occur before menstruation itself, but the present time keeps myths 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.310
 that it is the menstruation that causes these hormonal changes. PMS can 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.140
 manifest as a psychological symptom such as mood changes. I hate you so much 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.140
 But at the same time, you are the cutest, but I want to kill you. Rage. Cry. 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.760
 Irritability. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. Or as psychic symptoms 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:03.490
 such as abdominal pain, insomnia, nausea. One woman's PMS is not the same as other women, 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.120
 which is why professional medical workers have difficulty finding a clear and obvious understanding of how it all works 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.780
 works. Other psychological changes also appear. Amygdala in the brain that controls 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.190
 emotion, increasing its activity. We also observed lower levels of well-felt serotonin 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.240
 and gaba neurotransmitters that have anti-anxiety effects, causing stress and anxiety to increase. 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.170
 Oh, okay, so, you're wondering why I feel like this when all these things happen 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.050
 in my body? Because I can become a big poison and I can't control it. It's like: 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.240
 "I want to kiss you, but I don't want you to touch me." Because you're pretty looking, etc, 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.810
 but I also hate you. And I want the mountains of chocolate. And here I think about it 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.810
 maybe I have a bad day, or I'm crazy because it doesn't happen 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.520
 at the same time as my menstruation. But no, it could just be a PMS. But when menstruation 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.220
 begins, these hormone levels fall rapidly. If there is no fertilization, 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.390
 estrogen and progesterone levels decrease and the body becomes aware that nothing is happening. 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.010
 And as a result, a layer that has formed for a potential fetus begins to fall. 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.060
 And this sloughing of the membrane and the mucosa cannot go anywhere but out, which of course does 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.300
 also your hooks. But this is what happens when a really funny part starts. 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.990
 Because even if there is not the same amount of hormones moving in my brain, I have to spit out the unused 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.979
 Mucous membrane and blood from my body. Actually, it's fun because it causes it 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.310
 convulsions and bloating, and the wonderful need to go out but not to be able to do so. 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.370
 Of course, when it ends, the cycle starts again all over again and the cycle that is needed 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.520
 to maintain our human species. So when I don't have my day, dude, you know, 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.860
 I'm doing it for humanity. Because there are only a few fixed cycles in the world. 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.639
 The sun rises and sets. high tide and low tide. And my menstruation. So do it. Fact. 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.759
 The woman is super okay? We'll be giving autographs all night. Really. Without 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.030
 a permanent menstrual cycle, our existence of humanity 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.669
 would disappear completely. So even though this event may cause these mood changes, 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.569
 so it's definitely worth it. So thank you to the women for dealing 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.840
 with PMS and menstruation. We owe you one for this. Don't forget to visit this amazing
