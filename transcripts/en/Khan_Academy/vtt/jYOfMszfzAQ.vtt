00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.520
Let's think about exponents
with ones and zeroes.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.330
So let's take the
number 1, and let's

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.084
raise it to the eighth power.

00:00:10.084 --> 00:00:11.500
So we've already
seen that there's

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.890
two ways of thinking about this.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.348
You could literally view this
as taking eight 1's, and then

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:16.450
multiplying them together.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.158
So let's do that.

00:00:17.158 --> 00:00:21.557
So you have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:00:21.557 --> 00:00:26.010
eight 1's, and then you're
going to multiply them together.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.966
And if you were to do that,
you would get well, 1 times 1

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.340
is 1, times 1--
it doesn't matter

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.560
how many times you
multiply 1 by 1.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.170
You are going to just get 1.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.204
You are just going to get 1.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.120
And you could imagine.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.300
I did it eight times.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.820
I multiplied eight 1's.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.070
But even if this was
80, or if this was 800,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.480
or if this was 8 million,
if I just multiplied 1--

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.490
if I had 8 million 1's, and I
multiplied them all together,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.760
it would still be equal to 1.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.474
So 1 to any power is just
going to be equal to 1.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:59.640
And you might say, hey,
what about 1 to the 0 power?

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.850
Well, we've already said
anything to 0 power,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.300
except for 0--
that's where we're

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.450
going to-- it's
actually up for debate.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.269
But anything to the 0 power
is going to be equal to 1.

00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:14.810
And just as a little
bit of intuition

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.290
here, you could
literally view this

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.840
as our other definition
of exponentiation, which

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.160
is you start with a
1, and this number

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.820
says how many times you're
going to multiply that 1 times

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.580
this number.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.021
So 1 times 1 zero times
is just going to be 1.

00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:32.020
And that was a little bit
clearer when we did it

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.930
like this, where
we said 2 to the,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.710
let's say, fourth power
is equal to-- this

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.190
was the other definition
of exponentiation we had,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.040
which is you start with a
1, and then you multiply it

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.280
by 2 four times, so times
2, times 2, times 2,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.850
times 2, which is equal to--
let's see, this is equal to 16.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.350
So here if you start
with a 1 and then

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.057
you multiply it by
1 zero times, you're

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:03.890
still going to have
that 1 right over there.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.320
And that's why anything
that's not 0 to the 1 power

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.360
is going to be equal to 1.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.070
Now let's try some other
interesting scenarios.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.370
Let's start try some
negative numbers.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.760
So let's take negative 1.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.950
And let's first raise
it to the 0 power.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.070
So once again,
this is just going,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.740
based on this definition,
this is starting with a 1

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.899
and then multiplying it
by this number 0 times.

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:32.440
Well, that means
we're just not going

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.690
to multiply it by this number.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.620
So you're just going to get a 1.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.720
Let's try negative 1.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.310
Let's try negative 1
to the first power.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.800
Well, anything to the first
power, you could view this--

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.890
and I like going with
this definition as opposed

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.800
to this one right over here.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.290
If we were to make
them consistent,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.880
if you were to make
this definition

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.830
consistent with this, you would
say hey, let's start with a 1,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.110
and then multiply
it by 1 eight times.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.480
And you're still going to
get a 1 right over here.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.070
But let's do this
with negative 1.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.270
So we're going to
start with a 1,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.410
and then we're going to multiply
it by negative 1 one time--

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.950
times negative 1.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.660
And this is, of course, going
to be equal to negative 1.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.270
Now let's take
negative 1, and let's

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.440
take it to the second power.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.979
We often say that
we are squaring it

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.770
when we take something
to the second power.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.830
So negative 1 to the
second power-- well,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.650
we could start with a 1.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.620
We could start with a 1, and
then multiply it by negative 1

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.630
two times-- multiply
it by negative 1 twice.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.327
And what's this
going to be equal to?

00:03:34.327 --> 00:03:35.910
And once again, by
our old definition,

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.060
you could also just say,
hey, ignoring this one,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.935
because that's not going
to change the value,

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:42.260
we took two negative 1's
and we're multiplying them.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.580
Well, negative 1
times negative 1 is 1.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.440
And I think you see
a pattern forming.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.780
Let's take negative
1 to the third power.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.840
What's this going
to be equal to?

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.820
Well, by this definition,
you start with a 1,

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.890
and then you multiply it
by negative 1 three times,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.945
so negative 1 times
negative 1 times negative 1.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:08.570
Or you could just
think of it as you're

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.736
taking three negative 1's
and you're multiplying it,

00:04:10.736 --> 00:04:12.630
because this 1 doesn't
change the value.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.560
And this is going to be equal
to negative 1 times negative 1

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.730
is positive 1, times
negative 1 is negative 1.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.910
So you see the pattern.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.240
Negative 1 to the 0 power is 1.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.420
Negative 1 to the first
power is negative 1.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.930
Then you multiply
it by negative 1,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.221
you're going to get positive 1.

00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:30.190
Then you multiply it by negative
1 again to get negative 1.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.840
And the pattern
you might be seeing

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.240
is if you take negative
1 to an odd power you're

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.100
going to get negative 1.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.130
And if you take it
to an even power,

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.839
you're going to get 1 because
a negative times a negative is

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:47.880
going to be the positive.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.270
And you're going to have an
even number of negatives,

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.811
so that you're always going to
have negative times negatives.

00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:56.639
So this right over
here, this is even.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:57.930
Even is going to be positive 1.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.138
And then you could see that
if you went to negative 1

00:05:00.138 --> 00:05:01.480
to the fourth power.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.350
Negative 1 the fourth power?

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.720
Well, you could start
with a 1 and then

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.180
multiply it by negative 1 four
times, so a negative 1 times

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.510
negative 1, times negative
1, times negative 1,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.450
which is just going to
be equal to positive 1.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.960
So if someone were to
ask you-- we already

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.120
established that if someone were
to take 1 to the, I don't know,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.430
1 millionth power, this is
just going to be equal to 1.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.350
If someone told you
let's take negative 1

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.210
and raise it to the 1 millionth
power, well, 1 million

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.730
is an even number,
so this is still

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.870
going to be equal to positive 1.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:58.600
But if you took negative
1 to the 999,999th power,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.380
this is an odd number.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.606
So this is going to be
equal to negative 1.
