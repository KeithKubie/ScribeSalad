Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and today

Speaker 2:          00:05          we begin on a plane. Thank you Brooke, which carried our newly married producer Tim Howard to the Galapagos. So I took the plane from Quito. We had just finished the honeymoon that morning. They make announcements and the certain point, the flight attendants, they open up all of the overhead bins and they walk up and down spraying some sort of insecticide for what? For like uh, invasive species I think. Yeah, like whatever bugs might've snuck on in the brain. But at this point I'm getting super excited and I'm thinking about Darwin and I start reading voyage of the Beagle, his book on this nook that I had bought for the trip, but then my power supply didn't work and my nook died. Does a big problem for Darren to run out of power. His book. Oh God. And then the islands come into site. What is the color of the Pacific Ocean when you look up the plane window?

Speaker 2:          01:06          That was actually the first thing I noticed. It's this totally wild, like I've never seen like this story book, blue, green iridescent aqua marine and I'm thinking like, wow, this is going to be like dropping into another world, you know, like nature and its purest form. My version was is my dream and what it would be like is you landed on it and it's sort of like low grassy knoll and an enormous turtle comes by. The one that you could sit on the top of it and it wouldn't notice that you were there just going to meet to the airport just wandering by and basically that's very similar to what I was

Speaker 1:          01:41          picturing, but maybe we need to land, we take the 40 minute bus ride to play for Yara or Toyota, which turns out to be kind of a big town. Tons of people live there. It's like a fishing village. Tons. No, it's way bigger than a fishing village. And just let me say that my first hours in Galapagos were totally different than I was expecting. I'm sort of the first thing that really just like, where the hell am I? I am walking through the towns kind of late Sun is just starting to set me actually walking down to Charles Darwin Avenue, just kind of getting the lay of the land. When all of a sudden [inaudible] this line of cars comes around the corner honking, endless honking and they're waving flags, blue flags. At first I didn't know what that was happening, but turns out it was an election and I was just really blown away that this continued this procession for like 15 minutes.

Speaker 1:          03:02          And I remember asking him one guy on the up though, they're driving so slow, I can just walk up to them and say, I'm, I've got it. Oh, I sold a car. I'm like, who's your candidate? And they're like, I didn't know who the guy was, but it turns out he was the incumbent and I'm like, fucking it up. Is he going to win? And this guy he like doesn't even say anything. He just kind of points you like points at the cars in front and behind as if like, dude, seriously. You see how many of us there are?

Speaker 1:          03:30          But then at a certain point I noticed this one guy by himself standing on the sidewalk wearing a white shirt and jeans. He's waving a flag, but his flag is a different color. It's white and it's really loud. But I go up to him and I yell at him, who is your candidate? And he said, I am a candidate. And I'm like, what are you seriously? So his name is Leon [inaudible] [inaudible] he is a naturalist guide. You actually ended up meeting a lot of people employed that way in Galapagos and he tells me so old, so young, outsider, politically, politically speaking, he's an outsider. And of course I'm wondering why he's standing there by himself waving a flag at this entire parade of people who don't support him at all. And he tells me, cl Momento I'm nervous. [inaudible] if the party in power now the front runners, if they get elected, they will [inaudible] [inaudible] and I see a dark and uncertain future. Grand Hotel is more big hotels, more of these enormous boats, more people [inaudible] if things keep going this way, who's going to stand up for nature? This is Radiolab and we are dedicating the entire hour to this little set of islands. And to that question, as the world is filling up with more and more and more people, is it inevitable that even the most sacred, pristine places on the planet will eventually get swallowed up? And how far are we willing to go to return a place to what it was before we got there? And more importantly, can we,

Speaker 3:          05:14          oh, I'm never a doubter. Okay, so this is Linda. Linda Caio currently the science advisor for Galapagos Conservancy. I began my work in Galapagos in 1981 she first came to study tortoise's. Back then, you know, Galapagos was really isolated,

Speaker 1:          05:32          barely any cars, super limited electricity.

Speaker 3:          05:35          All I remember is having a smile on my face all the time because you know, as a biologist going to Galapagos is like going to Mecca.

Speaker 4:          05:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          05:46          she says you have islands with massive volcanoes, forests, tree ferns that grow, you know, well above a human's height.

Speaker 1:          05:54          Yeah, I mean powerful. You know, there's

Speaker 5:          05:58          green mangroves, baklava flows and pink flamingos.

Speaker 2:          06:01          This is Mateus Espinosa, a naturalist guide in the Galapagos. And like Linda, he says that when he first got to the Galapagos in the 80s, he couldn't believe that the place was real to his breast taken. He visited an island called

Speaker 5:          06:15          if an Andina and the first thing that I saw was a lava fluid was moving. I said, what's going on? You No, no, no, that's lava throws her leg. 1000 CE Guan as taking a sunbath

Speaker 2:          06:32          and he says he would go on these dive.

Speaker 6:          06:35          Can you imagine

Speaker 5:          06:38          schools of hammerhead sharks like 508 tendent passing in front of you like tuna? I mean like, like sardines. It shows you the power. It shows your old for evolution. There is where evolution is very strong.

Speaker 2:          06:54          Okay, so quick context, uh, Galapagos islands, cluster of islands, way off the coast of Ecuador in the Pacific, 19 bigger islands, bunch of smaller ones. And this is the place, of course, we're, Darwin landed in 1835 and as he went island to island, he started noticing that there were all these creatures that were really similar to each other, but also a little bit different. The tortoise's had different shells depending on the kind of island they lived on. The finches look similar, but their peaks were always a little bit different. And this gets him thinking, what if it isn't the way that everybody always says? What if God didn't create every single species in the beginning and leave them unchanged? What if in fact life is purely change? What if everything has been changing all the time? Darwin's five weeks on Galapagos pushed him to develop his theory of evolution. And that's also why when we think of evolution, we think of the Galapagos and in particular we think of two iconic creatures, the tortoise

Speaker 6:          08:00          and the fence.

Speaker 1:          08:04          Let me start by telling you about the tortoise. It's hot, it's bright. It's such a perfect day for tortoise. Something are not hunting. But you know, looking for fourth day I was there, um, I went to the island of Floriana, which Darwin visited and they're up in the highlands basically in the middle of this yard. Oh my God. There are these three massive tortoises just clustered together under a tree. Wow. That is fricking amazing. Describe them. What are they look like? These are such alien looking creatures. They are like the size of, Geez, I don't even know what they're massive. They look like they would crush you to death. Well now how many years these guys have been here for? They can live for over 150 years. Wow. This is a tour. It is trying to get over a branch. [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          09:01          who is that? That is a sound of a tortoise breathe.

Speaker 6:          09:05          That's cool.

Speaker 3:          09:06          So Linda, when she first went to Galapagos to study these torts is about 30 years ago. I did a trip where we backpacked around the Caldera. She took a trip to this island called Isabella hiked up the side of a volcano and looked at all the tortoise country and it was an impenetrable forest, basically tortoise heaven. And what makes it so perfect for tortoises is in the dry season in Galapagos that go Roula, which is a very, very thick mist, comes onto the island. It rolls over this forest and it catches in the branches of the tree.

Speaker 7:          09:42          The water then drips down from the top of the trees down to the ground.

Speaker 3:          09:47          Creating what we call drip pools,

Speaker 7:          09:51          which provides tortoises with water during the dry season and they like to rest in water. And so there under the trees you have these ponds with dozens of tortoise domes just rising out of the water.

Speaker 3:          10:06          So that was my first experience. It was a magical, magical area. And then, um, I actually didn't get back there for maybe 15 years from when I was there the first time. And when I returned that forest was 100% gone.

Speaker 7:          10:27          The drip pools were just dry dust bowls. Wow. There was no shade tortoises where we're sitting out in the sun or, or crowded around the couple of stalks that were still there. This is Carl Campbell. I work for island conservation and I'm based here in the Galapagos Islands. Carl was actually the guy who showed me those tortoises. It was just a, yeah, it was a barren landscape. Yeah. Barren, barren grounds. What happened to the forest? Um, goats. Goats. And that was definitely not what I thought you were going to say. I thought you were gonna say people, it was kind of a collaboration. So here's the story.

Speaker 8:          11:06          Goats were originally sort of brought to the Galapagos, um, probably by pirates and wireless back in the 15 hundreds. You had tons of sailors making these, these long voyages across the Pacific. And uh, Galapagos was the, a, the major port on, on the wailing route and where, yeah, you'd come and get fresh water, but you'd also come in and pick up a tortoise's land tortoises and Yang boats and take away several hundred of them often and turn them upside down and they can last for up to a year and a half in the whole of the ship. Like

Speaker 7:          11:37          lying there upside down. Yeah, lying there upside down in order to make space for the tortoise's. The whalers and pirates would often take goats that they'd brought with them and throw them onto the islands. That way when they're on their way back and sick of eating tortoises, they could grab those goats. So whalers and Buccaneers, they introduced goats to Galapagos. But on islands like Isabella, which is this massive island size of Rhode Island, the goats were actually penned in to just a little part of it because there was this black lava rock that ran across the island, [inaudible] rough lava that's extremely difficult to walk across 12 miles of it. So that had acted as a barrier basically with goats on one side toward us on the other. But according to Linda, some time in the late 1970s the goats got brave. We were probably talking just a few goats.

Speaker 8:          12:31          Bye.

Speaker 3:          12:31          The 1990s those few goats, the population had exploded. And you need about 100,000 to go. And if you think of 100,000 goats eating everything in their path, every sort of plant, even the bark off of trees, they destroy the forest.

Speaker 7:          12:52          So now they had a dilemma. On the one hand, the tortoise's needed help. On the other hand, you had all of these goats that didn't choose to be on the island. You know, it wasn't their fault. And the goats that were out there were gorgeous. You know, they had curled horns, different colored for just beautiful animals and they'd been there for 500 years.

Speaker 8:          13:13          Some people were concerned, you know, with the goats have their own sort of, if you will, right to be there. Those arguments came up frequently to which Carl would respond. Yeah. Are we going to let tortoise's go extinct? Yeah. There's thousands of islands around the world that have goats on them. These tortoises are only found here. So where do your values lie?

Speaker 6:          13:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          13:32          and so in 1994 we had what we called the tortoise summit in England and that was where we started the discussions about what are we gonna do? Experts came from all over the world. Linda says, we want to get rid of the goats. And many of them thought we were nuts and that it was impossible. There's 100,000 of them. So many doubters. Carl says he even heard the idea, why don't you put lines?

Speaker 8:          13:58          Yeah, they eat goats in Africa. You know, why don't you get lions on there? And those are, you know, really interesting ideas. But at some point they're going to get hungry and they're going to start eating all the other things that yeah, you treasure by the occasional tourist.

Speaker 7:          14:12          In any case, after endless planning and meetings took eight years, I think they commence

Speaker 6:          14:21          project Isabella,

Speaker 5:          14:25          so the helicopters we used, they're called MD five hundreds small helicopter there for four passengers with one pilot, single turbine, five blades. This is Frasier Fraser Sutherland. I was the engineer pilot and a sharp shooter 2004 through to 2006 almost every day. During that time Frazier would fly over Isabella island. Two guys were two shooters are the side of the helicopter. What you do is so you come across and you're flying along and you might see one guy says, you follow that go as it ran away till join his friends. Do you have to find all those other guides? Circle of real low. You'd fly around them, around them up, try and get them in a single group, and then

Speaker 9:          15:04          you start picking off the goats one by one by one.

Speaker 5:          15:09          And there are actually videos online where you see these packs of goes

Speaker 9:          15:13          running for their lives and then dropping to the ground.

Speaker 7:          15:21          The last goat or two might sort of run into a area where it's impossible to read.

Speaker 5:          15:26          I would actually go into caves and what we'd do is we'd find a location as close as we could or right on top of the cave, drop out one of the two shooters that was in the helicopter and he'd physically go into the cave, shoot the goats out, or shoot them on site.

Speaker 7:          15:42          And then you go on and actually in under a year through this aerial attack, they end up wiping out 90% of the goats on Isabella. But to give an example of the nature of this business, that's Josh Donlin, he runs an NGO that was involved in project Isabella. It's relatively easy to remove 90% of a goat population from an island. But as they become rare and rare, they're harder and harder to detect. The goats become quote, educated. They learn that this sound yeah

Speaker 5:          16:11          means

Speaker 7:          16:14          so the goats start hiding. So they'll go onto bushes, they won't move to learn to stand under a tree, holding their breath. And so you end up flying around and an expensive helicopter not fighting. And it goes. Now the way we deal with that, it's an interesting one. We use this technique called Judas goats. Yeah, Judas codes. Initially it was Carl suggestion, buzz goats, uh, a gregarious and like being in groups. They're herd animals, right? And so, uh, the technique that we would use was

Speaker 5:          16:46          fire up your helicopter. You fly around, he'd find some, go to capture goats, capture them, lie, and then come back back to base camp, offload them and

Speaker 7:          16:57          put a radio collar on him and you throw him back on the island and then you wait. Instinctively that lone guy will go and find out the goats a week. Two weeks go by, you fire up the helicopter, they get back over to the island with this little device,

Speaker 10:         17:17          it's a directional antenna. Start Tracking the Judas go till they spot it with some other goats and then everyone gets shot except the Judas go. They let it go, finds more friends, and then everyone gets shot except the Judas go and then they do it again. Everyone gets shot except the Judas go. And you do that about every

Speaker 7:          17:46          two weeks for a year. Oh my God. And that is how they go from 90% go free to 91 to 92 to 93 to 94 [inaudible]. It's like having a pogrom on you over and over and over again. Jesus. It gets worse. Now Judas, Skoda is a good Judas go until it gets pregnant because then it doesn't want to be social anymore. It goes off and has this kid and is very solitary, which is the last thing you want when you're trying to get goats off islands. So Carl kept mulling this problem. What would it take to basically make, you know, the perfect year disco, the Ideal Judas Code, if you will, um, is it goat that would search for and be searched for and that would never get pregnant. So Carl Campbell figured out a technique where we could sterilize them in the field. It grabbed the goats stardom and then in a matter of minutes, SnipSnap did you do this?

Speaker 7:          18:38          Yeah. Well, I, I stood next to Carl and watched him do it and Carl took it one step further and he actually gave these females hormone implants, basically put them into heat for an extended duration. Normally a female goat would be in heat for maybe a couple of days. These females would go for more than 190 days. And wherever they went, they would lower those male goats out of their caves. So that, you know, all in all over the course of this two year program, we had hundreds of Judas goats out. And using those goats, they were able to go from 94% goat free to 96 to 97 to 98. And basically when you have only Judas goats meeting up with other Judas Coats, then you can say the goats have been eliminated. You're done a point. They got to, at least on Isabella in mid 2006,

Speaker 9:          19:32          uh,

Speaker 7:          19:34          this kind of eradication program was far beyond anything that anyone had ever done anywhere in the [inaudible] because it turns out they weren't just doing this on Isabella island. No, we're talking about island by island. Over the course of about seven years, they eliminate over 250,000 goats.

Speaker 6:          19:59          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          20:00          so you, um, you complete that with Isabella and did at work. Yeah. The results of this were absolutely impressive. You had plants reemerging, you had trees growing back, and in a really short period of time, and this allowed for those important drip pools and tortoises, they basically got their home back.

Speaker 11:         20:23          This is the real thing. Tortoise is walking around [inaudible] crazy man.

Speaker 7:          20:37          So they did it. They got all the goats, not all the goats.

Speaker 11:         20:40          What do you mean there's Judas Scouts?

Speaker 7:          20:43          They kept them around. Why? I would just, I would have shot them first just out of sympathy for them.

Speaker 2:          20:48          Yeah, exactly. Well, they needed the goats because, well, there was the problem of people

Speaker 9:          21:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          21:04          because during the 90s these demonstrations started.

Speaker 9:          21:07          That happened.

Speaker 5:          21:10          Demonstrations, outrage, violent activity, constant conflict. To explain [inaudible] [inaudible]. This is Augustine Lopez, longtime fisherman, and he told me that in the 70s and eighties [inaudible] lobster was fished all year round [inaudible] no restrictions. And then fishermen started making a killing fishing sea cucumber because there was this huge demand. But then the national park comes in, same group that's doing the goat eradication and they tell the fishermen they're overfishing, the sea cucumber. They've got to limit their catch. And the fishermen are like, who are you to tell me that I can't feed my family? So they lash out. They marched down in Charles Darwin Avenue. They would come down the street throwing rocks and sticks and everything. And that's Paul Watson, founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. He was there counter protesting, and he says that at one point they went after national park buildings and they were attacking the ranger stations with Molotov cocktails. They blockaded roads. They literally drove the Rangers out of the National Park headquarters and took it over on Isabella. They burned down a building. They kidnapped some people, including some of my crew. And they even killed dozens of tortillas.

Speaker 2:          22:27          It says sledding their throats according to some accounts. They even hung them from trees. Uh, so not only that, but according to Linda, those goats, couple islands where they've been eliminated, fishermen have put them back. Really? Oh yeah. And so what they decided to do is leave the Judas goats on various islands where they can live out their sterilized days, chomping on grass, sharing war stories until such time

Speaker 5:          23:03          as they might be needed again.

Speaker 2:          23:11          [inaudible] this is the war between the Greens and the and the fisherman and such. Is that still hot and difficult and are they still, you know, killing tortoises and they're not the fisherman? Um, they seem to have stopped, you know, taking over national park and killing tortoise's. You know, why it, it's a combination of reasons. On the one hand, fishermen have started to participate in the actual fisheries management more because it seems like they realize if they're going to keep their livelihood, they can't just fish everything out. But then at the same

Speaker 1:          23:46          time, the tourism economy has been taking off, and so all of these fishermen, they find that it's easier for them to actually survive by using their boats, um, to take tourists around island to island. So they're all kind of converting over into the tourism economy. Huh. We're going to take a short break. This is Radiolab. We'll be back with producer Tim Howard and this hour on Galapagos in just a moment.
