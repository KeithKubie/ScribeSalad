00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:11.200
What’s the deal with airplane fuel?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.469
Have you ever wondered if you can you put
jet fuel in a car and make it go faster?

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:15.969
Like, a rocket car!

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.289
Well, the answer is yes and no, because even
though at the core, jet fuel and car fuel

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.410
are similar, they are actually so, so different.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.260
Most cars and jets are powered through some
sort of combustion.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.289
Cars have an internal combustion engine and
jets gas turbine engine.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.899
Which means they both rely on a heat source
or explosion to power the engine.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.289
In most cases, this requires some sort of
combustible fossil fuel, which of course is

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:39.860
derived from oil.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.050
But that is where the similarities stop.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.039
To understand the differences between jet
fuel and car fuel you need to understand oil.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.470
The black slick stuff that comes out of the
ground.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.760
It contains aliphatic hydrocarbons.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.190
In other words, molecules of just hydrogen
and carbon.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.130
But depending on how many hydrogen and carbon
atoms there are, the molecules behave differently.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.660
When a hydrocarbon chain has only one carbon
and four hydrogen, it’s super light and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.660
makes methane.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.720
As more atoms are added to the chain, naturally
the molecule gets heavier alters its properties,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.869
becoming another gas.

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.400
So for instance, two carbon atoms and six
hydrogen atoms make ethane (C2H6), propane

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.760
is C3H8 and butane is C4H10.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.310
The C7 to C11 range make gasoline.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.250
Airplane fuel is derived from much heavier
chains, kerosene, in the C12 to C15 range.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.960
These two fuels actually have similar properties
but one of the key differences between gasoline

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.180
and kerosene is their flash point.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.509
The main reason airplanes use kerosene is
safety.

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.100
Kerosene has a higher flashpoint then car
gas, which means it takes a higher temperature

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.780
to ignite kerosene.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.880
This is important when you have a lot of it
and it's around a lot of people, like say

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.810
a major airport.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.060
Kerosene is also easily transported and is
readily available around the world.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.340
Also, kerosene can stay in liquid form longer
at low temperatures, which is important when

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.799
you’re flying thousands of feet in the air
when temperature can reach 34 degrees below

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.920
zero Celsius or more.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.060
Now there are two main types of jet fuel depending
on where you are in the world, Jet A's and

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.230
Jet A-1.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:14.030
Jet A is available mostly in the US and has
a freezing point of −40 °C, while Jet A-1

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.610
is used in the rest of the world.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.910
It has a lower freezing point of −47 °C.
Frozen jet fuel would be disastrous.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.080
And to make quality jet fuel, additives are
injected to help stop things like static build

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.900
up, which can create a spark, an anticorrosive
agent, a de-icing agent, and even an antimicrobial

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.750
agent to stop bacteria and fungus growing
and clogging the engine.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.560
Obviously, the gas you put in your car doesn’t
need all of this.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.670
The bottom line is, car fuel and jet fuel
are made differently from the start, and your

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.930
car can’t run on kerosene and doesn’t
really need to be prepared for such low temperatures.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.730
Also, jet fuel is super expensive, often over
$4 a gallon.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.090
But even after all that, there is one instance
jet fuel and one type of car fuel are actually

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.200
kind of similar.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.260
Turns out jet fuel is a lot like diesel.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.310
So much so you can actually power a diesel
powered truck with it.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.800
(although apparently you might want to add
a lubricant).

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.300
But if you put it in your regular car, it
would be just like putting diesel in it, it

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.710
just kind of stalls out, because of the way
diesel engines and gasoline engines differ.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.301
Diesel engines compress the fuel at a different
ratio than gasoline engines to get the fuel

00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:16.301
hot.

00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:19.760
So your car’s gasoline engine just won’t
get the jet fuel hot enough to spark.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.980
But it still could damage your engine.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.220
BUMMER.
