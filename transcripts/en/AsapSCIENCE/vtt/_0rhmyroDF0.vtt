00:00:00.045 --> 00:00:03.145
Mars has always been a hypothetical second home for humans,

00:00:03.145 --> 00:00:08.440
but with plans to actually start sending people and colonising the red planet as soon as the next decade,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.740
would you have what it takes to get to and live on Mars?

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.980
Your first challenge is getting through the launch.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.060
High levels of g-force can damage the body

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.740
and at around 9gs most humans black out from lack of blood to the brain.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:23.155
As a result, human missions are limited to around 3gs,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.600
or 3 times the force of gravity on earth,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.800
which astronauts are trained to withstand.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.140
So if you can survive the first few minutes without rocket system failures or depressurisation issues,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.680
then your other concern is protecting yourself from the Sun's radiation.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.360
Leaving Earth's atmosphere and its protection,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.000
you have an increased risk of cancer and damage to your Central Nervous System.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.760
You'd wanna go when Earth and Mars are most closely aligned,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.580
which only happens every 2 years,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.140
and you'll spend almost 150 days on your one way trip.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.075
You might also want to consider removing your gallbladder and appendix for your extended flight,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.145
as it could protect those organs from bursting due to pressure changes.

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.860
Now that your body is transitioning to micro gravity,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.260
you'll start to feel the negative effects of weightlessness.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.080
Your bodily fluids will shift upwards throughout your body,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.140
causing headaches and temporary blindness,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.080
and you can also expect your digestive system to slow down as your body adjusts.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.140
Because of limited space, you'd be wearing the same clothes for a long duration.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.640
Even astronauts on the ISS wear their underwear for up to a week,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.800
which is why female astronauts are more prone to getting UTIs in space.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.055
NASA's research shows that astronauts can lose

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.720
upto 1% of bone mineral and density per month.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.980
If you're willing to work out about 2 hours a day,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.520
like the astronauts aboard the ISS do, you'll have a better chance of counteracting this.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.300
Sex could help too, but it might be a bit difficult

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.760
due to Newton's 3rd law, a couple's every movement would counteract the other.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.900
Que the 2SUIT: A space suit made for two that zips like a sleeping bag,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.960
preventing pushing away from one another.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.055
Once you've landed on Mars, you'll instantly start to notice the differences between

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.640
your new home and Earth.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.560
Mars is further from the Sun, so the temperature ranges between -140° Celsius to 30° Celsius,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.680
but that doesn't mean you can just walk outside on warmer days.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.240
Earth's atmosphere is about 100 times more dense than Mars',

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.720
so you won't be protected from the Sun's radiation.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.400
This means you might have to get used to living in an underground habitat.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.680
Leaving your habitat, you'd likely wear a sweaty, 50 lb spacesuit

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.360
to protect your blood from boiling,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.160
or your organs rupturing from the lack of atmospheric pressure.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.140
The food would be freeze-dried food packed with nutritional requirements that tastes okay but

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.520
has a mushy texture, until your botanist can grow fresh fruit, vegetables and greens.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.880
You'd have to get used to seeing no vegetation growing outside naturally,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.000
or any people or animals moving about.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.760
Using NASA's Mars Simulation research, you'd likely be living in a habitat

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.780
the size of a small, 900 square ft apartment with a handful of other martians.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.800
You'd need to get along with people, or it may be difficult to find people to mate with

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.920
and grow a colony.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.220
Genetic diversity is an important part of keeping large groups healthy.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.160
Not having enough people to mate with often leads to inbreeding,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.300
which research shows can lead to the loss of more than 80% of the diversity within a gene,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.100
causing your small community to be vulnerable to extinction through disease.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.714
Old research suggests that a new colony would need about 150 people

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.100
to preserve genetic variation, but newer studies suggest the the number is

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.400
between 10,000 and 40,000 people needed.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.820
If that's true, you may have to wait a few months for more Martians to arrive

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.680
before you get jiggy.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.140
Even knowing theses risks, you'd also have to pass

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.900
a space agency's astronaut test before going,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.360
which are physically and mentally rigorous. But if you were accepted,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.160
would you wanna go?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.760
If you wanna know more about what life would actually be like living on Mars,
