(digital jingle)

00:00:05.183 --> 00:00:08.266
(light upbeat music)

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:32.746
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:33.854
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:36.020
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.452
Our guest today is
Marion Nestle who is the

00:00:39.452 --> 00:00:43.407
Paulette Goddard Professor in
the Department of Nutrition,

00:00:43.407 --> 00:00:47.445
Food Studies, and Public
Health at New York University.

00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:51.278
She chaired that department
from 1988 to 2003.

00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:57.135
She is also Professor of Sociology at NYU

00:00:57.135 --> 00:01:01.179
and Visiting Professor of
Nutritional Sciences at Cornell.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.136
At Berkeley in 2017, she is
the Barbara Weinstock lecturer

00:01:06.136 --> 00:01:08.393
on the morals of trade.

00:01:08.393 --> 00:01:11.455
Her many publications
include Food Politics,

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:15.804
How the Food Industry
Influenced Nutrition and Health,

00:01:15.804 --> 00:01:20.072
Safe Food, the Politics of
Food Safety, What to Eat,

00:01:20.072 --> 00:01:23.368

Guide to Food Politics,

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:30.199
and most recently Soda Politics,

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:32.782
Taking on Big Soda and Winning.

00:01:33.873 --> 00:01:36.850
Professor Nestle, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.350
- Glad to be back.

00:01:39.414 --> 00:01:40.881
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:42.231
- In New York City.

00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:45.592
- And looking back, how did
your parents shape your thinking

00:01:45.592 --> 00:01:47.034
about the world?

00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:51.201
- Well, my father was a bit
of an anarchist and was very

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:56.394
interested in social justice
so I grew up in one of those

00:01:56.394 --> 00:01:59.021
families where those were big issues.

00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:01.558
- And was there a lot of
reading in the household?

00:02:01.558 --> 00:02:04.505
- There was quite a lot of reading.

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:05.338
Yeah, we read.

00:02:05.338 --> 00:02:07.742
We read newspapers, that's a habit I've,

00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:09.294
it's a lifetime habit.

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:12.828
- And keeping up with political
events and world events?

00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:14.710
- Mm hmm (affirmative).

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.844
- When did you first get
the food / nutrition bug,

00:02:18.844 --> 00:02:21.322
if I can use that expression?

00:02:21.322 --> 00:02:25.489
And what first piqued your
interest in not just eating food

00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:28.243
but studying it?

00:02:28.243 --> 00:02:31.601
- Well, actually, the eating
food was a really profound

00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:35.001
experience because I went
to a summer camp in Vermont

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:39.168
and if you, the people who ran
the camp were fabulous cooks.

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:45.288
And they had a very large
vegetable garden that supplied

00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:46.963
the food for the camp.

00:02:46.963 --> 00:02:48.475
It was a small camp.

00:02:48.475 --> 00:02:49.998
And if you were good then you got to go

00:02:49.998 --> 00:02:51.851
pick the vegetables for dinner.

00:02:51.851 --> 00:02:54.679
And I remember, I was about
eight or nine years old

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:58.937
and was sent out in mid-summer
to pick string beans

00:02:58.937 --> 00:03:02.898
and I started picking them
and then I bit into one

00:03:02.898 --> 00:03:05.810
and I couldn't believe it.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.038
It was warm from the sun,
it was sweet, it was crisp,

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:10.882
it was absolutely delicious.

00:03:10.882 --> 00:03:13.331
I had never tasted a
bean like that before.

00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:16.398
That got me interested in food.

00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:18.565
- And what about politics?

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.117
Were you growing up in New
York City and was there

00:03:26.058 --> 00:03:29.308
a real sense of political developments?

00:03:30.207 --> 00:03:32.285
- Well, actually, I grew
up in Los Angeles because

00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:35.554
my family moved to Los
Angeles when I was 12.

00:03:35.554 --> 00:03:38.996
But I was given a nutrition
course to teach on my first

00:03:38.996 --> 00:03:43.163
teaching job and it was obvious
right from the beginning

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:47.113
that you couldn't really
understand why people ate

00:03:47.113 --> 00:03:51.385
the way they did unless you
understood the politics of it.

00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:55.070
And I remember giving students
in that class a series

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.132
of articles in the New York review

00:03:57.132 --> 00:03:59.783
of books on sugar politics.

00:03:59.783 --> 00:04:02.896
Right from the beginning,
so it was always there.

00:04:02.896 --> 00:04:04.780
- And where were you educated?

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.726
- Berkeley.

00:04:05.726 --> 00:04:06.559
- Berkeley?

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:08.302
And you got your BA here?

00:04:08.302 --> 00:04:10.876
- I have four degrees from Berkeley.

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:13.490
An Associate of Arts,
a Bachelor's of Arts,

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.849
a Doctorate, and a
Master's in Public Health.

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:21.836
- And, but you also studied
microbiology here or is that?

00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:24.777
- Yes, I was an undergraduate
bacteriology major.

00:04:24.777 --> 00:04:28.054
I did my Doctorate in molecular
biology and then I did

00:04:28.054 --> 00:04:31.087
a Master's in public health
nutrition quite a bit later.

00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:33.756
- And at Berkeley did you have any mentors

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:36.288
who especially influenced you?

00:04:36.288 --> 00:04:40.460
- Well, in, when I was in
graduate school, certainly.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.716
As an undergraduate, I was just
trying to figure it all out.

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:48.352
- And were you here during
the political turmoil

00:04:48.352 --> 00:04:49.736
of the '60s?

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:52.719
- I was here during the
political turmoil of the '50s

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:53.802
and the '60s.

00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:57.628
You know, when I was an
undergraduate it was when the

00:04:57.628 --> 00:05:01.187
Civil Rights movement was
starting and the women's movement

00:05:01.187 --> 00:05:04.945
was starting and when I
was a graduate student,

00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:06.992
it was the free speech movement.

00:05:06.992 --> 00:05:11.247
- And were you drawn
into those happenings?

00:05:11.247 --> 00:05:14.317
- Very much drawn into it
but I had two small children

00:05:14.317 --> 00:05:18.118
and there was no way that I
could put myself in a position

00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:20.652
where I could be arrested
because I wouldn't have anyone

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:22.487
to take care of my children.

00:05:22.487 --> 00:05:25.025
So I understood why it
was so difficult for women

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:27.652
to be revolutionaries.

00:05:27.652 --> 00:05:31.819
- And, of course, the revolution
was creating a revolution

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:36.119
in women's consciousness at the time.

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:37.680
- [Marion] Yes.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.680
- I like to ask my guests
what skills they think

00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:46.553
students should acquire if, for example,

00:05:46.553 --> 00:05:49.703
they want to go into nutrition studies.

00:05:49.703 --> 00:05:51.952
How would you advise them?

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:54.869
Is there, doing nutrition research,

00:05:56.807 --> 00:05:59.803
what does it take to do that well?

00:05:59.803 --> 00:06:02.086
- Well, I think you only need
to know how to do research

00:06:02.086 --> 00:06:06.057
in general and that means
an undergraduate program

00:06:06.057 --> 00:06:08.591
that teaches you how to use a library,

00:06:08.591 --> 00:06:10.433
how to search for information,

00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:13.883
how to check whether
information is accurate or not,

00:06:13.883 --> 00:06:16.794
how to think critically
about the information

00:06:16.794 --> 00:06:18.877
that you are looking for.

00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:24.026
I happened to do graduate
work in molecular biology

00:06:24.026 --> 00:06:28.193
and what I think I got out
of that was always trying

00:06:29.854 --> 00:06:34.698
to think about what alternative
explanation there could be

00:06:34.698 --> 00:06:37.399
for the result that you
thought you were getting.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:40.674
Critical thinking in
biology, the game when I was

00:06:40.674 --> 00:06:45.350
a graduate student was to
try to think of something

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.758
that could have accounted for the results,

00:06:47.758 --> 00:06:51.598
that hadn't been controlled
for in the experiments.

00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:53.762
That's proved very useful

00:06:53.762 --> 00:06:56.350
in thinking about nutrition research.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.517
- And also there's an
emphasis on a problem that has

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.652
been defined by the field?

00:07:03.652 --> 00:07:07.819
The reason I ask that is the
political aspect of your work

00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:10.608
is very different.

00:07:10.608 --> 00:07:14.472
So where I'm going here is
to compare your scientific

00:07:14.472 --> 00:07:17.472
studies with your sense of politics.

00:07:18.847 --> 00:07:21.675
- Well, I think what happened
with nutrition science

00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:25.848
was a huge change in the
nutrition problems in the world.

00:07:25.848 --> 00:07:30.518
Nutrition science started
out looking at what nutrients

00:07:30.518 --> 00:07:34.216
were required by the human
body and in what amounts.

00:07:34.216 --> 00:07:37.466
And that research was straight forward,

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.809
not politically fraught
in any way whatsoever,

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:46.745
the results were clear and understandable.

00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:50.885
Where the complications came
in were trying to see how

00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:54.070
experimental results
applied to populations.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.811
But there wasn't anything
controversial about it.

00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:01.526
When nutrition got controversial
was when chronic diseases

00:08:01.526 --> 00:08:04.757
became the leading causes
of death and disability

00:08:04.757 --> 00:08:07.807
in the United States and
in developed countries.

00:08:07.807 --> 00:08:11.974
And then, nutritionists needed
to look at dietary patterns

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:17.077
and instead of producing
dietary advice that encouraged

00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:22.193
people to eat more of things
that were required in the diet,

00:08:23.093 --> 00:08:25.423
they were talking about eating less.

00:08:25.423 --> 00:08:27.749
Eating less saturated
fat, eating less salt,

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:30.786
eating less sugar and all
of a sudden it got very,

00:08:30.786 --> 00:08:34.228
very political because
that stepped on the toes

00:08:34.228 --> 00:08:36.636
of the companies that were
making those products.

00:08:36.636 --> 00:08:40.408
- And when did this
change in thinking occur?

00:08:40.408 --> 00:08:43.783
- Well, I think it started in 1950s.

00:08:43.783 --> 00:08:48.249
I mean, there are books
in the 1950s that have,

00:08:48.249 --> 00:08:52.710
Ancel Keys, for example, who's
a cardiologist in Minnesota,

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:57.009
did a cookbook with his
wife in the late 1950s

00:08:57.009 --> 00:08:59.344
with dietary recommendations
in it that look like

00:08:59.344 --> 00:09:01.700
today's dietary guidelines.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.375
I mean, they've never changed.

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:07.117
Eat less sugar, eat less
saturated fat, eat less salt,

00:09:07.117 --> 00:09:08.798
eat a lot of fruits and vegetables,

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:12.143
don't gain too much weight, I mean really,

00:09:12.143 --> 00:09:14.031
basic dietary advice.

00:09:14.031 --> 00:09:17.939
So that was already known in the 1950s.

00:09:17.939 --> 00:09:21.781
It just took a long time to
come into public consciousness,

00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:25.752
particularly because the food
industry fought it so hard.

00:09:25.752 --> 00:09:29.549
- And when, how does this
change you're talking about

00:09:29.549 --> 00:09:34.291
relate to the industrialization
of agriculture and

00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:36.902
especially after World War II?

00:09:36.902 --> 00:09:38.621
In other words, is there
an interface there?

00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:39.889
- Oh, absolutely.

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:44.059
What happened with
agriculture was that there was

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:48.226
the policies used to be
we'll pay farmers not to grow

00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:53.985
very much food in order to
keep the price of the foods

00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:56.560
high enough to support the farmers.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.727
That changed in the 1970s.

00:10:00.284 --> 00:10:05.210
The famous Earl Butz, who
was Secretary of Agriculture,

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.149
said these policies are wrong,
we should be encouraging

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:11.460
farmers to grow as much
food as they possibly can.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.877
And they did and what happened
then was that there was

00:10:14.877 --> 00:10:17.530
an enormous surplus of food.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.827
Farmers were very good at
growing more when they were

00:10:19.827 --> 00:10:24.089
rewarded for growing more
and the price of food,

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:25.885
of basic food commodities,

00:10:25.885 --> 00:10:28.916
dropped because there was so much of it.

00:10:28.916 --> 00:10:32.065
And then food comp-, and the
number of calories in the food

00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:35.700
supply increased and food
companies had to figure out

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.047
how to sell their food
products in an environment

00:10:39.047 --> 00:10:41.630
in which there was way too much food,

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.126
far more than the population needed.

00:10:44.126 --> 00:10:47.376
And that's been the problem ever since.

00:10:49.456 --> 00:10:53.539
- And, now, in your awakening,
in terms of the politics

00:10:53.539 --> 00:10:57.051
of this, was that gradual over time?

00:10:57.051 --> 00:11:00.801
You mentioned your first
teaching assignment,

00:11:01.756 --> 00:11:05.359
you also were in the
government for a while,

00:11:05.359 --> 00:11:09.526
but was what you were seeing
with regard to the problems

00:11:11.187 --> 00:11:14.854
of food production, how
did that come about?

00:11:16.473 --> 00:11:17.306
Over time?

00:11:18.233 --> 00:11:19.586
- Oh, no, I had an epiphany.

00:11:19.586 --> 00:11:20.419
- I see.

00:11:20.419 --> 00:11:23.624
- And that epiphany occurred at a meeting

00:11:23.624 --> 00:11:27.912
of the National Cancer
Institute in the early 1990s.

00:11:27.912 --> 00:11:30.120
The people who were at that,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.847
this was a meeting on
behavioral causes of cancer

00:11:33.847 --> 00:11:36.618
and they had a couple of
people talking about diet

00:11:36.618 --> 00:11:41.122
and a lot of physicians who
were anti-smoking advocates

00:11:41.122 --> 00:11:43.417
talking about cigarette smoking.

00:11:43.417 --> 00:11:46.902
And I had never, I mean, I
knew that cigarettes were bad

00:11:46.902 --> 00:11:50.222
for you and I knew they caused cancer,

00:11:50.222 --> 00:11:54.716
but I had never seen presentations
of cigarette marketing

00:11:54.716 --> 00:11:57.872
before and the people who
spoke at this conference

00:11:57.872 --> 00:12:02.736
showed slide after slide after
slide of cigarette marketing

00:12:02.736 --> 00:12:05.883
all over the world, in
the remote Himalayas,

00:12:05.883 --> 00:12:08.050
in the jungles of Africa.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.162
And then someone got up
and did a presentation

00:12:11.162 --> 00:12:15.338
on cigarette marketing to
children and this was the days,

00:12:15.338 --> 00:12:17.956
these were the days of Joe Camel,

00:12:17.956 --> 00:12:22.525
and I knew about Joe Camel,
I had seen Joe Camel ads,

00:12:22.525 --> 00:12:26.547
but I had never paid any
attention to them before.

00:12:26.547 --> 00:12:30.240
They were so much a part of
the landscape that they were

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.140
easy to ignore, you just
paid no attention to it.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.207
And yet, this presentation made
it clear that the cigarette

00:12:37.207 --> 00:12:40.446
industry was deliberately
targeting children in just

00:12:40.446 --> 00:12:43.753
in hundreds and hundreds
of different ways.

00:12:43.753 --> 00:12:46.958
And I walked out of that
presentation thinking,

00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:51.125
we should be doing this for
Coca Cola, we nutritionists.

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:55.180
And I started paying attention.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.492
- And then after you had your
degrees you actually went

00:12:58.492 --> 00:13:02.575
and worked for the government
and was an advisor,

00:13:04.163 --> 00:13:06.080
or rather a programmer,

00:13:07.934 --> 00:13:11.131
for the writing of the guidelines.

00:13:11.131 --> 00:13:15.889
- No, I was a, I worked for the
Office of Disease Prevention

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:19.162
and Health Promotion in
Health and Human Services as

00:13:19.162 --> 00:13:22.068
what was called the Senior
Nutrition Policy Advisor,

00:13:22.068 --> 00:13:23.789
a very fancy title.

00:13:23.789 --> 00:13:26.325
What I was actually
doing was editing a book

00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:29.886
called The Surgeon General's
Report on Nutrition and Health

00:13:29.886 --> 00:13:32.169
that came out in 1988.

00:13:32.169 --> 00:13:35.147
- And that's when you got a
shock, which was you were told

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:36.950
there were certain things
you couldn't write?

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.397
- Oh, on my first day on the job.

00:13:39.397 --> 00:13:41.649
I was told the Surgeon General's Report,

00:13:41.649 --> 00:13:44.061
no matter what the research said,

00:13:44.061 --> 00:13:46.843
would never say eat less meat.

00:13:46.843 --> 00:13:49.501
It would find some other kind
of euphemism for it but it

00:13:49.501 --> 00:13:53.032
would never say eat less
meat because if it did

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:54.431
the Department of Agriculture,

00:13:54.431 --> 00:13:57.786
which represented the meat
industry, would get very upset.

00:13:57.786 --> 00:13:59.374
They would go to Congress and the report

00:13:59.374 --> 00:14:01.228
would never come out.

00:14:01.228 --> 00:14:02.903
So it used euphemisms.

00:14:02.903 --> 00:14:06.595
- So you're, this is a
step-by-step process in a way.

00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:09.173
And at first you're
learning about advertising

00:14:09.173 --> 00:14:10.194
and being shocked by that.

00:14:10.194 --> 00:14:11.385
- [Marion] No, actually that came later.

00:14:11.385 --> 00:14:13.052
- That came later,
well, it doesn't matter.

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.280
The sequence doesn't matter.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.261
- Mm hmm (affirmative).

00:14:15.261 --> 00:14:18.153
- But it's really, but
hey, the government,

00:14:18.153 --> 00:14:21.792
which is supposed to helping
in this process of informing

00:14:21.792 --> 00:14:25.030
people about food is shackled.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.215
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:14:26.215 --> 00:14:29.315
And, I mean, I had those
two years in Washington

00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:30.701
were revelatory.

00:14:30.701 --> 00:14:34.529
I mean, I learned things I
didn't even know I didn't know

00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:35.640
on that job.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.446
I mean, I had no idea how
politicized these things were

00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:43.208
and how you had to, this was,
after all, during the Reagan

00:14:43.208 --> 00:14:47.649
administration, and I
was dealing with people

00:14:47.649 --> 00:14:50.619
in the Department of
Agriculture who were very eager

00:14:50.619 --> 00:14:54.702
to protect the meat
industry, the dairy industry,

00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:57.306
the food processing industry,

00:14:57.306 --> 00:15:01.264
all of the major food industries
were under the protection

00:15:01.264 --> 00:15:03.762
of the Department of Agriculture.

00:15:03.762 --> 00:15:06.548
Because the people who
worked there were very much

00:15:06.548 --> 00:15:10.569
in favor of corporate
agriculture and corporate food

00:15:10.569 --> 00:15:14.736
production and found these
health issues to be, you know,

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:19.831
recommending people eat
less of these things,

00:15:19.831 --> 00:15:21.674
that was un-American.

00:15:21.674 --> 00:15:23.507
- I'm curious how your

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.200
work as a nutritionist interfaces

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.033
with your activism as
somebody who's concerned

00:15:35.414 --> 00:15:37.664
about the politics of this.

00:15:39.432 --> 00:15:42.432
Do the two backgrounds challenge you

00:15:44.145 --> 00:15:47.084
or do the perspectives inform each other?

00:15:47.084 --> 00:15:49.125
- Oh, I can't separate them.

00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:52.804
I mean, when I think about these
problems I think about them

00:15:52.804 --> 00:15:55.835
from the science all
the way to the advocacy

00:15:55.835 --> 00:15:58.171
and everything in between.

00:15:58.171 --> 00:16:01.406
I don't think it's possible
to talk about dietary

00:16:01.406 --> 00:16:04.185
recommendations or what
people should be eating

00:16:04.185 --> 00:16:07.546
without understanding how
the food system works.

00:16:07.546 --> 00:16:10.829
How the agriculture system
works, where the pressures are,

00:16:10.829 --> 00:16:13.162
who the stakeholders
are, all of those things

00:16:13.162 --> 00:16:14.716
are all part of it.

00:16:14.716 --> 00:16:18.602
- But you were also a
front runner, a leader,

00:16:18.602 --> 00:16:21.569
in identifying this connection.

00:16:21.569 --> 00:16:22.877
- Apparently.

00:16:22.877 --> 00:16:26.359
I thought I was just stating the obvious.

00:16:26.359 --> 00:16:30.526
That I was, my book Food
Politics, which came out in 2002,

00:16:31.886 --> 00:16:34.883
was really the first to talk
about these kinds of issues

00:16:34.883 --> 00:16:38.623
but I thought I was just
describing what was obvious

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:40.961
to anybody who looked.

00:16:40.961 --> 00:16:41.901
- But it wasn't?

00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:43.206
- [Marion] Apparently not.

00:16:43.206 --> 00:16:46.655
- And it wasn't obvious
to the general public?

00:16:46.655 --> 00:16:47.968
- Apparently not.

00:16:47.968 --> 00:16:48.801
- Yeah.

00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:53.739
And as you talk about nutrition
and the change of thinking

00:16:53.739 --> 00:16:56.559
in nutrition one gets a
sense because it's food

00:16:56.559 --> 00:17:01.183
and we all eat, it
interfaces with developments

00:17:01.183 --> 00:17:05.771
in the world, namely changes
in what people are eating

00:17:05.771 --> 00:17:08.668
because of the politics
of a production system.

00:17:08.668 --> 00:17:12.766
- Well, and also, we have a
globalized food system in which

00:17:12.766 --> 00:17:16.899
companies sell foods all over
the world and you can go to

00:17:16.899 --> 00:17:19.928
a supermarket in the dead
of winter in Manhattan

00:17:19.928 --> 00:17:22.995
and buy blueberries
from Chile or Argentina.

00:17:22.995 --> 00:17:25.366
I mean, that's a globalized food system.

00:17:25.366 --> 00:17:28.516
- And so then what are the
challenges of the interface

00:17:28.516 --> 00:17:29.980
between these two?

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.147
Is it, does, do you have to
think twice about the conclusion

00:17:35.463 --> 00:17:40.152
you're reaching because of
the interface with politics?

00:17:40.152 --> 00:17:41.583
Or not?

00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:45.468
- Well, I can't separate
the politics from either

00:17:45.468 --> 00:17:49.514
the science or the production
or the public health aspects.

00:17:49.514 --> 00:17:52.509
I mean, the politics are
always part of it because

00:17:52.509 --> 00:17:56.676
if you are advising the public
to eat more of one thing

00:17:58.253 --> 00:18:02.099
and less of another, you're
stepping on somebody's toes

00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:05.266
big time, especially if people listen.

00:18:06.772 --> 00:18:09.149
- The reason I'm pushing you on this

00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:13.232
is that your perspective
is unique in other areas

00:18:15.157 --> 00:18:19.380
because part of the
American political culture

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.885
is not seeing the politics
in issues like healthcare

00:18:23.885 --> 00:18:24.864
and so on.

00:18:24.864 --> 00:18:27.365
- Well, I would hope that
people would see the politics

00:18:27.365 --> 00:18:28.198
in healthcare today!

00:18:28.198 --> 00:18:32.647
- No, I'm, right, I'm
not being critical here,

00:18:32.647 --> 00:18:36.169
I'm just sort of saying
the extent to which,

00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:40.676
oh, that's politics, I don't
want to know how that affects.

00:18:40.676 --> 00:18:42.685
So it's a, what I'm trying to say is that.

00:18:42.685 --> 00:18:43.876
- Well, I hear that from students.

00:18:43.876 --> 00:18:44.737
- [Harry] Yeah.

00:18:44.737 --> 00:18:47.103
- You know, I teach
courses in food politics

00:18:47.103 --> 00:18:50.737
and food policy and the
students are extraordinarily

00:18:50.737 --> 00:18:53.999
uncomfortable thinking about the politics.

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:56.617
It's not something that
they're comfortable with,

00:18:56.617 --> 00:18:59.611
they don't feel like they
want to participate in it,

00:18:59.611 --> 00:19:02.278
feels kind of dirty, and remote.

00:19:04.775 --> 00:19:08.268
And part of what I try to do
is to show that every single

00:19:08.268 --> 00:19:11.174
food choice they make
is a political choice.

00:19:11.174 --> 00:19:14.192
- And is this because
we're, we and the students,

00:19:14.192 --> 00:19:16.442
are passive and they don't,

00:19:18.118 --> 00:19:22.285
the default position is
not to take an active role

00:19:23.267 --> 00:19:25.397
and that's what is required?

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:28.424
- Well, I think that, the
students that I talk to tell me

00:19:28.424 --> 00:19:30.668
that they just don't feel
like they have any power

00:19:30.668 --> 00:19:32.802
to take an active role.

00:19:32.802 --> 00:19:34.653
They don't feel empowered,

00:19:34.653 --> 00:19:37.196
they don't feel like
they're individual actions

00:19:37.196 --> 00:19:38.792
will have any effect.

00:19:38.792 --> 00:19:42.959
The problems of society seem
so enormous and so immutable

00:19:45.131 --> 00:19:46.848
that they don't feel
like they can do anything

00:19:46.848 --> 00:19:50.321
to affect change, especially now.

00:19:50.321 --> 00:19:54.885
So, the part of what I try
to do is to demonstrate

00:19:54.885 --> 00:19:59.103
that the food system has changed
so much and in so many ways

00:19:59.103 --> 00:20:03.761
for the better that you can
use food in a way that will

00:20:03.761 --> 00:20:07.280
make very positive changes in
people's lives and you really

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.628
can have an effect in a time period

00:20:10.628 --> 00:20:13.045
that you can actually notice.

00:20:14.063 --> 00:20:17.980
- Another aspect of your
work and of your books

00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:23.698
is how clearly written they
are and they're written for

00:20:25.575 --> 00:20:29.472
a broad public so that
people can understand things.

00:20:29.472 --> 00:20:33.639
But language is a tool in
this struggle and one gets

00:20:35.759 --> 00:20:39.968
the sense, quite obviously,
that language is a tool used

00:20:39.968 --> 00:20:44.423
by the food industry to
obscure the discoveries

00:20:44.423 --> 00:20:45.567
that are made.

00:20:45.567 --> 00:20:48.146
Talk a little about that
because it's very important.

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:51.819
In other words, we're always
being confronted in advertising

00:20:51.819 --> 00:20:55.986
which with a simple way of
saying something that actually

00:20:56.826 --> 00:21:00.993
obscures the truths that
nutrition science has revealed.

00:21:03.484 --> 00:21:06.925
- Well, advertising is
designed to appeal to emotion,

00:21:06.925 --> 00:21:10.781
it's not designed to appeal
to cognitive structures

00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:14.182
and academics are trying
to appeal to people's

00:21:14.182 --> 00:21:16.802
higher ordered thinking.

00:21:16.802 --> 00:21:19.995
I try to write clearly about
nutrition because I think

00:21:19.995 --> 00:21:24.609
so much of what we know
about nutrition is obfuscated

00:21:24.609 --> 00:21:27.942
by advertising, by the enormous interest

00:21:28.836 --> 00:21:32.233
of the food industry and
selling food products

00:21:32.233 --> 00:21:33.539
beyond anything else.

00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:36.120
I mean, for example, I mean,
I've just written a book

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.685
called Soda Politics and
so I use the soda industry

00:21:40.685 --> 00:21:44.939
as an example because
it's a really easy one.

00:21:44.939 --> 00:21:48.455
And I just saw a student
just, a former student,

00:21:48.455 --> 00:21:51.031
just sent me a photograph
of an advertisement

00:21:51.031 --> 00:21:54.542
on the New York subway where Coca Cola

00:21:54.542 --> 00:21:57.075
is advertising physical activity.

00:21:57.075 --> 00:21:58.952
- [Harry] Mm hmm (affirmative).

00:21:58.952 --> 00:22:01.369
- You know, if you're
active you'll be healthy.

00:22:01.369 --> 00:22:04.232
And then here's Coca
Cola at the bottom of it.

00:22:04.232 --> 00:22:07.299
So you can drink it with the
implication being that as long

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:09.681
as you're walking up the
stairs in the subway,

00:22:09.681 --> 00:22:13.000
you can drink as much
Coca Cola as you like.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.764
- And also the use of words
like moderation and balance.

00:22:17.764 --> 00:22:21.847
- [Marion] Mm hmm (affirmative).

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.547
- So there's a real war here
between the people who want

00:22:29.382 --> 00:22:33.783
to change what we eat and
the people who are producing

00:22:33.783 --> 00:22:35.337
what we already eat.

00:22:35.337 --> 00:22:37.467
- And think that what
we're eating is just fine.

00:22:37.467 --> 00:22:38.690
Sure.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.156
So, everything in moderation.

00:22:41.156 --> 00:22:44.343
You can use that in two
completely different ways.

00:22:44.343 --> 00:22:48.510
I use it all the time because
I happen to, I love to eat,

00:22:49.364 --> 00:22:52.182
and I don't have any food
restrictions and yes,

00:22:52.182 --> 00:22:55.269
I eat junk food, and yes,
I eat ice cream, and yes,

00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:59.600
I eat all kinds of things
that horrify people.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.847
But that's where I would say

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:03.809
everything in moderation, it's fine.

00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:06.340
I mean, mostly I eat
a pretty healthy diet.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.704
The food industry uses it
in another sense which is

00:23:09.704 --> 00:23:11.895
you can eat our products.

00:23:11.895 --> 00:23:14.063
And their idea of moderation and mine

00:23:14.063 --> 00:23:16.146
might be quite different.

00:23:17.056 --> 00:23:20.415
- And journalism plays a role in this.

00:23:20.415 --> 00:23:24.582
I emphasize the clarity of your
writings because journalism

00:23:26.533 --> 00:23:31.275
is an entry point for keeping
things the way they are

00:23:31.275 --> 00:23:33.521
or changing them.

00:23:33.521 --> 00:23:36.835
- Yes, I wrote a column for
the San Francisco Chronicle

00:23:36.835 --> 00:23:39.564
for about five years so I've
had a little journalistic

00:23:39.564 --> 00:23:43.097
experience and that was
an interesting experience.

00:23:43.097 --> 00:23:47.031
I was writing on deadline,
which I didn't like very much,

00:23:47.031 --> 00:23:51.198
and trying to communicate,
often, very complicated ideas

00:23:52.828 --> 00:23:56.104
in a way that people could
grasp without going through

00:23:56.104 --> 00:23:59.783
all the nuances, which, if
you're a scientist you have

00:23:59.783 --> 00:24:01.333
to have in there.

00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:06.291
It's not easy to write about
nutrition in a simplistic way.

00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:10.092
And when I see journalists
writing about nutrition as

00:24:10.092 --> 00:24:13.652
everything you know about
nutrition was wrong,

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:15.502
discount that one.

00:24:15.502 --> 00:24:20.176
Or, it's really, sugar is the
only problem with the diet,

00:24:20.176 --> 00:24:22.425
fat is the only problem with the diet.

00:24:22.425 --> 00:24:26.775
All of those kinds of things
are journalistic approaches

00:24:26.775 --> 00:24:29.357
that I think oversimplify
and are not helpful

00:24:29.357 --> 00:24:33.677
in the long run but they
make people buy books.

00:24:33.677 --> 00:24:35.677
- And simplicity to work

00:24:36.982 --> 00:24:39.399
has to reveal the complexity,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.490
either of the research or of the politics.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.600
- Yeah, I mean, I think the,

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.933
I love to quote Michael Pollan's comment

00:24:49.836 --> 00:24:52.663
on what people should eat,
eat food, mostly plants,

00:24:52.663 --> 00:24:53.934
not too much.

00:24:53.934 --> 00:24:58.101
I mean, that is an absolutely
brilliant, simply way of

00:25:02.216 --> 00:25:06.284
expressing concepts that are
really quite complicated.

00:25:06.284 --> 00:25:09.367
I thought he did a great job of that.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.067
- The, one of the striking
things when one reads your work

00:25:18.444 --> 00:25:22.335
and when you explore the
arsenal of of the food industry

00:25:22.335 --> 00:25:26.502
is that they use terminology
that across sectors is embedded

00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:31.534
in the political culture.

00:25:31.534 --> 00:25:33.618
What I have in mind is freedom of choice.

00:25:33.618 --> 00:25:35.213
- [Marion] Ah, yes.

00:25:35.213 --> 00:25:39.959
- In other words, we
don't want a police state.

00:25:39.959 --> 00:25:41.040
- A nanny state.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.898
- A nanny state, or a
nutritionist from Berkeley

00:25:44.898 --> 00:25:48.898
telling us what to eat
because we, as Americans,

00:25:49.841 --> 00:25:53.449
pride ourself on freedom of choice.

00:25:53.449 --> 00:25:57.616
We're hearing that in the
medical reform efforts now

00:25:59.111 --> 00:26:03.020
as the opposition tries to
stop things like Obamacare.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.641
Talk a little about that
because it's a real challenge.

00:26:05.641 --> 00:26:07.887
- It's, yeah, it's very,
very difficult to deal with

00:26:07.887 --> 00:26:09.695
but you don't really have a choice.

00:26:09.695 --> 00:26:11.574
You only have a choice of what's there.

00:26:11.574 --> 00:26:14.960
And, of course, they never
talk about the billions

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.241
and billions and billions of
dollars that go into marketing.

00:26:18.241 --> 00:26:21.029
The most profitable
products that are usually,

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:24.302
unfortunately, the most
profitable products are the ones

00:26:24.302 --> 00:26:26.633
that are least healthful.

00:26:26.633 --> 00:26:30.800
So, the budget for just Classic
Coca Cola is 250 million

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.596
dollars a year, just in the United States.

00:26:35.596 --> 00:26:36.456
- [Harry] To advertise?

00:26:36.456 --> 00:26:39.942
- Just for advertising that
goes through advertising

00:26:39.942 --> 00:26:42.939
agencies, just in the United States,

00:26:42.939 --> 00:26:45.717
just for that one product.

00:26:45.717 --> 00:26:49.206
And when you're seeing, when
you're bombarded with messages

00:26:49.206 --> 00:26:52.821
over and over and over again,
you don't even notice them.

00:26:52.821 --> 00:26:55.331
They're just so embedded in
your consciousness that you

00:26:55.331 --> 00:26:58.564
just sort of automatically reach for it.

00:26:58.564 --> 00:27:01.482
So the choice is being influenced.

00:27:01.482 --> 00:27:04.746
The choice is influenced by
the way grocery stores position

00:27:04.746 --> 00:27:09.646
their products, and that's
paid for, that's not random,

00:27:09.646 --> 00:27:11.936
it's totally paid for.

00:27:11.936 --> 00:27:15.492
It's influenced by the
marketing and the way that

00:27:15.492 --> 00:27:20.229
restaurants operate and the way
that grocery stores operate.

00:27:20.229 --> 00:27:24.396
All of this is planned and
so your choice is a choice

00:27:26.246 --> 00:27:31.055
that has to be made in the
context of a lot of economic

00:27:31.055 --> 00:27:33.062
decisions that these companies have made.

00:27:33.062 --> 00:27:34.857
But, of course, you don't see those.

00:27:34.857 --> 00:27:39.024
- And the political perspective
empowers you to see a larger

00:27:44.609 --> 00:27:49.385
structure, which you have to
see to get over the hurdle

00:27:49.385 --> 00:27:53.037
of changing people's
attitude towards food.

00:27:53.037 --> 00:27:54.018
- Oh, I think that's absolutely right.

00:27:54.018 --> 00:27:57.845
One of the reasons why the
Berkeley soda tax succeeded

00:27:57.845 --> 00:28:01.282
was because there was on the
ground one-on-one conversations

00:28:01.282 --> 00:28:05.329
with people trying to
explain to them that here was

00:28:05.329 --> 00:28:09.138
a corporation selling
something that was really bad

00:28:09.138 --> 00:28:11.603
for people if consumed, I
mean, here's where moderation

00:28:11.603 --> 00:28:15.610
comes in, if consumed in large amounts.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:18.080
And that if you want to
protect yourself against some

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.137
of the conditions that are
associated with drinking a lot

00:28:22.137 --> 00:28:24.885
of sugary beverages, you need to look at

00:28:24.885 --> 00:28:29.503
what the corporations are
doing as well as what you like

00:28:29.503 --> 00:28:31.711
or what's been advertised.

00:28:31.711 --> 00:28:34.690
And particularly when that
advertisement has been directed

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.357
particularly at you.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.574
- And so, let's say in the
case of the Berkeley tax,

00:28:41.574 --> 00:28:44.595
it's really important to say, hey,

00:28:44.595 --> 00:28:47.582
this really has health implications.

00:28:47.582 --> 00:28:52.184
I mean, it's affecting your
body in a way that you may

00:28:52.184 --> 00:28:53.042
or may not understand.

00:28:53.042 --> 00:28:56.652
- But it was also
Berkeley against big soda,

00:28:56.652 --> 00:29:01.229
which made it clear that here
was this big corporations,

00:29:01.229 --> 00:29:05.230
the American Beverage
Association, funded by Coca Cola

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:09.147
and PepsiCo, mainly, was
coming in and fighting

00:29:10.995 --> 00:29:12.997
a public health measure.

00:29:12.997 --> 00:29:15.932
That's what they were doing
and that was made very visible

00:29:15.932 --> 00:29:18.099
in Berkeley and I think
that was part of the reason

00:29:18.099 --> 00:29:19.487
for the success.

00:29:19.487 --> 00:29:22.107
- So to bring out the structure.

00:29:22.107 --> 00:29:23.211
- [Marion] The politics, the politics!

00:29:23.211 --> 00:29:25.261
- Yeah, the politics, the politics.

00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:28.214
- Yeah, this doesn't occur
in a political vacuum.

00:29:28.214 --> 00:29:30.785
- Now, now, going back to
what you were saying about

00:29:30.785 --> 00:29:35.418
nutrition, it's interesting
because what you were saying

00:29:35.418 --> 00:29:40.388
is that in a way nutrition
changed because of what doctors

00:29:40.388 --> 00:29:44.273
were seeing in terms of chronic illness.

00:29:44.273 --> 00:29:48.440
So the environment, in many
ways, impinges on the thinking

00:29:52.767 --> 00:29:55.710
and other sectors are helping inform us.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:59.346
So you were a person
who, as a nutritionist,

00:29:59.346 --> 00:30:03.899
clarifies it and gives
us these works on issues.

00:30:03.899 --> 00:30:08.648
But you're also getting help
from doctors who are, in a way,

00:30:08.648 --> 00:30:11.223
seeing the effect of the bad food.

00:30:11.223 --> 00:30:13.807
- Well, I would say it's,
these are public health

00:30:13.807 --> 00:30:16.460
implications and there was a big shift

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.297
after the second World War.

00:30:18.297 --> 00:30:21.739
From, remember, before
the second World War,

00:30:21.739 --> 00:30:26.115
one of the really difficult
problems that they had

00:30:26.115 --> 00:30:29.101
inducting people into the
Army was that people suffered

00:30:29.101 --> 00:30:31.881
from nutritional deficiencies,

00:30:31.881 --> 00:30:35.354
especially if they came from poor areas.

00:30:35.354 --> 00:30:39.521
And after the war, the food
supply improved enormously

00:30:40.766 --> 00:30:43.601
because we had figured
out how to get food across

00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:48.259
the country, the transportation
system improved enormously.

00:30:48.259 --> 00:30:51.371
And all of a sudden, much
more food was available,

00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:53.952
people were eating more,
and people started getting

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:57.146
heart disease, people
started developing obesity,

00:30:57.146 --> 00:30:59.312
they started getting Type II diabetes.

00:30:59.312 --> 00:31:03.539
These were diseases that
had been quite rare before

00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:06.160
and now, all of a sudden,
they were common and everybody

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.635
was seeing them.

00:31:07.635 --> 00:31:11.270
And it took a while for
researchers to try to figure out

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:14.171
what diet had to do with that.

00:31:14.171 --> 00:31:16.307
I think people were just
eating more and that was

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:17.890
the bigger problem.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.889
- Let's talk a little
about the food industries.

00:31:20.889 --> 00:31:22.650
You've touched on some of this before,

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.199
but let's clarify it for our audience.

00:31:26.199 --> 00:31:30.450
The dilemma of the food
industry is they're producing

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:34.098
too much food and they have to sell it

00:31:34.098 --> 00:31:35.786
in a competitive environment.

00:31:35.786 --> 00:31:37.185
- Well, that's the overall dilemma.

00:31:37.185 --> 00:31:38.198
- Yeah.

00:31:38.198 --> 00:31:41.345
- The dilemma for an individual company is

00:31:41.345 --> 00:31:42.861
how do I sell my product.

00:31:42.861 --> 00:31:45.027
Well, let's just start with calories.

00:31:45.027 --> 00:31:47.845
So, the American food
supply has an average

00:31:47.845 --> 00:31:51.095
of 4,000 calories available per capita.

00:31:52.305 --> 00:31:55.305
Per capita means little tiny babies,

00:31:56.845 --> 00:32:00.282
sedentary elderly people,
it means everybody.

00:32:00.282 --> 00:32:03.844
It's roughly twice what
the population needs.

00:32:03.844 --> 00:32:08.844
So, if you're a food company
in that situation, you have,

00:32:08.844 --> 00:32:11.177
and you're trying to sell your product,

00:32:11.177 --> 00:32:12.493
and you have to remember,

00:32:12.493 --> 00:32:14.701
if you're a publicly traded company,

00:32:14.701 --> 00:32:18.827
you must report growth to
Wall Street every 90 days.

00:32:18.827 --> 00:32:20.552
It's not enough to make a profit,

00:32:20.552 --> 00:32:22.636
you have to grow your profits.

00:32:22.636 --> 00:32:26.721
The single biggest driver
of obesity, in my opinion,

00:32:26.721 --> 00:32:29.090
is what Wall Street does to companies.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:33.563
So, companies have to
sell and they don't care

00:32:33.563 --> 00:32:35.602
what the public health implications are

00:32:35.602 --> 00:32:36.992
of what they're selling.

00:32:36.992 --> 00:32:40.266
They care a lot about the
economic implications because

00:32:40.266 --> 00:32:44.433
they're shareholders want to
get some dividends out of that.

00:32:47.069 --> 00:32:51.050
So, they find new ways
to sell food products.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:54.291
They make bigger portions,
because the cost of food

00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:56.997
is very cheap, the cost of labor is high,

00:32:56.997 --> 00:32:59.799
you can make a big portion,
it doesn't cost you much,

00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:01.895
and you can make a huge profit on it.

00:33:01.895 --> 00:33:03.754
They put food everywhere.

00:33:03.754 --> 00:33:05.394
Absolutely everywhere.

00:33:05.394 --> 00:33:08.346
So that if you go to a department store,

00:33:08.346 --> 00:33:12.192
there are going to be candy
bars at the checkout counter.

00:33:12.192 --> 00:33:16.359
Drug stores now look like
food stores because there's

00:33:17.705 --> 00:33:20.920
so much profit in selling a
lot of these kinds of things.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.393
Everybody eats, everybody's
going to be buying food.

00:33:24.393 --> 00:33:26.678
And they advertise and market.

00:33:26.678 --> 00:33:30.318
They market to kids, they
market to minorities.

00:33:30.318 --> 00:33:34.205
- And in this warfare between
the people who want us to eat

00:33:34.205 --> 00:33:38.668
well and the companies that
want to sell even the worst food

00:33:38.668 --> 00:33:42.835
they are, food companies
are a moving target because

00:33:44.764 --> 00:33:48.449
whenever something new comes
up, there's a new revelation,

00:33:48.449 --> 00:33:51.156
then they want to package
their product to make it seem

00:33:51.156 --> 00:33:52.423
that they are responsible.

00:33:52.423 --> 00:33:53.606
- [Marion] Oh, yeah,
they're really good at that.

00:33:53.606 --> 00:33:57.773
- Yeah, and so, basically, if
someone identifies a nutrient

00:33:59.111 --> 00:34:02.394
that's important, then that's
plastered all over the,

00:34:02.394 --> 00:34:07.354
it may be added, but then
it's plastered all over the

00:34:07.354 --> 00:34:09.283
box of cereal, say.

00:34:09.283 --> 00:34:13.450
But the issue is eating well
involves your total diet,

00:34:14.997 --> 00:34:18.635
not that you're eating
a particular nutrient.

00:34:18.635 --> 00:34:21.447
- Yeah, and I never talk about
nutrients at all anymore.

00:34:21.447 --> 00:34:22.280
- [Harry] Yeah.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.793
- I mean, just not at all.

00:34:23.793 --> 00:34:27.069
I think they're, for Americans
who have plenty to eat

00:34:27.069 --> 00:34:29.344
and get enough calories and
eat a reasonable variety

00:34:29.344 --> 00:34:32.092
of foods, nutrients are irrelevant.

00:34:32.092 --> 00:34:36.274
There's very, very little
evidence for nutrient deficiencies

00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:38.024
in people in the United States.

00:34:38.024 --> 00:34:40.769
I mean, it's practically non-existent.

00:34:40.769 --> 00:34:42.863
I'm going to go out on a
limb and say that I know

00:34:42.863 --> 00:34:45.074
there are people who disagree
with that but there's

00:34:45.074 --> 00:34:49.241
very, very little evidence for
frank nutrient deficiencies.

00:34:50.936 --> 00:34:54.049
The big problems are the
people who are eating too much.

00:34:54.049 --> 00:34:57.250
And that's a more difficult
problem to deal with

00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:01.047
because there are cultural
factors and societal factors

00:35:01.047 --> 00:35:03.700
that encourage people to
eat more than they need.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:07.541
Restaurants serve big portions
because people love them.

00:35:07.541 --> 00:35:10.196
And people are unaware
of the number of calories

00:35:10.196 --> 00:35:11.997
that they're taking in.

00:35:11.997 --> 00:35:15.921
I mean, I'm always saying
that if I had one thing

00:35:15.921 --> 00:35:19.987
that I could teach people,
it's that larger portions

00:35:19.987 --> 00:35:21.173
have more calories.

00:35:21.173 --> 00:35:23.545
I can't even say it with a straight face

00:35:23.545 --> 00:35:26.244
because it seems so ridiculous.

00:35:26.244 --> 00:35:28.579
But there's plenty of evidence that

00:35:28.579 --> 00:35:31.211
that's not intuitively obvious.

00:35:31.211 --> 00:35:33.111
- It's interesting.

00:35:33.111 --> 00:35:37.912
I interviewed, once, a Vice
President of Coke and the extent

00:35:37.912 --> 00:35:42.465
to which they find
substitutes or alternatives

00:35:42.465 --> 00:35:43.737
for the issue.

00:35:43.737 --> 00:35:47.904
So, at that point Coke was
emphasizing to be active,

00:35:50.334 --> 00:35:51.167
on the other hand.

00:35:51.167 --> 00:35:52.000
- [Marion] Oh, yeah, they still are.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.167
- Yeah and they basically,

00:35:55.618 --> 00:35:58.397
there was an argument about water.

00:35:58.397 --> 00:36:02.564
They had gotten into water
purification and doing good

00:36:04.084 --> 00:36:07.035
in the Third World by purifying water.

00:36:07.035 --> 00:36:11.202
So there's this arsenal is
very subtle and it interfaces

00:36:13.043 --> 00:36:16.710
in a really insidious
way with what might be

00:36:18.067 --> 00:36:19.459
the best information.

00:36:19.459 --> 00:36:22.683
We should be active but
they seem to be saying, oh,

00:36:22.683 --> 00:36:24.521
be active but also drink Coke.

00:36:24.521 --> 00:36:27.096
- Yeah, well, I mean, they're
just trying to sell products.

00:36:27.096 --> 00:36:28.326
That's all.

00:36:28.326 --> 00:36:31.270
You know, if they're a
publicly traded company,

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:33.894
they have to grow their
profits, that means selling more

00:36:33.894 --> 00:36:36.821
and more and more and more.

00:36:36.821 --> 00:36:39.068
And that's what they're about.

00:36:39.068 --> 00:36:40.787
That's their job.

00:36:40.787 --> 00:36:43.367
Public health is a big pain for them.

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:48.350
I mean, Coca Cola started
listing obesity as the number one

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.600
threat to its profits as early as 2003.

00:36:53.674 --> 00:36:58.616
In its filings to the Securities
and Exchange Commission,

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:02.419
where it has to list all
the things that are hazards

00:37:02.419 --> 00:37:06.231
to its profits, obesity
has been number one

00:37:06.231 --> 00:37:09.423
because of public health
people who are saying

00:37:09.423 --> 00:37:13.111
that sugary beverages have
something to do with obesity.

00:37:13.111 --> 00:37:15.241
It's a big problem for them.

00:37:15.241 --> 00:37:18.603
So this puts them, it pits
them against public health.

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:22.770
And, whereas, they would love
to make as much money off of

00:37:23.877 --> 00:37:27.555
bottled water or diet
drinks as they make off

00:37:27.555 --> 00:37:30.869
of Classic Coca Cola, they can't.

00:37:30.869 --> 00:37:32.619
It's more profitable.

00:37:34.355 --> 00:37:38.008
- And the role of
government enters into this.

00:37:38.008 --> 00:37:38.841
- [Marion] Mm hmm (Affirmative).

00:37:38.841 --> 00:37:42.508
- And we've talked
already about advisories,

00:37:43.652 --> 00:37:46.571
of government, about what to eat

00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:48.127
and how they're constrained.

00:37:48.127 --> 00:37:52.294
But a bigger issue is something
like the Agricultural Bill

00:37:54.507 --> 00:37:58.674
which essentially puts in
place a structure of government

00:37:59.983 --> 00:38:04.150
financing which benefits
those production processes

00:38:06.038 --> 00:38:08.009
that are creating too much food.

00:38:08.009 --> 00:38:09.069
- Exactly.

00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:13.236
And also benefits the
ingredients of processed foods

00:38:15.506 --> 00:38:19.847
so that the main agricultural
subsidies or protections

00:38:19.847 --> 00:38:23.035
or insurance payments go
to the producers of corns,

00:38:23.035 --> 00:38:27.485
soy beans, cottonseed,
and so forth and so on.

00:38:27.485 --> 00:38:29.619
Very little of it goes
to fruits and vegetables.

00:38:29.619 --> 00:38:33.786
So you have this curious
contradiction where one office

00:38:34.641 --> 00:38:37.786
of the Department of Agriculture
tells everybody to make

00:38:37.786 --> 00:38:41.627
half their plate fruits and
vegetables and yet there's very,

00:38:41.627 --> 00:38:46.217
very little public Farm Bill
money going into supporting

00:38:46.217 --> 00:38:47.647
fruits and vegetables.

00:38:47.647 --> 00:38:50.588
The last Farm Bill had a
few hundred million dollars

00:38:50.588 --> 00:38:54.514
but that's a rounding error
in the billions and billions

00:38:54.514 --> 00:38:56.686
that go into the Farm Bill.

00:38:56.686 --> 00:39:00.378
It's very, very small and
it's likely to be cut.

00:39:00.378 --> 00:39:02.548
- Yesterday in your lecture,
you pointed out that foods,

00:39:02.548 --> 00:39:06.715
vegetables and fruits, get
.45% of that budget whereas

00:39:09.011 --> 00:39:10.615
tobacco still 2%.

00:39:10.615 --> 00:39:11.684
- [Marion] Got 2%.

00:39:11.684 --> 00:39:13.652
And this was 2008 to 2012.

00:39:13.652 --> 00:39:14.485
- [Harry] Yeah.

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:15.490
- Yeah.

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:16.657
- And so what,

00:39:19.048 --> 00:39:22.482
how can we change the government?

00:39:22.482 --> 00:39:26.565
Look, we just had a foodie
First Lady, basically.

00:39:28.652 --> 00:39:33.394
But one gets the sense that
in addition to promoting

00:39:33.394 --> 00:39:37.806
being active and growing
your own vegetable garden,

00:39:37.806 --> 00:39:42.711
that there was a lot that
the Obamas could not do.

00:39:42.711 --> 00:39:45.875
- Well, that's certainly,
there's one argument about that.

00:39:45.875 --> 00:39:48.012
I thought it was very complicated.

00:39:48.012 --> 00:39:51.429
Mrs. Obama took a leadership role in food

00:39:52.573 --> 00:39:54.705
that was extraordinarily important.

00:39:54.705 --> 00:39:57.408
And the White House garden
gave lots of people to grow

00:39:57.408 --> 00:40:01.077
gardens, gave permission for
lots of people to grow gardens,

00:40:01.077 --> 00:40:04.244
it promoted organic gardening, I mean,

00:40:05.165 --> 00:40:07.081
it just had an enormous effect.

00:40:07.081 --> 00:40:10.108
Very difficult to measure but
I believe it had an enormous

00:40:10.108 --> 00:40:12.109
effect on the food movement.

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:13.673
I mean, I was thrilled.

00:40:13.673 --> 00:40:16.370
Imagine having a First Lady
interested in the same issues

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:17.555
I was interested in.

00:40:17.555 --> 00:40:19.736
That was kind of fabulous.

00:40:19.736 --> 00:40:23.903
But when she came up against
the line in the sand,

00:40:25.789 --> 00:40:28.365
and I believe that
marketing to children is

00:40:28.365 --> 00:40:32.168
the food industry's line in the
sand, and it's one that they

00:40:32.168 --> 00:40:36.697
will not cross, they will
not allow anyone to cross.

00:40:36.697 --> 00:40:40.206
She tried very hard to get
them to back off on marketing

00:40:40.206 --> 00:40:44.373
to children and made at least
two extraordinary, eloquent,

00:40:47.274 --> 00:40:51.322
beautifully, beautifully
constructed speeches about that

00:40:51.322 --> 00:40:53.039
to the food industry.

00:40:53.039 --> 00:40:56.562
But she had no elected
power to do anything.

00:40:56.562 --> 00:40:59.509
She had no elected responsibility,

00:40:59.509 --> 00:41:01.966
she didn't hold a federal office,

00:41:01.966 --> 00:41:04.053
all she had was leadership.

00:41:04.053 --> 00:41:05.410
And they could pay.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:06.309
- [Harry] Moral leadership.

00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:07.452
- Moral leadership.

00:41:07.452 --> 00:41:10.143
This was moral, under moral leadership.

00:41:10.143 --> 00:41:14.849
Which I think had an enormous
effect in ways that are not

00:41:14.849 --> 00:41:19.016
easy to measure but which
didn't change the food system

00:41:20.209 --> 00:41:24.084
in any measurable way
because she couldn't.

00:41:24.084 --> 00:41:28.606
She was opposed at every single
thing she was trying to do

00:41:28.606 --> 00:41:29.711
by the food industry.

00:41:29.711 --> 00:41:32.878
If they didn't like what was happening,

00:41:32.878 --> 00:41:35.962
they went right to Congress
and got an appropriations bill

00:41:35.962 --> 00:41:38.042
to put something in that stopped it.

00:41:38.042 --> 00:41:41.260
And I can think of at least
four examples of that.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.267
Four examples where the food
industry went to Congress

00:41:45.267 --> 00:41:49.434
and got something in an
appropriations bill to make

00:41:50.707 --> 00:41:54.874
ketchup a vegetable, to
allow potatoes to be served

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:59.957
in school meals every
single day, no restrictions,

00:42:01.602 --> 00:42:05.769
to stop an inter-agency
effort to try to set nutrition

00:42:07.897 --> 00:42:12.642
standards for marketing to
children, that was stopped cold.

00:42:12.642 --> 00:42:14.979
And then the business
about he dietary guidelines

00:42:14.979 --> 00:42:17.432
not saying anything about sustainability.

00:42:17.432 --> 00:42:19.348
I mean, these kinds of things,

00:42:19.348 --> 00:42:23.105
these are fighting public
health measures using

00:42:23.105 --> 00:42:26.864
the political system in a
way that most food advocates

00:42:26.864 --> 00:42:28.747
don't have access to
because they don't have

00:42:28.747 --> 00:42:30.723
that kind of money.

00:42:30.723 --> 00:42:33.635
- It's interesting because
what seems to be emerging

00:42:33.635 --> 00:42:37.635
is a picture of a strategy
that on the one hand,

00:42:39.163 --> 00:42:43.096
the power of the food
industry is so systemic that

00:42:43.096 --> 00:42:47.263
the right strategy is to chip
away at one particular sector.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:51.753
- [Marion] Not true.

00:42:51.753 --> 00:42:53.364
- I hope that's, is that a good.

00:42:53.364 --> 00:42:56.029
- I think it's more complicated than that.

00:42:56.029 --> 00:42:59.590
I mean there's been an enormous
change in the food system.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:01.677
If you go to a supermarket today,

00:43:01.677 --> 00:43:03.924
the food in the supermarkets
today is so much better

00:43:03.924 --> 00:43:05.900
than it was 30 years ago.

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.066
It's just that young people
don't remember because

00:43:08.066 --> 00:43:10.869
they weren't here 30 years ago.

00:43:10.869 --> 00:43:15.036
It's really much, much better
and many food companies,

00:43:16.257 --> 00:43:20.424
many restaurants are serving
food that is cleaner,

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:24.301
it's better prepared, it's organic,

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:28.433
it's not made with artificial
colors and flavors.

00:43:28.433 --> 00:43:30.897
I mean, there have been enormous changes

00:43:30.897 --> 00:43:34.899
in the food industry that
come from people voting

00:43:34.899 --> 00:43:38.750
with their fork for the
kind of food that they want.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:42.777
And I don't think you can
underestimate the role

00:43:42.777 --> 00:43:44.876
of individual food choice in that.

00:43:44.876 --> 00:43:46.631
Every time you make a
decision about what you're

00:43:46.631 --> 00:43:49.045
going to be eating, you're
voting with your fork

00:43:49.045 --> 00:43:50.881
for the kind of food system that you want.

00:43:50.881 --> 00:43:54.001
You want a, you buy your
food at farmer's markets,

00:43:54.001 --> 00:43:56.729
you're supporting small farmers,

00:43:56.729 --> 00:43:59.216
you're not supporting big agriculture.

00:43:59.216 --> 00:44:01.868
And the food industry is quite
aware of that and there have

00:44:01.868 --> 00:44:05.552
been many articles now talking
about how the food industry

00:44:05.552 --> 00:44:10.257
has to respond to this enormous
consumer demand for better

00:44:10.257 --> 00:44:12.634
healthier food, food
that's better for people

00:44:12.634 --> 00:44:13.939
in the environment.

00:44:13.939 --> 00:44:16.114
So I think the food movement is

00:44:16.114 --> 00:44:17.839
actually does have some power.

00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:20.734
It just doesn't have power in Washington.

00:44:20.734 --> 00:44:22.279
I wish it did.

00:44:22.279 --> 00:44:26.697
- And so, what you're
describing is a change

00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:30.251
of consciousness, broader
than we may realize,

00:44:30.251 --> 00:44:32.834
but on the other hand that the,

00:44:34.321 --> 00:44:38.488
the movement could, should
embrace the notion of choice.

00:44:39.821 --> 00:44:42.719
In other words, let's
take choice away from

00:44:42.719 --> 00:44:45.642
the food industry and put it
in the hands of the people

00:44:45.642 --> 00:44:48.426
who want better food and
want to be healthier.

00:44:48.426 --> 00:44:49.657
- Yeah, I think that's happening.

00:44:49.657 --> 00:44:52.602
I mean, I see that happening.

00:44:52.602 --> 00:44:56.968
You know, to move from
that to political power

00:44:56.968 --> 00:45:01.718
in Washington means taking
all of the thousands

00:45:01.718 --> 00:45:05.965
of organizations that are working
on food issues of one kind

00:45:05.965 --> 00:45:10.132
or another and unifying them
in some way so that they have

00:45:11.338 --> 00:45:14.838
some lobbying power and can control votes.

00:45:16.492 --> 00:45:19.478
But that means people
have to get out and vote.

00:45:19.478 --> 00:45:22.340
It means people have to run for office.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.423
It means people have to
engage in an ugly, messy,

00:45:28.372 --> 00:45:30.704
money-controlled political system,

00:45:30.704 --> 00:45:33.872
which a lot of people don't want to do.

00:45:33.872 --> 00:45:38.039
- Is there a movement also
implicit in what's going on

00:45:38.986 --> 00:45:43.050
to making a difference at the local level?

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:46.831
Because if you're buying
food from local markets,

00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:50.914
from local farmers, and
going to organic markets,

00:45:53.568 --> 00:45:57.735
you're making choice and so
it's a entry point into changing

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:03.065
the system before
Washington changes itself.

00:46:03.065 --> 00:46:04.623
And it may be more realistic.

00:46:04.623 --> 00:46:07.288
- Yeah, I think it's far more
realistic and I tell students

00:46:07.288 --> 00:46:09.855
who are interested in making
changes in the food system

00:46:09.855 --> 00:46:11.770
to do it locally.

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:15.200
Look in your community
and see what the needs are

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.002
and work in the community.

00:46:17.002 --> 00:46:19.086
Go to your local schools.

00:46:19.086 --> 00:46:22.650
What kind of food are the
kids eating in those schools?

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:23.999
Good, bad, indifferent?

00:46:23.999 --> 00:46:26.250
Can you make it better?

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.662
There's lots that can be
done on the local level

00:46:28.662 --> 00:46:31.234
and if enough is done on the
local level then Washington

00:46:31.234 --> 00:46:32.401
has to listen.

00:46:34.017 --> 00:46:38.184
- And what, obviously we're
entering into a period

00:46:39.152 --> 00:46:41.402
of dark ages in Washington.

00:46:42.514 --> 00:46:46.681
What should we be watching for
in the food area as something

00:46:48.002 --> 00:46:52.544
that the government may
try to turn back a lot of

00:46:52.544 --> 00:46:55.294
the advances that have been made?

00:46:56.148 --> 00:46:57.622
- Well, the big one is SNAP,

00:46:57.622 --> 00:47:01.471
the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program,

00:47:01.471 --> 00:47:03.683
food stamps is what it used to be called.

00:47:03.683 --> 00:47:08.344
That's the big one because
it is 80% of the money that

00:47:08.344 --> 00:47:10.554
comes into the Department of Agriculture's

00:47:10.554 --> 00:47:13.014
Farm Bill appropriations.

00:47:13.014 --> 00:47:17.181
The actual support for
agriculture is only 20%.

00:47:18.328 --> 00:47:22.495
So, it's this enormous 80
billion dollar a year program

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:28.838
that Congress is just dying to cut.

00:47:28.838 --> 00:47:30.961
- And what, explain
what this program does.

00:47:30.961 --> 00:47:32.211
- [Marion] It's food stamps.

00:47:32.211 --> 00:47:36.378
It provides electronic
benefits for people to go into

00:47:37.242 --> 00:47:39.521
grocery stores and buy food.

00:47:39.521 --> 00:47:40.354
- Right.

00:47:40.354 --> 00:47:42.128
And so the change might be in what you can

00:47:42.128 --> 00:47:43.563
use that money to buy?

00:47:43.563 --> 00:47:46.073
- No, the change will be
to cut the amount of money

00:47:46.073 --> 00:47:48.935
which is already quite
minimal considering that

00:47:48.935 --> 00:47:53.367
there are 45 million people
who have these benefits.

00:47:53.367 --> 00:47:57.497
And for them, that's the
last of the safety net

00:47:57.497 --> 00:48:01.195
in the United States for poor people.

00:48:01.195 --> 00:48:05.070
The President's budget that
came out quite recently

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:09.237
has the most, just cuts of
these tiny little programs

00:48:10.072 --> 00:48:12.315
that help poor people and help people

00:48:12.315 --> 00:48:14.537
with various kinds of things.

00:48:14.537 --> 00:48:17.031
And so they're cutting all of these,

00:48:17.031 --> 00:48:20.350
the argument being we don't
want tax payers who aren't

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.846
interested in these things to
be paying for these things.

00:48:22.846 --> 00:48:26.234
So that's the same argument
as we don't want tax payers

00:48:26.234 --> 00:48:28.327
to have to support schools if they don't

00:48:28.327 --> 00:48:29.923
have children in schools.

00:48:29.923 --> 00:48:31.887
That doesn't make any sense at all.

00:48:31.887 --> 00:48:34.754
That's not the way societies should work.

00:48:34.754 --> 00:48:35.587
- Right.

00:48:35.587 --> 00:48:39.222
And will there be resistance
to these cuts from the food

00:48:39.222 --> 00:48:40.579
industry, of all people?

00:48:40.579 --> 00:48:42.092
I mean, in other words, do they ben-.

00:48:42.092 --> 00:48:45.654
- Well, there actually might
be because retail stores

00:48:45.654 --> 00:48:50.074
get the most profits from
the food stamp program.

00:48:50.074 --> 00:48:51.869
That's where people buy them.

00:48:51.869 --> 00:48:55.016
So, retail stores, most of
the money in food stamps

00:48:55.016 --> 00:48:56.902
is spent at retail stores.

00:48:56.902 --> 00:48:59.392
The retail stores don't want to lose that.

00:48:59.392 --> 00:49:03.237
So they might, but it's hard to know.

00:49:03.237 --> 00:49:05.238
- Soda politics has been a place

00:49:05.238 --> 00:49:07.449
where there have been some successes.

00:49:07.449 --> 00:49:11.175
What has been the key
to what makes it work,

00:49:11.175 --> 00:49:13.550
because that's gonna tell
us about the political

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:17.796
organizing that we needed to
do to change the food system.

00:49:17.796 --> 00:49:22.044
- Yeah, I subtitled Soda
Politics, Taking on Big Soda,

00:49:22.044 --> 00:49:26.311
and in parenthesis, and
Winning, because sales of sodas

00:49:26.311 --> 00:49:28.148
are down so far.

00:49:28.148 --> 00:49:32.964
They peaked in about 1999 and
have been declining ever since

00:49:32.964 --> 00:49:36.275
and this year, for the first
time, sales of bottled water

00:49:36.275 --> 00:49:39.604
exceeded sales of sugary beverages.

00:49:39.604 --> 00:49:42.636
We still have a long way
to go but they're way down.

00:49:42.636 --> 00:49:45.211
Now, the soda industry
believes that public health

00:49:45.211 --> 00:49:49.378
advocacy is responsible for
that and I hope they're right.

00:49:50.229 --> 00:49:52.447
I'm going to assume that they're right.

00:49:52.447 --> 00:49:54.690
That means that public
health advocates have done

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:59.466
a terrific job of explaining
to people that sugary beverages

00:49:59.466 --> 00:50:01.304
are not good for their health.

00:50:01.304 --> 00:50:03.435
That they predispose to diabetes,

00:50:03.435 --> 00:50:06.337
that they predispose to a
whole lot of other conditions

00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:08.793
and that people would be
much healthier drinking

00:50:08.793 --> 00:50:11.414
less soda and certainly there's loads

00:50:11.414 --> 00:50:15.581
of anecdotal evidence, all
I did was stop drinking

00:50:16.799 --> 00:50:19.703
sugary beverages and the
weight just fell off.

00:50:19.703 --> 00:50:24.039
I mean, I've heard that so many
times I can't even count it.

00:50:24.039 --> 00:50:28.206
So I think that message got
out and then advocates also

00:50:30.067 --> 00:50:32.809
worked to get sugary
drinks out of schools,

00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:36.653
out of work places, got
government agencies to say

00:50:36.653 --> 00:50:39.391
this is gonna be a soda-free zone,

00:50:39.391 --> 00:50:43.479
hospitals to get rid of
their vending machines.

00:50:43.479 --> 00:50:48.108
I mean these efforts at the
local level have added up

00:50:48.108 --> 00:50:50.681
and it's become, in some social circles,

00:50:50.681 --> 00:50:54.902
no longer socially acceptable
to drink Coke or Pepsi.

00:50:54.902 --> 00:50:59.069
- If you were advising students
to prepare for a future

00:51:00.034 --> 00:51:03.951
in which they were making
choices that affected

00:51:05.218 --> 00:51:09.385
what we eat and they wanted
to change the food industry,

00:51:10.363 --> 00:51:15.317
how should they prepare for
that future in their own lives,

00:51:15.317 --> 00:51:18.734
beside invoking choice on their own part?

00:51:19.703 --> 00:51:23.355
What else should they
be studying to prepare

00:51:23.355 --> 00:51:26.709
for a future career in that work?

00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:31.579
- Well, I wanted to turn
students into food advocates.

00:51:31.579 --> 00:51:35.746
I want them out working with
people to try to improve diets

00:51:37.348 --> 00:51:40.168
and make diets healthier
for people on the planet.

00:51:40.168 --> 00:51:43.358
And there are loads and loads
and loads of ways to do that

00:51:43.358 --> 00:51:46.689
because there are so many
organizations that are working

00:51:46.689 --> 00:51:50.856
on these issues that you can
pick the particular tiny piece

00:51:51.725 --> 00:51:54.458
that you want to work on.

00:51:54.458 --> 00:51:58.912
Improving school food, improving
the environmental impact

00:51:58.912 --> 00:52:03.534
of whatever the food system
is doing, whatever it is,

00:52:03.534 --> 00:52:07.046
you can find an organization
that's working on it.

00:52:07.046 --> 00:52:10.277
Join organizations, volunteer.

00:52:10.277 --> 00:52:13.846
- And this really is an
issue about inequality.

00:52:13.846 --> 00:52:14.785
- [Marion] Absolutely!

00:52:14.785 --> 00:52:17.867
- Because wealthy people
know a lot of the stuff

00:52:17.867 --> 00:52:22.212
we're talking about but the
poor are more often the objects

00:52:22.212 --> 00:52:23.930
of the advertising and, yeah.

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:25.759
- [Marion] Absolutely.

00:52:25.759 --> 00:52:29.675
Yeah, no, it's absolutely
a social justice issue.

00:52:29.675 --> 00:52:34.294
And you can work on social
justice issues using food

00:52:34.294 --> 00:52:38.346
as an entry point in a way that
you cannot do with any other

00:52:38.346 --> 00:52:40.601
political issue, in my view.

00:52:40.601 --> 00:52:41.950
Because everybody eats.

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:44.981
So everybody can relate to it.

00:52:44.981 --> 00:52:49.148
It's not hard to explain to
people why the food system

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.883
for them is the way that it is
and what they can do to make

00:52:53.883 --> 00:52:55.075
changes in it.

00:52:55.075 --> 00:52:57.526
And lots of people are
interested in listening.

00:52:57.526 --> 00:52:58.763
It's an exciting time.

00:52:58.763 --> 00:53:00.928
- One of the things that
emerges from your work

00:53:00.928 --> 00:53:04.649
and your presentations is
you remain an optimist.

00:53:04.649 --> 00:53:08.939
- Absolutely, because
I can see the changes.

00:53:08.939 --> 00:53:11.222
- And is that what fuels your optimism?

00:53:11.222 --> 00:53:12.055
- Yeah.

00:53:12.055 --> 00:53:13.787
I mean, well, first of
all, I work with students.

00:53:13.787 --> 00:53:17.463
How could you not be optimistic
if you work with students?

00:53:17.463 --> 00:53:19.671
I mean, they're optimistic.

00:53:19.671 --> 00:53:22.082
They're so interested,
they're so excited about

00:53:22.082 --> 00:53:24.377
what the future holds for them

00:53:24.377 --> 00:53:28.217
and so eager to make positive change.

00:53:28.217 --> 00:53:30.549
How could you not be?

00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:34.380
I mean, I get my inspiration from them.

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:37.841
And, you know, I try to
support them in any way I can.

00:53:37.841 --> 00:53:39.025
Yes, go out and do it.

00:53:39.025 --> 00:53:40.906
No, don't be discouraged.

00:53:40.906 --> 00:53:43.969
Look at the changes that have taken place.

00:53:43.969 --> 00:53:46.588
Look at how much better
supermarket food is.

00:53:46.588 --> 00:53:48.840
Loot at the number of farmer's markets.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.741
Look at how, at the sales of organics,

00:53:51.741 --> 00:53:53.747
to pick just one example.

00:53:53.747 --> 00:53:58.705
And then my own personal example
is look at what's happened

00:53:58.705 --> 00:54:01.495
with food education in universities.

00:54:01.495 --> 00:54:04.889
My department at NYU started
a program in food studies

00:54:04.889 --> 00:54:06.722
in 1996, 21 years ago.

00:54:07.794 --> 00:54:09.226
We were it!

00:54:09.226 --> 00:54:11.685
There was one other program
at Boston University

00:54:11.685 --> 00:54:15.864
in gastronomy but we
were the only sort of,

00:54:15.864 --> 00:54:18.436
that was in the School
of Continuing Education,

00:54:18.436 --> 00:54:22.031
we were the only academically
involved program.

00:54:22.031 --> 00:54:24.196
We started out with
undergraduate, Master's,

00:54:24.196 --> 00:54:26.563
and Doctoral programs.

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:29.056
Everybody thought we were crazy.

00:54:29.056 --> 00:54:32.254
Who would want to study about food?

00:54:32.254 --> 00:54:33.490
Who would want to do that?

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:35.257
How are you gonna get students?

00:54:35.257 --> 00:54:36.853
They couldn't believe it.

00:54:36.853 --> 00:54:40.080
The New York Times wrote about
our program the week after

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.451
it was approved by New York State.

00:54:42.451 --> 00:54:45.965
We had people in our office
that afternoon holding

00:54:45.965 --> 00:54:47.844
the clipping and saying,

00:54:47.844 --> 00:54:50.668
I've waited all my life for this program.

00:54:50.668 --> 00:54:51.607
And we've never looked back.

00:54:51.607 --> 00:54:56.425
Now every university has some
kind of food program going on.

00:54:56.425 --> 00:55:00.232
There are five in New
York City that I know of.

00:55:00.232 --> 00:55:03.011
There are thousands and
thousands of young people

00:55:03.011 --> 00:55:07.178
who are interested in food
issues in a way that combines

00:55:09.119 --> 00:55:11.530
politics, sociology, science,

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:14.300
whatever it is they're interested in.

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:17.068
They can use food, everybody's
figured out that you can

00:55:17.068 --> 00:55:19.723
use food to teach anything.

00:55:19.723 --> 00:55:23.980
- One final question,
requiring a brief answer,

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:28.201
what lesson do you think one
can learn from your career?

00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:29.034
- [Marion] From mine?

00:55:29.034 --> 00:55:29.867
- Yeah.

00:55:29.867 --> 00:55:30.700
- Yeah, do what you like.

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:32.724
It'll really be fun.

00:55:32.724 --> 00:55:36.355
- And on that note, I want to
thank you, Professor Nestle,

00:55:36.355 --> 00:55:39.819
for being with us today and
coming back to Berkeley,

00:55:39.819 --> 00:55:40.717
your alma mater.

00:55:40.717 --> 00:55:41.861
- My pleasure.

00:55:41.861 --> 00:55:44.981
- And thank you very much
for joining us for this

00:55:44.981 --> 00:55:47.197
Conversation with History.

00:55:47.197 --> 00:55:50.280
(light upbeat music)
