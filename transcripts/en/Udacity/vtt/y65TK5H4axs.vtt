00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.407
Let's start with a simple scatter plot. Each dot

00:00:03.407 --> 00:00:07.099
in this chart represents the winning percentage of the Boston

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.346
Red Sox in the year between 1960 and 2010. In

00:00:10.346 --> 00:00:12.942
this chart, the main visual cue that we're using is

00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:16.896
position. The year for our particular winning percentage is dictated

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:19.590
by where we are in the x coordinate. And we

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.530
see what the winning percentage is by looking at a

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.400
data point's position on the y-axis. Secondly, we can note

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.290
that this plot provides pretty good context. We

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.336
have an X labeled Year, indicating what the x-axis

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:34.620
represents. A Y labelled Winning Percentage, telling us what

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.060
the y-axis represents. And we have a pretty descriptive

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.410
title. Boston Red Sox Winning Percentage. We might

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.320
include by year to make it even better. This

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.840
will help people who are unfamiliar with this data

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.900
really look at this chart and understand what's happening.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.040
But as you can see, a scatter plot here really puts focus on the individual

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.640
values. It's a little bit hard to discern trends. It could also be hard for a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.840
reader to mentally fill in the gaps between

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.910
the points and really understand what's happening from

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.620
year to year. It's for this reason that we might want to use a line chart.
