00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
 

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.390
This video, here, is a
groundbreaking video,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.500
for multiple reasons.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.280
One, I'm going to introduce
you to the variance

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.960
of a sample, which is
interesting in its own right.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.300
And I'm attempting to
record this video in HD,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.730
and hopefully you can see it
bigger and clearer than ever

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.230
before.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.330
But we'll see how
all of that goes.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.240
So this is a bit of an
experiment, so bear with me.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.170
But so, just before we go
into the variance of a sample,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.600
I think it's
instructive to review

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.360
the variance the population, and
we can compare their formulas.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.100
The variance of a
population-- and it's

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.150
this Greek letter, sigma.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.610
Lowercase sigma squared.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.570
That means variance.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.037
I know it's weird that
a variable already

00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:41.870
has a squared in it.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.244
You're not squaring
the variable.

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:44.270
This is the variable.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.850
Sigma squared means variance.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.225
Actually, let me
write that down.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:48.130
That equals variance.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.640
 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.400
And that is equal to--
you take each data point--

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.745
and we'll call them x sub i.

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:00.480
You take each data
point, find out

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.379
how far it is from the
mean of the population--

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.370
the mean of the population.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.051
You square it, and then you take
the average of all of those.

00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:12.050
So you take the average.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.930
You sum them all up.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.250
You go from i is equal to 1.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.720
So from the first point all
the way to the N-th point.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.780
And then to average,
you sum them all up,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.080
and then you divide by N.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.000
So the variance is the average
of the squared distances

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.262
of each point from the mean.

00:01:27.262 --> 00:01:28.970
And just to give you
the intuition again,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.420
it essentially says, on
average, roughly how far away

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.300
are each of the points
from the middle?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.300
That's the best way to
think about the variance.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.336
Now what if we're dealing-- this
was for a population, right?

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:40.960
And we said, if we
wanted to figure out

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.552
the variance of men's
heights in the country,

00:01:43.552 --> 00:01:45.010
it would be very
hard to figure out

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.610
the variance for the population.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.010
You would have to go
and, essentially, measure

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.330
everyone's height--
250 million people.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.915
Or what if it's for some
population where it's just

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:56.540
completely impossible
to have the data,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.690
or some random variable?

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.920
And we'll go more
into that later.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.419
So a lot of times,
you actually want

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:03.280
to estimate this
variance by taking

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.740
the variance of a sample.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.560
Same way that you could never
get the mean of a population,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.960
but maybe you want
to estimate it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.360
by getting the mean of a sample.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.290
And we learned that
in that first video.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.182
This is-- if that's the
whole population, that's

00:02:18.182 --> 00:02:20.640
millions of data points-- or
even data points in the future

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.015
that you'll never
be able to get,

00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:23.430
because it's a random variable.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.513
So this is the population.

00:02:24.513 --> 00:02:27.110
 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.630
You might just want to estimate
things by looking at a sample.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.540
And this is actually what
most of inferential statistics

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.420
is all about.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.820
Figuring out descriptive
statistics about the sample,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.930
and making inferences
about the population.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.660
Let me try this
drug on 100 people.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.780
And if it seems to have
statistically significant

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.490
results, this drug
will probably work

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.940
on the population as a whole.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.940
So that's what it's all about.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.523
So it's really
important to understand

00:02:51.523 --> 00:02:53.710
this notion of a sample
versus a population,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.830
and being able to
find statistics

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.280
on a sample that,
for the most part,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.580
can describe the population or
help us estimate-- they call

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.220
it parameters for
the population.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.360
So what's the mean of a-- let
me rewrite these definitions.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.870
What's the mean of a population?

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.670
I'll do it in that purple--
purple for population.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.120
The mean of a
population, you just

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.330
take each of the data points.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.740
So you take each of the data
points in the population-- xi.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.860
You sum them up.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.360
You start with the
first data point,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.330
and you go all the way
to the N-th data point,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.467
and you divide by N.
You sum them all up

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:29.050
and divide them by
N. That's the mean.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.490
So then you plug it
into this formula,

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.310
and you just can see
how far each point is

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.520
from that central
point, from that mean.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.390
And you get the variance.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.890
Now what happens if
we do it for a sample?

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.890
Well, if we want to estimate
the mean of a population

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.005
by somehow calculating a mean
for a sample, the best thing

00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:47.380
I can think of--
and really these

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.250
are kind of engineered formulas.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.750
These are human
beings saying, well,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.840
what is the best
way to sample it?

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.660
Well, all we can do is really
take an average of our sample.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.576
And that's the sample mean.

00:03:56.576 --> 00:03:57.950
And we learned in
the first video

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.500
that notation-- the formula's
almost identical to this.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.999
It's just the
notation is different.

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:05.180
Instead of writing mu, you
write x with a line over it.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.470
Sample mean is equal to--

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.440
Once again, you take each of the
data points now in the sample,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.250
not in the whole population.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.951
You sum them up, from the first
one and then to the n-th one,

00:04:16.951 --> 00:04:17.450
right?

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.740
They're saying that there are
n data points in this sample.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.420
And then you divide it by the
number of data points you have.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.520
Fair enough.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.820
It's really the same formula.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.140
The way I took the
mean of a population,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.240
I said, well, if I
just have a sample,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.865
let me just take the
mean the same way.

00:04:29.865 --> 00:04:32.160
And it might-- it's
probably a good estimate

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.070
of the mean of the population.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.370
Now, it gets interesting
when we talk about variance.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.310
So your natural reaction
is, OK, I have this sample.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.960
If I want to estimate the
variance of the population,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.210
why don't I just apply this
same formula, essentially,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.360
to the sample?

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.910
So I could say-- and this is
actually a sample variance.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.690
They use a formula-- s squared.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.254
So sigma is kind of the
Greek-letter equivalent of s.

00:04:58.254 --> 00:04:59.920
So now when we're
dealing with a sample,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.120
we just write the s there.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.370
So this is sample variance.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.328
Let me write that down.

00:05:03.328 --> 00:05:04.110
Sample variance.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:12.590
 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.900
So we might just say,
well, maybe a good way

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.500
to take the sample variance
is, do it the same way.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.720
Let's take the distance of each
of the points in the sample,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.440
find out how far it is
from our sample mean.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.396
Right here, we used
the population mean.

00:05:28.396 --> 00:05:29.770
But now we'll just
use the sample

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.457
mean, because that's
all we can have.

00:05:31.457 --> 00:05:33.040
We don't know what
the population mean

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.550
is without looking at
the whole population.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.550
Take the square of that.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.508
That makes it positive.

00:05:37.508 --> 00:05:40.361
It has other properties
which we'll go over later.

00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:42.860
And then take the average of
all of these squared distances.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.070
So you take it from--
you sum them all up.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.340
And there's n of them to
sum up, right-- lowercase n.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.209
And you divide by lowercase n.

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:53.250
You say, well, you know,
this is a good estimate.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.030
Whatever this variance
is, that might

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.071
be a good estimate for
the population as a whole.

00:05:57.071 --> 00:06:00.460
And actually this is what
some people often refer to,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.110
when they talk about
sample variance.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.280
And sometimes it'll actually
be referred to as this.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.537
They'll put a little
lowercase n there.

00:06:07.537 --> 00:06:09.870
And the reason why I do that
is because we divided by n.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.070
So you say, Sal, what's
the problem here?

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.190
And then the problem--
and I'll give you

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.360
the intuition, because
this is actually

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.290
something that used
to boggle my mind.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.680
And I'm still,
frankly, struggling

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.345
with the intuition behind it.

00:06:21.345 --> 00:06:23.490
Well, I have the
intuition, but more

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.305
of kind of rigorously
proving it to myself,

00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:27.110
that this is
definitely the case.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.132
But think about this.

00:06:28.132 --> 00:06:30.590
If I have a bunch of numbers--
and I'll draw a number line,

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.750
here.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.330
If I draw a number
line here-- let's

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.446
say I have a bunch of
numbers in my population.

00:06:39.446 --> 00:06:41.320
So let's say-- I'm just
going to randomly put

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.907
a bunch of numbers
in my population.

00:06:43.907 --> 00:06:45.990
And the ones to the right
are bigger than the ones

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.490
to the left.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.120
 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.510
And if I were to take a
sample of them, right?

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.610
Maybe I take-- and the
sample, it's random.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.360
You actually want to
take a random sample.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.985
You don't want to be
skewed in any way.

00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:04.420
So maybe I take this one, this
one, this one, and that one,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.125
right?

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.250
And then if I were to take
the mean of that number,

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.340
that number, that
number, and that number,

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.715
it'll be someplace
in the middle.

00:07:09.715 --> 00:07:11.220
It might be
someplace over there.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.761
And then, if I wanted to figure
out the sample variance using

00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:15.640
this formula, I'd
say, OK, this distance

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.440
squared plus this distance
squared plus this distance

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.630
squared plus that distance
squared, and average them

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.325
all out.

00:07:23.325 --> 00:07:24.700
And then I would
get this number.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.750
And that probably would be
a pretty good approximation

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.280
for the variance of
this entire population.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.880
The population of
the mean is probably

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.649
going to be-- I don't know, it
might be pretty close to this.

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:37.190
If we actually took all of the
data points and averaged them,

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.160
maybe they're, like,
here someplace.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.045
And then, if you figure
out the variance,

00:07:40.045 --> 00:07:42.336
it probably would be pretty
close to the average of all

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:46.771
of these lines, right, of the
sample variance distances.

00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:47.270
Fair enough.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.770
So you say, hey, Sal, this
looks pretty good now.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.030
But there's one little catch.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.530
What if-- I mean, there's always
a probability that, instead

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.810
of picking these fairly
well-distributed numbers

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.130
in my sample, what
if I happened to pick

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.560
this number, this number, and
that number, and, let's say,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.580
that number, as my sample?

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.430
Well, whatever your sample
is, your sample mean's

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.350
always going to be in
the middle of it, right?

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.110
So in this case, your sample
mean might be right here.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.360
So all of these numbers,
you might say, OK,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.180
this number's not too
far from that number.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.690
That number's not too far.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.200
And then that
number's not too far.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.540
So your sample variance,
when you do it this way,

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.750
it might turn out
a little bit low.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.890
Because all of these numbers,
they're almost, by definition,

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.500
going to be pretty close
to the mean of each other.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.340
But in this case, your
sample is kind of skewed,

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.230
and the actual mean
of the population

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.130
is out here someplace.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.350
So the actual variance
of the sample,

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.872
if you had actually
known the mean--

00:08:41.872 --> 00:08:44.330
I know this is all a little
confusing-- if you had actually

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.679
known the mean, you
would've said, oh, wow.

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:48.220
You would have found
these distances,

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.214
which would have
been a lot more.

00:08:51.214 --> 00:08:52.630
The whole point
of what I'm saying

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.000
is, when you take
a sample, there's

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.090
some chance that
your sample mean is

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.497
pretty close to the
population mean.

00:09:00.497 --> 00:09:02.830
Maybe your sample mean is
here, and your population mean

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:03.411
is here.

00:09:03.411 --> 00:09:04.910
And then this formula
would probably

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.451
work out pretty well, at least
given your sample data points,

00:09:07.451 --> 00:09:09.300
of figuring out what
the variance is.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.520
But there's a reasonable
chance that your sample

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.050
mean-- your sample
mean is always

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.870
going to be within your
data sample, right?

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.820
It's always going to be the
center of your data sample.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.330
But it's completely possible
that the population mean

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.650
is outside of your data sample.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.683
It might have just
been-- you know,

00:09:23.683 --> 00:09:25.450
you just happened
to pick ones that

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.290
don't contain the
actual population mean.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.680
And then this sample
variance, calculated this way,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.802
will actually underestimate
the actual population variance,

00:09:35.802 --> 00:09:38.260
because they're always going
to be closer to their own mean

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.060
than they are to
the population mean.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.039
And if you're understanding,
frankly, even 10% of this,

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:45.830
you are a very advanced
statistics student.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.490
But I'm saying all of
this to just give you,

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.030
hopefully, some
intuition to realize

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.560
that this will
often underestimate.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.580
This formula will
often underestimate

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.107
the actual population variance.

00:09:59.107 --> 00:10:00.940
And there's a formula--
and this is actually

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.430
proven more rigorously
than I'll do

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.920
it-- that is considered to be
a better-- or, they'll call it,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.090
unbiased-- estimate of
the population variance,

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.430
or the unbiased sample variance.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.190
And sometimes it's just
denoted by the s squared again.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:19.080
Sometimes it's denoted by
this-- s n minus 1 squared--

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.770
and I'll show you why.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.390
It's almost the same thing.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.000
You take each of
the data points,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.080
figure out how far they
are from the sample mean,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.390
you square them, and then
you take the average of those

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.570
squared, except for
one slight difference.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.800
i equals 1 to i equals n.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.420
Instead of dividing
by n, you divide

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.970
by a slightly smaller number.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.390
You divide by n minus 1.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.620
So when you divide by n minus
1 instead of dividing by n,

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.704
you're going to get a
slightly larger number here.

00:10:49.704 --> 00:10:51.286
And it turns out
that this is actually

00:10:51.286 --> 00:10:52.295
a much better estimate.

00:10:52.295 --> 00:10:54.378
And one day, I'm going to
write a computer program

00:10:54.378 --> 00:10:56.830
to at least prove it to
myself, experimentally,

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:01.804
that this is a better estimate
of the population variance.

00:11:01.804 --> 00:11:03.470
And you would calculate
it the same way.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.193
You just divide by n minus 1.

00:11:05.193 --> 00:11:07.526
The other way to think about
it-- and actually-- no, no.

00:11:07.526 --> 00:11:08.530
I'm all out of time.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.330
I'll leave you there, now,
and then, in the next video,

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.450
we'll do a couple
calculations, just

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.400
so you don't get too
overwhelmed with these ideas,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.233
because we're getting
a little bit abstract.

00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:16.639
See you in the next video.

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:17.139
