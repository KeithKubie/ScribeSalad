00:00:01.278 --> 00:00:03.611
How do we choose
the people we fall in love with?

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.041
In the modern world,

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.089
under the ideology of 'Romanticism'

00:00:07.267 --> 00:00:10.331
you're meant above all,
to Trust Your Feelings!

00:00:10.447 --> 00:00:12.534
Love is a mutual ecstasy

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.257
at finding a beautiful person,

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:15.232
inside and out,

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:18.044
with the rare capacity, to make us happy.

00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:21.444
The romantic attitude sounds warm and kind.

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:23.566
It's originators certainly imagined

00:00:23.592 --> 00:00:25.116
that it would bring
to an end the sort of

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:26.624
unhappy relationships

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.363
that resulted from the
old ways of finding a partner;

00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:31.121
the arranged marriage!

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.450
The only problem is that this call
for us to trust our instincts

00:00:35.644 --> 00:00:38.652
has very often proved to be
a disaster of its own.

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:42.379
Respecting the special feelings
we get around certain people

00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:45.945
in night-clubs, or train stations;
at parties or on websites

00:00:46.123 --> 00:00:49.210
and that romanticism so
ably celebrated an art

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:52.920
appears not to have led us to be
any happier in our unions

00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:56.710
The Medieval couple shackled into marriage
by two royal courts

00:00:56.912 --> 00:00:59.984
keen to preserve the sovereignty
of a slice of ancestral land.

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:03.305
Instinct has been little
better than calculation

00:01:03.427 --> 00:01:06.165
in underwriting the quality
of our love stories.

00:01:06.313 --> 00:01:07.797
There's another school of thought:

00:01:07.987 --> 00:01:09.924
this one influenced by psychotherapy

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:12.880
which challenges the notion
that trusting instinct

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.993
invariably draws us to those
who will make us happy.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:18.284
That's because the theory points out

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:20.809
that we don't fail in love
first and foremost

00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:23.598
with those who care for us in ideal ways

00:01:23.942 --> 00:01:28.125
We fall in love with those who care for
us in familiar ways.

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:30.565
And there might be, a big difference.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:34.021
Adult love is modeled on a template of love

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:35.475
created in childhood.

00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:38.184
And is likely to
be entwined with a range of

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:39.806
problematic attractions

00:01:39.926 --> 00:01:41.728
that militate in key ways

00:01:41.793 --> 00:01:45.682
against our chances of growth
and happiness, as adults.

00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:48.547
We may believe we are seeking
happiness in love

00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:51.310
but what we are really after is familiarity

00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:54.709
We're looking to recreate
within our adult relationships

00:01:54.737 --> 00:01:57.253
the very feelings we knew
so well in childhood

00:01:57.542 --> 00:02:01.153
And which were rarely limited
to just tenderness and care.

00:02:01.546 --> 00:02:04.038
The love many of us
would've tasted early on

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.802
was confused with other perhaps
more destructive dynamics

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:11.179
Feelings of wanting to help an
adult who is out of control

00:02:11.206 --> 00:02:14.040
or of being deprived of a parent's warmth.

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:16.106
Or scared of his/her anger

00:02:16.394 --> 00:02:20.306
or of not feeling secure enough to
communicate our trickier wishes

00:02:20.772 --> 00:02:23.851
How logical then, that we
should as adults find ourselves

00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:25.791
rejecting certain candidates

00:02:25.816 --> 00:02:27.784
not because they're wrong for us

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.357
but because they're a little too right

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.528
In a sense of seeming somehow
excessively balanced,

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:35.308
mature, understanding

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:36.501
and reliable

00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:41.607
given that in our hearts such
rightness feels foreign and unearned

00:02:42.192 --> 00:02:44.001
To choose our partners wisely,

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:47.677
we need to tease out how certain
compulsions to suffering

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:51.495
may be playing themselves out
in our feelings of attraction.

00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:54.479
A useful starting place is to ask ourselves

00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:58.267
perhaps in the company of a large sheet
of paper, a pen and a free afternoon

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.272
what sort of people in the abstract
put us off and what kinds excite us.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:07.857
To try to trace back qualities to the
people who first loves us in childhood

00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:10.751
and to ask ourselves how
much our impulses really

00:03:10.776 --> 00:03:13.902
are aligned with things
that might make us happy

00:03:14.424 --> 00:03:18.773
We could stand to discover for example
that slightly distant and sadistic people

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:21.666
do always more interesting to us than

00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:23.803
the so-called 'nice' ones.

00:03:23.997 --> 00:03:25.640
That should make us stop and think.

00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:29.223
Our honestly described
reactions are legacies

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:32.296
They are revealing underlying
assumptions we've acquired

00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:35.156
that what love for us can feel like.

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.702
We may start to get a clearer picture

00:03:37.727 --> 00:03:40.662
that our vision of what we're
looking for in another person

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.372
might not be in a specially good guide

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.033
to our personal happiness.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.369
Examining our emotional histories

00:03:47.554 --> 00:03:50.419
we learn that we can't just
be attracted to anyone

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.653
we're limited in the types we have

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:55.937
because of certain things that
happened to us in our past.

00:03:56.227 --> 00:03:59.378
Even if we can't always
radically shift these pattern

00:03:59.532 --> 00:04:02.921
it's useful to know that we're
carrying a ball and chain

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.591
It can make us more careful of ourselves

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.253
when we feel overwhelmed by a
certainty that we've met the one

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.542
after just a few minutes
chatting at the bar.

00:04:12.014 --> 00:04:15.093
Or when we're certain someone
is just brawn or boring

00:04:15.358 --> 00:04:18.430
even though objectively, they
do have a lot going for them.

00:04:18.854 --> 00:04:23.330
Ultimately, we stand to be liberated to
love different people to our initial

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:26.413
types, when we find that
the qualities we like

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.306
and the ones we very much fear

00:04:28.483 --> 00:04:31.047
can be found in different constellations

00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:35.361
from those we encountered in the people
who first thought us about affection

00:04:35.482 --> 00:04:39.204
long ago, in a childhood we should strive to understand

00:04:39.382 --> 00:04:42.081
and in many ways, free ourselves from.
