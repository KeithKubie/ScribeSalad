00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.520
In June 2014 our crew set up to visit Agafia Lykova. 
She's an old believer.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.920
After various newspapers has publish her appeal for help we decided to go meet her for herself

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.680
to hear her story first hand.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.000
Our first stop was the Siberian city of Abakan, capital of the republic of Khakassia.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.500
Agafia Lykova's lodge is still five hundred kilometers away, deep in the taiga.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.200
We had read a lot about her, and we all have more than a few conceptions about what we might find,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.220
but the truth exceed our expectations.
We have covered so many strange stories that,

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.960
It's really not clear which are true, and which aren't.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.780
We decided to travel to Agafia by river, following the exact route to the family had once

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.740
taking to flee the modern worldly life,

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.260
But in the town of  (Abaza???) which our boat was suppose to depart, we were stopped in our tracks by a flood.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.240
Endless rain and melting snow from the mountains had cause the deluge.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.380
A state of emergency had been declared through out the republic and rescue helicopters were constantly

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.180
buzzing over head.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.580
Luckily there were no casualties but even so, we couldn't find anyone who'd agree to take us up the river.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.260
Once the river had subsided we finally found a Khakassy nature reserve inspector Dmitry. he and his

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:31.660
fella Yevgenya agreed to take us to Agafia. We bought food, warm clothing and huge quantities of insect repellent.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.300
We'd be Agafia's first visitor since the flood.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.680
Our guide did make it through the rapids, but our walk ended up twice as long then we thought.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.620
The shore was completely covered with fallen trees which meant that our boat just couldn't land.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.580
Our motor boat was cruising around 30 kilometers an hour, and despite the rain we were still quite comfortable.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:34.220
But in the 1930's the Lykov family had traveled the same river in boats that been made up of hollow trunks,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.360
and they can only be moved by hard work using oars and poles.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:12.360
The rain hadn't helped..we often had to jump out so that our guides could navigate shallow water.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:25.500
Sometimes not even that made it easier, and we had to physically drag the boat up stream.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.280
On top of that, we had to make frequent stops, just to clear fallen trees from out of our way.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:00.120
Our trip continued for more than a day, the closer we got to Agafia the shallower the river.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.780
So now our boat reached the site where the Old Believers family had once lived.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.760
At that time the Lykovs were family of five, Karp, the father, his two sons: Savin and Dmitry, and

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.480
two daughters: Natalia and Agafia.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:38.940
They looked as they're been lifted straight out of the previous century, they wore homespun hemp and burlap

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.500
clothes, their shoes were made out of birch bark, and they used only primitive tools.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.000
They still lit fires with fleet and steel.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.160
The drilling unit began to work near their lodge, and the geologists made friends with the Old Believers.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.820
They often visited each other.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:04.280
It took about an hour to clear a passage, one enormous tree &lt;track lay half&gt; drawn in the water,

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.440
and there is no way we gonna surf through that..

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:20.040
Our guide tried to hold the boat off the &lt;hobsticols&gt; for another half hour, we did try to help but..

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.180
&lt;added up&gt; almost take us  &lt;a deep ourselves&gt;...

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.560
Then we decided to take a chance, and use speed to get over the track.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:50.100
we were always covering ourselves with ?? ??, the area's rife with the insects that carried ???.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.480
Strangely that, Agafia was still unaffected...

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:51.140
In 1981, three years after the Lykovs were discovered, Savin, Dmitry and Natalia died suddenly.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.560
One theory suggested that the family had weak immune systems, because they never been exposes

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.520
to the outside world. And, they could ha×”e &lt;contracted Ammonia&gt; from the geologists..

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:31.000
Finally, and only after two days of ?? travel , we got to our destination.. Our first meeting with Agafia

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.700
called for some unusual preparation work to be done...

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:51.340
On the map this ?? marks on the Lykovs lodge, it where the ?? Abakn river join. Its also where

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.420
Agafia and Erofey live.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:10.820
You can't reach Agafia's place by following the river bank, so we had ?? to the woods,

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:16.100
Our guide told us its only about a kilometer away, but in the end we were walking for about thirty minutes,

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.480
pretend that it much more than a kilometer..

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.140
Eventually &lt;tho&gt;, we could recognize a Erofey's hut.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:14.940
Agafia &lt;rusted&gt; us  to help her set up a new fishing net early in the morning. fishing was one of the

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.640
main occupations of the Lykovs family. karp, the family father, taught all of his children the essential skills

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.480
they need to survive a taiga.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:13.140
Erofey was eager to share stories about the Lyovs life. To be honest, we had already heard them

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.580
before because geologists that been following the Old Believers life from the moment they were discovered.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.680
But then something unexpected came up...

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:41.260
We went off checking the landing site, ?? ?? come here very often only what is emergency,

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:46.780
but now the recent ?? was change the river landscape completely. Its hard to see where any elicopter

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.980
might be able to land.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.700
As we made our way back, perhaps because she knew that Erofey has told us too much,

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.300
Agafia had something she wanted to say..

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:54.260
We wanted to ask Erofey if what Agagfia had said about what had happened was true..

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:24.460
Its looked that ?? was ??. So we decided we'd stay back a little bit.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:08.940
Agafia obviously wasn't interesting in sorting things up with Erofey, she had too much to do in her home.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.340
She still light his fire with fleet and steel when she wants to cook anything.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.440
She makes her own bread from flowers that donated by people who want to help her.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:31.160
It's always brought in by helicopter but only when its a very good reason for them to be there.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.480
And she has her own particular reason for not accepting some things...

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:45.080
That evening, despite the rain and recent conflict, Agafia  went to Erofey for communication session,

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:50.940
every Wednesday Erofey uses the radio to talk to his son Nicolay, or to the nature reserve inspectors.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.760
It's the only meaning communication with the outside world. today was the inspectors

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.980
he wanted to call first.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:58.300
Nicolay couldn't be reach on the radio this time.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.280
The next day, we went out to the Taiga to collect branches for the goats.

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:09.060
Agafia use to cut grass and store ?? for the winter, but now it's get more difficult for her because

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.720
of the ?? ??breast. All she can do now is cut the branches.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:26.220
We wanted to help Agafia and Erofey &lt;make it up&gt;, after all we ?? of responsible for ?? their long standing ??.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:09.980
after two failed record ?? attemps, we went ?? Agafia to her vegtables path to?? the poatatoes ??.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.300
She also grown onions, ??, carrots and ??.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:20.660
Even ?? Agafia has detached from outside world, she still pretty well informed about it.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:25.680
the old two infrequent helicopters also bring her books and magazines.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:45.820
In February 1988, Karp Lykov, the father of the family, died. And a year later, Agafia was joined by

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:51.740
another fellow believer, Ivan Tropin. He stayed in her home. Their are rumors as going ?? that

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.540
Agafia was now married.

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:08.380
Ivan Tropin died long ago, and Agafia was the only person who be able to confirm or denied

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:15.460
what Erofey had said. Its clearly a painful subject for her, and we didn't want to add insult to injury.

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:20.240
But that evening, in quite unprompted, Agafia told us her story.

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:50.540
Later, we wanted to set the record straight, so we asked Agafia a direct question.

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:57.880
We asked Agafia to write another letter, this time to all the Old believers of the world.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:19.500
Agafia hunting over her letter, and it was time for us to leave. Again we follow that familliar part throught

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.500
the taiga to return to our boat.
