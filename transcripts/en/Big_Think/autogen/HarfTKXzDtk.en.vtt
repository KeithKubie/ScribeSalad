with Stuxnet it was a weapon it was a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
with Stuxnet it was a weapon it was a
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.270
with Stuxnet it was a weapon it was a
weapon like anything else in history you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
weapon like anything else in history you
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.340
weapon like anything else in history you
know a stone a drone it caused physical

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
know a stone a drone it caused physical
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.240
know a stone a drone it caused physical
damage but it was sent out in the world

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
damage but it was sent out in the world
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.089
damage but it was sent out in the world
on a mission in a way no previous weapon

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
on a mission in a way no previous weapon
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.860

is done go out find this one target

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
is done go out find this one target
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.930
is done go out find this one target
and cause harm to that target and

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940
and cause harm to that target and
 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.649
and cause harm to that target and
nothing else and so it plays out over a

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659
nothing else and so it plays out over a
 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.559
nothing else and so it plays out over a
matter of you know Stuxnet plays out

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569
matter of you know Stuxnet plays out
 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.960
matter of you know Stuxnet plays out
over a series of time it also is

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
over a series of time it also is
 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.580
over a series of time it also is
interesting because it's the first

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590
interesting because it's the first
 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.920
interesting because it's the first
weapon that can be both here they're

ethical wrinkle on one hand we can say
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.050
ethical wrinkle on one hand we can say
this may have been the the first ethical

things that we would describe as
potentially ethical so Stuxnet could

potentially ethical so Stuxnet could
 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.160
potentially ethical so Stuxnet could
only cause harm to its intended target
