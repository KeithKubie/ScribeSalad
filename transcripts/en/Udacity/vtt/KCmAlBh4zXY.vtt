00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.040
Parentheses impact how
we calculate exponents.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.790
Negative four inside parentheses
raised to the second power.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.430
Is not the same thing as a negative
four raised to the second power.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.820
Parentheses tell us about what
the base is in an exponent.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.609
So in the case of negative four in
parentheses raised to the second power

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.123
the base is -4 and the exponent
can be expanded to -4 times -4.

00:00:27.123 --> 00:00:30.570
-4 squared doesn't have parentheses.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.690
So I take the negative sign in
front of the 4 to mean that I'm

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.880
finding the negative of four squared.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.960
The base is four in effect
negative four squared can

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.740
be expanded to negative
one times four times four.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.270
Remember that when you see
a negative in front of a base and

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.680
there are no parentheses around it you
can just think of it as negative one

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.430
times whatever the exponent is.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.000
Evaluate these exponents and be careful
about the sign of your answers.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.480
