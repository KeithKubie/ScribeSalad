00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.250
A presumption among many thoughtful people
is that the great enemy of a good life and

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.420
a decent world is something called ‘bias’.
By bias, people have come to understand a

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.339
twisting of the facts towards dark and entirely
negative ends. According to this interpretation,

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:25.739
bias is invariably and necessarily bad. In
some quarters, the word has simply grown synonymous

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:32.180
with evil. In order to hate bias so much,
one has to love the idea of something else

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.050
with equal passion: ‘the facts’. People
hate bias because they ultimately believe

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.040
in the redemptive possibility of something
completely objective, and scientifically verifiable.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.000
Loathing of bias is the flipside of faith
in facts. Facts evidently exist in many areas

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.650
of life. Science and many of the human sciences
are beautifully based on evidence-based, fact-yielding

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.100
work. The problem is that in many of the most
important aspects of existence, there simply

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.049
are no ‘facts’ available. The big questions
that bedevil us, individually and collectively,

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.360
have no facts to appeal to. – How should
we live? – what is the right economic system

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.469
to institute? – what sort of relationships
should we have? – what choices should we

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:24.130
make? – Who are we and what do we want and
need? In the face of such dilemmas, we may

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.420
well long for facts – by which we really
mean, answers we can be assured will be indisputably

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.299
correct. But we invariably face ambiguity
and, whatever answers we formulate, a degree

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.729
of loss, and the risk of blindness and error.
It is these elements which the haters of bias

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.709
are, deep down, especially intolerant towards
and upset about. Their hatred of bias reflects

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:56.850
a longing for a world without a need for hard
choices and the sacrifice these necessarily

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.520
entail. We may well long to ‘stick to facts,’
but we eventually have to try to lead our

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.870
lives according to values, which are inherently
much more contentious and complicated structures.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:17.830
There is no merely fact-based road to a good
and contented life. The passion against bias

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.260
often comes to a head in our thinking about
news organisations. In certain circles, there

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.830
is a particular loathing for what is termed
biased news – and a belief in the option

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.310
of decent news organisations which are going
to always and inherently be unbiased. Unfortunately,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.500
there is simply no way of providing factual,
‘unbiased’ answers to the really big issues

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.610
facing societies. News organisations that
vaunt their neutrality forget that neutrality

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.000
is simply impossible vis a vis the really
urgent questions confronting our civilisation.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.510
The word ‘bias’ ultimately simply alludes
to the business of having a ‘take’ on

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.790
existence. One may have a better or worse
take, but one needs a take. One needs eventually

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.560
to tackle the question of what is important,
just, worth striving for. If news or information

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.750
or even philosophy are to matter to us, really
matter, they will have to be presented to

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.850
us by organisations that have tried to think
through the ends of human life, that have

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.590
a vision of where we are trying to go as a
species, and that have somewhere articulated

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.570
their answers to their audiences. The issue
is not – therefore – the illusory and

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:40.040
timid one between bias and fact but between
better and worse varieties of bias. We should

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.120
never knock (to take the most obvious examples)
America’s Fox News or Britain’s Daily

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.040
Mail just on the basis that they are biased,
we should only ever argue that they seem badly

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.500
biased. That is the battle to fight. We also
need an extension of our sense of what sort

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.620
of bias can exist. At present, we are used
to thinking of bias simply in terms of right

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.760
and left. But this is a radical reduction
in the kinds of bias that are theoretically

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.830
available to us. We don’t always have to
limits things to a choice between blue and

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.540
red. We might discover a bias in favour of
the wisdom of Montaigne, the dark consoling

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.710
pessimism of Schopenhauer or the wit and humanity
of Marcel Proust. We could be biased towards

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.910
ambiguity, cheerful despair or sane insanity.
Our societies would be richer if we were better,

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:38.180
not at stripping facts of bias, but at developing
our capacities for higher bias. All individuals

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.000
and organisations – even ones like the BBC,
Wikipedia or a great university – in fact,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.370
believe in all sorts of things deep down;
they aren’t as neutral as they want us to

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.120
think – and that’s an extremely good thing.
It’s high time for them to stop hiding behind

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.930
a false defence of their factual impartiality
and to come out from behind the shadows with

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.430
a clear articulation of their vision of a
good society. It’s time for biases to conflict

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.770
openly, as part of a healthy democratic process.
We don’t need our information stripped of

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:18.210
bias, we need to evolve our way, through a
clash of ideologies, towards the best kinds

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.940
of bias. Furthermore, we’ll have matured
when we start to know what our own biases

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:32.160
really are – and so start to get less prickly
and touchy about the biases of others.
