00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.540
Did you hear that?
Canada has,

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.930
they're banning whale and dolphin captivity.
I think it's great.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.190
I think it's great to,
it apparently just passed.
I mean,
how about blackfish?

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.230
One documentary and it like kind of,
I think initiated a movement.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.150
Oh,
for sure.
Yeah.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.820
People didn't know they needed to do you just see it in a digestible form

7
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:25.110
instead of having to go seek it out and read articles about it and news reports

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.410
instead of that,
they get to see it.
There it is in a very digestible format.

9
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.280
He go,
oh my God,
this is chaos.
This is horrible.
This is it.
This is an atrocity.

10
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.550
You're taking these incredible animals that are probably some of the most

11
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:38.370
magnificent creatures that evolution has ever created,

12
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.630
and you're putting them in a fish tank.
You're putting them in a swimming pool.

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.680
There's their fins go limp.
Yeah.
That's crazy.
Well,
it actually,

14
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:50.010
if you think about the killer whale,
I mean that's the king.
Yeah.

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.400
Does a crazy video that I just watched yesterday of one killing a beach seal it

16
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.370
injured the seal and the seal tried to make it over into and it literally

17
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.520
beached itself smashed this seal on those just blood everywhere and these a

18
00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:07.770
bunch of people were standing around watching and going,
Holy Shit.

19
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.510
And then it flopped it's way back into the water and swam off.
It didn't eat it.

20
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.780
Yeah.
Okay,
good.
Well that's what I,
I mean listen,
that's the thing about nature,

21
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:19.410
right?
It's,
it's,
it's kind of brutal but it's not personal.

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.620
Like the see the,
you know the whales not like,

23
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:24.450
you know that sealed gave me kind of a funny look.

24
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.270
I'm going to go and give it to him.
It's like,
oh there's some food.

25
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.030
Did you ever see them one more in they're on the iceberg and they look,

26
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.780
oh that bugger is still holding on and they push it again and there was a mother

27
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.290
teaching it's calves at a hunt to mark that she was setting it up,

28
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:41.610
like showing like you can make them slide like watch this will slide.
Well,

29
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:43.890
I was listening to my friend Steve Romanellas podcast,

30
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:47.820
and he was talking about the difference in the orchids in the Puget sound and

31
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:51.810
that their local orchids,
which are,
uh,
essentially,
uh,

32
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.230
salmon specialists and they don't eat animals.
They don't eat,
um,

33
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.210
marine mammals.

34
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.450
But then there are other ones that travel into the area and they are marine

35
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:06.930
mammal specialists.
So they,
all they eat is like seals and,
and,
uh,

36
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:09.990
and things along those lines.
And they have a totally different language.

37
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:11.400
Totally don't understand each other.

38
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.430
They don't interact with each other at every pod has its own language.

39
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.230
It's crazy.
They,

40
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.790
they put a whale in captivity once and it was night eating because they didn't

41
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:28.110
know it was a seal eating well,
not a fish eating well.

42
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.460
And so at [inaudible] I used to joke,
can you imagine like,
okay,
Suzy and Billy,

43
00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:37.260
we're going to go watch the,
you know,
the Orca Shampoo and then the trainers,

44
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:40.710
they're like throwing at seal.
Like that would not work out well.
Like,
Yay.

45
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:45.420
Do that trick again.
Give it a slab of cute little animal.
So it's,

46
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:47.990
uh,
they're very complex.
Yeah.
