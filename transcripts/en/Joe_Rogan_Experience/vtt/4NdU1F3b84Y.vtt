WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.360
And we're rolling in.
Cheers.
Cheers.
That's,

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.120
that's only part of a cat lady.

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.580
I mean obviously the one,
well it's a critical part.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.410
It is.
It is.
Without the red wine.
The Cat lady is not that ridiculous.
Right.

5
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:20.640
It's just red wine,
Tequila and red bull.
Yeah.
That's normal.

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.670
I mean that's like red bull and vodka.
It's not too crazy.
Yeah.

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.580
You pour the red wine in there and you're like,
well now you're desperate.

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.920
Now you're just like everyone shows up to a party with what they found in their

9
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.280
parents' frigerator.
Yeah.
And then the Cat lady appears.

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.000
Have you ever made one of those since then?
Yeah,
a lot.

11
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.450
I
turned people onto it all the time that it was so ridiculous.

12
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.840
I've gone into bars where people recognize me and then they,

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.510
the waitress comes over and says,

14
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.530
the bartender would like to give you this cat lady.
And I'm like,
what?

15
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.780
People don't know what we're talking about.
The Cat lady was a drunk,

16
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.610
but John invented two years ago in Lanai.
Two years ago.
Yeah.

17
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.430
I think it was two years ago.
Last year.
The year before that,
two years ago.

18
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.600
And it w it was Shane Dorian,
Sam halt,

19
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.730
Ben O'brien.
John Remy Remi.
Yeah.

20
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.440
He didn't get to enjoy it and that was the first we did a podcast in my suite

21
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.310
and we just went into the mini bar and we just grabbed everything.

22
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.380
I don't know about this we stuff you came with a full bear hug of just I could

23
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:35.700
hear cling happening and needed has dropped it the middle of the table.

24
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.750
This is what we got.
We like,
hey,
let's podcasts.

25
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:42.040
And that's where it all started by the fund.

26
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.950
By the end I just was kind of grabbing,
I think I was consuming more than most.

27
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:49.770
So I was just reaching around trying to take whatever was left.

28
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.730
And then you're like,
what the hell are you boring?

29
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.900
So that was our first year doing this trip.
And uh,

30
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:59.530
this year was our third and Ma'am is,
it is an honor,

31
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.181
first of all,

32
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:05.181
it's an awesome place to get ready for like elk to get ready,

33
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:08.790
get ready for anything.
Yeah.
Anything.

34
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.710
If you can successfully,

35
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.110
especially if someone's walking in no.
Like where they rate.

36
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.740
I remember last year when I l counted with Andy,

37
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.100
I told Andy when we were in Montana that this time I'm going to be limited on

38
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:30.090
how much I can hunt with you.
Like we'll both go opposite directions.

39
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:33.990
And then after I think two days and he said,
okay,

40
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:38.991
I realize now how much of my success before was hinting on you navigating me in

41
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:45.960
these like small moments that I didn't really realize how important they were.

42
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.080
And I think if you can come here and if you can,

43
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:53.100
do you like if your guide can get you close,

44
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.630
but then you just say,

45
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.930
I'm going to test only myself from here in like from the 250 yard mark in.

46
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.110
If you can get it done on an axis here,
you can get anything done.
Yeah.

47
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:06.070
That's great.

48
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.490
<v 1>Learning skills.
Yeah.
I think that's black belts skills,</v>

49
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.400
especially if you're taking a large,
long shot.

50
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.720
And he managed to crawl into place because a lot of it is crawling.

51
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.430
If you plan on coming out here,
folks bring some kneepads.
Luckily our Sitka gear,

52
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.160
uh,
pants have built in knee pads,
which are excellent.
But if you,
if you,

53
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.490
if you use a different kind of Cammo,
first of all,
you shouldn't,
second of all,

54
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:33.430
if you do use a different kinds of chemo,
better get some knee pads.

55
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.860
<v 0>Just the pattern itself looked amazing.
Amazing.</v>

56
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.030
Like when we were glassing across,
when I would glass and look at you,

57
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.050
or when I'd look back,
you blend it.
I mean it worked really well.

58
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:47.610
It was straight everywhere.
The subalpine is the bomb.
It's the bomb.

59
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.650
<v 1>I've used a lot of different cammo trying different stuff out and you know,</v>

60
00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:56.070
I really love first light.
They make good stuff.
Um,

61
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.530
but sit cause the best,
they're the best.

62
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.280
They just take everything above and beyond everything is one step better.

63
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.390
<v 0>Yeah,
it was funny.
They won't,</v>

64
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.990
they won't come out and publicly say that subalpine is effective for like white

65
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.250
tail or Turkeys because the Gore,

66
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.930
the Gore methodology,
uh,
I don't know if I said that right,

67
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:24.931
but they have a protocol of having their tests to prove things or be able to

68
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:28.210
make a statement or very vigorous for Gore.

69
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.920
So because they've never truly tested subalpine to a turkeys vision,

70
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.820
they won't come out and publicly say that it's effective for Turkeys.

71
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.880
Even though I can tell you it definitely is early season white tails and midway

72
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:45.790
through the season for white tails,
hundred percent effective.

73
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:49.210
But what it was truly tested for was sub Alpine.

74
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:51.970
It was like tested for hunting big game.

75
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.400
And so they'll say that.

76
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.610
But I can tell you if there's any type of foliage that has a hint of green in

77
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:03.400
it,
it is effective.
It just breaks everything up.
So good.

78
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.500
Like when we were a Utah hunting elk,
gosh,
lend right.

79
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.490
And I went back a few times and I could I,
I couldn't tell where you were in the,

80
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:15.610
even in those poplars where there's some white and black speckle.

81
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.750
It looked amazing.
Yeah.
It's a perfect breakup pattern.
You just,

82
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.350
you don't see the,
the,
the human form for here,

83
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:28.351
what matters most is movement and I guess what the environment.

84
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.310
Ha Ha.
Now we have a something a little different Margarita.

85
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.960
Yup.
That'll work.
Yeah.
The movement is big,

86
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:45.460
but I became an even bigger believer in the Hex who was here when we had that

87
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:48.670
bird fly by and just land right behind us.
I was like,
dude,

88
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:52.120
what is wrong with this bird?
He was right in our idea.
We were there.
Yeah,

89
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:54.380
he's right in our business.
We were just sitting there,
sit in

90
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.100
<v 1>there and this bird just flew by and right next to us</v>

91
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.510
<v 0>and start tweeting away,
letting us know.
I think you said you go,</v>

92
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.630
what's this thing doing?
And I just looked at you.
I'm like,

93
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.590
that's what things do at the heck.
Squirrels jump on my shoulders.

94
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.750
Birds like try to land on me.
What a wig you out is when owls,

95
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.333
when I'm in a whitetail,

96
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.360
Stan and owls will come in and be like cupped gonna land on your shoulder.

97
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.860
If it's a small bird,
I'll let them do it.
If it's a squirrel,
I'm like,

98
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.330
get on there dude,
I'll,
I'll do that when it's got talents.
I'm like,

99
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.240
whoa,
like back off bro.

100
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.210
But I've had several outages Kinda come flying in.

101
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:38.380
They Cup up and they're just going to land on my shoulder and I,

102
00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:42.590
I have to just whip out just the hex.
Who for people who don't know,

103
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.830
h e c s the heck suit breaks up.

104
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.490
It blocks your electrical signal,
right?

105
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.020
The electromagnetic signal that your body gives off.
Yup.
Yup.

106
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.670
And it's been proven to work on fish and it's been proven to work on what other

107
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:02.570
animals fishes tested.
For sure.
Birds for sure.

108
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:07.010
Because migratory birds have had tons of tons of like,

109
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.040
I think I shouldn't say federal,

110
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:15.041
but like granted tests to track migratory birds and how they see,

111
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.040
and it's proven that birds do see in electronic fields.

112
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.400
So for birds they say that it's incredibly effective because like that's why

113
00:07:25.191 --> 00:07:26.300
they've got all that footage.

114
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.540
Being able to crawl out on keys and people shooting Turkeys from just sitting

115
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.450
next to nothing,
just you know,
being able to do it.

116
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:40.451
But for those it's really important that your hands and your face mask and

117
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:44.450
everything are fully covered with the hex where honestly I'm going with the

118
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:46.670
major muscle groups for my stuff,

119
00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:51.671
I wear the top and the bottom for small game in big game and I'm a believer man.

120
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.970
Skulls still skeptical though.
Yeah,
I mean,
you know,
some people say,
hey,
you know,

121
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:03.350
it seems like you're selling snake oil.
And I'm like,
I get it.
I get it.

122
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.020
You know,
I understand what you're saying.

123
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:09.470
All I can tell you tell you is like with bears,

124
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.960
they're predatory animals.
With bears,

125
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:15.710
my encounters with them has just been weird.

126
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.510
You know how well it works.
But then if my camera guy doesn't have it,

127
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.150
it seems like I'm picked off more.

128
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:28.690
So I definitely feel like when I've been in my one on one situations and I'm

129
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:32.810
fully,
you know,
fully clothed in it,
I wear it all the time.

130
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.980
I mean I guess it'd be easy for me to not to,
but I always do.
I mean I,

131
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.600
I'm a believer in it for sure.
Yeah.
I became more of a believer this trip.

132
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.610
I felt like there was too many moments to where deer was staring at us and they

133
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:49.220
just didn't know what the hell we were when,

134
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.370
whereas like some of the times in the past when I wasn't wearing it,

135
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.980
the same sort of situation to deal would start blowing and then they would take

136
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.500
our,
the baby take off.
Yeah.

137
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:01.350
Make that crazy barking noise and I took off when you,

138
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.910
when we got up to your deer and where are we?
You know,

139
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.630
we're kind of his final resting place where we took pictures and stuff.

140
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.810
Did you ever look back to the tree that we were,

141
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.350
for those of you who want to know,
we're actually on our flight back.

142
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:21.090
This is a flight podcast.
Everyone around is like,
what's going on?

143
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.300
Not,
nope,
we're just podcasting folks.
Um,

144
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:30.050
did you look back at that tree and see how small that tree really was?

145
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.580
Three small,
I've imagined,

146
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:37.581
me and Joe Rogan tucked up next to kind of a bonds I tree

147
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:45.310
and we had a crawl about 80 90 yards to get to 80 or 90 yards crawling and we

148
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:51.510
get to this tree and I,

149
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.280
I kind of grabbed the base of the tree and I'm trying to Shimmy up the tree just

150
00:09:56.281 --> 00:10:00.300
enough and I figured there was going to be a few access there.

151
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.570
And that's the thing with access when they're bedded you might see one or two

152
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.980
that standing up at the time,

153
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.390
but once I got there I look back at you and I'm like giving the signal like

154
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.610
dude,
like don't crawl but like on your belly scoot,

155
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.620
like just use your fingertips in your nails and like pull yourself to me cause

156
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:24.150
we the f the,
our cover was probably only two feet tall.

157
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.260
And with you with a backpack on,

158
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:31.170
that was about all you could spare was just laying flat to your stomach and

159
00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:32.040
crawl up to me.

160
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:37.020
And then you got behind me and used me as a blocker to come up and how many

161
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:41.700
deer,
how many dearer within 80 yards of us.
It was a lot.
It was a lie.

162
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.530
They were everywhere.
Shot the deer.

163
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:47.340
That's when we really realize how many there were.
Oh Gee.
Lot of them popped up.

164
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.270
Yeah,
tons.
It was pretty crazy.

165
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.260
So let's talk about your shot first because that was honestly,

166
00:10:55.261 --> 00:11:00.261
that was the highlight of the whole trip for me was just hearing that sound.

167
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.830
We had the sun hearted are back.
I couldn't really see,

168
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.950
I was trying to film so I couldn't really see where your Arrow went.

169
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.840
I just could see,

170
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.580
I could see that broad head right past my shoulder.

171
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.200
And I was looking at the tip of your broadhead and seeing how still it was.

172
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:23.400
I was like referencing it on something that was behind it and you are just

173
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:27.510
stable and I could see your broadhead coming back,
back,
back,

174
00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:32.100
back on the rest.
So I knew you're just pulling on that silver back.
Just slow,

175
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.430
slow and sweet.
And as soon as I heard it go dear,

176
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.520
I just looked right at the axis and I heard that sound that just I knew it had

177
00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:42.840
found the honey spot.
Well,

178
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:48.020
I committed 100% to the silver back last year when,

179
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.560
um,
when a hunted here I was using,
I was using a thumb trigger

180
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.390
<v 1>and which is great,</v>

181
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.070
but these deers so skiddish and these moments are so,

182
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:05.020
so adrenaline filled.
I felt like I made a decision.
I'm like,
look,

183
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.500
I shoot super accurate with the silverback.
Why won't I hunt with it?

184
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:12.370
Like what am I thinking?
Am I thinking that I need to make it go off quick?

185
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.330
Like what am I thinking?

186
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.910
I'm just going to go to 100% silver back and I'm super glad that I did because a

187
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.420
shot my uh,
elk last year in Utah with a silver back,

188
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.270
I shot that amazing elk at to hone ranch,

189
00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:29.140
which is like the furthest I've ever shot an animal,
75 yards,

190
00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:31.570
perfect shot in the heart,
silverback.

191
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.630
I practice with a silver back on practice with anything else.

192
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.160
Sometimes I'll practice with the knock to it,
but I use a silver back so much.

193
00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:42.220
I don't even think about punching the trigger,
don't even think about it.

194
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.640
I just put my thumb there and I pull through it the same way I do with it with

195
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:46.450
the silver bag.

196
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.440
<v 0>That's how it is.</v>

197
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:52.180
People don't realize that there's this window when you have one thing that you

198
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:55.390
really like and you feel comfortable with and you feel like you have control

199
00:12:55.391 --> 00:13:00.190
over,
which let's just say it's the knock to it or,
or an index finger,

200
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.400
wrist strap release,
and then yeah,

201
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:06.100
you learn with the silver back and you realize,
okay,

202
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.220
this is a good training aid and you're kind of afraid to lose that last little

203
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:12.670
bit of control that you have.

204
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.790
But there's that window that if you can push through that,

205
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:21.310
you forget about that feeling and you just realize this is like,

206
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.880
you almost realize there is no other option.

207
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.230
This is just what I shoot with.
Yeah.
This is all I use every day.

208
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.350
<v 1>Plus I can make it go off in a second or two seconds.
Once you learn it.
Right.</v>

209
00:13:33.351 --> 00:13:38.210
It's all in.
It's all in the scapula.
That's all in that preload.
Yeah,

210
00:13:38.211 --> 00:13:41.120
it's all in that muscle in the middle of the back,
the Rhomboids,
that's,

211
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.100
it's all in that and I shoot with it so much.
You know I,

212
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.480
I have that archery range up my studio and I'm just constantly shooting.

213
00:13:50.481 --> 00:13:52.490
I get there before work or shoot after work,

214
00:13:52.491 --> 00:13:54.740
I shoot her just constantly shooting,

215
00:13:54.741 --> 00:13:58.220
constantly shooting with that thing so my body knows exactly what to do.

216
00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.410
That was one of the most satisfying things about this trip.

217
00:14:00.411 --> 00:14:03.440
Like even the shots that I missed and I missed a couple shots because these

218
00:14:03.441 --> 00:14:06.290
animals are so fast and we took some,
you know,

219
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:11.350
long shots and one of them was 80 something yards and the Arrow was perfectly on

220
00:14:11.391 --> 00:14:15.120
track for the boiler room.
Things saw the Arrow or her,

221
00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:18.080
the Arrow and just like see ya there so fast.

222
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.690
<v 0>The one thing that's different with the access is I don't think access,</v>

223
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.500
try to locate a sound and then decide whether or not that sound is dangerous or

224
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:31.600
not.
With most animals,

225
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.660
what I found is the first reaction is to pinpoint where a foreign sound came

226
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:42.070
from and once they're locked onto that,
if there's anything following that,

227
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.760
then now they,
they kind of react like a fight or flight thing.

228
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.230
So I've had,

229
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.680
I can see this a lot in video footage like with elk were they'll hear the bow

230
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:54.320
and they'll turn and look to wear a bow went off,

231
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.540
but if they don't hear something coming,

232
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.860
they just stand there and the Arrow comes in.
And I really feel like that with,

233
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.720
with the four fletch setups we have,

234
00:15:02.721 --> 00:15:07.640
I feel like the arrows are quieter than what we shot in the past.
Personally,

235
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.690
we'll definitely want to shot last year because last year here I was trying to

236
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:15.080
use a fixed played and it was a fixed blade with some holes in it.
Yeah,

237
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:16.840
it was like a whistle of death

238
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.980
show on some of those longer shots that the deer would turn.

239
00:15:21.981 --> 00:15:25.700
But you could see them look up like on the footage.
Yeah.
These,

240
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:27.950
they didn't do that.
They just looked our way.

241
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.940
They never looked up to like that sound that they could hear coming in.

242
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.020
So that's why I think the,
the projectile was good,
but these things are just,

243
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.430
they're keyed in and we talked to,
uh,
our buddies,

244
00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:43.310
a Sloan from Yeti and Cole Kramer,

245
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.140
we're over on the main island hunting access to their,
on Maui.
Oh yeah.

246
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.390
They're on Maui hunting access.

247
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.710
And I asked them how they were doing and they're like,
dude,
shot a few.

248
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.300
Dos missed a few,
lost a few.

249
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:03.340
These sayings are just crazy how fast they react and move.

250
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.560
And you say it's just,
you think it's from tigers,

251
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.990
you think it's evolved to get away from tigers?

252
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.390
It's probably what it is from India.

253
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.980
They were given the King Kamehameha I think in the 18 hundreds but they're just

254
00:16:15.981 --> 00:16:18.560
an insanely fast animal.
There's so much faster.

255
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.810
You'd think of mule deer as being fast.

256
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.850
Like mule deer are drunk and on pills compared to these things.

257
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.660
Really.
They're like,
there's so slow.
I think these are,

258
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.200
these are as fast is a highly pressured south Texas whitetail that's come into a

259
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:40.790
feeder that's kind of like jumpy twitching the whole time it's there and you

260
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.740
kind of have to aim.
I got to the point where when I was out with Cam,

261
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:47.540
cam asked me where I am and I said,
dude,

262
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:52.750
my pin was sitting in the corner pocket of the leg in the body.

263
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.970
Like I literally,
every time I drew back I put my,

264
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.640
the pin I wanted on the back of its front leg.

265
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.180
I followed that back leg up until it touched the bottom of the body and I was

266
00:17:08.931 --> 00:17:11.360
pulling right there.
I was,
I was,

267
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.380
I was pulling on my trigger in a place where my pin,

268
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.960
if the Arrow hit exactly behind the pin,

269
00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:20.610
it would've liked just shaved hair off its arm pit,

270
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.660
but that's not where any of the arrows hit.

271
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.960
They were all ducking and turn in and I feel like they're moving at least four

272
00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:32.510
inches down,

273
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.560
possibly more and turning away.

274
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.460
It seems like they duck and spin out like that's their move.

275
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:45.770
Pick the feet up and like rotate 180 degrees.
You agree?

276
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.800
Yeah,
100% they're never like darting forward.

277
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:53.250
That's why I think that this is the perfect place to show how effective a rage

278
00:17:53.251 --> 00:17:54.084
is.

279
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.480
The perfect place to show how effective a large cutting surface arrow is.

280
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:04.550
So broad.
It is.
Yup.
The benefits of it.
Giant,
giant.

281
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.593
If the,
if you,

282
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:10.670
if you have the variable of not knowing 100% where that Arrow could hit,

283
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:17.250
you know you're going to be within an area where a kill zone possibly,

284
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:21.150
depending on how fast it's reacting,
it might be a little bit outside of that.

285
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.840
The more damage the better off you are.

286
00:18:24.841 --> 00:18:27.360
As long as you're able to still get some penetration.

287
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.040
And Cam said too on the last podcast,
he's like,
hey man,

288
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.230
I definitely see where there's an application for this.
Yeah,

289
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.280
he's a fixed bled phene fixed blade fiend.

290
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.330
Do you think you would've got your deer if you would have been shooting a fixed

291
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:47.100
blade head?
It's hard to say.
I mean,
it's hard to say.

292
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:51.200
You know,
you,
I think fixed blades,
many of them,
especially vented ones,

293
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:55.210
they're louder too.
Yeah,
that's a,
that's a factor as well.
Yeah.

294
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.280
It could have nothing really knew what had happened with your shot.

295
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.060
I mean,
there was a lot of deer there and it was like Bam.

296
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.300
And then that deer ran off and he knew that thing had to have been completely

297
00:19:09.091 --> 00:19:13.650
expired within
three seconds.
Yeah.
To be fair,

298
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.610
it's sprinted as far as it could get was like 50 yards,
which will,

299
00:19:17.611 --> 00:19:19.170
you see how fast and access runs.

300
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.850
50 yards is not very long and it was dead seconds and,
and,

301
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:26.910
and done and everything else was just looking around like what happened?

302
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.190
What happened?
Yeah.
I had a second shot.

303
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.610
I tried to get a second shot at another deer at 70 yards.
And that,

304
00:19:32.611 --> 00:19:36.540
that deer duck the string.
Yeah.
Because then they're all alert.
They're all like,

305
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.620
they knew what was up.
You shut the rx three.
Love it.

306
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.900
It's so first it was so quiet.
It's so quiet.
Quiet.
And in Rx one.

307
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.530
Yeah.
Which I loved.
Yeah.
I love the rx one,
but this is better.

308
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.950
I mean those Hoyt engineers,
man,
they know what they're doing.

309
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.400
It's thing is super quiet and super accurate.

310
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:01.320
Did Cam shoe in our XRD she likes.
Oh,
okay.
That's right.

311
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.800
I forgot which one he was shooting.
I'm,
I shot the helix to,

312
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.930
I'm going to switch back to um,
to an rx three.

313
00:20:09.931 --> 00:20:14.700
I think for elk season.
People ask me all the time why,
you know,

314
00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:16.020
why one over the other?

315
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:20.310
I like to shoot them all because I know people have different price ranges.
Um,

316
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.280
I don't think one's more accurate than the other.

317
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:27.090
I really like the fact that I can change my grips out on my,

318
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:31.410
on the human memorizer.
Yeah.
If I was honest,

319
00:20:31.411 --> 00:20:35.340
I would say I would like it if Hoyt went back to what they used to do on the

320
00:20:35.341 --> 00:20:37.620
carbon risers.
Where did they do that?

321
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.090
They wanted you to be able to have the ability to shift the new grip left or

322
00:20:42.091 --> 00:20:46.350
right depending on how your natural grip is turning the bow so that you can

323
00:20:46.351 --> 00:20:51.310
adjust it to have like perfect alignment of the Arrow down the center shot of

324
00:20:51.311 --> 00:20:53.860
the riser,
uh,
for you.

325
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:57.400
Because obviously we've been shooting together for years.

326
00:20:57.401 --> 00:21:00.430
You don't have natural torque in your front hand,

327
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.350
so I didn't have to shift it any way.

328
00:21:02.351 --> 00:21:05.320
Your Arrow and everything is lined up right down the pipe.

329
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:07.210
Like right down the stabilizer.

330
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.230
Your pin sits right on the outside edge of your shaft.

331
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:13.540
You don't have any torque in the,
in the riser at all.

332
00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:14.950
You don't even need to move it.

333
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:20.430
But I think some people have a natural ability to kind of grab the handle.

334
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.910
So they wanted you to be able to remove that screw,
lift the grip off,

335
00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:29.410
and you can move this aluminum plate left or right underneath the plastic grip

336
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.920
to kind of compensate for your natural tour.
Personally,

337
00:21:32.921 --> 00:21:37.510
I'd rather just not have the torque.
Yeah,
learn how to not shoot that way.
Yeah,

338
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.180
that's probably best.
Yeah.
It's like a bandaid.
So maybe

339
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.650
<v 1>love those.
Knock on elk plates.
Yeah,</v>

340
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.630
I loved the way it feels in the hand too.
It's extra grippy.

341
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:52.020
Even when you're sweaty,
it feels like it really sits in your hand.
Well,

342
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:56.920
<v 0>I've always said less.
Less riser in your hand is better,</v>

343
00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.300
you know,
less,

344
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:03.220
less than your hand gives you less ability to torque what you're holding on to.

345
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.230
Is it the same for pool cues?

346
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.870
<v 1>It depends.
Some people like a thin grip pool cue and uh,</v>

347
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.040
that's what they prefer.

348
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:17.100
I have big hands and I like a fat grip pool cue because there's less movement in

349
00:22:17.141 --> 00:22:21.730
my hand when I,
when I hold a pool cue,
when it's sitting in my hand,

350
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.110
I want,
I want my hand to be like just dead.
I don't ever want to,

351
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.600
I don't grip the queue.
No.
Like have a death grip.

352
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.620
So your elbow is almost like an upside down pendulum.
My cue sits on like,

353
00:22:32.621 --> 00:22:37.000
you know,
in Spiderman is his web show.
Those two fingers were Spiderman uses.

354
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.440
That's how it goes.
That's how I hold my cue.
My cue sits in those fingers.

355
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.120
And this,
so the idea is that it just like,

356
00:22:46.121 --> 00:22:50.350
you're almost throwing the queue at,
at the,
uh,
at the ball.

357
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.130
So you're throwing the queue at the cue ball so that uh,

358
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.600
you're kind of like letting the weight of the cue and the swing of the arm do

359
00:22:58.601 --> 00:23:02.800
the work.
You're not,
you're not death gripping it and jerking it and punching it.

360
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:06.670
You don't ever want to punch the cue ball.
You want me,
you want to,

361
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:10.060
you want to be relaxed.
The whole idea is to be relaxed.

362
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:11.710
When I'm playing at my very best,

363
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:16.711
I'm barely gripping the queue and I'm letting the natural texture of the rap sit

364
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:17.554
in my hand.

365
00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.980
And this one of the reasons why a lot of times I like to use a wrap lists queue,

366
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.620
which is just wood with you know,
a,

367
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:27.100
an enamel or I mean some slacker co cover on it.

368
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:32.220
And then I put a bees wax on the lacquer and that's my favorite cause just sits

369
00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:33.551
in the hand.

370
00:23:33.551 --> 00:23:38.170
It's tacky and I don't have to grip it at all and I just let the Q do all the

371
00:23:38.171 --> 00:23:41.290
work and it's like the more you can relax in,
the more I play.

372
00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:46.090
Like I play for a few hours,
then I get real relaxed and then I can

373
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.320
<v 0>really just sorta like gently move my arm and let the cue ball do all what the</v>

374
00:23:50.321 --> 00:23:54.950
acoustic,
move the cue ball and do all the work.
You're the same with archery.
Me,

375
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.690
it's like I can come out of the gate and feel really relaxed and feel effortless

376
00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:02.990
as I shoot and then as I fatigue I obviously feel like I'm putting more effort

377
00:24:02.991 --> 00:24:06.050
in.
When I'm ready to pack up.

378
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.710
You're just starting to loosen up and it's the same with with pool,

379
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:14.060
you could play pool forever.
I mean I've had to just be like,
hey dude,
I'm done.

380
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.490
Here's like,
I'm just getting loosened up.
Yeah.

381
00:24:17.491 --> 00:24:19.190
I get loosened up about eight hours in

382
00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:23.210
with with pool.

383
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:28.780
The guys that look like they're not putting any effort in is that when they're

384
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.440
with archery,
one guys look super comfortable.

385
00:24:33.441 --> 00:24:36.830
Like you almost feel like the bow isn't real.
You watch them.
You look at,

386
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.360
I'm at full draw and you realize it doesn't even look like they're holding 60

387
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:45.700
pounds.
Like they look,
everything is in line,

388
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:50.630
everything's efficient.
It look effortless.
Is it the same with pool?

389
00:24:50.631 --> 00:24:54.170
Exactly the same.
Yeah.
When you see someone tighten up from nerves,

390
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.250
you see their hand grip,
the Q different,
and you see movement.

391
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.490
You see like the cue cue goes a little bit left little bit,
right.

392
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.540
They've put unnecessary an accidental English on the cue ball.

393
00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:10.040
Yeah.
It's,
um,
it's one of those things where the more you can stay calm,

394
00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:12.830
the more you can relax and rely on technique.

395
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.250
That's one of the reasons why archery so attractive to me because there's so

396
00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:20.690
many parallels in pool.
So my name and martial arts as well.

397
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.660
One thing you said the other day that I really,
really liked,

398
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.020
and I don't know how we got on the subject,
it might have been yesterday,

399
00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:29.450
but we were talking about,
um,

400
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:34.400
we're talking about how sometimes in sport for me it's ease.

401
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.640
It always seems easy to forget the basics.
Like I forget and,

402
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.400
and all sudden there'll be coaching someone new or something and I realize

403
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.010
they're asking them this question.
It's like,
oh man.
Yeah,

404
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:50.600
I'm taken for granted this basic.
Yeah.
But for you,

405
00:25:50.601 --> 00:25:52.880
you said with comedy you never do that,

406
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:58.090
which I think has to make you better at it because you and actually with my

407
00:25:58.251 --> 00:26:02.630
school of nock what I do to myself every year in December,

408
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.000
every year in December,
I'm like,
okay,
whatever I've done this past year,

409
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.290
doesn't matter.
I'm going to wipe the slate clean.

410
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.190
I'm going to start with shooting enough arrows to where I can,

411
00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.750
I can build some stamina practicing and then I'm just going to focus on my

412
00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:22.220
fundamentals one week at a time to try to back up.

413
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.083
It's not as,

414
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:27.740
it's not going back as far in the basics is I think what you were talking about,

415
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.000
but it's still,

416
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.500
it's still a really cool like training aspect,

417
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.630
isn't it?
Yeah.
Well what we were talking about,

418
00:26:35.631 --> 00:26:40.340
what you're saying is every two years I ride a whole new act and I started,

419
00:26:40.341 --> 00:26:43.980
I'm like a beginner again.
I'm a beginner who knows how to do,
but I don't

420
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.120
<v 1>have any new material.
My material is,
or I don't have any old material.</v>

421
00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.510
My two materials all new,

422
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.770
so I have to figure out how to make it work and all these people are paying to

423
00:26:52.771 --> 00:26:53.604
see me,

424
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.880
so I have to work really hard at it so I can't be lazy and I can't take it for

425
00:26:59.161 --> 00:26:59.994
granted.

426
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.260
And it's like I become almost like a beginner again every two years.

427
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.390
So every year lately because of the Netflix special.
Yeah.
Well it's too,

428
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.250
yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's two years in between specials.
Every special,

429
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.760
I did one in 2014 2016 2018 so I'm on like a two year schedule.

430
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.020
It seems to me to be the right way to do it because you can Polish,
yeah,

431
00:27:25.021 --> 00:27:29.580
you can get you.
But what's most important as one that's special comes out.

432
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:34.940
Like my last one came out in October of last year of 2018 and that specialist

433
00:27:35.131 --> 00:27:38.970
out that materials dead.
It's gone.
You can't say it again.

434
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.570
Then I moved to the new material and then I have to write and I have to,

435
00:27:42.571 --> 00:27:44.430
so I have all these people coming to see me.

436
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:49.431
So there's no way you're ever relaxed or too comfortable or you can't take it

437
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:51.511
for granted.

438
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:55.110
You have to always be nervous and always be on the ball and always be working

439
00:27:55.111 --> 00:28:00.111
hard and always be concentrating on the fundamentals of comedy,

440
00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:05.211
like the making sure that you're using the economy of words,

441
00:28:05.491 --> 00:28:09.240
making sure that you're saying things in a way that makes sense to people.

442
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.510
The best way to get it to people won't sneak in the punchlines where they don't

443
00:28:12.511 --> 00:28:17.511
see him come in and have premises that are good and address those premises in a

444
00:28:17.701 --> 00:28:18.534
way.

445
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:22.770
It's like the most smooth way to do it and so it requires a lot of thinking

446
00:28:22.771 --> 00:28:24.210
about comedy a lot.
A lot.

447
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.290
It seems like you're in the perfect place to be so close to the store for you to

448
00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:30.180
be able to go to the comedy store.
I mean,

449
00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:33.930
can you think of something that morning and be like,
I want to try this.

450
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:38.400
I think of things on my way to the comedy store.
Really?
Yeah,
all the time.

451
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.400
And you're like,
I'm just going to throw this out.
That out there.
Yup.

452
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.620
Throw it out there to sink or swim.

453
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.800
Sometimes they sank and you've got to acknowledge it.

454
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:49.920
You got to let the people know,
all right,
that was a new joke and that sucks.

455
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.961
We're going to keep going.

456
00:28:51.961 --> 00:28:54.870
And then people get a kick out of it because they know that you're trying things

457
00:28:54.871 --> 00:28:57.690
out.
Like all the people that really know comedy.

458
00:28:57.691 --> 00:28:59.890
That's actually one of the beautiful things about the comedy store's.

459
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:04.860
How many comedy fans like real efficient autos go.
There are people who,

460
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.950
you know,
they know that they can go there on any night of the week.

461
00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:12.951
They could see some of the best headliners on the planet and they know the

462
00:29:13.381 --> 00:29:14.670
process.
They understand.

463
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:19.370
Particularly one of the beautiful things about podcasts is that through podcasts

464
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:23.820
,
um,
we talk about it all the time.
We talk about that process.

465
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.880
So the people that listen to my podcast and many other comedians podcast,

466
00:29:27.881 --> 00:29:31.560
they understand our process now where they didn't before.
10 years ago,

467
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:33.680
people had no idea of Comedians roadshows.

468
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:38.880
Now they know the people that are really big fans.
They know really well.

469
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:42.190
I've seen some of your lineups were just,
it happens

470
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:46.870
<v 0>to be where those guys go to the store and it's not like it's a lineup.</v>

471
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.860
It could be a fricking comedy.
All Star Math.
Oh yeah.
I mean,

472
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.150
I've seen names on that top sign rum,
like Jesus,

473
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:57.080
if you went there that night,
yeah.

474
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.790
You're like hitting the best of the best.

475
00:30:00.791 --> 00:30:05.110
You could plan it on the planet and it's 20 bucks,
20 bucks.

476
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:10.060
And you might see Dave Chappelle,
Joey Diaz,
Ari Shaffir,
Thompson Gurra,

477
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:14.530
Bert Kreischer me.
I mean,
you see crystal Lee,
uh,

478
00:30:14.531 --> 00:30:16.980
you see,
uh,
Tony Hinchcliffe,

479
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.730
Edwards Smith.
It's just over and over and over.

480
00:30:21.731 --> 00:30:25.330
It's like the lineup isn't saying guys you've never heard of that are murderers.

481
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.540
Yeah.
And I mean,
it's a,
it's a beautiful place.

482
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.740
It's one of the main things that keeps me in La.
Yeah.
For sure.

483
00:30:32.741 --> 00:30:36.430
That in the podcast you have a good routine.
Yeah,
man,
I was ready to go.

484
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:40.030
I was ready to get the hell out of California a long time ago.

485
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:42.880
They sucked me in.
Well.

486
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.960
What's cool about our relationship to is

487
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:53.730
there comes this point about November were you fully switch gears to comedy and

488
00:30:55.661 --> 00:31:00.280
I fully switch gears to product development coming out,

489
00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.640
really working on my shooting and I go in this,

490
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:08.230
I kind of go reclusive as a friend.
There's been,
I think it at Christmas time,

491
00:31:08.231 --> 00:31:11.290
didn't I text you at Christmas?
And I said,
sir,
you know,

492
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:15.190
sorry for being a bad friend.
You weren't a bad friend.
We both do the same thing.

493
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:19.750
We're both,
I'm like,
you know,
I just said,
I know you're doing the same,

494
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:24.780
but like that's from I think as soon as elk season ends you go,

495
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:28.190
you did start your rewrite and yeah,

496
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.410
you wipe the slate clean and you start polishing and when you're in that,

497
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:37.210
when you're doing your comedy,
do you have to to stay in there to really,

498
00:31:37.211 --> 00:31:38.260
really do good at it?

499
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:43.260
That was what was always hard with me when people ask me to do articles is

500
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.470
there's certain times a year where I feel like I can write an article and it's

501
00:31:47.471 --> 00:31:50.590
really me and a lot of times it's when I'm coaching.

502
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:55.870
When I'm coaching and I'm seeing new people and I'm thinking about these things

503
00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:58.180
or I'm working on people's gear.

504
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.330
I feel like I'm a good writer at that point,

505
00:32:01.331 --> 00:32:04.060
but when someone hits me in the middle of a time where I'm like

506
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.980
in the middle of family vacations or if I'm in the middle of a mountain El Con,

507
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:17.680
I just feel like I'm,
I'm like,
I'm kind of forcing it.

508
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.430
Is it the same for you?
Yeah.
Get those windows where you're like,

509
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:26.140
this is my window where I hang out with comics.
I just think about this stuff.

510
00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:28.000
This is where I'm thinking about when I'm working out.

511
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:31.210
Do you I can never get out of shape.
I got comedy is like,

512
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.780
it's very critical to never really get out of shape like out of shape is like

513
00:32:34.781 --> 00:32:36.850
this whole week I didn't do comedy.

514
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:42.070
That's as long as I did to me said some fucking shit fun though.

515
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.870
I know.
Yeah,
but I can tell you're always thinking about we,

516
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.310
we bring up subjects,
I can't even think of them,

517
00:32:49.311 --> 00:32:52.220
but a subject would come up and oh that night,

518
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:55.010
the last night when cam was there and me,

519
00:32:55.011 --> 00:32:59.880
you and cam sat there and then the girls finally came towards the very,

520
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.460
yeah,
we got on some subjects.
I was just looking around like,

521
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:06.250
is there anyone here?
I like,

522
00:33:06.251 --> 00:33:11.251
hopefully like we have some privacy because we went down some rabbit holes man.

523
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.580
But it was funny.
Well that's the

524
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.100
<v 1>beautiful thing about comedy.
You know,</v>

525
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:21.101
it's like everybody knows there's some subjects that you can't really bring up

526
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:27.260
around a lot of people and those are the ones I liked the most.

527
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.041
You know?

528
00:33:28.041 --> 00:33:33.041
Those are the ones that like if I can sell those to thousands of people,

529
00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:39.550
if I'm in a room and there's seven thousand ten thousand people in the audience

530
00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:44.920
and I can sell this soup or fucking dangerous idea.

531
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:51.770
<v 0>Sometimes I say,
I'm like,
hear me out.
Yeah,
like Jesus Christ,</v>

532
00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:52.760
what are you saying?

533
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:57.780
<v 1>But if you,
if you have a point and it's well thought out,</v>

534
00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:02.580
it's like they really appreciate that you took that crazy ass chance and then

535
00:34:02.581 --> 00:34:06.570
they're laughing with you.
Like,
I can't believe,
like I did a show.

536
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.410
Um,
uh,
last week,
uh,

537
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.260
we were in Chicago and I did this giant arena and Daniel Cormier,

538
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:20.130
who's never seen me do stand up before came and afterwards we're working

539
00:34:20.131 --> 00:34:22.490
together doing commentary in the next day he grabbed it.
He's like,
yeah,

540
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.870
<v 0>can't believe this shit.
You were getting away with me either.
Dude.</v>

541
00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:31.010
<v 1>It's funny,
but it's like you gotta know that you have a point.</v>

542
00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:33.620
You've got,
you got to really have that,

543
00:34:33.621 --> 00:34:37.130
but you can't just say it for shock value.
Like for me,

544
00:34:37.131 --> 00:34:38.930
especially at this stage in my career,

545
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:44.210
I'm in this very unusual,
uh,
stratosphere.

546
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.020
There's not that many people that are in the first place.

547
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:53.210
I would argue that you are in the stratosphere of your own dude.

548
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:58.580
You're at the top of this needle where you get away with shit that no one on

549
00:34:58.581 --> 00:35:00.800
this planet can get away with.
I don't know about that.

550
00:35:00.801 --> 00:35:03.800
I think maybe other people would get away with it if they thought that about the

551
00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:06.550
things that I was,
I did about this.

552
00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.410
You gotta you gotta have this,

553
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.800
I think about things a lot before I say him.

554
00:35:12.801 --> 00:35:16.400
I mean it's not like I'm just flippantly saying something that might hurt

555
00:35:16.401 --> 00:35:18.290
someone's feelings or piss somebody off.

556
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.840
Like I want to make sure I cover those bases.

557
00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:27.170
You almost cover everyone's opinion within that arena and you've got to start

558
00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:29.300
off with the people that are opposing you.
Yep.

559
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:31.470
You got to start off looking at it like from the,

560
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:35.450
<v 0>you bait them in.
Yeah,
I've been there.
I've been there at times where I'm like,</v>

561
00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:36.531
okay,

562
00:35:36.531 --> 00:35:40.350
he's wanting them to like him just for a minute cause he's getting ready to shit

563
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:41.184
on them.

564
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:48.140
I just learned them into a trap of logic.
Yesterday I'm here.

565
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:52.920
Yesterday we were at the hotel and I'm walking around with my Vegan cat shirt

566
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:59.280
and uh,
I have,
I told you a story.

567
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.630
I was at a,

568
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:06.130
I was in our Iowa and someone came up to me and they were legitimately,

569
00:36:06.861 --> 00:36:11.861
it was a lady and she was legitimately triggered and she just said,

570
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.830
do you kill cats?
Because I had the shirt,

571
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:21.360
that's one of Joe's shirt that has a cat with two x's on his eyes.

572
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.630
And it just says,
Hashtag yeah,

573
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.880
if cartooned out when cartoon animals would be dead,

574
00:36:26.881 --> 00:36:31.110
they would have x's for eyeballs.
So it was Hashtag Vegan cat,
which is,

575
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:32.130
you know,

576
00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:37.050
obviously one of the parts of Djogan Joe's Netflix special from last year.

577
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.840
But,
uh,
I'll just looked at her and I said,
no.
I said,
I love cats.
And I said,

578
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:48.170
I'm trying to raise awareness for people that are feeding their cats like a

579
00:36:49.021 --> 00:36:52.710
vegan and they're causing blindness in felines.

580
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.860
And she goes,
what?
And I said,
yeah,

581
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:01.050
people quit feeding their cats meat and they become blind.

582
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.550
And I said,
I'm trying to raise awareness.
And she's like,
oh my God,

583
00:37:05.551 --> 00:37:08.430
I had no idea.
Thank you so much.

584
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:13.710
I'm going to start to raise awareness to people were still yesterday when I was,

585
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.650
uh,
yesterday I went to uh,

586
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.550
to get a drink at the bar and the girl that came over and surgery,

587
00:37:20.551 --> 00:37:24.720
she stopped me yesterday and she goes,
do you hate cats?

588
00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:29.910
And I go,
why?
And she goes,
what does that shirt mean?

589
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:35.070
And she goes,
I hope it's nice.
And I said,
yeah,
it's totally nice.
And she goes,

590
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:39.330
great,
I'm a Vegan and I love cats.
And I'm like,
well we're friends.

591
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.820
But yeah,
that's one of the subjects right there.

592
00:37:44.821 --> 00:37:47.520
That's one of the subjects where you got away with it.
Dude.

593
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:49.140
No one else could get away with it.

594
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.390
<v 1>That one was,
that one was a lot of work.
That was a lot of work.</v>

595
00:37:52.391 --> 00:37:57.391
That one I had to like circumnavigate that terrain many times to figure out the

596
00:37:58.331 --> 00:38:01.840
right way to get that bit across cause that was a real thing that did happen.

597
00:38:01.841 --> 00:38:04.660
A lady really did say a bunch of mean stuff to me.

598
00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:08.680
And then I went to her account and it said Hashtag Vegan Kat.

599
00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:11.980
And I really did look at my watch and go,
shit,

600
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.120
<v 0>should I look at this like I should go to bed right now.</v>

601
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.680
And I know this is true because most of the time when Joe texts me something

602
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:24.660
that's,
it's within 30 minutes.
And when I wake up in the morning,

603
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.490
cause with the two hour difference you're going to bed around three 30 and I'm

604
00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:30.950
getting up around like four,

605
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.620
four 30 and why do you mind my best

606
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.250
<v 1>writing?
Whatever reason,</v>

607
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.120
<v 0>late at night.</v>

608
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.680
And I think part of it's cause my wife and my kids are asleep and I'm usually

609
00:38:41.681 --> 00:38:44.200
coming home from the comedy store.
So I work,

610
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:49.410
I do my sets and then I come home and then I write a lot of good time to do it.

611
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:52.810
Yeah.
Cause everyone's asleep and my brain's fired up.

612
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:57.580
So usually I'm just hanging out with the dog and just writing and then like

613
00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:59.510
right until it was too sleepy.
And then I go to sleep.

614
00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:03.500
But sometimes like I'll get these sparks.
So I'm like,
I'm like,
uh,

615
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:06.010
I'm a spark farmer.
I'm out there.

616
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:09.610
And just trying to farm some sparks or a forage or for sparks.

617
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.450
I'm looking for sparks and then I find a spot

618
00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.880
I below on that spark and I try to turn it into a flame and then I have to keep

619
00:39:18.881 --> 00:39:19.870
that flame alive.

620
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.920
And so then I have to keep working at it on stage and figuring out a way and

621
00:39:23.921 --> 00:39:26.850
then some people booed me or they'll get mad at me and I go to that.

622
00:39:26.851 --> 00:39:29.410
That's what I'm saying.
And then I have to figure out,
okay,

623
00:39:29.411 --> 00:39:32.230
how do I stop the BU in its tracks?

624
00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:35.740
Well I've got to get to their argument before they do.
Yeah.

625
00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:39.490
So I have to figure out a way in such a good way to approach it dude.

626
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:42.760
But it's like if you're crafty,
this sneaky.
Yeah.

627
00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:48.610
It's obvious you're a black belt in Jujitsu person cause you're baiting people,

628
00:39:48.611 --> 00:39:52.070
sneaking them in.
Yeah.
You up and son of a bitch once.

629
00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.660
You are one of those things where it's like I've been doing it now for more than

630
00:39:55.661 --> 00:39:59.650
30 years.
It'll be 31 years this August.

631
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:05.000
So it was crazy.
I'm trying to remember.
I remember you doing a show,

632
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.330
I don't know if he did a show at the Riviera,

633
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:12.880
but I was shooting in Vegas and I know it was late nineties,

634
00:40:12.881 --> 00:40:17.110
early two thousands and you were doing a show there.
Yeah,
yeah.

635
00:40:17.111 --> 00:40:20.290
I used to do shows there.
That was the only place I performed in Vegas was it?

636
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:24.700
Was it at Riviera?
Yeah,
I remember it then.
Yeah.
So that would have been,

637
00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.620
I'm sure it's 20 years ago.
So you'd have been 10 years in.
Yep.

638
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.710
And I think I remember,
uh,

639
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.580
I remember some of my friends go on and they were shocked

640
00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.500
because they said they're like,

641
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:46.840
he is not filtered in his comedy compared to how he announces the UFC.

642
00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:51.970
<v 1>Because you like I,
there's no subjects off limits.</v>

643
00:40:51.971 --> 00:40:55.190
Is there a UFC is a different job.
You know,
it's,

644
00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.900
it's very confusing for people and I kind of sympathize with them because I have

645
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.600
two completely unrelated jobs like comp,

646
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:08.740
well almost three because podcasting is sometimes funny,

647
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:13.360
but many times not like sometimes I'm just talking to scientists and then

648
00:41:13.361 --> 00:41:18.361
sometimes I'm talking to scholars or the diversity is what has people hooked.

649
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.810
But it's,
to me,
it's,
that's how I view the world.

650
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.520
I don't need to be funny.

651
00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.250
Like I don't ever try to be funny when I'm doing the UFC mom,

652
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.920
when my obligation,

653
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:34.840
when I'm doing the UFC is to give justice or to give,
uh,
to,

654
00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:35.450
to,

655
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:39.980
to honor the hard work that these men and women have put into and their training

656
00:41:39.981 --> 00:41:44.660
camp and to appreciate their effort and to appreciate their art.
The martial art.

657
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:49.690
You're super serious about martial arts hit when people try to make that funny.

658
00:41:50.151 --> 00:41:53.420
You don't like it?
No.
Most of the time I don't.
I mean,

659
00:41:53.421 --> 00:41:57.770
unless something funny happens.
Yeah.
But it has to be my balls are hot.
Yeah.

660
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:05.030
If something like that.
Yeah.
That's just genuinely funny.
I'll laugh at that.

661
00:42:05.031 --> 00:42:06.170
But for the most part,

662
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:11.440
my job is to make it exciting for people that are listening and to sort of

663
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:16.190
explain what's happening in terms of particularly the ground.

664
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:20.240
Like people kind of understand when someone's throwing a kick or a punch and

665
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:24.080
it's my job to point things out that I see like patterns.

666
00:42:24.081 --> 00:42:25.880
Sometimes I'll see like someone moving,
I'm like,

667
00:42:25.881 --> 00:42:29.000
this guy is moving at a much higher level in an off.

668
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.340
Sometimes that happens right before I got to gets knocked out.

669
00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:35.690
I'll say I see a bit like this this past weekend.
Um,

670
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.320
Ricardo Lamas was fighting Calvin cater and uh,
I said,

671
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:44.321
I see a big difference between the striking level of Calvin cater and Ricardo

672
00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:49.330
Lamas.
Calvin is just boom,
he lands a knockout blow.
Like right after I said that.

673
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.920
Like sometimes it's crazy.
Yeah,
it happens like that.
But you,

674
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:55.730
but that's important for,
for people at home.
Like they want,

675
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.130
they do the one,

676
00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:01.320
the one of the reasons why some people like me as a commentators,

677
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.610
cause they know that I'm,
I genuinely enjoy this.

678
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:07.880
This is not a job to me is something I don't think,

679
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:11.720
oh here I am working,
I'm getting paid,
I'm getting some money.

680
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:15.890
I don't think of that.
But I think is like I am,
first of all,

681
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:20.810
I love the sport I and I genuinely appreciate what these guys are doing are

682
00:43:20.811 --> 00:43:22.880
these girls are doing and I just want to give,

683
00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.770
I want to honor what they're doing.

684
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:30.280
I think anything you have interest in you a 100% come across as authentic.

685
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.960
And that's what,
that's what people say they like about me is because they say,

686
00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:40.961
I feel like you are a 100% authentic about your passion for archery.

687
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:41.990
Yeah.

688
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:46.990
And honestly I feel like social media helps accelerate that because people start

689
00:43:47.751 --> 00:43:52.751
to not have only this filter that the TV network allows people to see or that

690
00:43:55.281 --> 00:44:00.050
sometimes you are,
I don't have control on what that filter is.
We might say like,

691
00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.220
hey man,
that's not me.

692
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:05.690
Can you like I really like if you did it like this or like no,
you know,

693
00:44:05.691 --> 00:44:09.140
we've done some polls and this is really what we want.
Which is what,

694
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:14.230
which is why I left my network because I realized if I go onto a live feed

695
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.670
people a hundred percent get exactly how I feel.
Yeah.

696
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:24.700
And I think the more that they experience that their radars of people's natural

697
00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:30.740
radars of who's legit and who's not there.

698
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.980
Yeah.
And

699
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.150
<v 0>I think it's the,</v>

700
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:38.300
it's the best thing in the world for people like me or you or cam or any of

701
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:44.940
these people that we know within their fields where there they're real,

702
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.710
they're real people within those fields.
Or aunt,
you know,

703
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:52.170
Andy's a great example too.
He's like,

704
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.310
he's almost breaking the mold of what a lot of navy seals are doing.

705
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:58.920
Is it fair to say that because so many,

706
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:03.960
so many like ride their past to,

707
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:08.160
you know,
to try to,
you know,
build something,
whereas Andy's almost,

708
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:12.510
you almost have to drag it out of them.
You know,
you almost have to say like,

709
00:45:12.511 --> 00:45:17.040
no dude,
you've done some really cool shit.
We need to talk about this.

710
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.610
And he's trying to say,
well,
there's more to me than that.
You know,

711
00:45:20.611 --> 00:45:21.750
there's more to me than that.

712
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:25.860
But I think once people really see that honesty come forward,

713
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.280
that's what people are grasping for.
They're like,
I really want,

714
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:33.480
I really liked that person that I'm seeing.
That's what I want more of.
Yeah.

715
00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:36.000
You're not produced,
you know when someone wants it.

716
00:45:36.001 --> 00:45:40.380
That's a good way to put back on when you're doing a live stream or whether

717
00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.340
you're doing a podcast,
you're not produced.
And that's the same with me.

718
00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:45.720
I don't have anyone telling me to do.

719
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:48.610
And I've been in that situation where I had someone telling me to do and it

720
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:52.560
tells me what to do or what to say.
And it's,
it's just,
it's not as effective.

721
00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.310
It's not as genuine.
It doesn't come across that way.
Yep.

722
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:00.720
I saw today.
It's fun.
It's weird how your phone,

723
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.550
your phone's a spy.
I got today,

724
00:46:05.551 --> 00:46:09.660
I got ads pulled up in my Instagram about travel coolers.

725
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.540
Whoa.
Cause we were talking about coolers.
Yeah.

726
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:16.980
Last night at dinner we were going to get our meat home.
Isn't that crazy,

727
00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:20.640
isn't it?
It's so weird.
It's crazy.
Crazy.
So it's listening to us.

728
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.430
It's listening for sure.
Yeah.

729
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:27.030
It's those who can tell us what's happening.

730
00:46:27.031 --> 00:46:28.830
I want to know like what is your,

731
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:32.340
I need to get someone on that tells me what the hell you're phone is listening

732
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.530
to.
Cause that does happen to be all the time.

733
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.250
We're all of a sudden the Google feed news feed has ads.

734
00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.610
If that happens where you get really high before they come on,

735
00:46:41.611 --> 00:46:45.840
just so you can really study where she can really trip out because you'll be

736
00:46:45.841 --> 00:46:48.380
like,
whoa.
Yeah,

737
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:51.090
you'll be deep into that need to find out.

738
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:53.250
I need to find out how they're doing it and what they're doing.

739
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.530
Cause that's weird.
Like what if you're like planning a murder,

740
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.350
you know your phone on you and then also have FCI knocks on your door and I've

741
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:00.090
done or no,

742
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:05.090
I'm writing a book on murder and I'm planning it out with a friend to try to

743
00:47:05.281 --> 00:47:07.650
pretend that we are planning a murder.

744
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:12.470
So I could see how people talk when they're planning a murder.
So me and my,

745
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:16.230
that's a cover up there.
But if you did do that,
imagine if you did do that.

746
00:47:16.231 --> 00:47:21.090
Like if you were like Jack Carr,
right?
Our friend George Peterson who,

747
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:25.800
uh,
he just gave me these two new books.
I brought mine here,
read it.
But we were,

748
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:30.610
we never had downtime that we were having fun the whole time.

749
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.473
But like you say,

750
00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:35.620
Jack was writing a book or George was writing a book and he was trying to figure

751
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:38.190
out how jack is is a,
we should say is,

752
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:42.490
is his pseudonym that he uses for writing check cars is,
yeah,

753
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:45.340
it's his pen name is nom de Plume.
Um,

754
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.050
but if he was trying to figure out how someone would talk when they were setting

755
00:47:50.051 --> 00:47:53.790
up a murder and so he got together with an actor or,
or,

756
00:47:53.791 --> 00:47:57.370
or a detective or someone and said,
how w what would you say?

757
00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:00.040
Like how would you talk about it?
What would you do?
What would be the steps?

758
00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.160
And the phone picked that up and all of a sudden the FBI's knocking on his door

759
00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:07.600
and say,
Hey,
I'm not murdering anybody.
I'm writing books.
Like,

760
00:48:07.601 --> 00:48:08.980
what are we doing here folks?

761
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:13.600
What if you've got an ad for like ballet latex gloves,

762
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:18.580
bleed shaped,
climbed a shovel,
a 1987,

763
00:48:18.581 --> 00:48:21.400
18 minivan gasoline,

764
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:26.200
gasoline lighters and be like,
hmm.
Yeah.
I mean,

765
00:48:26.201 --> 00:48:27.550
I'm sure,
honestly,

766
00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:31.600
I'm sure there's companies that would pay if they knew this guy is a buyer.

767
00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:36.160
Oh yeah,
he's sketchy.
We don't care.
We're just trying to make money.

768
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:40.360
We don't know nothing.
Yeah.
We don't know nothing.
I think that,
um,
you know,

769
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:43.960
we're talking about to get away from that we were talking about when it comes to

770
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.340
honesty,
there's never really been,
uh,

771
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:52.330
shows where no one was telling anyone what to do.

772
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:53.913
There's never been like,

773
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:57.660
you think about how many downloads you get per episode like theirs.

774
00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:02.820
That's what you get for your archery podcast is like a successful cable show,

775
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:07.020
which is really crazy.
Yeah.
Right.
Think about it.

776
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:12.930
More downloads in two days on my podcast than what Friday night full draw at

777
00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:20.440
eight o'clock on the sportsmans channel got when I had that slot,
I couldn't,
uh,

778
00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:25.270
I,
I would only imagine that they can't compete.

779
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.110
No.

780
00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:31.060
Cause it's no way all watered down and it doesn't resonate with people the same

781
00:49:31.061 --> 00:49:31.894
way.

782
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:37.030
When people know that straight from your mouth and there's no one,

783
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.860
oh this is who John Dudley really is.

784
00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.890
Like one of the things that people tell me when they meet me,
they go,
oh,

785
00:49:41.891 --> 00:49:46.420
you're like,
hey,
how are you on the podcast?
[inaudible] and again that's me.

786
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:48.340
They just,
I don't have a boss,

787
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:52.390
but there's never been a thing like that when you don't have a boss.

788
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:56.000
And yet every episode reaches millions and millions of people.

789
00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:58.060
Like if I could see the number of people,

790
00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:03.240
if I could like be on a stage and look out and see like I had a be real from

791
00:50:03.641 --> 00:50:07.000
Cypress Hill on the podcast the other day.
That was a good one.
Amazing.

792
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:10.960
I love that guy.
I love him.
I love Cypress Hill.
But he,

793
00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:15.220
we showed video footage of when they're playing at Woodstock and that was a half

794
00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:18.280
a million people.
Well if I have a half a million people listen to a podcast,

795
00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:20.860
that podcast sucked.
Like something must've went wrong.

796
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:26.260
So think about the numbers like for a podcast that's like a killer podcast.

797
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:31.610
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's unbelievable.
Yeah.
What were,
I mean,

798
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:36.410
if you think back of like a really good band that sold out a stadium,

799
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:41.810
what that number would be in there?
Like this is a legitimate successful band.

800
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:43.720
Well,
I feel like,
uh,

801
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:48.320
a really big giant band can do like a football stadium,

802
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:53.630
50,000 people or 70,000 people,
which is,
you know,

803
00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:58.730
unheard of.
Right?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Those are giant,
giant numbers.

804
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:02.150
But that ain't shit for a podcast.
That ain't shit.

805
00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:05.900
So think about one of your podcasts is way bigger than a football stadium,

806
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.450
which was really nuts,
man.
Yeah,
it's really nuts.

807
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.900
It's never been anything like this and it's free.
It's free.

808
00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.980
There's never been anything like this and there's never been anything where have

809
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:21.130
to be using those sick and iPads for some other purposes back in the day.

810
00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:26.180
Yeah.
You need more than the sick and iPads.
Yeah.
Yeah.

811
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:30.980
More [inaudible] some,
you know,
some thick ones.
Yeah.

812
00:51:30.981 --> 00:51:35.660
These callused hands wouldn't be favorable.
It's,

813
00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:39.830
um,
it's cool though,
man.
I mean we,
we came at the right time for this.
You know,

814
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.900
we're,
we're,

815
00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:45.380
I mean for you to have laugh the sportsmans channel and enter into this new

816
00:51:45.381 --> 00:51:50.170
world.
Isn't it awesome though?
What I think is so cool is,
um,
and we,

817
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.340
me and cam talked about this,

818
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:57.970
about the number of people that we get exposed to that we would have never got

819
00:51:59.091 --> 00:52:04.010
to hear their voice.
People that write just a super cool book having a,
you know,

820
00:52:04.011 --> 00:52:09.011
that have dedicated their lives to an to an awesome topic.

821
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:11.510
Yeah.
And you would have never,
like,

822
00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:15.830
unless jre was out there for you to go down some wormhole at three o'clock in

823
00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:19.670
the morning and be like,
you know what,
this dude like,
I gotta get this guy on.

824
00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:23.000
He's,
he's tripping me out with some of this information.

825
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.890
And then you share it to millions and millions and millions of millions.
Yeah.

826
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:31.610
The,
I mean it makes,
honestly,

827
00:52:31.611 --> 00:52:35.000
it makes mainstream,
it makes it harder for them to lie.

828
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:36.880
Thanks.

829
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.970
Don't you think makes it harder for them to survive because they seem so corny.

830
00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.900
Like you have a,
a mainstream show that covers these subjects.

831
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.390
It's like stupid music and dramatic,
you know,

832
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:53.430
reads and it's obviously written and they don't get to just talk like to,

833
00:52:55.630 --> 00:53:00.630
to discuss subjects you need time to define or how someone really feels about a

834
00:53:01.221 --> 00:53:04.220
subject.
You need time.
Yeah.
And you know,

835
00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:08.900
and what these shows are trying to do is they're trying to create these gotcha

836
00:53:08.901 --> 00:53:09.650
moments for,

837
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:13.550
they're trying to catch people and misrepresent their position on things and

838
00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:16.380
they're trying to,
you know,

839
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:19.970
they're trying to like create controversy cause that's how they sold things in

840
00:53:19.971 --> 00:53:23.300
the past.
But people are getting tired of being bullshitted.

841
00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:26.100
They're getting tired of it.
They want to like,
like when

842
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.350
<v 1>I had Graham Hancock on the other day,</v>

843
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:32.460
it was this massively successful podcasts.

844
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:34.470
Millions and millions of people downloaded it.

845
00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:38.940
And it's about the origins of civilization on earth,

846
00:53:38.941 --> 00:53:40.830
which is such a crazy subject.
Yeah.

847
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.220
I think that so many people would be fascinated by,
but they are,

848
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:47.940
but they were never represented before because it was never given to them in a

849
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:51.610
way where you could just listen to the author who was this incredibly well

850
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.820
researched guy,
incredibly articulate,

851
00:53:53.821 --> 00:53:55.980
has been passionate about the subject for decades,

852
00:53:56.190 --> 00:54:01.190
and who is also often maligned by mainstream archeologists and scholars,

853
00:54:01.201 --> 00:54:02.360
and now they'll,

854
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:07.170
those mainstream archeologists and scholars through new evidence and new

855
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:12.200
discoveries have been forced to recognize that human beings have existed in

856
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:13.560
these,

857
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:18.560
these more advanced civilizations in ever we than anyone ever thought before.

858
00:54:19.021 --> 00:54:21.150
For many,
many,
many years,

859
00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:26.240
thousands of years prior to when we had dated organized civilizations and

860
00:54:27.061 --> 00:54:31.530
cultures,
and it wasn't that these subjects were an interesting before.

861
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:36.240
It's just that you didn't get a chance to listen to someone talk about it.

862
00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:41.090
<v 0>No.
It stop without an interruption or without a producer saying,
you know what?</v>

863
00:54:41.091 --> 00:54:42.680
That part was an interesting,
right.

864
00:54:42.681 --> 00:54:47.681
Now there's gaps or you leave someone the ability to intervene and say,

865
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.561
well,
no,

866
00:54:48.561 --> 00:54:51.830
that's not accurate because he never mentioned this because I actually had,

867
00:54:51.831 --> 00:54:53.540
but they edited it out.
Yeah,

868
00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.660
that'd be the person that'd be on like a PBS special.

869
00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.780
And you're at the mercy of when the error yeah.

870
00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.770
How they break it up into their 22 minutes and it doesn't,

871
00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:06.560
it doesn't give it the justice that,
you know,

872
00:55:06.561 --> 00:55:09.630
obviously someone that's dedicated that much time where it deserved.

873
00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:11.930
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
it's um,</v>

874
00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:17.420
it's a new world and you and I got super lucky that we kind of stumbled into

875
00:55:17.421 --> 00:55:21.230
this new world,
you know,
and,
uh,
I was listening to your podcast,

876
00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.150
longform met you and,
uh,

877
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:26.420
why I watch your TV show and then I found out about your podcast and then I was

878
00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:30.310
listened to your podcast and I was saying how crazy this,

879
00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:34.520
this guy's talking about like x tens and different flood chains and different

880
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:38.020
configurations and healing goals and all this shit.
Like,
Whoa,

881
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:39.200
fuck is listening to this.

882
00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.820
<v 0>How can I write that in the 1200 words to kids?</v>

883
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:47.080
You can't someone be like,
Hey,
we need a feature article.
Right.

884
00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:49.750
1250 cap it out.
But to me it

885
00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.240
<v 1>really,
um,</v>

886
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:56.450
resembled pool in a way because with pool there's all this talk about low

887
00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:03.780
deflection shafts or 13 millimeter tip versus 12 millimeter,

888
00:56:03.781 --> 00:56:08.640
12 and a half millimeter,
a carbon fiber shafts.
Um,

889
00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:13.770
uh,
maple butts versus uh,
Ebony which is a stiffer,

890
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:16.440
heavier way.
19 inch sh

891
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:20.270
<v 0>balance carbon you told me.
Yeah.
There's Internet for shafts.
Yeah.</v>

892
00:56:20.271 --> 00:56:24.190
A lot of the top top players are using carbon shafts

893
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:27.790
<v 1>and like the big name companies,
like a Predator,</v>

894
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:31.540
they're making carbon shafts for,
for cues.
And a lot of people swear by them.

895
00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:33.640
They don't Ding up like regular ones do.

896
00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:36.400
But it's also like if I started talking to people the way,

897
00:56:36.401 --> 00:56:38.110
I mean I've been playing pool for

898
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.710
20,
25 years.

899
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:48.550
Yeah,
about 25 years I've been playing pool like pretty,

900
00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:49.960
I mean I never really stopped.

901
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:53.320
I mean maybe a little bit when I was really getting heavily into video games,

902
00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:56.110
I deviated a bit.

903
00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:01.560
But for 25 years I've been playing pool and experimenting with different tips

904
00:57:01.961 --> 00:57:06.961
and later tips versus buffalo hide tips versus cow high versus pig tips.

905
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:13.000
Something means is all these different types of just kinds of equipment.

906
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.390
And

907
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:16.960
<v 0>You tell them that you saying this right now is probably like when you listen to</v>

908
00:57:16.961 --> 00:57:18.520
one of my first podcast,

909
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:22.840
I think one of my first podcast or the top few was,
um,

910
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:27.490
cause I kind of wanted to come out of the gate with,
this is how deep I've gone.

911
00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:32.350
And so I got James Park on,
which I love James.
He's an awesome dude.

912
00:57:32.351 --> 00:57:33.370
He's from Australia,

913
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:38.910
but this guy could have a doctorate in the aerodynamics of an Arrow.

914
00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:42.400
That's probably one of the ones that tripped you out probably.

915
00:57:42.401 --> 00:57:45.130
But now you're talking pig tips.
Yeah,
the pool cue.
Yeah.

916
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:49.480
Thinking like it's making sense where I'm like,
well Duh.
Yeah,

917
00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:52.900
different density leather tips when totally makes sense.

918
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:57.880
But I never even knew it existed until right now.
And now I'm thinking,
Oh shit.

919
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:59.740
Yeah.
Now I'm thinking,

920
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:04.630
well there's 50 different types of plastic.
Like how many are they playing with?

921
00:58:04.631 --> 00:58:08.200
Delran then put in the pig to Dick on the top of it.

922
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:09.720
Are they using for skin yet?

923
00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:16.050
<v 1>Yeah.
And then there's also wrapped cues versus rap lists.</v>

924
00:58:16.051 --> 00:58:17.720
The way you hold it,
the way you grip it.

925
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:21.230
Some guys like to grip it with their wrists bent forward so there's less

926
00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:23.120
variation.
Some guys let the,

927
00:58:23.121 --> 00:58:27.430
let the light to let the law Risko real loose and let the,
the cradle,

928
00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.930
the Q in their hands.
It's a,

929
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:33.470
there's all these different techniques and strategies and like it's also like

930
00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:34.640
finger punches,
right?

931
00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.940
Some guys who can punch that trigger and they can do it really accurately.

932
00:58:37.941 --> 00:58:39.080
It's very few people.

933
00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.020
That's the same thing with guys who have a death grip on the queue.

934
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:44.850
Some guys have a death grip on the Q line play.
Really?

935
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:49.940
Now you don't have a death grip,
but you know it's like anything else.

936
00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:54.230
You would have to learn how to do it correctly and you would have to practice.

937
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:55.071
You know,

938
00:58:55.071 --> 00:59:00.071
I practice playing pool by myself mostly most of the times and I play,

939
00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:04.970
I played by myself.
I wish I could do what ironman does,

940
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:08.860
where he talks at Jarvis and they expand stuff.
I want to do that on that.
On

941
00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:12.310
<v 0>your brain when you're looking at angles on a,
yeah,</v>

942
00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:15.430
because you want much when I'll break if I break,

943
00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:18.580
cause Joe and I've played together a couple different times.

944
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:25.200
You look at the table and I can see like I know you're thinking Joe the when the

945
00:59:25.551 --> 00:59:30.020
thinking Joe's there like all the cogs are turning and you're doing you're rain

946
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:30.854
man thing.

947
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:35.630
I wish I knew how many different angles and shit you were looking at.

948
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:38.930
Well I'll tell you if you want,
you know I'll,
I'll show it to you.

949
00:59:38.931 --> 00:59:40.490
Like we were talking about a little bit the other day.

950
00:59:40.491 --> 00:59:43.190
I was like well I have to go with the four.

951
00:59:43.191 --> 00:59:46.490
I have tinted with righthand English because I have to wind up on the left hand

952
00:59:46.491 --> 00:59:49.890
side of the five cause I want to drift down to the sixth is so close to the

953
00:59:49.891 --> 00:59:50.480
second.

954
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:54.260
I don't have the seven rather I don't have much room or playing your whole

955
00:59:54.261 --> 00:59:58.010
layout.
I played four balls ahead always.
That's it.
No.

956
00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:02.120
Sometimes I only play three balls ahead if it's like a fairly easy rack but

957
01:00:02.121 --> 01:00:05.690
sometimes I like to play four balls ahead.
They give.
If there's a cluster,

958
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:08.600
then I know I have to break it out.
I can't,
I can't fuck around.

959
01:00:08.601 --> 01:00:12.470
I have to make sure that I'm on the high side of this ball because when I

960
01:00:12.471 --> 01:00:16.410
collide,
when I make the shot,
I have to hit that second bar.
I will.

961
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.010
I won't be able to get out.
I'm trying to get out.

962
01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:23.750
I'm not trying to just when I want to watch someone play because everybody likes

963
01:00:23.751 --> 01:00:26.120
to say they know how to play pool,
which is hilarious.

964
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:29.120
People come to my podcast studio,
they're like,
oh,
you play pool.

965
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:32.810
Let's play some pool.
I knew you well enough to just say,

966
01:00:32.811 --> 01:00:36.890
I don't know shit about further.
When you're like,
do you play pool?
I'm like,
nope.

967
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.200
I don't want to hold this thing,
but I always,

968
01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:44.360
I watch how they make a ball if they just try to make a ball.
I was like,
oh,

969
01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:47.630
okay.
You can't play pool.
You might be a little pockets and balls,

970
01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:49.400
but I'm going to fuck you up in the long run.

971
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:53.330
You might be able to make all the shots and run out and I'll say,

972
01:00:53.331 --> 01:00:57.590
congratulations,
that was a disaster you got out,
but those terrible,

973
01:00:57.591 --> 01:01:02.000
I did that twice.
It can happen.
Yeah,
it's actually the perfect,

974
01:01:02.001 --> 01:01:07.001
this is the perfect time to talk about when people try to argue with me why?

975
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:13.850
When they say what I'm doing is work and it's always worked and they're like,

976
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:17.750
we know you teach that way.
The way that I teach,

977
01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:21.080
I would say 80% of the people,

978
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:25.220
it maximizes them to the best of their ability.

979
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.720
Are there a fraction of people that are like the exemptions to the rule?

980
01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:36.410
Yeah,
and you can probably go and win a tournament.

981
01:01:36.411 --> 01:01:41.300
You could probably at some point in your career if you go to enough major
events,

982
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:43.820
you'll win lawn doing it your way,

983
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.230
but I,

984
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.810
I'm certain that what I'm teaching will get the mass,

985
01:01:50.811 --> 01:01:53.900
majority of people more

986
01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:59.990
production over a long run,
there'll be more effective.
Right,
right.
Way To do it.

987
01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:04.520
Is that right?
Is it the same?
Yes.
It's like,
I beat you two games of pool.

988
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:06.830
But to me that's like,
you know,

989
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:10.490
if you fricking throw three things out of the window,

990
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:16.430
you know,
one every hundred times is going to land where you think it might land,

991
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.130
but it's just cha,
it's chance.
Well,
playing on a eight

992
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:24.090
<v 1>by four,
which is a smaller table and it has buckets for holes.
It's like,</v>

993
01:02:24.091 --> 01:02:28.410
like those buckets,
all those things factor in.
And you know,

994
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.400
the table that I have in my studio is sucks.
It's bad.

995
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:33.660
That's a brutal table.

996
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:37.470
That's like one of those metal targets that has the softball size.

997
01:02:37.471 --> 01:02:42.390
Actually what it is shooting at 40 hours.
Every shot.
I'm like,

998
01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:46.230
dude,
I swear I would've made the shot at my old table at home.
And you're like,

999
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:48.740
yeah,
these pockets are a little smaller.
I'm like,
Dang,

1000
01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:52.610
they're an inch and a half shorter than a regulation pocket.
Yeah.

1001
01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:56.730
But that's how I,
that's how I practice.
By the way,

1002
01:02:56.731 --> 01:03:00.410
the last podcast I did with Joe on the Gre,
uh,

1003
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:04.620
there was a few people that said I might've gone too far on the,
on the drink.

1004
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.010
Just so everyone knows.

1005
01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:12.780
Joe was beating my ass for about three hours on the pool table,

1006
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.330
on the small ass pockets.

1007
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:20.750
So I was just like drinking my sorrows away and about the time he was all warmed

1008
01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:24.690
up and it had enough of me said,
let's podcast.
And I'm like,

1009
01:03:24.691 --> 01:03:28.680
I thought we were podcasts tomorrow.
He's like,
no,
let's just go now.
So yeah,
that,

1010
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:32.670
yeah,
that was a rough one.
You didn't win a single game that time.
That was rough.

1011
01:03:32.671 --> 01:03:35.850
That fucking table is rough,
man.
That table's rough.
It was,

1012
01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:40.080
but that's my practice table.
That's how I like,
it's like putting that um,
uh,

1013
01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:44.400
outdoorsman,
atlas pack running up,
taking you right to the TAC and be like,

1014
01:03:44.401 --> 01:03:48.670
all right.
Yeah,
yeah.
120 yards.
Hit that sheep.
Yup.

1015
01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:53.970
37 degree angle.
Good luck.
Know Finder.
Exactly.

1016
01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:58.050
Hope that,
hope you've learned some stuff.
It's a,
you know,
there's levels,

1017
01:03:58.051 --> 01:03:59.070
there's levels to everything.

1018
01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:04.230
And one of the things that I learned very early on when I became obsessed with

1019
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:09.180
martial arts was how important technique is to generate power,

1020
01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:13.560
to generate real power and to be,
to do things correctly.

1021
01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:17.880
Can you name one field where that's not important?
I can principles,
no,

1022
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:20.970
I can't comedy.
It's with everything.
Like Joey Diaz,

1023
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.370
when you see Joey on stage,

1024
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:28.260
he's so wild and crazy and his comedy is so,
it's so out there.

1025
01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.680
You think may be,
there's no technique to it,

1026
01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:33.840
but he's one of the best technicians.

1027
01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:36.640
He knows exactly what exactly what he's doing does,

1028
01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:41.810
but he's such an amazing technician because he has the best economy of words.

1029
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:47.430
Like,
here's a Joey Diaz joke that I love.
He goes,
I like transvestites.
They Cook,

1030
01:04:47.431 --> 01:04:51.390
they clean.
You can beat on them.
Every once in awhile the cops come pull.

1031
01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:56.250
They're going to believe me.
Uh,
some dude with a wig and a black eye.
Those jokes,

1032
01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:00.900
that's a great bit.
And the jokes come at you before.

1033
01:05:00.901 --> 01:05:03.750
You know where he's going.
Yeah.
The cops come,

1034
01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:07.740
who are they going to believe me are some do with a wig?
And a black guy.

1035
01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:12.630
That's a brilliant joke.
But it's that economy of words and there's a,

1036
01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:14.190
there's a,
that's like a skill.

1037
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:18.400
If when you see a comic and they have too many words before they get to the

1038
01:05:18.401 --> 01:05:18.850
punchline,

1039
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:21.670
either that's a new joke and they're trying to figure out how to say it,

1040
01:05:21.671 --> 01:05:23.380
which I do when I have new jokes,

1041
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.940
I'll oftentimes go back and listen to old recordings of a joke that I'm doing.

1042
01:05:27.941 --> 01:05:30.430
Like three months later where I've got it down,

1043
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:32.920
I'll go back and listen to how I started doing it three months ago.

1044
01:05:32.921 --> 01:05:33.880
And it's embarrassing.

1045
01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:38.380
It's terrible because there's so many extra words in itself.
Meandering.

1046
01:05:38.381 --> 01:05:42.700
It's just,
yeah,
the,
so there's technique to everything,
man.

1047
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:44.530
Everything.
But in martial arts,

1048
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:50.580
the consequences of having poor technique or the the most devastating cause

1049
01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:54.260
you're gonna get hit or you Canadian strangled or are you going to get your arm

1050
01:05:54.261 --> 01:05:55.090
snapped?

1051
01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:59.350
Like all the technique in martial arts is super,

1052
01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:00.850
super critical.
It's everything.

1053
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:06.630
Do you think there's people that could just focus on five basic principles of

1054
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:11.500
like Jujitsu and just Merck and that's all they do,

1055
01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:15.490
but they do it so well.
They can just wait on it perfectly.
You,

1056
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:20.670
there's a guy named John Donna her who has done an amazing job and training

1057
01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:22.090
these killers,

1058
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:26.950
just incredible athletes who've been able to beat people with far more

1059
01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:30.500
experienced than them because John who was a,

1060
01:06:30.501 --> 01:06:34.930
a a philosophy major in college and just,
he's a brilliant man.

1061
01:06:35.070 --> 01:06:40.070
A true genius has figured out a way to cut to the chase and figure out what is

1062
01:06:41.111 --> 01:06:41.980
most important,

1063
01:06:41.981 --> 01:06:45.760
what am I trying to achieve and what are the barriers trying to achieve this.

1064
01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:50.770
And then he's figured out a way to apply that to his students.

1065
01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:55.980
And it teaches students in this way that cuts the learning curve down radically.

1066
01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.580
And because of that,

1067
01:06:57.581 --> 01:07:02.410
he's developed these guys like Gary Tonin or Gordon Ryan or Nicky Ryan.

1068
01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:06.340
He's like guys who have not been doing Jujitsu relatively,

1069
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:09.040
haven't been doing Jujitsu near as long as their competitors,

1070
01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:14.020
but are far more effective.
Yup.
So they're seeing some of his stuff.
Yeah,

1071
01:07:14.021 --> 01:07:16.210
he's genius man.
He's genius.
But,

1072
01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:22.130
but it's that it's,
it's the analysis.
What it is is a,

1073
01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:22.660
uh,

1074
01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:27.660
superior intellect that applies that superior intellect to something where

1075
01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:30.640
people may not have been as focused.

1076
01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:34.720
And there's also a problem that you Jitsu where a lot of people just like to

1077
01:07:34.721 --> 01:07:39.010
roll.
They just liked to spar because it's fun.
You learn a couple techniques,

1078
01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:42.460
then you try to get each other.
Cause it's a,
it's a fun,
it's a fun thing to do,

1079
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:46.770
but the best way to do it is to drill and the re the really best way to do it as

1080
01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:50.740
a drill with intent and,
and understanding of each piece.

1081
01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:54.580
Like a very detailed,
comprehensive understanding of each position.

1082
01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:58.810
And what's the danger of not having inside control.

1083
01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:03.130
What's the danger of not having the underhook with and,
and see,

1084
01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:04.900
that's what,
for me,

1085
01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:10.000
that's what I feel like some of the places where I've gone and done Jujitsu,

1086
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.530
they're not explaining.

1087
01:08:11.531 --> 01:08:16.010
So it's hard for you to absorb because I think just based on my background,

1088
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:21.700
<v 0>I'm wanting to know the basics and the why's and the drills and I'm totally</v>

1089
01:08:22.461 --> 01:08:24.500
comfortable just being in the drills,

1090
01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:28.970
just being in the drills to where it's hard for me to want to learn something

1091
01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:32.180
new because I know that I'm not doing what you told me before.

1092
01:08:32.181 --> 01:08:34.520
Good enough for me to say,
okay.

1093
01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:39.530
I feel like I'm doing that without having to consciously really try hard at it.

1094
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:43.430
Yeah.
And I,
I love that about sport where you,

1095
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:48.640
you're able to just drill and drill and drill until the subconscious absorbs it.

1096
01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:54.260
And it's like at that moment I feel like I've made a step.
Yeah.

1097
01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:59.320
And now now drop something else in and I call it selective cycling.

1098
01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:06.100
I cycle things in when I feel like I've absorbed something that I've already

1099
01:09:06.381 --> 01:09:10.730
worked on.
It's like that with students.
You know,
Andy said it before,

1100
01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:14.480
he goes a year end.
You tell me something.

1101
01:09:14.481 --> 01:09:18.320
Were you just now tell me it and I look at you and I'm like,

1102
01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:21.980
a year ago I was doing this right.
And you knew it.
And I'm like,
well yeah,

1103
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:24.680
of course I knew it,
but it wasn't relevant.

1104
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:30.230
You're ready now to know right now you're ready to know.

1105
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:34.400
And I almost feel like it's better,
at least for some people.
For me,

1106
01:09:34.401 --> 01:09:39.200
I feel like it would be that way because I would always be thinking back to,

1107
01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:43.220
well,
why was I doing that?
Why or I,
deep down,

1108
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:47.150
I know I'm not doing good enough.
Like I'm not doing an efficient enough.

1109
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:52.630
Whereas sometimes I've gone with people in there like we just roll because

1110
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:58.850
eventually you'll just start to realize why it's important and that there,

1111
01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.880
honestly,
the places where I've stopped going is,

1112
01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:06.920
is those places because I'm like,
I can't,
I don't feel like I learned that way.

1113
01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.820
<v 1>The things that we do at 10th planet is,
um,</v>

1114
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:17.080
Eddie breaks things down into paths and paths where people escape and then pass.

1115
01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.600
When people counter,
like sometimes like you'll,

1116
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:24.930
you'll have a path where you will pass someone's guard,
moving them out,

1117
01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:28.430
go for the arm bar,
they defend the arm bar,

1118
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.380
then they wind up on top,

1119
01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.070
then they pass and then they go into like an arm triangle or some other

1120
01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:34.970
submission.

1121
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:39.170
So the person who was initially attacking winds up being the person who gets

1122
01:10:39.171 --> 01:10:44.120
submitted and you'll do this path and drill this path and you,
you basically,

1123
01:10:44.121 --> 01:10:49.121
it's almost like a choreographed a sequence of events that will take place in

1124
01:10:50.211 --> 01:10:53.150
sparring.
Like where you'll catch yourself in an arm bar,

1125
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:56.650
you defend that arm bar and then all of a sudden you find yourself inside

1126
01:10:56.690 --> 01:11:00.980
control and then you find yourself submitting someone with this very same

1127
01:11:00.981 --> 01:11:02.000
sequence of events.

1128
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:07.390
And that just builds your understanding of the positions and understanding of

1129
01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.430
like what can take place from those positions.

1130
01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.580
Like there's certain arm bars that you can catch while someone's going for a

1131
01:11:14.581 --> 01:11:15.530
twister or,

1132
01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:19.350
or someone's in the truck or if someone's in these various positions and until

1133
01:11:19.351 --> 01:11:21.180
you're there you don't really know it.

1134
01:11:21.181 --> 01:11:24.000
So the two to do it in like a very clear path.

1135
01:11:24.001 --> 01:11:28.850
So all the warm ups that we do will be these,
these pathways.
Yeah.

1136
01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:32.060
<v 0>And I think it's important to,
you know,</v>

1137
01:11:32.061 --> 01:11:35.510
there's people that say they listen to me and the,
and they just say,
you know,

1138
01:11:35.511 --> 01:11:38.510
I just don't get it.
I,
for whatever reason I don't like,

1139
01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:42.200
I don't like with Dudley's talking about,
I get it.
Yeah.
I've gotten,

1140
01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.840
I've gotten goodness,
it's an ego thing.

1141
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:47.900
I've gone to places I think sometimes,

1142
01:11:47.901 --> 01:11:52.820
but I've gone to places where for whatever reason I'm hearing the same thing,

1143
01:11:52.821 --> 01:11:53.570
but I,

1144
01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:58.570
it's easier to take it in even though it seems like it's the same information.

1145
01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.680
It seems like there's some teachers that are really good at teaching and there's

1146
01:12:03.681 --> 01:12:08.681
some teachers that have been taught how to teach and it comes across that way

1147
01:12:09.021 --> 01:12:10.730
and it's hard.
It's hard to soak it in.

1148
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:12.970
<v 1>Well,
it's also the personality of the people that are teaching you.</v>

1149
01:12:13.090 --> 01:12:15.880
And sometimes you don't want to learn from somebody.
You don't like them,

1150
01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:18.340
you don't like the way they're talking.
Or maybe they're arrogant.

1151
01:12:18.370 --> 01:12:22.420
And maybe that that arrogance comes off as like you want to prove them wrong.

1152
01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.260
And so just listening.
Yeah.

1153
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:25.723
<v 0>Yeah.
I get it.</v>

1154
01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:31.310
Well the last thing we should talk about is probably where we started this trip

1155
01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:36.140
grilling.
Cause you and I are both passionate about cooking food.
Yeah.

1156
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:41.510
We eat what we kill.
Right?
Yeah.
And you were,

1157
01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:46.350
you are on a different grill path complete weren't you?

1158
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.190
I mean I kept telling you like,
dude,

1159
01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.000
I don't know a lot about this trigger but man,

1160
01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:58.430
it's like changed my life.
Well I was doing things very hot.
Yup.
And uh,

1161
01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.180
<v 1>I was uh,</v>

1162
01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:04.180
I had a Yoder that has a direct heat element and the direct heat aspect of it

1163
01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:11.601
was a uws grilled greats they'd put down and he would turn up the flames very,

1164
01:13:12.091 --> 01:13:15.720
very,
very high.
And I would cook on these grill grades.

1165
01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:19.470
Did you put these grill marks on the uh,
on the meat?

1166
01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:24.840
It was drying out the meat though and until Chad a whiskey bent barbecue.
Yeah.

1167
01:13:24.841 --> 01:13:25.530
Chad war.

1168
01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:30.270
Chad Ward on the instrument Paolo until he explained it to me.

1169
01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:34.650
The idea of the reverse sear,
cooking things low and slow,

1170
01:13:34.651 --> 01:13:37.590
and then seeing them at the end.
I really didn't get it.

1171
01:13:37.591 --> 01:13:39.960
And then once I just started cooking like that,
I'm like,
oh,
okay.

1172
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:42.750
You mean I get mad when I go to a restaurant,

1173
01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:44.820
a good restaurant and that they cook the steak.

1174
01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.600
<v 0>Isn't that a bummer?
It's a bump.
Talked about that all the time,
dude.</v>

1175
01:13:48.601 --> 01:13:52.620
What do we cook night one?
When Sharon and I flew in,

1176
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:58.800
did we cook cowboys steaks?
Revise and revise and revise.
Yeah,

1177
01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:03.510
we ate those at the house.
You've got,
so you've got the new iron wood.
It's,

1178
01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:07.120
it's like,
it's not the highest end trigger.

1179
01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:09.570
It's the next one in line.
Yeah.

1180
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:12.460
For someone buying one in the store.

1181
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:17.350
<v 1>Dude,
well I had an iron wood before and timberline,
excuse me,</v>

1182
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:21.940
a timberline before and they wanted to give me the ironwood because it's the

1183
01:14:21.941 --> 01:14:25.410
newest version with the,
um,
the,
and they had to,

1184
01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:28.450
they hadn't had the two motor,
they didn't have the timberline,

1185
01:14:28.451 --> 01:14:33.220
the new timberline out yet.
But you know what,
man,
if you're on a budget,

1186
01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:38.020
I mean,
it's phenomenal.
I have no complaints.
I have the six 50,

1187
01:14:38.021 --> 01:14:40.510
I had the timberline 1300 before,

1188
01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:45.580
but this iron would six fifties amazing.
It's so good.
And I love the APP.

1189
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:49.600
One of the best things for me for triggers the APP and the fact that I can

1190
01:14:49.601 --> 01:14:51.640
adjust the temperature of the grill on my phone.

1191
01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.980
And then also I could find recipes.

1192
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:58.000
Like I cooked lobster tails the other day and I got the recipe directly from my

1193
01:14:58.001 --> 01:15:00.880
phone.
And uh,
I went to the grocery store,

1194
01:15:00.881 --> 01:15:04.200
I got the ingredients based on that and I,
I,

1195
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:09.280
I cooked it on,
on the trigger with Mike.
What did you tell me you cooked at?

1196
01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.550
I think you said you cooked something only to 25,

1197
01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:17.200
just so you could use a super smoke.
Well,
I've been doing that a lot with roasts.

1198
01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:21.160
Oh really?
Yeah,
I've been doing that a lot.
I really liked that super smoke,
man.

1199
01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:22.840
It just,
it does something to the,

1200
01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.540
I love that smoky flavor that you get everything.

1201
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:30.550
It's one of the best things about pellet grills and I think I've had a lot of

1202
01:15:30.551 --> 01:15:34.720
pellet grills,
you know,
uh,
the triggers the best.
It's the best.

1203
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:38.860
It's the best that maintaining temperature,
it gets to temperature better.

1204
01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:42.400
It's the easiest to work.
It does such stable too.

1205
01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:45.610
I've had some complicated ones where they,
it cooked good,

1206
01:15:45.611 --> 01:15:49.120
but it was like you had to like read the manual and figure out how to do things

1207
01:15:49.121 --> 01:15:52.470
and triggers a straightforward,
but the,

1208
01:15:53.050 --> 01:15:57.220
but pellet grills without a doubt are my favorite way to cook food because

1209
01:15:57.221 --> 01:16:01.630
you're just getting fire and wood.
There's no nonsense.
There's no charcoal.

1210
01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:06.370
Lighter fluid is no briquettes it's just wood and,

1211
01:16:06.810 --> 01:16:09.530
and fire.
It's appellate.
That's repetitive.
Yeah.

1212
01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:12.850
And then what they figured out how to do,
first of all,

1213
01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:17.290
it's so efficient.
The Traeger uses so little pellets.

1214
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.120
Like I fill that hopper once I go,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,
nine,

1215
01:16:22.121 --> 01:16:24.700
10 cooks was just,
I mean,
it's a foot,

1216
01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:30.220
a foot deep of pellets and it takes forever to run.
Run through that.

1217
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:33.040
We were eating those revise that night.
And we're like,
dude,

1218
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:36.480
this is as good as your editors know.
Like I haven't gone anywhere.

1219
01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:40.210
I would say I need to know how this guy is doing this because it's better than

1220
01:16:40.211 --> 01:16:41.500
what I'm making at home.
No,

1221
01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:46.540
they were definitely as good as anything I've ever got ever.

1222
01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:47.050
Yeah.

1223
01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:52.050
And it's so easy to use and to do it at two 25 and I love the fact that trigger

1224
01:16:52.211 --> 01:16:57.130
has that probe and you can,
you will eat it on your phone.
The APP.

1225
01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.500
Yeah.
Harry is,

1226
01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:03.550
has his first apartment right now and I don't,

1227
01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:08.350
and actually it's a summer.
He's got a,
he's a,
he's in a research project,

1228
01:17:08.351 --> 01:17:10.190
which is pretty,
but

1229
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:10.670
<v 0>uh,</v>

1230
01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:14.960
I don't think he realized that the school wasn't cooking food because he was in

1231
01:17:14.961 --> 01:17:19.961
his apartment one night and he sent a text to share in that said campus is

1232
01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:23.990
closed.
We can't get food there,
so we've got to do our own.
And he goes,

1233
01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:26.750
do you think dad could cook for us some nights?

1234
01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:32.090
And she's like,
you need to cook for him.
So I told them,
I said,

1235
01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:35.540
do you want me to do,
I forgot what I said.
We did a brisket,

1236
01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:41.150
said I'll cook a brisket for your guys.
Uh,
so I started it at night.

1237
01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:44.720
I literally woke up at three in the morning,

1238
01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:49.490
grab my phone next to my bed,
open it up,

1239
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:54.800
told me that the brisket was at like one 59 I got up,

1240
01:17:55.550 --> 01:18:00.080
went outside,
put the brisket in a big foil Pan,
wrapped it all in there,

1241
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:03.710
put in a little bit of juice,
sealed it all up,

1242
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:08.210
bumped the temp up to two 75 put it back in the grill,
closed it,

1243
01:18:08.211 --> 01:18:13.211
and just set the alarm for when the brisket hit two oh four like set the alarm

1244
01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:18.140
on the APP.
So the next morning at 9:00 AM being,

1245
01:18:18.141 --> 01:18:21.350
it goes off the briskets at two Oh four I took it out,

1246
01:18:21.351 --> 01:18:26.060
set it in a Yeti and just left it in there until the guys came home after their

1247
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:30.680
10 mile run for that day and just sliced it and it was ready to go.
Amazing.

1248
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:35.000
It was perfect.
Yeah,
it's the perfect combination of technology.
Yama.
Shit.

1249
01:18:35.001 --> 01:18:39.540
I ruined on a fricking propane web.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

1250
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.240
Or charcoal grill.
Yeah.

1251
01:18:41.241 --> 01:18:46.190
I had a Kamado one of those ceramic grills,
which is great.

1252
01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:50.540
It's great until you use a pellet grill.
Yeah.
And then,
you know,

1253
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:54.140
my wife was like,
get rid of this stupid thing.
Like you don't even use it.

1254
01:18:54.141 --> 01:18:55.790
I'm like,
but it looks cool.
Well,

1255
01:18:55.791 --> 01:19:00.791
it's like people that say you need to learn how to start a fire with two sticks.

1256
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:04.480
No.
Yeah,
I can do it.
But I also can buy a bic lighter,

1257
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:06.500
the gas station when I'm filling up my car.

1258
01:19:09.630 --> 01:19:14.480
So I really know.
I mean,
look,
it's a good survival skill.
Yeah.

1259
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:16.550
If you really do find yourself,

1260
01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:20.810
and I know some guys like to just bring like a Flint and some,

1261
01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:25.520
some,
uh,
I got it swaps there.
Some people,
Vaseline.

1262
01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:30.110
Schneider likes a shooter.
Traditional bow.
I don't get more power to them.

1263
01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.940
I don't get that.
But then other people say,

1264
01:19:31.941 --> 01:19:35.540
why shooting a bow and he can shoot a rifle,
right?
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1265
01:19:35.541 --> 01:19:40.010
We're in that category,
dammit.
Yeah.
Idiots.
Yeah.
Well,

1266
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:45.410
the argument for that is these damn deer,
there's an access tier.

1267
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:49.220
I met some hunters this morning.
Real nice guys.
And one of the guys,

1268
01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:54.410
he got his first big game animal today with a rifle.
Um,

1269
01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.260
so they were there for half an hour and they shot a deer.
Yep.

1270
01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:59.870
We hunted for five days for me.

1271
01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:05.440
I struck out five days in a row until finally I connected on the sixth day with

1272
01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:10.500
a Beautiful Bach.
But we'll dude,
we're on.
We're on.

1273
01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:15.030
We're flashing on one,
one bar.
A battery.
I'm afraid of it.

1274
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:19.820
Battery charger.
Wow.
Do you have a thing to plug in?

1275
01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.720
But do we have a plugin plugin close by us?

1276
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:27.420
It's gotta be some well outlet here and figure that part out.
Just bail on this.

1277
01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:32.100
Um,
I don't see anything clear.
Quitters religious bail.
Dammit.

1278
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:36.570
There's any power here.
Well,
see it,
dude,
this was awesome.
Hey my brother.
Listen,

1279
01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:40.260
it's always,
always a good time hanging with you.
I love hunting with you.

1280
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:44.820
Thanks for [inaudible] me about the archery.
Hey,
the next time we see each other.

1281
01:20:44.821 --> 01:20:48.640
Do you know who are going to be introducing the archery?
Bowhunting.
Who?

1282
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:56.490
Jocko Jocko is first bow hunt is going to be archery elk in Utah.
Oh,

1283
01:20:56.830 --> 01:21:00.450
do amazing.
We have an awesome camp.
This is,
that's going to be legit.

1284
01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:03.380
That's going to be legit.
Oh,
we'll be doing some podcasts from their phone.

1285
01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.930
Why don't you worry.
Yeah.

1286
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:08.280
I'm wondering if he'll still act as tough and cool as he,
yeah,

1287
01:21:08.281 --> 01:21:09.810
he think he's going to keep it together.

1288
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.800
I think you'll probably be pretty stoic and just listen.
Yeah guys.

1289
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:18.390
And he's a good learner.
People at that position.
Yeah.
They know how to learn.

1290
01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:21.600
He's a black belt in Jujitsu to you don't you don't get to be a black belt

1291
01:21:21.601 --> 01:21:25.260
unless you're a good learner.
He might have to beat it into them,

1292
01:21:25.261 --> 01:21:28.710
but I don't think so.
I don't think so.
I think he's just going to listen.

1293
01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:31.020
Would it be fun if he like missed his first one?

1294
01:21:31.021 --> 01:21:35.310
The elk just school disaster where he was like where he thought he could just

1295
01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:38.520
tough it out.
I would like to see him get a fucking 10 ring.

1296
01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:42.870
That's what I want to say.
Yeah.
I want to see it.
An l dropped away.

1297
01:21:42.871 --> 01:21:47.130
My elk dropped it to hone where the step four steps and just tipped over.

1298
01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.520
That's what we all do this for you say it?
I say it.
Cam says it.
Yeah.

1299
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.920
Uh,
I don't know.
I it was uh,
it was a super fun,

1300
01:21:55.921 --> 01:21:59.130
I'm so thankful that that day that you couldn't go,

1301
01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:04.440
that I asked cam to go with me because that was the first time that we've hunted

1302
01:22:04.441 --> 01:22:07.260
together.
And I would say,

1303
01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:12.360
I mean we were both at Uaa for 12 years together,

1304
01:22:12.450 --> 01:22:16.410
never had hunted together and it was,
it was pretty cool.

1305
01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:21.150
Once you get in a situation where,
especially a hunting situation where it's,

1306
01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.930
it's life or death,
I mean for what you're pursuing,

1307
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:29.610
the movements that you make and the choices you make,

1308
01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:33.750
they really define,
they do define you.

1309
01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.840
And whether people out there like me or don't like me or like cam or don't like

1310
01:22:40.081 --> 01:22:45.000
Cam.
All I can say is when we were in the moments that we are in,

1311
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:47.910
that's the ultimate litmus test for me.

1312
01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:52.500
Like a hunting situation for me is a litmus test for a person.
For you.

1313
01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:56.730
I think it's someone that like actually goes into a real fight right from a,

1314
01:22:56.850 --> 01:22:59.490
it's a lot of things.
It's comedy.
Oh yeah.

1315
01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:02.790
I've gotten to become friends with someone that I've watched him on stage.

1316
01:23:02.791 --> 01:23:06.070
I'm like,
oh,
I can't be friends with you anymore.
Really?
Yes.

1317
01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:10.030
Terrible.
But then are there times where you're like,
this guy,

1318
01:23:10.031 --> 01:23:14.050
I don't really know,
but then when you see him,
you're like,
you know what,

1319
01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:19.630
like 100% he got my respect.
Oh yeah.
And that's where it was at.
You know,

1320
01:23:19.631 --> 01:23:24.310
I can,
I,
I'm,
I'm truly,
I'm,

1321
01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:30.250
I'm truly respectful and I'm honest when I say that.

1322
01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.660
Yeah.
Like,
you know,

1323
01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:35.650
I wouldn't add cam on my podcast if I wouldn't have said that there was,

1324
01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:38.380
it was an eyeopening experience for me.
I had a very,

1325
01:23:38.381 --> 01:23:43.381
very good time with them and I think we both

1326
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:48.000
kind of found a different,
different appreciation for each other.

1327
01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:50.320
He's an awesome guy.
I love him to death,

1328
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:54.560
so it's so cool for me to see you guys become friends.
Yeah,

1329
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:56.560
it really is.
It's amazing.

1330
01:23:56.561 --> 01:24:01.561
I think comedy and bow hunting have one thing in common is that it's so

1331
01:24:01.931 --> 01:24:05.740
difficult to get to that elite level.
Then once you meet someone,

1332
01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:08.890
it's like how many of you you,
how many are there?

1333
01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:12.310
I mean how many like legit elite bow hunters are there?

1334
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:16.840
Are there even 500 on earth?
Oh my God,
it would be way smaller.

1335
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:20.830
Same with comedy,
smaller comedy.
I think it's probably the same thing.

1336
01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:24.250
I mean I know I would offend people or people will be like,
what?

1337
01:24:24.251 --> 01:24:25.330
I'm not on that list,

1338
01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:30.840
but I think it's really small and,

1339
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.530
and I'm talking on like not just a good level.

1340
01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:39.700
I'm talking on a level where if someone said,

1341
01:24:39.730 --> 01:24:42.220
listen dude,
you have,

1342
01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:45.850
you have like 10 cards to play in these cards.

1343
01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:51.070
Every card has to hit.
Who are the people on this card?

1344
01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:54.950
Yeah,
it's small man's Ma.

1345
01:24:56.260 --> 01:25:00.390
Is that fair to say?
Yes.
It's a hundred a hundred percent fair.
Yeah.

1346
01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:01.413
I think it's,

1347
01:25:01.450 --> 01:25:04.930
there's many things in life and there's a lot of different personalities within

1348
01:25:04.931 --> 01:25:07.840
those,
like people,
some people have different personalities,

1349
01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:11.680
some people get to the same place with a different path,

1350
01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:16.510
and sometimes it's abrasive.
Sometimes they're the fan favorite,

1351
01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:20.800
but in the end,
like the people that are within that realm,

1352
01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:24.520
it's like the big brother house.
There's people that people are rooting for,

1353
01:25:24.521 --> 01:25:27.100
and there's people that people,
you know,
or like,

1354
01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.210
I don't know how that guy got there.
It doesn't matter.
He's there.
Yeah.

1355
01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:36.760
It's an old expression game recognizes game.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just leave it at that.

1356
01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:41.210
My brother loves cheers brother.
All right,
everybody.
Bye everybody.
See you.
