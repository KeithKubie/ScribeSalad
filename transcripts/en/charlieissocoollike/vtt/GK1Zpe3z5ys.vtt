So, in an effort to add more fuel to the
Charlie-is-secretly-an-old-man fire,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.020
I've spent the last week here in the Canary Islands,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.930
specifically on Gran Canaria where the majority
of the other holiday goers here are

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.650
at least 30 years older than Emily and I.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.200
I didn't plan for it, but I have found myself
on a holiday for old people.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.290
These guys have absolutely no interest in going
"wild" on vacation, and,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.320
kind of unsurprisingly, I'm very happy to be a part
of this crowd.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.410
In fact, sometimes the people here actually seem
younger than we do. 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.470
On our first night here, everybody was dancing by
the pool to an Elvis impersonator

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.070
while we were off to bed at 10 PM complaining
about the noise.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.770
Almost all of my time here, so far, has been spent eating,
reading, and napping, and it has been great. 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.370
I would've spent more time exploring the island,
but honestly it seems as though this place has

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.260
been built specifically for eating, reading,
and napping.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.330
In spite of not doing much exploring here, though,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.710
I have found a number of other things to marvel at.
Mainly the breasts.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.860
There are a lot of breasts out in the open here.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.430
In fact, I'm pretty comfortable saying that the
amount of breasts,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.680
real-life breasts, I've seen in my lifetime has
quadrupled over the course of the last seven days. 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.800
Also, this is the point in the travel vlog where I
would show you a montage

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.920
of all of those breasts, but I'm not going to put you
through that, don't worry.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.980
I haven't been recording them. Obviously.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.410
Now while eating out all the time has obviously
been super lovely,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.850
one thing that hasn't been so nice is that,
for some reason, every single place to eat here

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.800
has a man outside it yelling at you,
telling you to come and eat at

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.920
his restaurant right this moment. I mean, I guess it's
a tactic that must have work at least

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.000
once on somebody because now everybody does it
just in case it works again. 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.030
You can never let them down right away either
because they always start with a question like,

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.710
"Hey. Do you like eating?"
I mean, yes, yes I do, but not with you.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.780
"Hey. Where are you from?"
I'll tell you where I'm not from. Hungry.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.220
I wish I'd said that to them, but I wasn't
brave enough.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.800
Now we have ended up doing one big activity while
here called AstroGC, which was awesome.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.610
A man came to pick us up in his van, took us to the top
of a mountain at nighttime, and we went stargazing.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.390
The high mountains and the lack of light pollution here
mean that Gran Canaria is just really good for stargazing,

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.470
and so, thanks to that, me and Emily can now say
that we have seen Jupiter

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.510
and its moons, the remnants of a supernova,
the Orion Nebula,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.460
two star clusters, and two galaxies.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.580
And not only was it an amazing experience that I
won't ever forget, but it also makes me quite happy

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.710
that I have seen something slightly more
spectacular than just a lot of breasts on this trip.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.810
Anyway, this is the bit where I'm meant to relate the
galaxies in the sky to

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.100
the breasts that I've seen on this trip and turn
it into some lovely

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.880
metaphor about loving yourself and you're a star,
but honestly I can't be bothered.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.730
I'm on holiday, so I'm not gonna. Adios, amigos.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.980
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike, 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
which makes you, like, cool.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.620
Thank you very much for watching. Here are my past
two videos. One's about sex, one's about Britain.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.220
If you can guess which one is which, you'll be in
with the chance of winning

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.050
the grand prize of watching one of these two videos.
Oooh. Ahhh.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.980
I'll leave the rest up to you. Goodbye.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.382
