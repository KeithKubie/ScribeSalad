00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.220
Would you fall on a grenade to save your friends?

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.150
How about two grenades?

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.800
Jack H. Lucas did and became the youngest
man to be awarded the U.S. Medal of Honor,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.800
the United States’ highest combat award.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.180
Born Jacklyn Harrell Lucas in Plymouth, NC
on February 14, 1928, Jacklyn was a natural

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.070
athlete who quickly rose to captain of the
football team at his high school, the Edwards

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.430
Military Institute.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.579
By the age of 14, Jack looked much older.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.120
Relatively tall for his age (5′ 8″) and
brawny at 180 pounds, Jack had no trouble

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.110
convincing the Marine Corps recruiters that
he was 17 when he enlisted in August of 1942.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.360
Notably, to enlist at age 17 (as opposed to
18), Jack needed a parent signature – so

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.150
he forged his mother’s.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.579
Jack did his basic training at Parris Island,
South Carolina and qualified as both a rifle

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.040
sharpshooter and a heavy machine gun crewman.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.650
In November 1943, he was assigned to the 6th
Base Depot of the V Amphibious Corps at Camp

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.640
Catlin in Oahu, Hawaii.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.870
There he achieved the rank of Private First
Class in January of 1944.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.310
However, after reviewing a letter Jack had
written to his girlfriend, military censors

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.680
realized he was only 15 years old.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.070
He was then removed from his combat unit,
but rather than sent home (something he argued

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.140
heavily against), he was assigned to truck
driving.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.050
Of course, being “in the rear with the gear”
was not Jack’s idea of military service.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.570
Angry, he got into so many fights that he
was ultimately court-martialed and spent 5

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.710
months breaking rocks and consuming mostly
bread and water.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.689
Released from the stockade by January 1945
and still determined to see combat, Jack walked

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.689
away from his post that month and stowed away
on the USS Deuel, a transport ship heading

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.780
toward fighting in the Pacific.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.409
Because he left his assignment, he was declared
a deserter and reduced in rank to Private.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.480
Now closer to the action, after hiding for
about a month, Jack finally turned himself

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.010
in on February 8, 1945, once again volunteering
to fight.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.360
On February 14, he turned 17.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.180
By February 20, he got his wish and was fighting
on the island of Iwa Jima.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.739
During the battle on February 20, 1945, Jack
and his comrades were advancing toward a Japanese

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.970
airstrip near Mount Suribachi.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.970
Taking cover in a trench under heavy fire,
Jack realized they were only feet away from

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.069
enemy soldiers in a neighboring trench.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.940
He managed to shoot two of the soldiers before
two live grenades landed in his trench.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.840
Thinking quickly, Jack threw himself on the
first grenade, shoving it into volcanic ash

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.080
and used his body and rifle to shield the
others with him from the pending blast.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.099
When another grenade appeared directly after
the first, he reached out and pulled it under

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.310
himself as well.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.040
His body took the brunt of the blasts and
the massive amount of shrapnel.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.540
His companions were all saved, but his injuries
were so serious they thought he had died.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.430
Only after a second company moved through
did anyone realize he was somehow still alive.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.910
Jack endured nearly two dozen surgeries and
extensive therapy and convalescence.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.510
Despite the surgeries, over 200 pieces of
shrapnel remained in his body for the rest

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.540
of his life.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.599
Shortly after his act of heroism, on February
26, 1945, the deserter classification was

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.349
removed and he was restored to the rank of
Private First Class.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.450
Ultimately all 17 of his military convictions
were also cleared.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.780
Nonetheless, he was unfit for duty and discharged
form the Marines on September 18, 1945.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.200
On October 5, 1945 President Harry S Truman
awarded Jack, and 13 other recipients at that

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.370
ceremony, the Medal of Honor.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.879
Notably, however, at 17 he was the youngest
there and the youngest to ever receive the

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.879
award.

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.760
For his bravery and service, Jack also received
the Presidential Unit Citation, American Campaign

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.140
Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the
World War II Victory Medal and a Purple Heart.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.140
So what happened after?

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.280
Besides graduating high school and earning
a business degree, at the age of 31, he enlisted

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.209
as a First Lieutenant in the 82nd Airborne
Division of the U.S. Army.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.840
During his first training jump, according
to his team leader, “Jack was the last one

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.100
out of the plane and the first one on the
ground.”

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.629
You see, neither of his parachutes opened.

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:22.340
Despite this and an approximately 3,500 foot
fall, he miraculously survived with only minor

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.340
injuries.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.180
Two weeks later, he was back jumping out of
planes.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.629
Once he returned to civilian life four years
later, he opened a chain of beef selling businesses

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:34.960
in Washington, D.C., married a few times (including
one wife who tried to have him killed), and

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.680
later, with the help of D.K.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.889
Drum, published an autobiography aptly titled,
Indestructible.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.979
Jack lived to the ripe old age of 80, dying
on June 5, 2008 from leukemia.

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:50.270
A more recent individual who jumped on a grenade
to save another soldier was Lance Corporal

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.020
William Kyle Carpenter.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.830
On November 21, 2010 while in Afghanistan,
a grenade was thrown into his sandbagged position.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.909
Rather than run, he used his own body to shield
the other soldier with him from the blast.

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.719
Like Jack Lucas, though severely injured,
Carpenter lived and was awarded the Medal

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:55.139
of Honor in June 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:51.930
of 2014.
