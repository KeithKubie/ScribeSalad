00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.604
- [Voiceover] Let's talk a little bit

00:00:01.604 --> 00:00:04.328
about the water cycle, which
we're all familiar with.

00:00:04.328 --> 00:00:06.096
In fact, we're all part
of the water cycle,

00:00:06.096 --> 00:00:07.509
every moment of our lives.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.312
We might not fully appreciate it.

00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:11.011
So let's just jump in the cycle.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.706
I'll start with evaporation.

00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:15.288
So we could start with the
surface of the ocean here,

00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:17.695
or this river, or this lake.

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:19.066
And at any given moment,

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:22.068
there's going to be water
evaporating off of that surface.

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:24.832
Water molecules that were
in their liquid state,

00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:28.644
liquid state, they just have
enough energy to bounce away

00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:30.811
and go into the gas state.

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:37.069
And water in a gaseous state
we call vapor, water vapor.

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:38.652
Water, water vapor.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:45.395
And so that water vapor,
it is going to rise,

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:49.685
likely with the air that has
been heated on the surface,

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:54.304
due to the sun, and there's
other more complex dynamics

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.548
at play, but as it rises, and
as the overall temperature

00:00:57.548 --> 00:01:01.715
cools, that water vapor will
condense into little droplets.

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.869
It'll condense around
little, tiny air particles,

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.953
little particles of dust
that you can't even see

00:01:06.953 --> 00:01:09.847
with your eye, and
that's what forms clouds.

00:01:09.847 --> 00:01:14.014
So this is little droplets,
so the water's actually back

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:19.323
to the liquid form, they're
not individual water molecules

00:01:19.323 --> 00:01:23.513
anymore, they're now able
to interact with each other,

00:01:23.513 --> 00:01:26.947
and they're condensing
around these little,

00:01:26.947 --> 00:01:31.114
microscopic dust particles
to form these water droplets.

00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:33.422
And if it's cold enough,
they might also form

00:01:33.422 --> 00:01:37.572
small ice crystals, and
that's what clouds are.

00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:40.556
And we see here, they're
talking about transportation,

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:42.450
you can have these clouds, we
obviously, if you look outside

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.841
and you see clouds, those
clouds are moving with the wind.

00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:48.447
And so they could be moving
all of those droplets

00:01:48.447 --> 00:01:51.025
with the overall wind.

00:01:51.025 --> 00:01:52.598
And when those droplets get heavy enough,

00:01:52.598 --> 00:01:55.964
they will precipitate,
they will precipitate down.

00:01:55.964 --> 00:01:58.888
Now they could precipitate
back into where we started,

00:01:58.888 --> 00:02:01.349
they could go back to the ocean there.

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.231
Or you could go onto a mountain here,

00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:07.707
and since if the air is cold enough,

00:02:07.707 --> 00:02:09.463
and if you have the right conditions,

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:10.968
that precipitation might be snow,

00:02:10.968 --> 00:02:14.589
and it might stay snow right over there.

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.513
Or ice, but then eventually
things might warm up,

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:20.879
or they might not warm up,
but if they do warm up,

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.623
well, then, they would melt,

00:02:22.623 --> 00:02:25.649
and there would be snow melt run-off.

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:26.837
And that's what you're seeing there.

00:02:26.837 --> 00:02:29.674
If that rain is falling in this area,

00:02:29.674 --> 00:02:33.990
so let's say it's not cold
enough for it to be snow,

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.249
we are talking about rain.

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.643
Well, most of that water
is actually going to

00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:41.060
percolate down into the soil.

00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:44.603
So most of it goes down.

00:02:44.603 --> 00:02:46.628
We look around us and we
see these rivers and lakes,

00:02:46.628 --> 00:02:48.263
and we say wow, there's
a lot of water there.

00:02:48.263 --> 00:02:50.368
But it turns out, there's
actually a lot more water

00:02:50.368 --> 00:02:53.286
inside the ground and
obviously, in the ocean.

00:02:53.286 --> 00:02:55.227
And we'll talk about that in a little bit.

00:02:55.227 --> 00:02:58.620
So you have all of this water that forms

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.620
in these underground aquafiers here.

00:03:02.604 --> 00:03:05.435
But some of it also ends up in these lakes

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.535
and these lakes are usually
in a situation where

00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:12.070
the ground is either already
saturated with water,

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.111
or there's the right types of rocks,

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.820
so it can contain the water up here,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.798
and similarly, rivers
are formed by runoff,

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:22.850
it's snow melt run-off
can famously form rivers.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.366
And in general, if you
see a creek or a river

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:28.328
near your house, especially
when it rains it fills up,

00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:31.003
that's a good indication
that the ground water's

00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:32.926
already saturated and so
things are running off

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:34.259
into that river.

00:03:35.475 --> 00:03:38.068
And so that in general is the water cycle.

00:03:38.068 --> 00:03:39.919
You have evaporation, it
condenses into clouds,

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.111
it eventually precipitates,
and it keeps going,

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:44.037
round and round and round.

00:03:44.037 --> 00:03:46.107
Now of course, there's
others actors at play.

00:03:46.107 --> 00:03:47.894
You have things like plants.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:51.690
Plants will take up water
from the upper soil,

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.037
as far as the plant's roots go.

00:03:54.037 --> 00:03:57.247
And it will use that water
to transport nutrients

00:03:57.247 --> 00:03:59.827
down from the soil up into the leaves.

00:03:59.827 --> 00:04:02.196
It also uses that water as part of

00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:03.759
the photosynthesis
process that we've studied

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.625
in many videos.

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:09.843
And a lot of that water
gets transpired out.

00:04:09.843 --> 00:04:12.861
So once again, this is
transpiration, essentially,

00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:15.503
evaporation out the leaves of the water.

00:04:15.503 --> 00:04:18.836
Over here you see this word sublimation.

00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:22.885
That's going straight from
the solid form of water, ice,

00:04:22.885 --> 00:04:27.097
into the gas form of
water, or water vapor.

00:04:27.097 --> 00:04:29.745
And this will happen in
situations where it's cold

00:04:29.745 --> 00:04:32.218
and it's very, very, very, very dry.

00:04:32.218 --> 00:04:35.501
And you have, in general, low pressure.

00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:38.649
So instead of going into the liquid state,

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:40.856
right then the water
molecules start just leaving

00:04:40.856 --> 00:04:42.106
as water vapor.

00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:46.149
And of course, I said, we're part of it.

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:47.297
Well, how are we part of it?

00:04:47.297 --> 00:04:49.760
We will drink some of this fresh water,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.108
our bodies are actually mostly water.

00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:54.632
The cells in our bodies are 70% water.

00:04:54.632 --> 00:04:58.540
Everything we study in biology,
water is a key environment

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.837
for all of these things to occur.

00:05:01.837 --> 00:05:03.587
And then we use that water,

00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:07.271
and then we will get that
water out of our body,

00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:11.749
and then it continues on as
part of this water cycle.

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:13.717
Now one thing that I
find really interesting,

00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:17.576
as an organism that is
dependent on fresh water,

00:05:17.576 --> 00:05:18.576
when people say fresh water,

00:05:18.576 --> 00:05:19.935
we're talking about water without salt,

00:05:19.935 --> 00:05:21.768
as opposed to salt water.

00:05:21.768 --> 00:05:24.532
So we really need the
fresh water in this lake,

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:27.490
or in this river, or we might dig wells,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.762
so that we can get the water
out of these aquafiers.

00:05:30.762 --> 00:05:33.448
It actually turns out that
very little of the overall

00:05:33.448 --> 00:05:36.281
water in the world is fresh water.

00:05:37.767 --> 00:05:41.140
And so let me show you
this chart over here.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.370
I always knew that, but
I didn't fully appreciate

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.583
how little was fresh water.

00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:47.987
So of all the water on our planet,

00:05:47.987 --> 00:05:52.740
97.5% is salt water, for the
most part, in our oceans.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.061
Only 2-1/2% is fresh water.

00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:58.822
And even of that 2-1/2% fresh water,

00:05:58.822 --> 00:06:01.428
very little of it is what
we traditionally associate

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:03.303
fresh water, the lakes and the rivers.

00:06:03.303 --> 00:06:05.150
When I think of fresh
water, I'm gonna say oh,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.749
let me go to a lake or a river,

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:08.633
that's stuff that we
could potentially drink.

00:06:08.633 --> 00:06:11.520
But most of it is actually in glaciers

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.827
and permanent snow cover.

00:06:13.827 --> 00:06:17.494
So it's ice, snow, that
is just not melting.

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:20.466
And it makes you think
about what would happen

00:06:20.466 --> 00:06:22.292
if this stuff were to melt.

00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:24.083
And then you also have ground water,

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:25.456
which we could have access to.

00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:28.967
That's why people dig wells,
so we're talking about,

00:06:28.967 --> 00:06:31.724
well, ground water includes soil moisture,

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.813
swamp water, and permafrost.

00:06:33.813 --> 00:06:37.637
Very little of the water is
actually in lakes and rivers,

00:06:37.637 --> 00:06:39.615
which I personally find fascinating.

00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:43.299
It wasn't obvious to me before
I, frankly, saw this chart.

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:45.178
Now another really interesting thing is,

00:06:45.178 --> 00:06:48.294
how long, on average,
water molecules might stay

00:06:48.294 --> 00:06:50.747
in different parts of this water cycle.

00:06:50.747 --> 00:06:53.891
Going back here, you can
imagine that a water molecule

00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:56.862
can stay for a very
long time in the ocean,

00:06:56.862 --> 00:06:58.967
especially, you know it's
going to be moving around,

00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:01.744
depending on ocean
currents and temperature

00:07:01.744 --> 00:07:03.205
and all of that, but you can imagine,

00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:05.500
it could stay in that
liquid form in that ocean

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.907
for a very long time.

00:07:06.907 --> 00:07:09.237
And maybe it spends a shorter
amount of time in a cloud.

00:07:09.237 --> 00:07:11.338
And people have actually studied this,

00:07:11.338 --> 00:07:12.631
which I find fascinating.

00:07:12.631 --> 00:07:14.643
I'd be curious to figure
out how they actually

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:16.252
got this data.

00:07:16.252 --> 00:07:20.601
But this is the average residence
time for water molecules.

00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:24.896
And you can see here that
water can stay in glaciers

00:07:24.896 --> 00:07:27.266
and permafrost for a very long time,

00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:29.649
we're talking it could
be up to 10,000 years,

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:31.002
and these are all rough numbers.

00:07:31.002 --> 00:07:33.560
It can stay as ground water
anywhere from two weeks,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.906
to 10,000 years, I guess,
depending on how isolated

00:07:35.906 --> 00:07:37.983
that ground water is.

00:07:37.983 --> 00:07:40.591
It could be in the oceans
and seas as salt water

00:07:40.591 --> 00:07:43.387
for 4,000 years, and we
can look at all of these,

00:07:43.387 --> 00:07:46.470
all the way, within living organisms,

00:07:47.374 --> 00:07:50.353
it'll stay about, on
average, a water molecule

00:07:50.353 --> 00:07:52.968
will last about a week in the atmosphere,

00:07:52.968 --> 00:07:55.860
so that's getting water
vapor, turning into a cloud,

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.169
precipitating down, on
average, one and a half weeks.

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:00.407
And once again, these are averages.

00:08:00.407 --> 00:08:01.946
It doesn't mean that every
water molecule will stay

00:08:01.946 --> 00:08:04.523
exactly one and half
weeks in the atmosphere,

00:08:04.523 --> 00:08:06.637
but it's a pretty interesting
thing to think about,

00:08:06.637 --> 00:08:08.578
and it gives you a
little bit more sense of,

00:08:08.578 --> 00:08:10.118
well, one, where all the water is,

00:08:10.118 --> 00:08:12.863
and how it all works together
with the water cycle.
