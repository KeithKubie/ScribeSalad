doing this but the reality is you know
 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.500
doing this but the reality is you know
it may have been the whole reason you

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510
it may have been the whole reason you

hand turn you know the other restaurant
 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.370
hand turn you know the other restaurant
is the left hand turn across traffic and

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380
is the left hand turn across traffic and
 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.260
is the left hand turn across traffic and
you know at that just you know for some

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270
you know at that just you know for some
 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.210
you know at that just you know for some
reason I don't I prefer to avoid that

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220
reason I don't I prefer to avoid that
 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.030
reason I don't I prefer to avoid that
and then once I did that right hand turn

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040
and then once I did that right hand turn
 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.530
and then once I did that right hand turn
two or three times then that right hand

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540
two or three times then that right hand
 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.620
two or three times then that right hand
turn became automatic so the idea that

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630
turn became automatic so the idea that
 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.300
turn became automatic so the idea that
