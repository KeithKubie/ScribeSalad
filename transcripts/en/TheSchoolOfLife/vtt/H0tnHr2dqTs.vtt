00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.700
Jacques Derrida was one of the most famous, controversial,

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.760
but also wise figures in recent French intellectual life.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.480
He invented a way of doing philosophy that he called

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.160
Deconstruction, which fundamentally altered our understanding of many academic fields,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.680
especially literary studies.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.000
Derrida was born in 1930 in El Biar, a suburb of Algiers, in what was then French colonial Algeria.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.440
His family were jews, his father a salesman for a local wine firm.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.760
He was initially slow at school and harbored dreams of becoming a professional soccer player.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.860
In 1942, under new laws enacted by the collaborationist French Vichy regime,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.520
Derrida, like all other Jewish children, was forcibly excluded from his Lycée

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.520
and spent a lot of his time at home with his mother.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.200
He suffered greatly from the anti-semitism of Algeria's majority Muslim population

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.040
and was deeply marked by the experience of having been in an inferior position

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.360
at the nexus of three different religions:

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.680
Judaism, Christianity and Islam, all of which claimed to speak the truth

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.880
none of which knew how to treat the others with particular respect.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.940
In 1949, just turned 19, Derrida traveled to Paris to take up a place at the prestigious École Normale Supérieure.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.080
He was a Brilliant student, but in an odd position.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.920
Highly privileged in terms of education,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.880
but utterly at the margins in Metropolitan France in his status as an Algerian jew.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.020
Though Derrida was not an autobiographical writer,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.260
It's hard not to read his work as a highly abstract response to his first-hand knowledge of bigotry

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.860
and exclusion.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.020
It was from the late 1960s onwards the Derrida began to develop the ideas that made his name.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.060
In time he became a celebrity intellectual around Europe and America.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.100
He was hugely glamorous. A good-looking man with great taste in raincoats and haircuts.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.140
He had a rich, diverse and complex love life.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.320
In 1980 he was arrested on a wholy full drug smuggling charge, but was supported by the French president and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.740
politicians from both left and right.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.560
He loved playing snooker and devoted most of his afternoons to the game,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.380
which he played with exemplary skill.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.560
He died in 2004 from pancreatic cancer at the age of 74

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.560
Derrida wrote 40 books, all of them abstruse and subtle.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.920
But his importance for us can be revealed by examining three initially odd sounding terms he often used:

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.120
Deconstruction, Aporia and Logocentrism.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.140
Behind the High-flown vocabulary, lie some crucially important ideas.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.360
Deconstruction is the word most commonly associated with Derrida.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.360
He used it to describe the way he went about thinking,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.660
though when other people started using this term he quite often felt

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.820
they'd misunderstood what he meant by it.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.280
Essencialy, Deconstruction means dismantling our excessive loyalty to any idea

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.080
and learning to see the aspects of the truth that might lie buried in its opposite.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.960
It was in 1967 that Derrida published his first major book: "Of Grammatology".

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.920
Its overt topic is admittedly rather strange, even tedious.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.660
Derrida was convinced that western philosophers since Socrates

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.240
had systematically privileged speech, which was seen as authentic communication,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.340
over writing, which was regarded as a mere transcript of what people might say,

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.619
a secondhand report lacking the interaction and truthfulness that comes with conversation.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.830
In itself this hardly feels like an urgent issue

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.109
But the drama of Derrida's work came from the bigger idea he developed from this claim.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.240
His overarching ambition was to advance a vast troubling proposition.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.580
But once we begin to examine it closely, almost all our thinking is riddled with a false,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.100
that is unjustified and unhelpful, privileging of one thing over another.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.070
Speech is privileged over writing,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.980
reason over passion,

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.480
men, at least for long periods, over women,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.200
words over pictures,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.200
sight over touch.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.620
Derrida score point was that this privileging involves a failure to see the merits and value

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.780
of the supposedly lesser part of the equation

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.120
Derrida was not so much making the nihilistic point that everything is worthless.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.120
He was stressing that the neglected

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.860
counterparts in some of our key oppositions are worthy of love and a attention.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.120
Over his 40 books, Derrida deconstructed a range of key binary terms.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.340
Reason vs passion, masculinity vs femininity, profit vs generosity, high culture vs low culture.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.640
His hope was that we could learn to live more ntelligently

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.680
with some of the conflicts that lay beneath these terms,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.540
that we could come to see that both sides were on to something,

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.860
that both were a bit wrong, that both needed each other, and that the tension between

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.060
would by necessity always prove irrevocable.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.580
It might look as if Derrida was always using Deconstruction to attack tradition

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.760
and the free market and to promote a left-wing egalitarian agenda,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.680
but it was a great deal more subtle than this.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.500
For example in his deconstruction of the idea of equality,

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.540
Derrida proposed that the assertion that equality is always better than inequality,

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.620
though this might be a modern liberal axiom, is, in fact,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.970
unstable and obscure, and he pointed out that some of the best human situations

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.749
we know are obviously not examples of equality in action.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.520
Derrida, a devoted professor and father,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.240
wrote beautifully and at length about the relationship between pupils and teachers

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.560
and children and parents.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.240
To deconstruct an idea is to show that it's confused and riddled with logical defects

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.660
and that we must keep its messiness constantly in mind.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.520
Derrida was criticizing our tendency to imagine that behind every problem

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.300
lies somewhere a good and neat solution.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.600
We offer him creatures destined to live our lives without clear answers,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.800
and that the craving for them is at the root of our troubles.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.920
He wanted to cure us of our love of crude simplicity

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.520
and to make us more comfortable with a permanently oscillating nature of wisdom.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.060
For instance, he argued that we might be rightly confused about the merits of Capitalism and Socialism,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.320
or the relationship between love and sex, but that we should never rush to conclusions around these topics

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.060
There are useful things to be said on both sides of these equations.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.140
To conclude that capitalism is either splendid or sinful, or that love and sex are either

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.120
very closely linked or have nothing much to do with one another

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.700
is to avoid grappling with a fraud and kaleidoscopic nature of reality.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.800
Being confused and uncertain around such concepts

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.980
Isn't a sign of weakness or stupidity. It is for Derrida the central mark of maturity.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.660
Derrida's tactic was to glamorize this condition and to give it a positive ring,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.440
which is why he brought back into use a beautiful Greek word:

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.180
Aporia, meaning impasse or puzzlement.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.240
He was proposing Aporia as a state we should feel proud to know and to visit on a regular basis.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.380
Confusion and doubt and not embarrassing dead ends in a Derridean world view.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.160
They're simply evidence of the adulthood of the mind.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.900
One of Derrida's chief targets of Criticism was a way of thinking that he called Logocentrism.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.800
By which he understood an over hasty, naive devotion to reason, logic and clear definition,

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.480
underpinned by a faith in language as the natural and best way to communicate.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.840
Derrida, who loved music and art, stressed that many of the most important things we feel

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.340
can never be neatly expressed in words spoken or written, as a logocentric tends to forget.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.300
An instance of logocentrism which particularly interested Derrida was the prestige of the idea of

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.959
IQ, which measures primarily a person's ability to solve logical puzzles,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.360
But which largely ignores many other qualities of mind,

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.480
for example, telling us very little about a person's capacity for friendship, for being a parent,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.380
ror having fun or managing their emotions

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.420
For Derrida certain people might not be so brilliant at completing geometrical sequences,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.820
but that would tell us very little about their skill at making a success of a marriage,

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.820
a business, a holiday or a party.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.760
All of whose importance Derrida understood well.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.460
As an esteemed professor who lectured in the world's best universities

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.360
Derrida, who was also a snooker and football loving Algerian jew,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.380
was casting doubts on the entire foundations of the modern intellectual worldview.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.700
Like many important thinkers,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.600
Derrida can be cherished as a corrective to certain excessive attitudes.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.980
In his case, an overzealous devotion to reason and clear-cut answers.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.580
Derrida didn't want to remove all hierarchies.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:51.360
he knew it was right that kindness should be privileged over cruelty, wit over dullness, generosity over meanness

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.780
But he also understood how off we unwittingly dismiss things people and ideas

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.940
when their opposites bask in what might be an arbitrary status.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.640
At its best, Derrida is a voice of modesty and patience

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.680
asking us to see what might be a value in those ideas

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.940
we too easily overlook and to get curious about why it might be nice to be always,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.720
even if only for a little while, on the other side of any debate.
