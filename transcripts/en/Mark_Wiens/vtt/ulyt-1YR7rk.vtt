00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.840
It's just after 5:30 am when I roll out of
bed and start walking around the streets of

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.840
Jaffna.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.340
Beach Road is quietly waking up, a lady is
sweeping on the side of the road, a few people

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.830
are washing their clothes, and motorcycles
randomly breeze past.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.140
The air is already warm and humidity is already
intense.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.220
Luckily not all of Jaffna is still quiet.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:41.340
I'm heading on over to grab some local style
breakfast and a few cups of tea.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:01:03.129
Ok, I'm about to chow down on some local breakfast.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:20.420
Paratha which is - oh the power has gown out
now, but anyways.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:39.990
A piece of warm paratha bread is like a roti,
and dip it into coconut sambal which is coconut

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.649
mixed with chil.

00:01:44.649 --> 00:02:02.049
Sorry, the power has gone out guys, but I'm
going to keep on munching!

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.869
Mmmm, so good, coconut with chili and lime.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.879
I've also got some curry sauce to dip it into.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:10.979
Ohh that's insane.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.549
Aww, dude that curry sauce is bomb.

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.750
Washing it down with tea, Wow!

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.319
After breakfast, life in Jaffna has begun.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.629
I might go check out this Fort right here.

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.209
Just a few years ago, Jaffna was a war zone.

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.849
As you can see there's all kinds of bombed
out structures and old homes.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:37.489
Now that the vegetation has grown up over
the ruins, this type of scenery is really

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.569
common here in Jaffna.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.189
Right now it's about 9 am, but the sun is
just absolutely blazing hot.

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:51.439
I can't even, you got to cover up your head
or you're just going to dehydrate within moments.

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.930
From the bombarded neighborhoods, it's just
a short 5 minute walk to the bustling center

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.970
of Jaffna town.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:06.060
Over here they are filling up buses.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:26.871
Filling them to capacity, stuffing people
in like sardines, but I'm going to choose

00:03:26.871 --> 00:03:27.871
the walking option right now, straight through
the center of town.

00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:38.189
Alright, I just picked up a snack, a mango,
chopped up like this.

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:43.069
Let me grab a chunk.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.069
It's sour!

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.569
It's real sour, ok that's a bit too sour for
me.

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.150
Nallur Kovil is the most famous Hindu temple
in Jaffna.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.440
Traditional ceremonies are held everyday.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:04.050
I arrived just in time for the 4 pm session.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.689
And to enter you have to take off your shirt,
so I'm going to quickly take off my shirt,

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.180
but unfortunately photography is strictly
prohibited inside, so you're not going to

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.563
see more of this temple, but I'm going to
go in and catch a ceremony.

00:04:18.563 --> 00:04:21.609
They have ceremonies throughout the day, I'm
at the 4 o'clock session.

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:36.370
So if you come to Jaffna, you got to check
out Nallur Kovil.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:48.260
I'm at a restaurant called Hotel Rolex, about
the smash down on some awesome looking food.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.510
I got a paratha, and this is actually a squid,
a local squid curry.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.510
Grab a piece of the squid.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.510
Get a bit of the rice and chilies and tomatoes.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.510
That squid curry is awesome!

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.510
I also got daal and rice, anyway, I'm going
to dig into the food, it's too good.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:17.560
One thing you'll need to get used to when
you come to Sri Lanka is the napkins, made

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.230
from yesterday's newspaper.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:45.340
Alright, see you guys later, I'm about to
devour this food.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.190
My last tasty treat of the day is something
that's very dear to Sri Lankan's.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:06:05.460
I'm about to taste for the first time, something
called wood apple juice, made from the bizarre

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.990
wood apple fruit.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.990
It's pretty brown looking.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.990
Take a tamarind fruit and cross it with blue
cheese, and you have wood apple juice.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.729
It's rather bizarre, but, it's pretty good.
