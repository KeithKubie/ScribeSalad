[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.670
- Thank you, Judith.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.370
I feel like you
could do the talk,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.394
as you know so well the work.

00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:15.060
Well, thank you.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.800
I'm very happy to be here
among such great Fellows.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.110
And thank you to the Radcliffe
Institute and the team.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.140
I would like also to thank
Meg Rotzel and [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.830
for the shows that
you will see later.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.300
And I would also like to thank
Julia Sweeney, my research

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.150
partner, who has done a
great job on that talk

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.550
but also researching for my
current project at Radcliffe.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.910
So I'm not a good
improviser, so I will read.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.050
I'm sorry for that.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.390
In the late '90s,
in the aftermath

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.060
of what was commonly called
the Civil War, which was not

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.260
just civil, but involved many
regional and international

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.400
actors, I had the urge
to express and reflect

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.960
on what had happened,
which led me

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.450
to make artworks
dealing primarily

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.470
with the question of
history and its narration.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.760
What image of these dramatic
events could I retain?

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.750
What image of them
would I recreate?

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.180
At that time, I
found myself caught

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.870
in the tension between the
temptation, even the necessity,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.950
of recounting our history and
the impossibility of fully

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.350
accessing it.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.260
Some facts, dramas
and experiences

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.090
are bound to never reach us and
will remain unspoken, buried.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.260
We can never certify
their existence,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.210
but only presume it with
traces in their absence.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.600
The act of witnessing, the
notion of responsibility,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.610
the mechanisms of
memory and the use

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.040
of the archive
and oral histories

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.560
were all crucial elements
to me from early on.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.990
It is within that
framework that I initiated

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.480
assembling a series
of testimonies

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.690
on the Lebanese wars for
my work, Objects of War,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.670
and later for Here
and Perhaps Elsewhere.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.280
In Objects of War, I asked
several, various people

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.850
actually, to choose an
ordinary and unusual object

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.150
from the time of the wars that
served as a starting point

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.060
for narrating a personal,
lived experience.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.240
While ostensibly creating a
collective memory of the wars,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.200
the testimonies gathered
in Objects of War exposed

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.420
the vanity of such a task.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.670
It became clear to
me that the only way

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.240
to approach with presenting
and narrating the Lebanese wars

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.030
at that moment was
to abandon the quest

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.170
for a complete narrative
or an absolute truth.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.500
I could only propose
attempts, fragments

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.580
of chronicles, relative
truth and first person

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.840
accounts of the extraordinary
and the banal, all of which

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.890
underline the gaps and losses
in history and in the process

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.110
of remembering.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.150
Objects of War is not a film.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.350
It is shown only
as an installation,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.710
including both the
video testimonies

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.330
and the original objects
that are displayed as relics,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.500
as you saw.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.720
As an ongoing project,
Objects of War

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.505
has evolved into
an open archive.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.110
And here you can see some of
the objects that are various.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.050
As of today there are
six Objects of War.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.060
They each run for approximately
an hour to an hour and a half.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.640
So of course, it's not
expected from the audience

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.770
to watch all of them when
you come to the show.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.590
But it gives you a sense
at once of the intimacy,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.680
but also of the very personal,
yet universal, accounts.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.540
I will show you a short excerpt.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:08:36.809
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:40.919
- There's no beginning nor end
and no hierarchy or chronology

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.310
among the various
stories recounted.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.820
In both Objects of War and
Here and Perhaps Elsewhere,

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.720
the fragments of history
are memory and oblivion

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.680
at the same time.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.140
Parts of an incomplete
whole, when assembled,

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.195
rearranged and reinterpreted,
they border fiction.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.420
Through Here and
Perhaps Elsewhere,

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.600
I tried to regain an image of
Beirut that had been fragmented

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.490
in my mind for so many years.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.960
Could the fragmentation
of the city only

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.860
be captured and expressed
by a fragmented image?

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.330
Knowing that thousands
disappeared during the Lebanese

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.190
wars-- actually we
say around 17,000--

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.470
and that in most cases,
the circumstances

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.840
of their disappearance
were never known,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.700
I traversed the
former green line,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.960
the area that divided
Beirut into East and West

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.120
and the common sight
of kidnappings,

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.120
and asked people I encountered
if they knew someone

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.360
who had been kidnapped here.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.450
I filmed for three weeks,
punctuating my journey

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.450
with stops at the sites
of former checkpoints,

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.450
relying on archival
photographs in an attempt

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.300
to pinpoint their location
within the present.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.520
And here you can see
an example of some

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.150
of these archival photographs.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.290
At times, people
faced difficulty

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.400
finding the exact location
of the checkpoints

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.740
within the cityscape.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.950
And when they did locate
them, often their location

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:22.100
did not match that of
the archival photograph.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.790
Using documentary tactics, Here
and Perhaps Elsewhere charts

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:30.380
a personal map of a real space
to comprehend its realities,

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.785
constructing your subjective
geography of space.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.620
In this work, the
place designated

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.860
as a green line or
dividing line is

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.930
central as an image and symbol.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.320
Yet it is never defined and
fails to be represented.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.480
One could say that,
although the dividing line

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:54.470
physically exists, it became
over time a mental line that

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.680
fragmented the city and
undermined coexistence

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.085
in many of its areas.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.590
In almost every
street I walked, it

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.440
seemed someone had
experienced a loss.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.100
And even though we were in
2002, the lingering presence

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.820
of the war appeared in most
of the stories recounted.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.420
I filmed without preparation,
recording the speech triggered

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.230
by my question, registering
the mechanisms of recollection,

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.460
reenactment and narration
in all their manifestations,

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.110
from what people
could or could not

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.850
remember to what they refused
to tell me or feared to say.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.940
And I must say here that had
I done this film today exactly

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.710
in the same manner, it would
not be the same speeches

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:41.620
that I would collect.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.920
Because the political
situation has changed.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.620
So in that sense,
it is also really

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.500
a diagnosis of the present.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.440
So the performance
of memory here

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.220
allowed me for the activation
of the past remnants

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.730
within the present.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.390
Its inclination toward
omission and distortion

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.330
and the discrepancy between
what is brought to memory

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.180
and what is documented
interrogates a very idea

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:07.860
of truth.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.350
I'll show you a
four minute excerpt.

accounts of personal experiences

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.480
in both Objects of War
and Here and Perhaps

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.140
Elsewhere could
act as documents,

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.140
the awareness of the participant
of being filmed, as well

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.220
as the subjectivity
of my selection

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.200
and assemblage of
testimonies leave

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.970
room for a fictional dimension.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.280
I also wrote a short
fiction by the same name

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.860
about the disappearance
of a man recounted

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.100
in five different versions
by each protagonist.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.230
It was published as
a booklet in 2003

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.320
and later as a website in 2009.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.590
I won't have time to talk about
it, so if you would like to,

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.180
you can visit this website.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.720
It's a website of
this short story.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.700
Disappearance as
well as the questions

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.620
of truth and
responsibility are also

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.320
at The Heart of the
Journey, a video essay

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.320
which uncovers a suppressed
narrative within my own family,

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.740
the story of my
grandmother Rose, located

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:06.700
at the intersection of the
personal and collective.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.480
The Journey
simultaneously reflects

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.180
on the conflicts in our
region and questions

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.000
my own identity and
political choices.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.680
Rose was born in Jerusalem
in 1910 and moved to Beirut

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.359
in the '30s.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.609
Her character allows
me to create a link

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:26.690
to the complex history,
and I must say unresolved,

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.320
between the Palestinian
and Lebanese people.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.860
In the film I look
back from what

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.860
seems like a hopeless present.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.560
And I'm sure you can identify
to that now, that has inherited

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.270
a tumultuous and
fragmented [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.660
to a moment in our past when
peace, unity, and modernity

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.420
seemed like a promise
for our region.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.420
Constructed like a spider
web, the scenes of The Journey

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.960
were not edited in
chronological time, but rather

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.730
according to elliptical
time and structure.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.440
The disparate fragments are
assembled retrospectively,

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.470
emphasizing the erratic
rhythm of memory

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.790
and the incapacity of
linear historical narration

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:13.240
to account for the intricacies
of human experience.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.850
I will show you an excerpt
which is a bit long,

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.870

- Another central
element in The Journey

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.460
is loss, visible in
my grandmother's loss

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.340
of first her
homeland, Palestine,

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.980
and then her son, my uncle,
kidnapped during the war

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.750
and never returned.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.600
To this day, we have no answers
regarding the true account

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.540
of his disappearance.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.610
In the process of grappling
with losses for which there

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:48.390
are no reparations or recovery,
this train of memories

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.000
made palpable through
the work's reliance

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.390
on the mnemonic aid of
archival photographs and eight

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.450
millimeter films as well
as through the fragility

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:00.420
of spoken testimonies.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.780
Especially evident in
language, slippage--

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:08.370
such as when my grandmother
slides in and out of awareness.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.430
Ultimately, the third loss
experience in The Journey

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.460
is Rose's own suggested
death as her illness grows

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.303
and she begins losing
track with reality.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.500
Until the 2006 war--

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.510
so I realized yesterday
that you may not

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:30.270
know what the 2006 war is.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:34.530
In July 2006, Hezbollah,
who is the Party of God,

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:39.150
kidnapped two Israeli soldier
at the border of South Lebanon.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:42.660
And following that,
Israel attacked Lebanon,

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.660
and there was a major
siege for one month.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.740
And maybe there were 1,500
deaths and one million

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:50.370
displaced.

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:54.450
And the entire southern suburb,
as well as the southern part

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:58.560
of the country was destroyed.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.950
So until the 2006
war, I had never

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.220
realized the work and the
immediacy of an event.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.870
And I actually thought
that The Journey

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:10.458
would be my last work dealing
with the issue of war.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.040
The series of eight prints
and the video Nights and Days

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.250
are part of a body of work
that relates to the 2006 war

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.040
in Lebanon, which raised
the following questions.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.420
How are we to produce images of
artistic value in times of war,

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.360
in its immediacy,
versus producing them

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.420
with a distance on that event?

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.520
Can we testify while
still remaining

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.290
at a critical distance?

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.540
Nights and Days
question the relation

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.090
between the time of the
occurrence of an event

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:46.710
and the production of
documents on that event.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.620
I was unable to produce
anything during the 2006 war.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:55.690
But after 10 days, I started
taking notes, daily notes.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:27:00.430
I wondered, if I document my
daily life during that period,

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:03.820
will I deprive myself from
the capacity and the necessity

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.950
to forget?

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.400
I considered these collected
elements as a trace

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.780
to be later reintroduced
in new narratives.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.060
Only a few months
after did I feel

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.110
capable of using these notes
to construct a narrative that

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.900
conveys at once a
sense of urgency

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.920
and my incapacity of
representing this war.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.400
The photographs-- so there
are eight photographs--

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.030
and the video are based on the
film and written notes made

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.590
that summer.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:39.070
They interrogate the tension
between the desire to witness

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:42.550
and the desire to open a breach
in the capacity of witnessing,

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.430
to undermine it or
accept its failure.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.780
The first part of the video
resembles a diary of war,

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.180
yet is not.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.460
It alternates day
shots with night shots,

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.140
with my own voiceover
expressing the waiting,

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.100
the interrogations, and
the fears experienced

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.915
in such unusual time.

00:28:02.915 --> 00:28:04.940
Now I will show you
an excerpt of one

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.305
minute of the first part.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:18.620
- I cannot remember what I
was doing before it all began.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.056
I do not fear anymore.

00:28:20.056 --> 00:28:21.561
I wait.

00:28:21.561 --> 00:28:25.730
I recall images of those
torn, battered figures.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.050
I insert my face, my
body in their place.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.950
Am I wounded or dead?

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.740
No, wounded.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.310
I scream.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:37.730
I do not want to have
both my legs amputated.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.080
I howl.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.430
I cry.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:41.990
Nothing can be done.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:43.970
They must amputate.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:45.800
He had no face left to cry.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.900
The bomb beheaded him.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.880
I insert my body in his place.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.560
I die.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.310
And then the explosion--

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.540
I only faint in this version.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.400
I do not die.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.070
I recall the bodies,
the fragments

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.190
of bodies strewn around me.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.050
I cannot feel anymore.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:08.120
The pain is pure.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.080
There must be pieces of my body
missing, pieces of my being

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.640
surely.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.510
I do not recognize anyone.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.290
Later--

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:22.550
- So the bomb is real, but
my narration is fictive.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:26.240
Obviously it's a speculation.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.450
It's an imagined narrative.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.190
The second part
of Nights and Days

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:37.370
is a journey to South Lebanon,
which had just been devastated

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.110
during that war.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:43.120
It alternates peaceful landscape
with ruins and destruction

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.500
with only music for
sound, as in my opinion

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.610
no words could express
this devastation.

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:52.010
So in the second part,
my voice withdraws,

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:53.700
replaced by a drone--

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.360
a sound piece composed by
Charbel Haber, with whom

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.340
I collaborate regularly--

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.950
based on the actual recording
of the Israeli drone.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.150
As some may know, a drone
is not just a guided plane.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:07.460
But it's also a music genre.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.710
It starts from a
single note and extends

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.540
to become a musical piece.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.018
And I'll show you--

00:30:14.018 --> 00:30:19.496
um, a very short--

00:30:19.496 --> 00:30:20.990
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:47.642 --> 00:31:50.820
[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.440
- The experience of
living in Beirut today,

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.480
together with my desire to
explore new modes of narration,

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.030
has consequently led to
a shift in my approach

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:05.120
to image, speech and more
generally, to representation.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.250
I continue to reflect
on Beirut's history

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.370
and its present, moving
away from an engagement

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:13.520
with direct speech and
the use of personal memory

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.220
to a more distant [INAUDIBLE]
mode of associating

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:20.330
various elements and traces
through space and time.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:22.550
Evoking the idea
of a palimpsest,

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:25.430
my recent work Beirut,
Autopsy of a City

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:29.270
and my ongoing project
Under-Writing Beirut

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:32.210
shed light on layers
of temporal deposits

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:35.330
that are enmeshed in
an open-ended process

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:41.030
of absorption, erasier
and reconfiguration.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:44.510
I woke up one day thinking that
the city I've been living in

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.250
could disappear.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.320
That disappearance
is not exclusively

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.850
a historical process
or an extinct one.

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:55.120
This anxiety led me to create
Beirut, Autopsy of a City.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.845
So it's quite an
irrational project.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.640
The first chapter that you see
here, a history of Beirut's

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.760
possible disappearance,
juxtaposes and overlaps

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.540
collected elements
from past epochs

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.870
to re-examine notions
of chronology.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.420
It retells the stories of
the conquests, defeats,

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:21.940
and natural disasters that
shaped and disfigured Beirut.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.640
The viewer wanders amid
intertemporally connected

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.230
fragments that become
fictionalized chronicle.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:33.870
So I used videos, text and
images from various sources.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:44.330
These are examples of
the images contained

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:45.260
in that first chapter.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.270
The second chapter,
"Beirut, 1,001 Views",

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.310
is a projection of
a panoramic view

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:01.670
of the city that is an
amalgam of photographs

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.470
taken at different
time in its history.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:13.810
In a single scene, a ship
from the 19th century

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:17.080
floats in a photograph
of the sea from the '50s,

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.960
under a menacing
skyline from the '80s.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:25.870
The resulting image is neither
past one nor a present one,

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:30.190
but effective representation
where some element does appear.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.650
Within it, well other--

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.480
and here you cannot see, because
it's a 16 minute animation

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.230
which is deliberately naive.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.374
But you will see elements
that appear and disappear

00:34:41.374 --> 00:34:42.540
throughout those 16 minutes.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.500
This third chapter,
"Beirut, 2058",

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.489
displaces the anxiety from
the past and its remnants

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:59.030
and project them onto a
speculative future, apocalyptic

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.110
realm.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.120
Where the city has
vanished, leaving us

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.530
with one peaceful image of a
seashore under its quiet sky.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.240
And this text is
the introduction

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.040
to that third chapter
is written by a narrator

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.110
at the first person.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.320
We don't know if
this catastrophe

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.670
was a natural disaster
or caused by war.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.608
And this is how it's
displayed [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:24.608 --> 00:35:25.544

[WATER RUSHING]

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.410
- While Beirut, Autopsy of
a City was about a specific

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:36.700
moment that endangered the life
of Beirut from 1200 BC until

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:41.620
2058 AD, Under-Writing
Beirut looks at historically

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.840
and personally significant
locations within

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.270
Beirut's present, investigating
their sociological,

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:51.310
political and economic history.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:54.970
How can narratives emerge
from or be triggered by places

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.040
rather than represent them?

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.430
So here for me is quite an
important shift in my practice

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.390
and on the notion
of representation.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.240
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.930
The first chapter is "Mathaf",
the Arabic word for museum.

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:13.260
And the name of the area
where I live in Beirut.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.010
Home to the National Museum
of Beirut opened in '42,

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:22.020
the museum is located along what
was once a green line, which

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.390
divided east and west Beirut.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:28.470
Once a site meant to
represent national union,

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:30.390
the museum in this
area became a symbol

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:32.490
of the country's
division and the backdrop

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.675
for sectarian violence.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.360
During the war and
despite preservation

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.430
efforts made by the
museum conservator

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:50.570
to protect the collection by
building walls and concealing

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:53.420
objects with concrete, as you
can see in that photograph,

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.450
these are sarcophagi that
are covered with concrete

00:36:56.450 --> 00:37:03.040
to be protected from potential
looting or from militiamen.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.760
The museum's building
was destroyed

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.010
and part of it's small
yet impressive collection

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:11.150
was severely damaged,
looted or lost.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.220
Under-Writing Beirut--
Mathaf responds

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.830
both to the impossibility
I faced while attempting

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.980
to access artifacts from
the museum's storage

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.340
as well as its archives
and to the only objects

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.610
made available.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.490
So this is a view of
the entire installation.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.740
So the only object that
were made available to me

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.450
were this beautiful,
yet now damaged,

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:40.570
good shepherd mosaic and a
photograph documenting it

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:45.160
from the time of the wars when
a sniper punctured a hole in it

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.309
to have a strategic view onto
the immediate surroundings.

00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:51.100
So the immediate
surroundings, like I said,

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:55.830
is a passage checkpoint
between east and west.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.930
And you can see today, as it
was filled from the outside,

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.365
but the hole was kept
intact from the inside.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.480
Object of War is a
negative of the sniper hole

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.030
cast as a concrete sculpture.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:18.300
It's initial incentive
rests on the practice

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:23.490
of the imprint as a trace of
contact with a body or void.

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:28.680
Yet it is a free reformulation
rather than an exact replica.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.510
And here you can
see the sketch--

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:33.780
the document with the
sniper hole-- my sketches

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:39.390
that I used to do
a 3D image in order

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:41.580
to produce a cast,
and a photograph

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.260
that I've taken in present time.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.030
And this is the
actual sculpture.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:53.840
Object from The National
Museum of Beirut--

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.260
this piece.

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.010
Objects from The
National Museum of Beirut

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:00.560
is inspired by inaccessibility.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.690
And in particular, by
the inaccessibility

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:04.270
of the museum storage.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.410
It dwells, by default,
on the only part

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.480
of the collection
that is visible,

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:12.440
the entirety of the display
on December 15, 2012.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.530
By reproducing every captions
identifying the objects

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:19.100
on view, the work ironically
and vainly attempts

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.730
to represent the museum's
holdings in one image,

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:25.430
uncovering the politics
of historiography

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.740
and questioning the
museum as a foundation

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.240
for national identity.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.780
The closed leather
book entitled,

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.600
Object Missing from The
National Museum of Beirut

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.360
relates to the stories heard
and unheard about the museum's

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.880
disappeared objects.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.160
It emphasized the secrecy
surrounding their disappearance

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:48.600
and the inaccessibility
of pertinent information.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.780
It triggers our imagination
in suggesting an archive that

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.030
may or may not exist.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.220
And here you have
pinhole cameras

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.030
made out from my home
towards the museum.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:08.480
And they look at
that place, which

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.700
for me has an unresolved
past, I would say.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.410
Under-Writing Beirut-- Nahr,
the Arabic word for river,

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.410
is the second chapter
investigating the urban areas

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:24.020
adjacent to Beirut
River, particularly

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:27.960
the area named Jisr El Wati,
where I co-founded Beirut Art

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.120
Center in 2009.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.690
The area, a historically
derelict piece of land and one

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:37.410
of the few remaining unexploited
space of the capitol,

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:39.300
has witnessed rapid
transformation

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.150
into a place of interest
for art practitioners,

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:47.730
and soon a high rise
residential development.

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:50.310
The river, which defines
the eastern edge of Beirut,

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:53.090
is a dry dumping ground
most of the year.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:56.040
A diverse migrant
population has historically

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.640
settled along its
banks since 1915.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.970
With the continual expansion of
the city's influx of refugees

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.220
and migrants, and
the ambitious plans

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:07.440
to rehabilitate the
river, the future

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.600
of the river and its
communities is unknown.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.640
The river in this project
acts as a suspended space,

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.500
allowing me to explore notions
of borders and landscape

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:22.910
and to reflect on migration
and gentrification.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:25.530
The drawings are based on
various maps of Beirut,

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.630
and you saw one of them earlier.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.270
But they depart from tracing
the topography of the river

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:31.920
with graphite pencil.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.770
And using wax, pastels
and dry pigments,

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:38.370
they evolve into more
organic abstract shapes,

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:41.910
reminiscent of cells,
flowers and body organs.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:50.730
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.220
[ENGINE HUM]

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:56.420
The video of the river combines
one single sequence shot

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:58.660
inside the dry river
with a voice over,

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.297
a poetic account on
exile and displacement.

00:42:01.297 --> 00:42:01.880
[END PLAYBACK]

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:06.932
The three screen
video instillation

00:42:06.932 --> 00:42:11.010
of After the River,
opening this afternoon,

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:12.600
shows the river
and its surrounding

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.370
from various angles
in an attempt

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.920
to create a multilayered
sensorial geography

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.580
of the space.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:25.420
And this is a view of
After the River in Cardiff,

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.680
where it premiered.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.940
The third chapter, which
I'm currently researching

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.870
at the Radcliffe Institute, is
entitled Under-Writing Beirut--

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:37.620
Ouzai.

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:42.750
The name Ouzai comes from the
name of a well-regarded Sunni

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:46.620
imam and prolific lawmaker,
Abdirahman Ouzai, I who

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.320
lived in the eighth century.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.750
Born in Damascus and
later settling in Beirut,

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:55.570
the imam was renowned
for his tolerance.

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:59.580
He argued over 70,000 cases and
founded the main school of law

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:03.210
practiced in Syria and
elsewhere for centuries.

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:08.130
He was buried near the seaside
south of the city in a shrine.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.080
The whole area around
his shrine became

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.960
known as the Plains of Ouzai.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.500
Today Ouzai would be identified
as part of the Southern suburbs

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.690
of Beirut, which
are often referred

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:24.480
to monolithically as Dahieh,
which means suburb in Arabic.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.670
Until the '50s,
Ouzai was no more

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.070
than a plain of sand dunes.

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:31.680
Today it is a complicated,
densely populated

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.310
urban landscape, full of mostly
informal constructions made

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:38.590
by various waves of
rural Lebanese migrants,

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:40.470
mostly Shiite and
other displaced

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:44.080
people who settled and found
refuge in the area in the '70s

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:44.580
and '80s.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.620
The area has experienced
countless overlapping claims

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.620
and struggles for
land ownership.

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.850
Somehow through it
all, Ouzai seems

00:43:54.850 --> 00:43:58.540
to resist definition,
existing inside the loopholes

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.860
and edges of legality.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.650
So I came to be interested in
Ouzais through my feature film,

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:07.150
And the Living is
Easy, because one

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:11.560
of the character whom
I met at [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.880
was living in Ouzai.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:20.960
And this is where I first
started filming there in 2011.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.670
At the time of the
first settlers,

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:26.080
the land was known as musha, or
state-owned land property held

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.600
by municipalities or
large group of co-owners,

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.320
which all inhabitants of the
area had the right to use.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.940
Despite this, a few families
made claims to the land in '55.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:42.500
Their conflict culminated in
a formal trial, [INAUDIBLE],

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:46.010
which means the trials of
the dunes or of the sands,

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:49.130
where it was ruled that
the land would be private.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:52.640
Even then, people moved in and
constructed homes informally

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.460
despite the ruling, and
sometimes in reaction

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.990
to it, against the government.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.630
Furthermore,
properties were often

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.490
co-owned by so
many people that it

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.280
was impossible to regulate
informal settlement

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.290
on private land.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.900
Nearby, beach resorts were
being built along the shore,

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.210
reaching the peak vacation
traffic in the '60s.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.810
Ouzai, amidst legal
confusion and just north

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:19.110
of the airport built in
'54, remained less desirable

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:22.410
and less conventionally
buildable.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.600
Ouzai's density
increased in 48 when

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.670
Palestinians, displaced
after the creation

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:29.970
of the state of Israel,
took refuge across Lebanon.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:33.660
In the '70s, faced with
Israeli attacks and occupation,

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.690
residents of South Lebanon,
mostly Shia Muslim,

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:41.400
fled to Beirut, many settling
in the Eastern suburbs.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.760
However, civil massacres
between Christian and Muslim

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.310
would displace those
Shiite migrants again,

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:50.460
causing them to resettle
in Southern Western suburbs

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.630
like Ouzai.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:55.590
And amorphous in
structure and often

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:57.720
labeled as chaotic,
the neighborhood's

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.420
visual appearance has
become intertwined

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.840
with a stereotypical and
stigmatized identity,

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.270
the poor rural Shiite.

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.120
This image has been fought
over, suppressed, claimed

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:12.930
and reclaimed,
redefined, and co-opted

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.060
by sectarian interests.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:18.540
Political parties, mainly
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:23.310
have used the narrative of
the historical oppression

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:26.250
of Shiites by the state,
by the Lebanese state,

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.490
to gather support and build
up a strong territorial base

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.010
in Ouzai.

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:33.720
Under-Writing
Beirut-- Ouzai had not

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.920
yet taken any specific
artistic form, deliberately.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.830
But research so far
gathers maps, plans, images

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:44.020
and recorded personal
stories and uncovers

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.340
seams of social stigmatization,
sectarian conflict,

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.970
informality, urban planning,
superpositions of rights,

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:53.700
and legal exception.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.160
This third chapter might
be the most challenging one

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.140
because the history
is intensely charged

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:01.200
with sociopolitical
complications and tensions

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.800
at the heart of the
situation of Lebanon.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.860
Indeed, when researching
Ouzai's history,

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:10.020
one sees its uniqueness.

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.920
Yet many parallels with the
country as a whole can be made.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.890
And the feeling of being
in a dead end situation

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:18.396
with no solutions prevails.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:26.180
So I would like to thank you
and invite you to the opening.

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.400
There will be no
Q&amp;A because of time.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.600
But feel free to ask me any
question during the reception

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.100
opening.

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:32.725
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:34.420
Thank you very much.
