00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.604
This was the logic
of a 20-year-old boy

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:07.339
who didn't know women at all.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:08.707
If you like a girl

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:10.042
and she doesn't
like you back enough,

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.544
the worst thing you could do
is be like,

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.579
"Oh, you don't understand.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.748
I'm never leaving."

from his own podcast
called "Julian Loves Music."

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:08.601
Please give it up for Mr. Julian
McCullough, everybody.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:12.171
[cheers and applause]

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:16.141
- All right, so I grew up
in a musical family.

00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:17.577
We care too much about music,

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:20.312
and it hurt me real bad.

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:23.583
I'm actually named after
Julian "Cannonball" Adderley.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.853
That's Miles Davis'
saxophone player,

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:29.922
which is a lot of pressure
to put on a tiny white baby.

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:31.591
[laughter]

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:34.760
But my dad loves jazz, and not
even the jazz you don't like.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.462
He likes way worse jazz.

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:41.500
My dad likes avant-garde jazz,
which is the kind that's like...

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.803
[squawking]

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:46.973
And the drummer's playing a
different song.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:50.976
[laughter]

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:53.178
So I've always cared
too much about music.

00:01:53.178 --> 00:01:54.180
I get to college.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.348
I make the biggest mistake

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:57.016
you could possibly make
in college

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.617
besides go to Rutgers.

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:02.655
I fell batshit, head over heels,

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:06.359
crazy in love with the most
maladjusted, toxic girl

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.127
I could possibly find,

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.830
but when you're 20, you're like,
"They're the hottest."

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.866
So there were red flags
everywhere.

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:16.669
She walked into class
four days late.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.038
That was the first time
I ever saw her,

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:22.975
four days late,
and half an hour late that day,

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:24.977
she walks in, head to toe
all black.

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:28.147
Black hair, covered in tattoos,
sunglasses.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:32.417
Sits down in the front row,
loud and pissed off, like--

00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:33.853
like she was trying to sleep,

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:38.157
and we built
a classroom around her.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.659
She never took
her sunglasses off

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.161
the whole time
at 10:00 a.m.,

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.196
so you're either drunk
or an asshole.

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.831
Either way, I was like,
"I'm Julian.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:47.266
What's your name?"

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:50.369
And...

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:51.604
So I ask her out,

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:54.339
and she says no
the first time.

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:56.242
I ask her out nine more times.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.777
This is when I was young.

00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:59.512
I was hungry.
I was persistent.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.080
I'm not like that
at all anymore.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.282
Now I'm like a cat
on a windowsill with women.

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:05.017
You know what I mean?
Where I'm like, "Meow,"

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:06.953
and they're like, "No,"
and I'm like...

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.358
I have the sun.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:16.895
So...

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:19.031
she finally agrees
to go out with me,

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.533
you know what I mean?
And it's amazing.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.268
It works.
We start dating.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:24.036
We're boyfriend and girlfriend.
I can't believe it.

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:26.305
I've never had a real girlfriend
in college yet.

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:28.708
And she's dangerous and out of
my league.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.143
I'm, like, it's amazing.

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.811
The problem is,
it was never even.

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:35.648
I was obsessed with this girl,

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:37.716
and she was, like,
kind of on board

00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:39.752
that she had a boyfriend
from English class.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:43.990
Like, that was
the two levels we were at.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.724
I don't know if you've ever
been in a relationship

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:47.560
that uneven before,
but if you haven't,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.063
I highly recommend it,
because if you're confident,

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.498
it'll fix it.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:55.468
So...

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:57.603
we're going out, but I'm
miserable the whole time.

00:03:57.603 --> 00:03:59.905
I'm basically chasing my own
girlfriend

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.607
in this relationship,

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:03.675
and it wasn't
completely one-sided.

00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:05.911
You know, we did have
a song together.

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:07.646
She didn't know
that we had a song together,

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:09.849
but I picked a song
for both of us

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.617
that I would listen to
alone in the dark

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:15.087
when she wouldn't call,
and it was called

00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:17.089
"Lover, You Should've Come Over"
by Jeff Buckley.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.625
It's a very intense love song
from the '90s.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.127
Yeah, he drowned.

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:26.665
Anyway, I'm laying there
in the dark one night

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:28.667
in my room alone,
listening to the song,

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:31.037
and I get an epiphany
from the lyrics

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:33.439
about how to handle
my situation.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.941
One of the lyrics is,

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:38.477
"She's a tear that hangs
inside my soul forever,"

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:40.813
and I was like, "Yup."

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:44.984
But it called her a tear,
and that's when I was like,

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.619
"Oh, my God.
She's had a sad life."

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.953
You know what I mean?

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:49.721
Like, her dad ran out
on the family.

00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.323
Her mom was addicted to pills.

00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:53.058
Her ex-boyfriend
sold all her stuff for drugs

00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:54.993
one time when she came home.

00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:57.130
Everybody that's ever said
"I love you" to this girl

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.665
has also completely
screwed her over.

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:02.068
So she thinks because I say I
love you,

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.969
I'm gonna screw her over.

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.905
I need to prove to her
that I'm never gonna leave,

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:08.841
and then she'll love me back.

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.709
This was the logic
of a 20-year-old boy

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:15.180
who didn't know women at all,
because if you like a girl

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.815
and she doesn't
like you back enough,

00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:18.651
the worst thing you could do
is be like,

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:19.719
"Oh, you don't understand.

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.721
I'm never leaving."

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:23.222
[laughter]

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.990
What I should've done
is been like,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.392
"Let's go to lunch,"
and then just left her

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:28.260
in a field somewhere,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.928
and if she ever made it
back to town,

00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:31.330
she'd be like,
"You need a blow job.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.766
You're mysterious."

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.836
So...I didn't know that at the
time, you know.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:41.607
I was, like, 25 when I found
that out.

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:44.443
So...
so I get an epiphany in bed,

00:05:44.443 --> 00:05:46.045
and I get out of bed that night,
and I'm like,

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:47.446
"I know what I'm gonna do."

00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:50.015
I walk a block down
to the tattoo parlor

00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:52.017
that's close
to my apartment, right?

00:05:52.017 --> 00:05:54.019
You don't know
what's gonna happen.

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:57.290
And...

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.024
I walk in, and I go,

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:03.362
"I would like
one tattoo, please."

00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:04.863
And the guy was like,
"First time?"

00:06:04.863 --> 00:06:08.533
And I was like,
"You don't know my life."

00:06:08.533 --> 00:06:10.103
He goes, "What are we doing?"

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:12.805
I go, "All right,
I'm in love with my girlfriend.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:15.107
"She's kind of on board.
We need to fix it.

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:17.543
"We have a song together
that she doesn't know about

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:21.480
"where he says she's a tear that
hangs inside my soul forever.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.650
"She has a butterfly tattoo
on her bicep,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.720
"which is really cool.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.924
"I need that butterfly tattoo

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:34.961
on my stomach,
where our souls are?"

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:40.732
"With tears above it."

00:06:40.732 --> 00:06:43.335
And he goes--
wait, what did he say?

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:45.437
He goes--oh.

00:06:45.437 --> 00:06:46.906
"No."

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:50.009
[laughter]

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:56.815
"No way, dude.
I'm not giving you that tattoo."

00:06:56.815 --> 00:06:58.317
And I was--I couldn't believe
it.

00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:00.085
I was like, "What are you talk--
this is a tattoo store.

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:01.787
I give you money.
You give me a tattoo."

00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:03.755
He goes, "That's not how it
works.

00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:05.924
"That's the worst thing I've
ever heard in my entire life.

00:07:05.924 --> 00:07:06.959
I'm never giving you that."

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:09.362
I go, "But--but I love her."

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:10.997
He goes, "How long
you been together?"

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:12.431
I go, "Six months."
He goes, "Get out

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:13.632
"of my fucking store.

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:15.601
I'm not giving you that tattoo."

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.937
I go, "Fine, I'll just go
somewhere else

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.939
and get a worse one."

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:23.942
You know?
Now he knows I'm mature.

00:07:23.942 --> 00:07:25.811
So he goes, "Ugh, all right.

00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:29.948
"Look, go home.
Wait seven days.

00:07:29.948 --> 00:07:31.516
"If you come back,
you still want it,

00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:33.652
and you're not drunk,
I'll give it to ya."

00:07:33.652 --> 00:07:36.521
And I was like, "You're on,
motherfucker."

00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:38.290
And he was like,
"It's not a challenge.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.459
I don't want to do this."

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:45.298
[laughter]

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.200
So I go home.
I wait seven days.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.402
I listen to the song over and
over again.

00:07:50.402 --> 00:07:53.806
I go back in,
put $200 on the counter,

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:55.574
and he gives me this.

00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:58.410
[audience murmuring]

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.347
[applause]

00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:18.897
So...

00:08:18.897 --> 00:08:21.167
that was 15 years ago,

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.536
if you're wondering if tattoos
are permanent.

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:28.340
[laughter]

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.043
And it's somehow brighter today
than the day I got it.

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:35.380
I don't know how that happened.
It's supposed to fade, right?

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.517
About an hour into it, he's
like, "I'm done."

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.585
I looked down.
It was a black outline.

00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:43.688
And I must have said, "Gayer,"

00:08:43.688 --> 00:08:45.757
'cause it's rainbow-colored
on the inside.

00:08:45.757 --> 00:08:51.030
I don't know why I thought that
would be a good idea.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.464
That was 15 years ago.

00:08:52.464 --> 00:08:54.400
I've been doing comedy
for 13 years.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.537
This is the first year I've ever
talked about this onstage.

00:08:58.537 --> 00:09:01.874
That's how long it took me
to be okay with it.

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:04.977
[cheers and applause]

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.614
Not because of you guys.

00:09:09.614 --> 00:09:12.385
You guys are very supportive.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:13.886
But all my friends are
comedians.

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.387
You can't show this to a
comedian.

00:09:15.387 --> 00:09:17.155
They won't talk about anything
else ever.

00:09:17.155 --> 00:09:19.057
I don't even want to get
off stage right now

00:09:19.057 --> 00:09:20.993
and go back to the green room.

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:23.495
[laughter]

00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:26.265
I showed it to one comedian
friend one time,

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:29.234
and he goes, "Oh, why didn't you
just get two dudes

00:09:29.234 --> 00:09:30.669
"butt fucking on your stomach?

00:09:30.669 --> 00:09:32.805
That would have been less gay."

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:34.840
[laughter]

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.576
And I said, "'Cause those
weren't the lyrics."

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:39.678
[laughter]

00:09:39.678 --> 00:09:41.080
You guys were awesome.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.581
Thank you so much.
Have a great night.
