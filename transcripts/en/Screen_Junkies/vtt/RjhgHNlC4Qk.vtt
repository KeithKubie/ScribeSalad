00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.300
The following trailer is rated S for spoilers.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.600
From the director who exploded onto the scene

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.600
then went out like a hot fart

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.900
Comes what might be M. Night Shyamalan's greatest... surprise... yet!

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.060
He's actually kinda good again.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.180
I did not see this happening.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.180
What? No?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.880
Split

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.740
James McAvoy stars as man with 24 split personalities in the same body

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.080
but get ready to see about only 8 of them.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.180
a kinda which kinda blend together.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
I think i'm talking to Denis.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.340
Still, he'll teach a masterclass and channeling a wide variety of creepy personalities, like:

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.260
Creepy child.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.800
Someone's coming for you.
-Creepy Tim Gunn.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.040
That one. I'm gonna hand-print it
with newspaper headlines.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.340
And, creepy Mrs. Doubt fire

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.320
I think I'll put a pretty
flower in your hair.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.460
As they do wonderfull job explaining how so many personalities can co-exist in his mind,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.680
But ignore one big question!

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.780
How does he always have the right clothes nearby when he changes?

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.180
Does he keep grandma's sweater in every room, just in case?

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.360
No!

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.660
Watch McAvoy act circles around 
the rest of the cast,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.520
How? - I know.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.480
Litteral circels, because this dumbass victim stand around, waiting to be eaten.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.940
Or lock themselves in the lockers.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.040
Or not run away when this happens.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.800
Okay, and run, run.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.780
Okay, and... go.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.120
Run away, right now.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.960
Run, you moron!

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.100
But, don't worry, fans of the old bad Shyamalan, because he'll still be guilty of his trademarks.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.940
Like, vacant staring

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.680
Wooden acting.
-I'm proud of you., i think.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.940
And the worst dialogue 
the side of the Happening.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.060
Jai, what health-conscious
fast food purveyor

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.440
did you originally solicit
to buy these chicken wings

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.580
you've so lovingly reheated
in a minor suicidal gesture?

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.200
Yep, there is the M. Night 
we all know and hate.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.400
So, prepare for dawn of the new Shyamalansans.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.300
In a film that doesn't just 
kick ass as a standalone movie.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.040
And also works as.... Hold on, 
if you dont want twist in a Split ruined,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.100
you are gonna clear out for this part.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.960
It's ok, i'll give you some time to click away while we watch the wind from Happening.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.820
OK? Everyone gone who doesn't want the big twist spoiled?

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.540
Alright, here goes.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.180
It's a secret sequel to Unbreakable.
How cool is that?

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.280
A movie 17  made by years old studio,
which most of the audience likely forgot about.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.800
There is no way you saw that coming.
Now i can have wondering,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.960
is it all connected?
Who else could show up in Shamala verse?

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.940
Could we get a whole the Shamala's ventures with the kid who see dead people?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.940
Aang and Cypher Rage?
Nevermind, that will be terrible.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.420
You are not out of dog house,
 yet, Nightman.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.880
Starring:

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.100
The ol M. Night cameo.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.640
Personalities 9-23.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.540
Mr. Plinkett's basement.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.680
Beastmode activated, and

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.260
What it's like to be a girl on the internet.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.780
Take off your skirt and 
take off your shirt.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.320
Just take it off. Can i kiss ya?

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.640
10 Cloverfield room.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.320
I do have the ability to use Kevin's full name
and bring him forward.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.920
This guy is not gonna be 
much of a challenge to Bruce Willis.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.980
He's got the same weakness
 as Rumpelstiltskin.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.720
