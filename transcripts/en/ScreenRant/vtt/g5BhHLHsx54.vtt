10 Marvel Movie Mysteries That Need Answers
Badly

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.330
In any given interconnected movie universe,
there will always be a lot of narrative threads

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.900
occurring at any given time.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.450
As a general rule, they're included to leave
writers with the option to go back to them

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.740
in the future if they want to - but that doesn't
always end up immediately being the case.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.810
Some plot threads can be forgotten, and some
can just take a lot of time to resolve.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.910
This can leave audiences with a lot of questions
- and not all of them end up being answered.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.800
The Marvel Cinematic Universe is no exception
to this.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.790
Thirteen movies have been released in the
MCU to date and there have been loads of plot

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.830
threads that writers have yet to go back to.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.340
Granted, we know that some of them will be
revisited, but not all of them will be, and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.380
it can be frustrating having to wait to see
them resolved in either case.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.220
On that note, here are ten Marvel movies mysteries
that need answers badly (and please bear in

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.100
mind there are spoilers for Captain America:
Civil War in this video).

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.020
What Are The Infinity War Movies Going To
Be Called?

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.219
At the start of May in 2016, it was revealed
by director brothers Anthony and Joe Russo

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.680
that the two Avengers: Infinity War movies
will be renamed before they are released in

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.280
2018 and 2019 respectively.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.720
But what will they be renamed to?

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.250
The only clue the Russos gave about the new
names is that they would be different to each

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.320
other and not just called "Part One" and "Part
Two" any more.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.781
This is extremely intriguing, but with no
timescale on the renaming being given, fans

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.680
of the Marvel Cinematic Universe are going
to have to be patient for an answer to that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.960
question.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560
What Actually Happened To The Red Skull?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.290
At the end of 2011's Captain America: The
First Avenger, Hugo Weaving's Red Skull attempted

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.740
to handle the Tesseract and met his demise
- but exactly what kind of demise was it?

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.670
The immediate assumption was that he had died,
but the Tesseract is the Infinity Stone that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.310
enables travel across the universe, so was
the Red Skull simply transported to a distant

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.380
location in the cosmos?

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.979
He has yet to re-emerge in the Marvel Cinematic
Universe, but speculation about a possible

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.920
return has been rife for years.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.740
Should he ever return, fans of the franchise
would finally learn exactly what happened

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.490
to him.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.399
Does Atlantis Exist In The MCU?

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.530
Towards the end of 2010's Iron Man 2, Tony
Stark receives a debriefing from Nick Fury

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.920
at a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.830
In the room are a number of high-tech computer
screens with important information displayed

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.830
on them.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.550
One of the screens has a map of the world
on it with a number of key locations highlighted

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.550
on it; these include Wakanda and what appears
to be Atlantis.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.320
Wakanda has, of course, been confirmed to
exist in the MCU, but six years on we still

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.220
haven't seen Atlantis introduced.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.970
Does it actually exist in the MCU?

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.000
It would be very cool if it does, because
we might get to see the introduction of Namor

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.510
the Sub-Mariner, but who knows if we'll ever
find out?

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.850
Where Is The Real Mandarin?

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.900
2013's Iron Man 3 introduced a villain that
caused a lot of anger among comic book movie

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.900
fans.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.319
The Mandarin was initially believed to be
the same bad guy who so famously fights Iron

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.920
Man on a regular basis in the comics, but
Iron Man 3 put a controversial twist on the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.920
character.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.330
The Mandarin was revealed to be a ruse portrayed
by bumbling British actor Trevor Slattery,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.800
created to allow Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian
to go about his villainous business undisturbed.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.269
However, Marvel Studios backtracked due to
the fan reaction, and revealed in the Marvel

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.420
One-Shot All Hail the King that the real Mandarin
is still out there.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.489
But where is he?

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.989
Are we ever going to see him?

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:24.950
Only time will tell, but it doesn't look likely
at the moment.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.970
How Does Erik Selvig Know So Much?

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.550
In 2013's Thor: The Dark World, Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd's
Erik Selvig was revealed to have been driven

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.280
mad by the events of 2012's The Avengers - a
movie in which Loki mind-controlled him using

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.920
his mysterious scepter.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.560
In his crazed state, the institutionalised
Selvig drew a diagram of the World Tree on

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.830
a chalkboard that included references to "The
Fault" and "The Crossroads".

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.560
Fans of Marvel Comics will know that these
are both cosmic gateways to an infinite number

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.200
of alien dimensions and alternate universes.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.209
But how the hell does Selvig know about them?

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.430
What exactly did Loki put in his head?

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.140
Where exactly had he been taken by the God
of Mischief?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.980
We'll probably never know.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.430
What's Happend To Odin?

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.860
At the end of the aforementioned Thor: The
Dark World, when Loki was believed to be dead,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.090
the God of Mischief actually revealed himself
to be sat on the throne belonging to his adopted

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.129
father Odin.

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.160
Loki had used his magical illusions to disguise
himself as the All-Father and had clearly

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.019
disposed of Anthony Hopkins' character in
some way.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.630
Since then, Odin's whereabouts hasn't been
confirmed.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.630
Is he dead?

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.270
Is he being held captive somewhere?

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.500
Did Loki hand him over to the Mad Titan, Thanos,
as a way of apologising for his failure to

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.560
conquer Earth in The Avengers?

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.180
Surely we'll find out the answer to this question
in 2017's Thor: Ragnarok.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.940
How Do The Avengers Still Not Know Phil Coulson's
Alive?

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.351
In the aforementioned Avengers movie in 2012,
it's fair to say that the death of Phil Coulson

00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:51.540
was pivotal in the coming together of the
fractured titular team in order for them to

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.910
defeat Loki and his invading Chitauri army.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.680
Tony Stark and his fellow heroes weren't going
to let Clark Gregg's likeable character die

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.880
in vain, so they put their differences aside,
convened in New York City, and kicked some

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.090
alien ass.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.991
Soon after that victory, it was revealed in
television's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. that Coulson

00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:08.390
had been resurrected.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.960
Nearly four years on, the Avengers still don't
know that he's alive again.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.960
How?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.220
Both the Avengers and Coulson's team of S.H.I.E.L.D.
agents make it their business to intervene

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.030
in the exploits of super-powered villains
around the globe - and Coulson often does

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.060
it in broad daylight - so it's crazy to think
his friends and allies in the Avengers aren't

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:32.690
aware that he's not still dead.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.900
Who Is Peter Quill's Father?

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.920
Guardians of the Galaxy was one of 2014's
most successful movies, and it will be getting

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.949
a 2017 sequel as a result.

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.440
This is great news, as we already know that
it will answer a question that fans badly

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.440
want answering.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.229
It was revealed in the first movie that Peter
Quill's father - someone Yondu described as

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.160
a "jackass" - was something more than human,
and that's why Peter was able to withstand

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.170
the power of the Orb Infinity Stone.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.430
The movie ended on that cliffhanger, which
was really frustrating.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.520
But it has now been confirmed that none other
than Kurt Russell will be playing Quill's

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.030
dad in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:11.360
We really can't wait to find out which character
he's playing!

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.810
Where Are All The Avengers Now?

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.330
At the end of the aforementioned Civil War
movie, a lot of questions were left unanswered

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.509
regarding where certain Avengers were.

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.120
Captain America broke Clint Barton, Wanda
Maximoff, Sam Wilson and Scott Lang out of

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.110
the Raft prison, but where that quartet disappeared
to afterwards is unclear.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.500
Black Widow also had to go on the run after
helping Cap and Bucky Barnes escape from the

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.040
authorities, so it's only known where a few
of the Avengers are.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.490
Tony Stark, James Rhodes and Vision remain
at the Avengers facility in Upstate New York,

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.819
Spider-Man is back home in Queens and Captain
America is in Wakanda with Black Panther and

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:45.819
Bucky Barnes.

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.889
When you also bear in mind that Hulk and Thor's
whereabouts are still unknown after the events

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:54.410
of 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, fans really
want to know where a lot of the Avengers are.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.190
Did Spider-Man Sign The Sokovia Accords?

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.819
2016's Captain America: Civil War saw the
Marvel Cinematic Universe debut of Spider-Man.

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:04.690
The movie had Team Iron Man and Team Captain
America fighting over the implementation of

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.289
the Sokovia Accords; a legislative bill that
required superhumans to register as such and

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:11.330
be managed by the governments of the world.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.509
The Webslinger fought on Tony Stark's pro-registration
side, but did he actually sign the Accords?

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:20.039
He wasn't present for any discussions about
it and it was never made clear.

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:23.270
It's really hard to imagine Spider-Man only
operating on the streets of New York when

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.110
the government tell him to - that's just not
how Spider-Man classically operates - and

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.070
his first MCU solo movie in 2017 will definitely
have a bizarre feel to it if that turns out

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.060
to be the case.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.500
Thanks for watching our list of 10 Marvel
movie mysteries that need answers badly.
