00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this unit, we look at how to model a 1/4 of a car, seeing physics in action.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I guess you can imagine how to model other types of machinery

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
with the help of differential equations and the computer.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And we took a glimpse at control theory trying to come up with feedback loops

00:00:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that ensure the system behaves in an optimum fashion.
