.

00:15:04.898 --> 00:15:08.805
&gt;&gt;  Members of congress and 
distinguished guests, welcome to

00:15:08.806 --> 00:15:10.806
the 

00:15:13.241 --> 00:15:15.241
Library of Congress and

00:15:17.373 --> 00:15:19.644
the 8th Kissinger Lecture.  The 
Kissinger program is made 

00:15:19.645 --> 00:15:21.645
possible 

00:15:22.752 --> 00:15:25.616
by generous donations and 
admirers of Dr. Kissinger who 

00:15:25.617 --> 00:15:27.617
was the 56th secretary of state 
of the United States and a 

00:15:31.112 --> 00:15:33.794
recipient o of the Nobel Peace 
Prize.  Before we move on, we 

00:15:33.795 --> 00:15:35.795
join America in 

00:15:37.653 --> 00:15:40.380
mourning the passing of former 
president George HWBusH.

00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:45.877
The Kissinger program  
celebrates statesmanship and 

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.128
foreign policy.  This is in 
keeping with exactly that 

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:51.386
tradition.  We all wish the 
extended Bush family 

00:15:56.702 --> 00:15:58.702
and has many close friends the 
best in this difficult time.

00:16:01.405 --> 00:16:03.405
We mourn the passing also last 
month of Dr.

00:16:06.659 --> 00:16:08.758
James billing  ger.

00:16:11.832 --> 00:16:14.071
His distinguished career here at
the library spanned 2 years.

00:16:15.901 --> 00:16:17.901
The Kissinger Lecture has been 
delivered 

00:16:21.407 --> 00:16:23.407
by heads of state, including 
Tony Blair, 

00:16:25.497 --> 00:16:27.950
and former president of Brazil, 
former president of the French 

00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:29.951
republic, as 

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.151
well as former United States 
secretaries of state.

00:16:41.404 --> 00:16:43.026
We will have an address by our 
Kissinger lecturer, madam 

00:16:43.027 --> 00:16:45.027
Christine Lagarde, 

00:16:49.167 --> 00:16:51.167
followed by a conversation with 
Margaret 

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:55.847
Brennan, CBS News correspondent 
and host of Face the Nation.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.400
I now introduce Dr.

00:17:01.652 --> 00:17:04.921
Carla Hayden, the 14th Librarian
of Congress.

00:17:07.934 --> 00:17:08.226
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN:  Good evening, 

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:10.227
madam 

00:17:11.708 --> 00:17:15.414
Lagarde, members of congress, 
and distinguished guests.  We 

00:17:15.415 --> 00:17:17.887
are deeply honored to welcome to
the Library of Congress tonight 

00:17:20.752 --> 00:17:22.798
Christine Lagarde, managing 
director of the international 

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:25.644
monetary fund.
As you can see, we are in the 

00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:27.645
great 

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:32.342
hall, of the library's

00:17:33.648 --> 00:17:35.648
Thomas Jefferson building, 
surrounded 

00:17:36.703 --> 00:17:38.335
by visual art, symbolizing the 
progress of civilization and the

00:17:38.336 --> 00:17:40.336
traditions of 

00:17:43.448 --> 00:17:45.448
knowledge and learning, a most 
fitting 

00:17:46.778 --> 00:17:48.778
venue for the 8th Kissinger 
Lecture.

00:17:49.233 --> 00:17:50.445
Christine Lagarde is a 
distinguished public servant 

00:17:50.446 --> 00:17:52.893
with a deep knowledge on of the 
world economy and the ways 

00:17:54.116 --> 00:17:56.588
financial architecture can shape
the lives of individuals in 

00:17:56.589 --> 00:17:58.589
countries around the globe.

00:18:04.609 --> 00:18:07.060
Among her many high ranking 
appointments in the private and 

00:18:07.061 --> 00:18:09.061
public sector, in June she 
became the first woman to hold 

00:18:12.994 --> 00:18:14.994
the post of finance and economy 
minister 

00:18:17.582 --> 00:18:19.582
of a G7 country, later as 
chairman of 

00:18:25.099 --> 00:18:27.627
the G20 she set in motion a wide
ranging agenda.

00:18:30.722 --> 00:18:32.765
She later became the 11th 
managing director of the IMF and

00:18:32.766 --> 00:18:34.766
the first woman to hold that 
position.

00:18:40.765 --> 00:18:43.252
On February 19, 2016, the IMF 
executive board selected her to 

00:18:43.253 --> 00:18:48.381
serve as the managing director 
for a second five-year term.  

00:18:48.382 --> 00:18:50.218
She has tackled some of the most
challenging financial issues 

00:18:50.219 --> 00:18:53.077
related to European integration,
international 

00:18:57.181 --> 00:18:59.181
trade, and the development of 
global economic governance.

00:19:03.987 --> 00:19:05.987
However, I am excited to be the 
person 

00:19:08.203 --> 00:19:10.203
that will deliver breaking news.

00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:18.891
The room just got a little 
quieter.

00:19:21.603 --> 00:19:23.235
Well, today Forbes released its 
100 Most Powerful Women in the 

00:19:23.236 --> 00:19:25.236
World.

00:19:28.211 --> 00:19:30.465
And  Madam Christine Lagarde was
voted the third most powerful 

00:19:30.466 --> 00:19:33.732
woman in the world.
[Applause]

00:19:39.806 --> 00:19:41.806
[Cheers]
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN:  So, ladies and

00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:47.225
gentlemen, please join me in 
welcoming Ms. Christine Lagarde.

00:19:50.496 --> 00:19:52.496
[Applause]

00:20:03.016 --> 00:20:05.016
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Thank you
very much, Dr.

00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:11.806
Hayden, dear Carla, for this 
generous and brief introduction.

00:20:11.807 --> 00:20:13.807
They are the best.  They are the
best.

00:20:16.985 --> 00:20:18.853
I'm so happy to see many of you 
here, my friends, and very much 

00:20:18.854 --> 00:20:20.854
looking forward to the 
discussion that we will 

00:20:23.757 --> 00:20:27.458
have after these remarks with 
Margaret Brennan.  Thank you 

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:29.459
also, Mr.

00:20:31.144 --> 00:20:33.783
Haskil, for the warm welcome you
extended to all of us.

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:37.282
He could not be here tonight but
I had a conversation with him 

00:20:37.283 --> 00:20:39.283
just before 

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.380
arriving at this beautiful 
Library of Congress.

00:20:43.835 --> 00:20:45.473
And Henry Kissinger was 
delighted that we were gathering

00:20:45.474 --> 00:20:47.474
tonight and he has 

00:20:49.175 --> 00:20:52.026
asked me to express to all of 
you his best wishes and very 

00:20:52.027 --> 00:20:57.400
strong support for continuing 
the lecture that he started back

00:20:57.401 --> 00:20:59.401
in 2001.

00:21:02.104 --> 00:21:04.164
I would also like to indicate 
myself that somebody else is 

00:21:04.165 --> 00:21:06.195
very much in our thoughts 
tonight, and that is obviously 

00:21:11.952 --> 00:21:16.674
former  President George H.W. 
Bush is all his family members. 

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:18.675
We all mourn his passing.  Many 
others are trying to enter into 

00:21:20.377 --> 00:21:22.377
the rotunda as we speak.

00:21:23.624 --> 00:21:25.624
And we celebrate the arc of his 
life.

00:21:26.926 --> 00:21:28.926
The pilot who bravely fought in 
World 

00:21:31.246 --> 00:21:33.684
War II, the president who helped
heal division after the Cold War

00:21:33.685 --> 00:21:35.685
and the 

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.560
statesman who believed in the 
power

00:21:43.153 --> 00:21:45.153
of international cooperation.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.456
I was privileged to meet him on 
several occasions up in Maine 

00:21:48.457 --> 00:21:53.132
and I could appreciate what a 
kind, generous, and noble man he

00:21:53.133 --> 00:21:55.133
was.

00:21:59.262 --> 00:22:01.262
So tonight, tonight is December 
4th.

00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:04.829
It's actually an important date 
for a particular reason that I 

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:08.117
will not mention to you now.  
You'll have to wait until the 

00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:14.245
end of my remarks.  And you're 
not allowed to look at your cell

00:22:14.246 --> 00:22:16.246
phone please.
[Laughter]

00:22:17.095 --> 00:22:19.434
No.
I have to confess something 

00:22:19.435 --> 00:22:21.435
here.

00:22:25.167 --> 00:22:27.167
When I walked into the  Great 
Hall and 

00:22:28.242 --> 00:22:30.242
was given a lovely private tour 
by you, Dr. Dr.

00:22:33.782 --> 00:22:35.782
Hayden, three thoughts crossed 
my mind.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:42.990
The first one was this young 
French 

00:22:46.323 --> 00:22:48.323
student who was studying for her

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.200
political sciences dissertation

00:22:56.116 --> 00:22:58.987
back 42 years ago and spent time
in the reading room.  Thanks to 

00:22:58.988 --> 00:23:00.843
the Library of Congress I was 
able to better research the work

00:23:00.844 --> 00:23:02.844
I 

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:08.654
did on Ralph Nader and the 
American consumerism in those 

00:23:08.655 --> 00:23:10.655
days.  Thank you.  I'm in your 
debt.

00:23:11.764 --> 00:23:13.607
The second person I thought 
about was my son, a young 

00:23:13.608 --> 00:23:15.657
architect.  He would love this 
place.  He would love it.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.970
The space, the height, the 
creativity.

00:23:24.459 --> 00:23:27.328
And the third thought I had was 
about my country, France.  And 

00:23:27.329 --> 00:23:28.754
maybe another country, actually,
that I was just visiting a 

00:23:28.755 --> 00:23:30.755
couple of 

00:23:33.478 --> 00:23:35.540
days ago, Argentina.
Why is that?

00:23:40.686 --> 00:23:42.686
Well, when this structure was 
completed, 

00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:48.269
in 1897, the chief engineer 
remarked, I 

00:23:54.304 --> 00:23:55.949
quote, that the Palagonia, the 
Paris opera house, was the prime

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.230
suggestion for the new Library 
of Congress.

00:24:01.514 --> 00:24:03.514
That makes sense because the 
Paris opera 

00:24:05.796 --> 00:24:07.796
house was completed 20 years 
earlier in 1875.

00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:11.561
Now, I think the French may have

00:24:12.645 --> 00:24:14.645
borrowed a little bit from 
others, 

00:24:20.894 --> 00:24:22.894
because Tiat Cologne in buenos 
Eros was 

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.676
finished in 1857.  If you look 
at these two buildings, it tells

00:24:27.677 --> 00:24:29.677
you something.

00:24:31.215 --> 00:24:34.199
First of all, intellectual 
property was of great interest 

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.510
across borders, even back then, 
attitude least among architects,

00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:40.575
who happily borrowed from each 
other, learned from each other, 

00:24:40.576 --> 00:24:45.823
and became inspired as a result.
Second, it reminds us that they 

00:24:48.491 --> 00:24:50.491
understood that building 
something 

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.540
lasting means linking the solid 

00:24:55.019 --> 00:24:57.019
foundations of the past with a 
spark of imagination.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.700
You can't just copy-cat.

00:25:02.204 --> 00:25:04.867
That kind of creativity and 
long-term vision rooted in 

00:25:04.868 --> 00:25:07.569
history and informed by our 
successes and failures from the 

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.570
past 

00:25:10.637 --> 00:25:13.550
is my theme for this evening.
First, where have we been?

00:25:18.255 --> 00:25:20.300
How has creativity and 
international economy 

00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:22.301
cooperation helped bring more 

00:25:23.404 --> 00:25:25.404
prosperity and more peace in the
world?

00:25:27.976 --> 00:25:29.976
And second, where can we travel 
together?

00:25:31.657 --> 00:25:34.307
How can creativity and informed 
visionary thinking help adopt 

00:25:34.308 --> 00:25:37.605
the international system to our 
current challenges?

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.070
So let me begin first with a 
little bit 

00:25:43.751 --> 00:25:46.204
of shared history, between the 
International Monetary Fund and 

00:25:46.205 --> 00:25:48.205
the 

00:25:49.879 --> 00:25:51.879
United States of the last 75 
years.

00:25:54.451 --> 00:25:56.451
In the first half of the 20th 
century, 

00:25:58.938 --> 00:26:01.720
the dominant economic and 
military powers used force to 

00:26:01.721 --> 00:26:04.372
assert their self-interest at 
enormous cost in terms 

00:26:07.708 --> 00:26:09.708
of human life and physical 
destruction.

00:26:10.383 --> 00:26:12.618
The tragic result compelled 
nations to find a better way.

00:26:15.887 --> 00:26:17.887
It only took them two wars, and 

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.200
atrocities along the way, but in
1944, they found it.

00:26:25.912 --> 00:26:27.747
The United States emerged as the
major global power and did 

00:26:27.748 --> 00:26:30.610
something unprecedented.

00:26:35.776 --> 00:26:37.776
Informed by the devastateing 
ultimate 

00:26:42.524 --> 00:26:44.524
outcome of of the

00:26:45.663 --> 00:26:47.663
Versailles treaty which we just 

00:26:52.295 --> 00:26:54.295
celebrated the 100 year an 
versesy, the 

00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:59.169
United States decided to go 
forward with cooperation.  Dr.

00:27:02.444 --> 00:27:04.281
Kissinger called the innovations
of the postwar period, I quote, 

00:27:04.282 --> 00:27:08.377
a great birth of creativity that
brought security to the world.

00:27:08.582 --> 00:27:15.184
How did the U.S. do it?
Out of generosity?  Yeah.

00:27:17.055 --> 00:27:19.486
With consideration to their 
self-interest?  Yes.

00:27:22.379 --> 00:27:24.852
And with a little help from some
of their friends.

00:27:27.743 --> 00:27:30.023
Let us look at that turning 
point of 75 years ago.

00:27:33.312 --> 00:27:35.312
And think first of the creation 
of the system itself.

00:27:37.961 --> 00:27:39.961
The

00:27:43.799 --> 00:27:45.799
Principal architect, John Kains 
of the 

00:27:48.946 --> 00:27:50.946
UK and Harry Dexter White from 
the U.S.

00:27:52.007 --> 00:27:54.007
were deeply influenced by the 
two wars.

00:27:59.748 --> 00:28:01.748
They witnessed where there were

00:28:03.423 --> 00:28:05.423
witnessed relationships that had

00:28:07.658 --> 00:28:09.658
foundations in the treaty of 
Versailles.

00:28:11.385 --> 00:28:14.055
The result was imploding world 
trade that deepened the 

00:28:14.056 --> 00:28:16.922
depression and caused massive 
economic and social upheaval.

00:28:20.642 --> 00:28:22.642
Ultimately, these pressures gave
rise 

00:28:25.725 --> 00:28:27.725
to nationalist and pop list 
movement

00:28:30.113 --> 00:28:32.113
ul populist movements and 
eventually catastrophe.

00:28:32.373 --> 00:28:34.373
Emerging from the second World 
war, the U.S.

00:28:38.961 --> 00:28:41.931
and some 40 countries gathered 
in New Hampshire and decided to 

00:28:41.932 --> 00:28:45.237
create the International 
Monetary Fund and the World 

00:28:45.238 --> 00:28:47.238
Bank.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.380
They tasked the fund with 
promoting 

00:28:53.778 --> 00:28:55.624
international monetary 
cooperation, supporting trade 

00:28:55.625 --> 00:28:58.104
and economic growth, and 
discouraging policies that would

00:28:58.918 --> 00:29:03.855
harm prosperity.
It was revolutionary.  It was 

00:29:03.856 --> 00:29:05.856
visionary.  And guess what?

00:29:07.788 --> 00:29:09.788
It worked.

00:29:11.902 --> 00:29:13.902
From the very beginning, the IMF
helped 

00:29:15.199 --> 00:29:17.666
countries address major new 
challenges through 

00:29:17.667 --> 00:29:19.667
collaboration.

00:29:24.188 --> 00:29:26.188
Complimenting the  Marshall plan
we at 

00:29:30.126 --> 00:29:32.126
IMF helped Europe rebuild from 
from the horror of war.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.971
We helped to implement policies 
to promote growth.  It's a 

00:29:36.972 --> 00:29:39.438
mission we continue to this day.
As you may have recently seen in

00:29:44.164 --> 00:29:44.801
countries like arg Argentina, 
Egypt, Ukraine, and many others.

00:29:49.099 --> 00:29:51.155
The genius of this collaborated 
system they invented was it was 

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:53.420
designed to adapt and change.

00:29:57.544 --> 00:30:00.203
And in the early '70s, that 
change arrived.

00:30:04.332 --> 00:30:06.332
Some of you might remember that 
speech, 

00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:12.211
a land mark speech, the 
challenge of peace.

00:30:14.307 --> 00:30:17.012
President Nixon suspended the 
U.S. dollar currency into gold 

00:30:17.013 --> 00:30:19.013
and that 

00:30:20.476 --> 00:30:21.721
shocked the world and forced a 
year-long negotiation that led 

00:30:21.722 --> 00:30:23.722
to the modern 

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
floating exchange rate 
structure, away 

00:30:28.707 --> 00:30:31.431
from the fixed gold reference 
structure, moving into floating 

00:30:31.432 --> 00:30:35.350
exchange rate structure.
System that is still today in 

00:30:35.351 --> 00:30:37.823
place, in many corners of the 
world.

00:30:40.709 --> 00:30:42.343
But at the time, some thought 
that this particular change 

00:30:42.344 --> 00:30:47.246
would mean the end of the IMF.
But all our members at the time,

00:30:49.898 --> 00:30:52.360
including the United States, 
knew that the goal of stability 

00:30:52.361 --> 00:30:55.489
and prosperity extended well 
beyond fixed exchange rates.

00:30:58.745 --> 00:31:00.745
They recognized the benefits of 
the 

00:31:01.808 --> 00:31:03.859
global financial firefighter 
that could help countries in 

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.751
times of need.
They built on what worked, 

00:31:06.752 --> 00:31:08.752
changed what 

00:31:10.036 --> 00:31:12.706
did not, and they adapted.
And we moved on.

00:31:16.597 --> 00:31:18.597
1973, the oil crisis, the IMF 
created 

00:31:21.711 --> 00:31:24.208
new tools, to help countries 
facing an energy emergency in 

00:31:24.209 --> 00:31:26.893
line with the funds rule to help
smooth shocks and prevent 

00:31:27.921 --> 00:31:29.921
harmful spillovers.

00:31:33.488 --> 00:31:36.374
As the debt crisis hit Latin 
America in the '80s, the IMF 

00:31:36.375 --> 00:31:38.375
with creativity ideas and 
support from the United States 

00:31:38.614 --> 00:31:40.614
stepped in to calm the waters.

00:31:44.093 --> 00:31:46.196
After the fall of the Berlin 
wall we took on a new challenge 

00:31:46.197 --> 00:31:48.197
which was 

00:31:50.312 --> 00:31:51.742
happening the Soviet Union  bloc
nations to transform themselves 

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.743
from centrally planned to free 
market economies.

00:31:57.182 --> 00:31:59.182
In the 1990s

00:32:00.596 --> 00:32:03.463
, the fund assisted countries in
overcoming first the Mexican 

00:32:03.464 --> 00:32:05.537
financial crisis and then the 
Asian financial  crisis.

00:32:07.178 --> 00:32:09.467
Throughout all these challenges,
we continued to help countries 

00:32:09.468 --> 00:32:11.468
throughout 

00:32:13.628 --> 00:32:15.080
the world with their 
fundamentals, their fiscal and 

00:32:15.081 --> 00:32:18.192
monetary exchange rate policies 
and with steps to build stronger

00:32:18.193 --> 00:32:20.193
economic institutions.

00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:24.405
Because without that 
macroeconomic stability, growth 

00:32:24.406 --> 00:32:27.274
cannot prosper.
These efforts enabled better 

00:32:27.275 --> 00:32:29.275
policies 

00:32:30.551 --> 00:32:32.551
that opened markets, boosted 
trade, 

00:32:35.271 --> 00:32:37.271
created jobs, and unleashed 
economic potential.

00:32:42.042 --> 00:32:44.739
And then came 2008, and the 
financial crisis, the global 

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.740
financial crisis.

00:32:50.288 --> 00:32:52.330
Most of the other crises that I 
have referred to applied to 

00:32:52.331 --> 00:32:54.331
particular regions.

00:32:55.428 --> 00:32:58.537
This one was the first of a 
completely global nature.  The 

00:32:58.538 --> 00:33:01.444
ensuing great recession reminded
us that international 

00:33:01.445 --> 00:33:05.347
cooperation was essential, not 
optional.  As the French finance

00:33:05.348 --> 00:33:08.275
minister at the time, I 
certainly participated in that 

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.480
exercise.

00:33:12.425 --> 00:33:14.425
All G20 nations and the federal 

00:33:18.173 --> 00:33:20.622
reserve took trued extraordinary
steps to save the system.

00:33:24.941 --> 00:33:27.381
Veterans, when we sort of come 
together, we just wonder how we 

00:33:27.382 --> 00:33:29.382
did it, 

00:33:33.343 --> 00:33:35.343
and how much we transgressed and
had to 

00:33:38.596 --> 00:33:40.596
violate principles and rules and
reinvent.

00:33:43.369 --> 00:33:45.369
But we helped secure the global 
economy.

00:33:47.343 --> 00:33:49.807
In the decade since the 2008 
financial crisis, we supported 

00:33:49.808 --> 00:33:51.808
economic programs in 90 
countries.

00:33:55.571 --> 00:33:57.571
And adapted our lending 
instruments, 

00:33:58.864 --> 00:34:00.864
including zero interest loans to
help low-income countries.

00:34:04.851 --> 00:34:06.699
But the global economy did not 
only need liquidity and 

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.122
stimulus, it also needed to 
reform its financial 

00:34:09.123 --> 00:34:11.591
architecture.  And we worked 
with our membership to 

00:34:14.665 --> 00:34:16.722
build a stronger financial 
sector so that we could, 

00:34:16.723 --> 00:34:18.723
together, limit the 

00:34:20.408 --> 00:34:23.111
consequences of what will be, 
one day, the next crisis.

00:34:24.324 --> 00:34:27.791
So we learned from the past.  We
got creativity.  And we changed 

00:34:27.792 --> 00:34:30.241
for the better.
And none of that, none of that, 

00:34:30.242 --> 00:34:32.919
would have been possible without
the United States.

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:39.208
This country challenged the 

00:34:40.468 --> 00:34:44.548
international quarter when it 
needed challenging.  It forged 

00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:47.197
compromise when compromise was 
necessary.  Why?  Why did it do 

00:34:47.198 --> 00:34:49.198
all that?  Benevolence?

00:34:52.331 --> 00:34:54.563
It did so because a stronger and
more stable world paid dividends

00:34:54.564 --> 00:34:57.862
for the United States.  It 
enabled the U.S.

00:35:01.971 --> 00:35:03.242
to enjoy some of the longest 
runs of sustained economic 

00:35:03.243 --> 00:35:05.904
growth the modern world has ever
known.

00:35:10.663 --> 00:35:12.663
Since that meeting in 
Britainwoods 

00:35:14.179 --> 00:35:16.179
nearly 75 years ago, real U.S.

00:35:17.475 --> 00:35:19.475
GDP increased by a factor of 
eight.

00:35:23.919 --> 00:35:25.919
The average American's real 
income has quadrupled.

00:35:28.815 --> 00:35:31.476
This did not come at the expense
of other nations.  On the 

00:35:31.477 --> 00:35:33.477
contrary, this country's 

00:35:34.956 --> 00:35:37.127
leadership paid the way not for 
decades of opportunities here in

00:35:37.128 --> 00:35:39.128
America, but 

00:35:40.615 --> 00:35:42.615
also growth that spread across 
the world.

00:35:46.965 --> 00:35:48.965
Now, today, that landscape is 
shifting again.

00:35:50.835 --> 00:35:53.754
And part of this change is 
driven by geo politics, and the 

00:35:53.755 --> 00:35:56.003
shift in some economic power 
from West to East.

00:35:59.685 --> 00:36:01.685
Part of it by the rise of 
non-state 

00:36:03.609 --> 00:36:08.534
actors, including multinational 
organizations and corporates.  

00:36:08.535 --> 00:36:10.535
Part of it is driven by 
technology, 

00:36:14.255 --> 00:36:16.255
and the rapid

00:36:17.491 --> 00:36:19.491
acceleration of everything in 
our lives.

00:36:19.554 --> 00:36:22.245
As I'm sure you know, Dr. 
Hayden, 90% of the world's data 

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:24.493
was created just over the last 
two years.

00:36:28.194 --> 00:36:30.194
Now, I have to say as a daughter
of two 

00:36:31.314 --> 00:36:32.345
classics professors, I know my 
parents would have found that 

00:36:32.346 --> 00:36:34.346
very, very depressing.
[Laughter]

00:36:37.627 --> 00:36:41.948
But the truth is that everything
moves faster.  Information, 

00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:43.949
money, disease, you name it.

00:36:46.466 --> 00:36:48.951
And these transformations can 
bring enormous opportunities but

00:36:48.952 --> 00:36:52.040
can also create massive risks.
Why is that?

00:36:55.507 --> 00:36:58.371
Because more than ever before, 
at least as was demonstrated in 

00:36:58.372 --> 00:37:00.372
2008, what 

00:37:01.441 --> 00:37:03.441
happens in one nation is going 
to impact all nations.

00:37:06.903 --> 00:37:10.911
From weapons of mass destruction
to cyber security to the 

00:37:10.912 --> 00:37:12.912
interconnected financial system,

00:37:14.401 --> 00:37:16.401
many of our current challenges 
recognize no borders.

00:37:17.707 --> 00:37:19.978
So when support for 
international cooperation 

00:37:19.979 --> 00:37:21.979
falters, we must remember 

00:37:23.494 --> 00:37:26.191
the lessons the United States 
and her allies taught the world 

00:37:26.192 --> 00:37:29.282
over the last 75 years.  It's a 
big lesson.

00:37:34.703 --> 00:37:36.703
Solidarity is self-interest.

00:37:40.011 --> 00:37:43.078
And that principle endures in 
our changing world.  Our 

00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:45.079
challenge now is to yet again 

00:37:46.617 --> 00:37:48.617
adapt and reform.

00:37:50.616 --> 00:37:52.652
So I believe that this year, 
2019, can be another turning 

00:37:52.653 --> 00:37:54.653
point in our journey.

00:37:57.957 --> 00:37:59.957
A moment when the world delivers
a new 

00:38:01.619 --> 00:38:03.619
burst of creativity in solving 
our shared challenges.

00:38:07.101 --> 00:38:08.946
There's something there which 
you can't see but from which we 

00:38:08.947 --> 00:38:11.203
can draw inspiration.  Correct 
me if I'm wrong, but it's 

00:38:13.889 --> 00:38:15.330
something like, they build too 
low those who build beneath the 

00:38:15.331 --> 00:38:21.286
stars.  It's written up there.
Imagine what the world could be 

00:38:21.287 --> 00:38:23.287
if we 

00:38:26.586 --> 00:38:28.586
were to build beneath the stars,
the 

00:38:31.235 --> 00:38:33.235
docks as I call it, or the age 
of anger.  Let's imagine.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.640
The age of anger.

00:38:41.158 --> 00:38:45.703
By 2040, inequality could exceed
the levels of the gilded age.  

00:38:45.704 --> 00:38:47.704
Strong monopolies and weak 
governments 

00:38:49.985 --> 00:38:51.985
with ineffective domestic 
policies could 

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:55.954
make it impossible for startups 
and entrepreneurs to succeed.

00:38:55.955 --> 00:39:00.296
Health breakthroughs could allow
the richest to live past 120, 

00:39:00.297 --> 00:39:02.297
while millions 

00:39:04.991 --> 00:39:06.991
of others would suffer from 
disease.

00:39:10.325 --> 00:39:11.767
Social media would bombard 
populations, underscoring the 

00:39:11.768 --> 00:39:14.232
difference between their reality
and the possibility of a better 

00:39:14.233 --> 00:39:16.233
life.

00:39:17.861 --> 00:39:19.861
And the

00:39:20.883 --> 00:39:22.883
aspiration gap would fuel 
anxiety and anger.

00:39:23.164 --> 00:39:25.840
Trust would break down.  The 
world would be more connected 

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.470
digitally, but less connected 
every other way.

00:39:29.932 --> 00:39:32.579
International cooperation for 
the benefit of all would be a 

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.580
concept best 

00:39:35.862 --> 00:39:37.930
studied in libraries like this 
one, but rarely practiced on the

00:39:37.931 --> 00:39:39.931
world stage.

00:39:41.617 --> 00:39:44.494
Due to the supremacy of national
interest and a singular focus on

00:39:44.919 --> 00:39:46.919
domestic policies.
So borrow from Dr.

00:39:50.298 --> 00:39:52.937
Kissinger's world order, we 
might be, I quote, facing a 

00:39:52.938 --> 00:39:54.938
period in which forces beyond 
the restraints of any order 

00:39:56.052 --> 00:39:58.052
determine the future.

00:40:01.547 --> 00:40:02.579
That is a very dystopian 
scenario.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.580
Isn't it?

00:40:06.663 --> 00:40:08.663
Not one that we designed, and 
certainly 

00:40:09.762 --> 00:40:12.821
not one that I believe can be or
should be our destiny.  Neither 

00:40:12.822 --> 00:40:14.822
does  Dr. Kissinger for that 
matter.

00:40:19.296 --> 00:40:21.296
We have overcome

00:40:23.673 --> 00:40:25.673
existential threats before and 
we can do so again.

00:40:27.362 --> 00:40:29.428
Think of 2019, if we make it the
start of a different kind of AI.

00:40:31.517 --> 00:40:33.770
Everybody thinks, oh, she's 
going to talk about artificial 

00:40:33.771 --> 00:40:35.771
intelligence.  No.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.640
Age of

00:40:42.818 --> 00:40:44.818
ingenuity.

00:40:46.124 --> 00:40:48.124
This would be a future fueled by
ingenuity and cooperation.

00:40:50.878 --> 00:40:52.878
2040, I'm in a new scenario now.

00:40:54.375 --> 00:40:56.375
We would see flourishing 
economies 

00:40:57.635 --> 00:40:59.635
redominantly running on 
renewable energy.

00:41:02.761 --> 00:41:04.388
Women would be fully empowered 
in the workforce proven to be an

00:41:04.389 --> 00:41:07.086
economic game changer.  Health 
care portability would reflect 

00:41:09.931 --> 00:41:11.931
the changing nature of work in 
the digital economy.

00:41:14.457 --> 00:41:16.457
Corporation would embrace social

00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:20.857
responsibility as part of their 
business model because they 

00:41:20.858 --> 00:41:23.297
would be rated on that, as well.

00:41:26.585 --> 00:41:29.916
We could save lives and millions
of jobs.  We could see an end to

00:41:29.917 --> 00:41:34.678
mass immigration and 
peacefulness between nations 

00:41:34.679 --> 00:41:37.939
would prevail.
Am I being too optimistic?  Of 

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.214
course!
You know the difference between 

00:41:40.215 --> 00:41:42.215
the 

00:41:43.909 --> 00:41:46.185
optimist and the pessimist?  
They're both wrong, but the 

00:41:46.186 --> 00:41:48.186
optimist is happier.
[Laughter]

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:51.273
So I have to be optimistic.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:53.971
Because I'm thinking about the 
world my grandchildren will 

00:41:53.972 --> 00:41:55.972
inherit.

00:42:00.108 --> 00:42:02.757
But it presents us with a 
fundamental choice: Stand still 

00:42:02.758 --> 00:42:04.758
and watch discord 

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.054
and discontent bubble over into 
conflict conflict, or move 

00:42:09.055 --> 00:42:11.552
forward, reimagine the way 
nations work together, and build

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:19.507
prosperity and peace.
Okay.  Nice words.  What does it

00:42:19.508 --> 00:42:21.987
mean in practice?  It means 
countries working together, 

00:42:25.298 --> 00:42:28.986
to put people, all people, at 
the center of all our efforts.  

00:42:28.987 --> 00:42:30.987
Focusing on real results to 
improve their lives.

00:42:32.291 --> 00:42:34.291
It also means governments and 

00:42:37.067 --> 00:42:39.067
institutions being more 
transparent and 

00:42:40.541 --> 00:42:41.366
accountable which includes 
listening to more diverse 

00:42:41.367 --> 00:42:45.754
voices.  It means ensuring the 
economic benefits of 

00:42:45.755 --> 00:42:48.000
globalizations are shared by 
many, not just a few.

00:42:51.477 --> 00:42:53.477
I call that the new 
multilateralism.

00:42:54.943 --> 00:42:56.568
You might just call it common 
sense if that word suits you 

00:42:56.569 --> 00:42:58.569
better.

00:43:00.234 --> 00:43:02.234
But let me be very clear here.

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.530
Good international cooperation 
is 

00:43:06.626 --> 00:43:09.699
never going to substitute for 
good domestic policy.  Of 

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.368
course, individual countries 
have the responsibility for the 

00:43:12.369 --> 00:43:14.369
well-being of their citizens.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:18.318
In fact, strong domestic 
policies can form the foundation

00:43:18.319 --> 00:43:20.319
for effective 

00:43:22.015 --> 00:43:23.440
international cooperation, and 
in our modern world there are 

00:43:23.441 --> 00:43:25.441
some issues that 

00:43:26.727 --> 00:43:28.727
can only be addressed through 
international cooperation.

00:43:31.237 --> 00:43:33.304
I want to discuss four such 
issues.  I promise I'll be brief

00:43:33.305 --> 00:43:35.305
on each of the four.

00:43:37.571 --> 00:43:39.571
But I think they are all 
important.

00:43:41.876 --> 00:43:43.876
And to be successful in 
delivering on 

00:43:45.161 --> 00:43:47.427
those four, we will need 
creativity and we will need 

00:43:47.428 --> 00:43:49.428
cooperation.

00:43:51.512 --> 00:43:57.266
Let me start with those, the 
first one.  First one is trade. 

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:59.910
I've been saying for some time 
now that we need to fix the 

00:43:59.911 --> 00:44:02.362
system.  More recently, I've 
been urging 

00:44:06.056 --> 00:44:08.094
countries to actually deescalate
trade tensions and it was 

00:44:08.095 --> 00:44:10.095
encouraging to see over the 
weekend some progress made at 

00:44:17.057 --> 00:44:19.057
the G20 meeting in Buenos Ere 
Aires.

00:44:24.274 --> 00:44:26.274
We must continue the 
deescalation and 

00:44:28.394 --> 00:44:30.394
improving trade for the future.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.520
It means agreement and also 
perfecting 

00:44:35.592 --> 00:44:37.592
intellectual property rights 
without 

00:44:39.492 --> 00:44:41.492
stifling innovation and getting 
rid of economic rents.

00:44:44.388 --> 00:44:47.272
New trade agreements would 
release the potential of  

00:44:47.273 --> 00:44:49.926
e-customers and trade 
in-services.  All of this is 

00:44:49.927 --> 00:44:51.927
critical not for the 

00:44:55.365 --> 00:44:59.749
sake of trade, although Montes
que would argue with me.  He 

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.434
would say where there is trade, 
there is good manners.  He's 

00:45:02.435 --> 00:45:04.435
right.

00:45:06.909 --> 00:45:08.909
Montesque is always right.

00:45:11.634 --> 00:45:13.898
No, it's critical because trade 
gives opportunity and 

00:45:13.899 --> 00:45:15.899
accelerates innovation, and we 
need both.

00:45:18.386 --> 00:45:20.386
Secondly, we need international 
taxation cooperation.

00:45:21.868 --> 00:45:23.923
Companies now have world-wide 
presence.  Even when they're  

00:45:23.924 --> 00:45:25.924
small.

00:45:27.378 --> 00:45:29.208
In the old days, you had to be 
one of those top guns to be 

00:45:29.209 --> 00:45:31.209
international.

00:45:33.556 --> 00:45:35.798
Now, very small companies can be
very international companies, 

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:37.799
but governments 

00:45:41.957 --> 00:45:43.957
have not figured yet a 
world-wide answer to tax.

00:45:45.258 --> 00:45:47.258
And right now, too many tax 
dollars are 

00:45:48.785 --> 00:45:51.424
left on the table, thanks to tax
optimization and the bad kind of

00:45:52.032 --> 00:45:54.032
creativity.

00:45:55.299 --> 00:45:57.299
So countries need to work 
closely 

00:45:58.978 --> 00:46:00.978
together to collect what is 
owed, where 

00:46:04.876 --> 00:46:06.876
it's owed, and avoid a race tax 
to the bottom.

00:46:08.207 --> 00:46:11.111
They can close the loopholes 
that leads to base erosion and 

00:46:11.112 --> 00:46:13.112
profit shifting.

00:46:14.974 --> 00:46:16.974
We are working with our partners
so 

00:46:19.057 --> 00:46:20.885
that they can share best 
practices and revise regulation 

00:46:20.886 --> 00:46:23.384
for a digital economy in which 
many companies have no single 

00:46:26.281 --> 00:46:28.281
established base of operation, 
and yet they do operate.

00:46:29.559 --> 00:46:33.227
Why do we need this?  Why do we 
need revenue?  Because all 

00:46:33.228 --> 00:46:37.731
countries should be investing in
their future.  And public and 

00:46:37.732 --> 00:46:39.732
private funding working 

00:46:41.408 --> 00:46:43.617
together can strengthen 
infrastructure, improve 

00:46:43.618 --> 00:46:45.701
education, and prepare all of us
to adjust to the technical 

00:46:49.534 --> 00:46:53.287
transformations of our 
doorsteps.  When the return on 

00:46:53.288 --> 00:46:57.783
those investments are so far 
away, it's unlikely the private 

00:46:57.784 --> 00:46:59.784
sector alone will actually 
invest.

00:47:00.911 --> 00:47:03.783
My third issue is our climate.  
From the recent major hurricanes

00:47:03.784 --> 00:47:05.784
in 

00:47:06.787 --> 00:47:11.414
the Caribbeans to the wildfires 
in California, so the Pacific, 

00:47:11.415 --> 00:47:15.371
the dangerous effects of climate
change are becoming more 

00:47:15.372 --> 00:47:19.249
tangible by the day.  New U.S. 
government study shows the 

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.250
economic 

00:47:22.379 --> 00:47:24.379
impact from climate change could
reduce 

00:47:25.889 --> 00:47:27.889
America's GDP in the coming 
decades.

00:47:28.937 --> 00:47:30.937
The collaborative agreement in 
Paris 

00:47:32.698 --> 00:47:34.698
in 2015 is probably the best 
toolbox we 

00:47:36.315 --> 00:47:39.034
have to start fixing the 
planetary challenge and move to 

00:47:39.035 --> 00:47:41.035
a zero carbon economy.

00:47:43.733 --> 00:47:45.733
It's also ideas I've tried to 
highlight tonight.

00:47:49.296 --> 00:47:51.930
Creativity, visionary thinking, 
and a commitment to the global 

00:47:51.931 --> 00:47:53.931
good that serves our best 
interests.

00:47:56.837 --> 00:47:58.837
This is for the survival of 
future generations.

00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:02.079
Now I mentioned three issues: 
Trade, tax, climate.

00:48:03.984 --> 00:48:05.984
Each of them is worthy of their 
own Kissinger Lecture.

00:48:06.439 --> 00:48:08.679
But there's one issue that I 
believe is the bedrock for 

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.982
progress nearly everywhere else.
And that is why the fourth and 

00:48:11.983 --> 00:48:13.983
final 

00:48:15.669 --> 00:48:17.669
area I want to discuss is good 

00:48:20.361 --> 00:48:22.217
governance, free from the 
shackles of corruption.

00:48:22.218 --> 00:48:24.240
The simple fact is that without 
confidence in our institutions, 

00:48:24.241 --> 00:48:27.946
none of the change we seek will 
be possible.  So let me focus on

00:48:27.947 --> 00:48:30.847
that briefly.  It's my fourth 
and last key  point.

00:48:34.554 --> 00:48:36.805
Why is corruption so corrosive? 
Because when people start 

00:48:36.806 --> 00:48:38.806
believing 

00:48:40.132 --> 00:48:42.159
the economy no longer works for 
them, society no  longer works 

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.225
for them, they start 
disconnecting from economy and 

00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:49.577
disconnecting from society.  
Corruption stops economy's 

00:48:49.578 --> 00:48:51.578
vitality 

00:48:53.718 --> 00:48:55.718
and siphons off desperately 
needed resources.

00:48:59.852 --> 00:49:01.479
Money diverted from education 
and health habituates inequality

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.480
and limits the possibility of a 
better life.

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:08.570
Do you know the annual cost of 
bribery 

00:49:10.263 --> 00:49:12.488
alone -- and corruption is more 
than just bribery -- but the 

00:49:12.489 --> 00:49:14.489
cost of bribery 

00:49:16.211 --> 00:49:18.211
is estimated to be at $1.5 
trillion.

00:49:20.289 --> 00:49:22.289
That's roughly 2% of global GDP.

00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:25.961
Millennials feel the problem 
acutely.

00:49:28.875 --> 00:49:30.713
A recent survey of global youth 
reveal that young people 

00:49:30.714 --> 00:49:33.154
identify corruption, not jobs, 
not better education, but 

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:37.628
corruption, as the most pressing
concern in their own countries.

00:49:37.629 --> 00:49:41.747
There's wisdom in this insight 
because corruption is the root 

00:49:41.748 --> 00:49:46.225
cause of many of the economic 
injustices that many of these 

00:49:46.226 --> 00:49:48.226
young men and women are facing.

00:49:51.138 --> 00:49:53.138
And that is why, with the 
support of our 

00:49:54.606 --> 00:49:57.036
entire membership, we are going 
to scrutinize anew the impact on

00:49:57.037 --> 00:49:59.037
corruption on a country's 
macroeconomic health.

00:50:02.598 --> 00:50:05.270
So far we've done quite a bit of
work on anti-money laundering 

00:50:05.271 --> 00:50:07.271
and combating terrorism.

00:50:09.162 --> 00:50:12.673
We've done that with 110 of our 
country members.  But it's only 

00:50:12.674 --> 00:50:14.674
a small part of the 

00:50:15.769 --> 00:50:18.833
wider work needed to promote 
good governance.  Investing in 

00:50:18.834 --> 00:50:20.872
institution is indispensable, 
and also to verify that 

00:50:24.578 --> 00:50:26.578
those institutions actually 
deliver.

00:50:29.086 --> 00:50:31.086
Because likewise, corruption 
knows no border.

00:50:35.783 --> 00:50:37.783
Think for a second how

00:50:40.557 --> 00:50:42.557
Sentec is changing the economic 
game.

00:50:45.435 --> 00:50:47.435
New innovations can be used by 
cyber 

00:50:49.059 --> 00:50:51.059
criminals to

00:50:52.337 --> 00:50:54.337
funnel illicit financial flows 
on a worldwide basis.

00:50:57.262 --> 00:50:59.719
This is not one nation's problem
or within one nation's ability 

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.955
to solve.  It needs  
cross-border collaboration.

00:51:02.972 --> 00:51:04.972
But it is fixable.

00:51:08.487 --> 00:51:09.706
The same innovations that create
cross cross-border challenges 

00:51:09.707 --> 00:51:15.264
can also be used to help us 
fight back, through biometrics, 

00:51:15.265 --> 00:51:18.158
block chain, and more.
We can find better ways to build

00:51:18.159 --> 00:51:20.802
a better, safer system for the 
long term.

00:51:24.293 --> 00:51:26.293
Governments can and must work 
with the 

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.458
world's best engineers to build 
stronger cyber security systems 

00:51:30.459 --> 00:51:32.459
to protect 

00:51:33.714 --> 00:51:35.949
people's bank accounts, their 
well-being and even hotel 

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:37.950
bookings.

00:51:39.022 --> 00:51:41.022
This is common good we must 
choose to support.

00:51:43.111 --> 00:51:44.528
If we take -- if we take the 
challenge of corruption as the 

00:51:44.529 --> 00:51:46.529
model of 

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:49.940
cooperation that we can

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:53.264
actually implement, it can be a 
model for the other topics that 

00:51:53.265 --> 00:51:55.265
I've mentioned.

00:51:56.757 --> 00:51:58.757
It can be the sign that the 
brotherhood 

00:52:00.465 --> 00:52:02.911
of man, as Cains called it, is 
ready once again to meet the 

00:52:02.912 --> 00:52:04.912
call of history.

00:52:07.908 --> 00:52:09.908
Except, by the way, at this 
time, women will play a role.

00:52:09.981 --> 00:52:12.227
[Laughter]

00:52:15.234 --> 00:52:17.234
[Applause]

00:52:18.986 --> 00:52:21.834
You should have seen the photo 
of those 

00:52:27.567 --> 00:52:30.620
who created  Brednews in 1944.  
44 men.  Full stop.

00:52:31.031 --> 00:52:33.031
[Laughter]

00:52:34.298 --> 00:52:36.133
So I think it's by doing that we
can start restoring trust, which

00:52:36.134 --> 00:52:38.134
is probably 

00:52:40.399 --> 00:52:41.821
the most precious and most 
in-demand commodity in our 

00:52:41.822 --> 00:52:46.095
society.  This is how we begin 
to adapt once more and reimagine

00:52:46.096 --> 00:52:48.143
that international cooperation 
that we need.

00:52:50.993 --> 00:52:52.993
New, before I conclude, we have 
one more thing to do.

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.819
I began my remarks by mentioning
that December 4th was an 

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.695
important date.  There's one 
person who is not allowed to 

00:53:01.696 --> 00:53:03.696
answer that question.  That's 
Mrs.

00:53:06.621 --> 00:53:09.338
Harmon who is the president of 
the Woodrow Wilson center.

00:53:15.856 --> 00:53:18.707
Because on December 4th, 1918, 
exactly 100 years ago to this 

00:53:18.708 --> 00:53:23.844
day, president Woodrow Wilson 
set sale for France to help 

00:53:23.845 --> 00:53:25.845
negotiate what he hoped would be
a lasting peace.

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:28.530
He became the first U.S.

00:53:30.038 --> 00:53:30.864
-- the first sitting U.S. 
president to travel to Europe.

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:36.970
And in some way, some ways, we 
can trace 

00:53:38.864 --> 00:53:42.148
the origins of modern creativity
and visionary thinking in U.S. 

00:53:42.149 --> 00:53:44.149
foreign policy to this date.

00:53:45.624 --> 00:53:47.624
It's also a humbling reminder 
that our 

00:53:49.293 --> 00:53:51.803
plans do not always work out as 
intended.  But it is also a 

00:53:51.804 --> 00:53:57.153
signal that we must try and try 
and try again.  We must build on

00:53:57.154 --> 00:53:59.154
what worked, change 

00:54:01.678 --> 00:54:04.287
what does not, and continually 
evolve, improve, imagine a 

00:54:04.288 --> 00:54:06.568
better future for all people.  
It was the vision that inspired 

00:54:06.569 --> 00:54:08.569
the 

00:54:09.641 --> 00:54:11.509
leaders of this country, and it 
must be the mission that will 

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:15.199
guide us in the days ahead.
Thank you very much.

00:54:18.418 --> 00:54:20.418
[Applause]

00:54:28.401 --> 00:54:33.572
&gt;&gt;  Thank you, Madam Lagarde.
[Applause]

00:54:36.024 --> 00:54:38.478
&gt;&gt;  Thank you, Madam Lagarde.  
And without further delay, I 

00:54:38.479 --> 00:54:40.929
want to welcome to the stage, 
please join me in 

00:54:44.828 --> 00:54:47.486
welcoming to the stage, Margaret
Brennan, moderator of CBS Face 

00:54:47.487 --> 00:54:49.724
the Nation.
[Applause]

00:54:50.541 --> 00:54:52.541
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  Thanks to 
all of you.

00:54:54.416 --> 00:54:56.416
What a gorgeous venue to have 
this conversation.

00:54:58.103 --> 00:55:00.103
And I'm privileged to have it 
today.

00:55:01.173 --> 00:55:03.173
You know, at your introduction, 
it was 

00:55:04.249 --> 00:55:06.249
pointed out you were named one 
of the 

00:55:08.759 --> 00:55:10.759
third most powerful, I believe, 
between 

00:55:13.897 --> 00:55:15.523
Theresa May and chancellor 
Merkell in terms of the most 

00:55:15.524 --> 00:55:17.524
powerful women.

00:55:19.586 --> 00:55:21.419
I think the correction needs to 
be made you're actually one of 

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.676
the most powerful individuals in
the world through the work 

00:55:24.677 --> 00:55:26.677
you've done to stabilize the 
world economy.

00:55:27.737 --> 00:55:29.797
That's why I think you laying 
out your vision as you have, 

00:55:29.798 --> 00:55:32.651
there's a lot of things we want 
to break apart here.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:36.690
Let's start off with what's 
happening today.

00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:40.382
You're seeing recession fears 
come out once again.  It was a 

00:55:40.383 --> 00:55:42.819
bad day in the market.  There 
are some who looked at what 

00:55:44.759 --> 00:55:47.372
happened at the G20 and said 
there wasn't progress.  You said

00:55:47.373 --> 00:55:52.863
you saw some.  How do you define
some progress.  Where is the 

00:55:52.864 --> 00:55:54.864
hope you're seeing?

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:58.519
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Well, I 
might be 

00:56:00.431 --> 00:56:02.431
a little bit bias because I was 

00:56:03.519 --> 00:56:05.519
attending the G7 leaderring 
meeting in 

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.140
Canada and the

00:56:11.142 --> 00:56:13.142
APEC meeting in paw paw new 
genie.

00:56:16.688 --> 00:56:17.913
And the APAC meeting there was 
no communicatetion.  People 

00:56:17.914 --> 00:56:20.563
could not agree on anything.  So
the fact that leaders agreed on 

00:56:20.564 --> 00:56:22.564
a 

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:27.281
set of  principles, issues, 
points, the 

00:56:29.562 --> 00:56:31.562
fact that there was that, was in
a way reassuring.

00:56:33.845 --> 00:56:35.685
So that's -- not a new 
agreement.  I think it was 

00:56:35.686 --> 00:56:37.926
probably not as strong as some 
expected it, but it really 

00:56:40.368 --> 00:56:42.639
touched on many critical issues.
The language was not exactly 

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.640
according 

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:50.310
to sort of the history of

00:56:53.252 --> 00:56:55.252
communicay drafting.

00:56:56.338 --> 00:56:59.607
There was clearly a consensus 
trade was critically important. 

00:56:59.608 --> 00:57:01.608
Trade had to be conducted 
according to 

00:57:05.762 --> 00:57:07.762
rules set by an institution, the
WTO, 

00:57:08.799 --> 00:57:10.799
that had to be reformed.  There 
was clear agreement on the 

00:57:11.052 --> 00:57:15.160
principles of reform.  How it's 
going to be reformed is another 

00:57:15.161 --> 00:57:17.161
matter and it's not going to 

00:57:18.227 --> 00:57:20.890
take a few weeks but probably 
more months than weeks.

00:57:23.144 --> 00:57:25.144
And there was willingness to 
engage on the part of all.

00:57:30.546 --> 00:57:32.546
And part of the night was not 
such a bad outcome.

00:57:32.796 --> 00:57:34.796
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  You mean 
in the 

00:57:40.006 --> 00:57:42.006
meeting between  Xi Peng and the
president?

00:57:42.052 --> 00:57:43.879
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Yes.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  Is 90 days

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.880
enough 

00:57:47.961 --> 00:57:50.464
to come to an agreement between 
the two largest economies in the

00:57:50.465 --> 00:57:52.100
world?
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  I'm not 

00:57:52.101 --> 00:57:56.218
sure the objective is a trade 
agreement, but at least there's 

00:57:56.219 --> 00:57:58.219
a framework under which they 
agreed to move forward and to 

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.723
address some of the key issues.
You know, I think what's clearly

00:58:03.187 --> 00:58:05.438
important is to come to an 
understanding on both sides.  To

00:58:05.439 --> 00:58:07.439
agree on some key principles.

00:58:10.712 --> 00:58:12.712
To have definitions of what is a

00:58:14.844 --> 00:58:17.694
subsidy, what warrants 
intellectual property right 

00:58:17.695 --> 00:58:19.695
protection, and what is 

00:58:20.971 --> 00:58:22.971
the state on enterprise, and so 
on and so forth.

00:58:23.237 --> 00:58:26.093
So it is complicated and it is 
going to take time.  But the 

00:58:26.094 --> 00:58:28.094
willingness of these two 

00:58:30.634 --> 00:58:33.280
presidents to move forward, and 
to agree to discuss those 

00:58:33.281 --> 00:58:35.281
issues, I think is, compared 
with what we have just gone 

00:58:35.764 --> 00:58:40.101
through, is progress.  Yes.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  And the 

00:58:43.185 --> 00:58:45.639
nervousness we're seeing in the 
markets, you're saying, look, 

00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.670
they're talking.
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Yeah, 

00:58:47.671 --> 00:58:49.671
yeah, yeah.

00:58:51.539 --> 00:58:54.419
We can't just react on a daily 
market variation.  These things 

00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.420
take time.

00:58:57.514 --> 00:58:59.514
Markets get jittery and react 
sort of 

00:59:02.037 --> 00:59:03.894
off the cuff on the news of the 
day, but I think those are, you 

00:59:03.895 --> 00:59:06.381
know, much longer-term issues 
that warrant time, 

00:59:09.656 --> 00:59:12.135
thinking, considerations, and, 
you know, it's also a clear 

00:59:12.136 --> 00:59:14.136
shift that we are 

00:59:15.822 --> 00:59:17.822
seeing and which is being 
acknowledged 

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.320
and will turn into, I hope, some
resolution.

00:59:23.219 --> 00:59:25.250
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  I think it
was, in listening to you sketch 

00:59:25.251 --> 00:59:27.251
out going back 

00:59:28.531 --> 00:59:30.588
to Brettenwood to the president,
I think it's a good reminder to 

00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:32.589
many people that the U.S.

00:59:34.703 --> 00:59:35.910
was part in parcel of creating 
many of these international 

00:59:35.911 --> 00:59:40.432
institutions, because now in our
daily political life, they're 

00:59:40.433 --> 00:59:42.276
described or at least felt or 
perceived by some to be against 

00:59:42.277 --> 00:59:44.277
U.S. interest.

00:59:50.216 --> 00:59:52.137
That is how some of the more 
popularist rhetoric has 

00:59:52.138 --> 00:59:54.138
described institutions like 
yours.

00:59:58.512 --> 01:00:00.512
Today, Mike Pompeyo listed what 
he felt 

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:06.927
were all the flaws of 
international or organizations 

01:00:06.928 --> 01:00:08.928
and even the IMF failed 

01:00:10.186 --> 01:00:12.186
to live up to what it was meant 
to do, 

01:00:13.447 --> 01:00:15.472
which was rebuild Europe.  That 
these measures are actually 

01:00:17.337 --> 01:00:20.186
hurting the world, not helping 
it.  What do you make of his 

01:00:20.187 --> 01:00:21.611
speech?
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  First of 

01:00:21.612 --> 01:00:23.612
all, I 

01:00:25.077 --> 01:00:29.980
did not read his entire speech. 
Bits and pieces were picked up. 

01:00:29.981 --> 01:00:31.981
I will very carefully read his 
speech.

01:00:33.885 --> 01:00:35.885
I've heard this austerity 
comment made in many instances.

01:00:40.616 --> 01:00:42.616
When we are called upon to help 
a 

01:00:44.898 --> 01:00:47.594
country that is in very dear 
financial difficulty, we have to

01:00:47.595 --> 01:00:49.595
restore stability.

01:00:50.653 --> 01:00:52.653
We have to restore public 
finance discipline discipline.

01:00:59.595 --> 01:01:01.856
We have to empower the 
authorities with financing.  

01:01:01.857 --> 01:01:03.857
That's one thing we do.

01:01:08.246 --> 01:01:10.246
But we are also an instrument of
macroeconomic sanity.

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:14.206
If we're called upon to act, 
because there was mismanagement,

01:01:14.207 --> 01:01:16.207
there was poor 

01:01:17.895 --> 01:01:20.578
public finance organizations, 
there was poor monetary policy, 

01:01:20.579 --> 01:01:24.465
for multiple reasons, the 
situation was not in order.  And

01:01:24.466 --> 01:01:26.466
we're trying not to bring 

01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:30.170
austerity, but to bring order.  
So that's number one.

01:01:32.656 --> 01:01:35.084
Number two, if we did not come 
in to help, the situation would 

01:01:35.085 --> 01:01:37.332
be even worse.  Because what 
happens is when a country 

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:44.510
calls for help, we come in, we 
do expect 

01:01:45.715 --> 01:01:47.715
that public finances will be, 
you know, redisciplined, 

01:01:50.103 --> 01:01:52.953
reorganized, and that stability 
will result, at which point 

01:01:52.954 --> 01:01:54.954
investors come in 

01:01:56.902 --> 01:01:58.950
and say, okay, now the situation
is standardized.  We can come 

01:01:58.951 --> 01:02:00.951
back and we can invest.

01:02:02.234 --> 01:02:03.856
If we did not do that, they 
simply would not come in at that

01:02:03.857 --> 01:02:05.857
point.

01:02:07.741 --> 01:02:09.741
So I think it's -- we're not the

01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:13.450
merchant of austerity, per se.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.600
We are merchant of trust in the 

01:02:18.063 --> 01:02:20.934
stability of a system that is 
needed in order to attract 

01:02:20.935 --> 01:02:22.935
investors, generate 

01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:26.239
growth, and, you know, entail 
creation of jobs.

01:02:28.727 --> 01:02:31.169
We are the enablers of that.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  You called

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:36.661
out for a kind of collaborative 
leadership.  Particularly from 

01:02:36.662 --> 01:02:39.333
the United States.
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Because 

01:02:39.334 --> 01:02:42.428
that is what has worked.  When I
look back and consider the 

01:02:46.125 --> 01:02:48.125
history of the United States' 
role, its 

01:02:50.425 --> 01:02:52.666
involvement, what has worked, 
how it has worked for this 

01:02:52.667 --> 01:02:54.497
country and others, that 
collaboration has proven 

01:02:54.498 --> 01:02:57.578
extremely efficient.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  Well, the 

01:02:58.792 --> 01:03:01.028
secretary of state today said 
the administration is working to

01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:03.029
refocus the 

01:03:06.187 --> 01:03:08.458
IMF, and WTO, to promote more 
prosperity, into nations that 

01:03:08.459 --> 01:03:10.459
can 

01:03:12.332 --> 01:03:14.823
already access global capital 
markets, and to banks that could

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:18.335
raise capital on their own.  
That's his vision that he 

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:21.048
describes what the U.S. should 
be implementing right now.

01:03:23.495 --> 01:03:25.495
What do you make of that 
proposal?

01:03:30.058 --> 01:03:32.508
It was delivered in  Brussells 
and it ruffled a few feathers.

01:03:33.319 --> 01:03:36.383
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Making 
sure that capital can invest, 

01:03:36.384 --> 01:03:38.384
that's exactly what we do.

01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:41.096
It's because private capital has
completely lost interest in 

01:03:41.097 --> 01:03:43.097
certain countries.

01:03:44.959 --> 01:03:47.210
When I look at the three I 
mentioned: Egypt, Ukraine, 

01:03:47.211 --> 01:03:49.879
Argentina.  Why did they come 
in?  Nobody else wanted to come 

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:53.800
in.  There was not a single 
investor prepared to take the 

01:03:53.801 --> 01:03:55.801
risk of going in 

01:03:57.265 --> 01:03:59.265
because the situation was in 
disorder, 

01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:01.781
public finance was not properly 
managed, and there was internal 

01:04:01.782 --> 01:04:03.782
factors that created massive 
instability.

01:04:05.465 --> 01:04:06.699
So we come in and enable the 
country to become attractive 

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:09.594
again.  It's not as if we were a
substitute to 

01:04:13.878 --> 01:04:15.878
private sector investors, 
investment.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.760
We are the facilitators of that 
investment.

01:04:21.253 --> 01:04:25.119
Otherwise, they simply won't 
come.  Too risky for them.  Once

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.120
they know we're involved, they 

01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:30.680
know we put in place 
sustainability.  If 

01:04:30.681 --> 01:04:33.965
restructuring is needed, we ask 
for it.  If new monetary policy 

01:04:33.966 --> 01:04:35.966
needs to be 

01:04:38.278 --> 01:04:40.278
implemented, we recommend it, 
and it's 

01:04:41.741 --> 01:04:43.741
implemented, with some success, 
I dare say.

01:04:44.205 --> 01:04:47.059
I'm not sure he understands very
clearly what is -- what is -- 

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.060
well, our mission is prosperity.
Yes.

01:04:52.591 --> 01:04:53.816
This is what the initial 
founders actually tasked us to 

01:04:53.817 --> 01:04:56.685
do.  That's what we need to do.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  So these 

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:01.202
descriptions of the vision and 
the leadership that America is 

01:05:01.203 --> 01:05:03.203
providing on 

01:05:05.091 --> 01:05:07.091
this front, for you it is not 
achieving 

01:05:10.441 --> 01:05:11.673
what you were saying is needed, 
to meet the crises right now 

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:12.919
that you see?
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  I was 

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.920
curious 

01:05:16.163 --> 01:05:18.186
about the  taxpayers' money.  
We've actually always paid back 

01:05:18.187 --> 01:05:22.293
and more.  So over the course of
time, the United States has 

01:05:22.294 --> 01:05:24.294
actually made quite a bit of 

01:05:25.556 --> 01:05:27.590
money out of the IMF involvement
in countries.

01:05:28.196 --> 01:05:30.196
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  You think 
there's 

01:05:31.258 --> 01:05:33.258
a fundamental misunderstanding 
or are 

01:05:34.739 --> 01:05:36.813
there portions of truth to these
criticisms?

01:05:37.635 --> 01:05:39.256
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Well the 
fact that growth must be 

01:05:39.257 --> 01:05:41.257
generated as a 

01:05:42.712 --> 01:05:43.760
result of our involvement is 
something I  completely agree 

01:05:43.761 --> 01:05:46.404
with.  It doesn't come overnight
because you 

01:05:49.485 --> 01:05:51.730
need to restore the situation 
and start public finance and 

01:05:51.731 --> 01:05:53.731
reorganize sometimes 

01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:57.436
through structural reforms of 
the economy, but growth 

01:05:57.437 --> 01:05:59.437
ultimately comes.
I'll tell you.

01:06:01.318 --> 01:06:03.579
As French finance minister we 
had to deal with some difficult 

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.580
cases in Europe.

01:06:07.191 --> 01:06:09.238
But when I look at a country 
like port gal, the involvement 

01:06:09.239 --> 01:06:13.784
of the IMF was critical in 
turning the situation around, 

01:06:13.785 --> 01:06:15.785
sorting out quite a few 
difficult issues.

01:06:17.886 --> 01:06:19.706
Portugal is now doing pretty 
well compared with other 

01:06:19.707 --> 01:06:21.707
European countries.

01:06:24.217 --> 01:06:25.205
When I look at Ireland, it's 
thriving.

01:06:25.206 --> 01:06:27.429
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  Those are 
countries that needed help in 

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:29.468
crises?
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  We had to

01:06:29.469 --> 01:06:32.957
come in with the IMF and put in 
place significant lending 

01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:34.958
programs and we 

01:06:36.037 --> 01:06:37.661
expected serious measures to be 
taken on the fiscal front, 

01:06:37.662 --> 01:06:40.328
because there was too much 
fiscal deficit, and in the case 

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:42.329
of Ireland because the banking 
system was 

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:47.078
completely out of control, and 
had gone way too far into 

01:06:47.079 --> 01:06:49.079
extending beyond the country.

01:06:50.535 --> 01:06:53.199
So this -- these programs have 
clearly generated a growth.

01:06:55.247 --> 01:06:56.664
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  When you 
use that phrase, you know, 

01:06:56.665 --> 01:06:58.665
describing we could 

01:07:00.406 --> 01:07:02.663
live in an age of anger, putting
a time line out decades from 

01:07:02.664 --> 01:07:04.664
now, if you look 

01:07:06.531 --> 01:07:08.359
at some of the forces, not just 
in the United States, but 

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:11.009
contributed to making trade a 
very contentious issue during 

01:07:13.472 --> 01:07:15.307
the 2016 campaign on the left 
and on the right, but also what 

01:07:15.308 --> 01:07:17.308
you're seeing in 

01:07:18.614 --> 01:07:20.434
Europe, in your home country of 
France right now protests around

01:07:20.435 --> 01:07:22.715
the economy, and specifically 
the gas tax.

01:07:26.815 --> 01:07:28.236
I won't get into president  
trump's tweet about it tonight.

01:07:28.237 --> 01:07:31.963
But generally speaking, aren't 
you seeing those forces of 

01:07:31.964 --> 01:07:33.964
anger?

01:07:36.263 --> 01:07:38.713
I mean you're seeing more 
populist governments come to 

01:07:38.714 --> 01:07:40.714
power, or at least 

01:07:41.978 --> 01:07:43.615
with the economy, 
anti-multilateral institutional 

01:07:43.616 --> 01:07:45.239
rhetoric, in a lot of places 
right now.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.291
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Yeah.  
That is correct.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:50.314
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  Are we in 
that time you're describing?

01:07:51.694 --> 01:07:53.694
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  We are at
risk of 

01:07:55.408 --> 01:07:58.276
slipping into that kind of age 
of anger, which is why it's 

01:07:58.277 --> 01:08:02.539
critically important to actually
address those issues.  As I was 

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:07.833
trying to explain in my remarks,
those are not issues that can be

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:09.834
addressed purely domestically.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.938
Some of them have to be 
addressed domestically, but when

01:08:12.939 --> 01:08:14.939
it comes to 

01:08:16.882 --> 01:08:18.914
trade, to tax, to climate 
change, to cyber security, to 

01:08:18.915 --> 01:08:20.915
corruption, it has to 

01:08:23.396 --> 01:08:25.644
be on an international 
cooperation basis, as well.  

01:08:25.645 --> 01:08:28.348
They come together.  But yes.  
There has to be a response to 

01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:30.349
those 

01:08:32.459 --> 01:08:35.315
issues, because many people are 
not satisfied with the income, 

01:08:35.316 --> 01:08:41.040
not satisfied with their future,
have this anxiety of what the 

01:08:41.041 --> 01:08:43.041
future holds for their children,
and all these concerns need to 

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:45.703
be addressed.

01:08:46.742 --> 01:08:48.987
And need to be addressed by 
societies at large.

01:08:53.155 --> 01:08:56.641
&gt;&gt;  Margaret: The challenge is 
the lack of trust in the 

01:08:56.642 --> 01:08:58.642
institutions that have been 
tasked with this.

01:08:58.712 --> 01:09:00.761
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Yes.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  You 

01:09:00.762 --> 01:09:05.484
mentioned your time as minister 
of finance in France.  Clearly, 

01:09:05.485 --> 01:09:07.485
one of the difficult time 
periods you could have that job.

01:09:11.222 --> 01:09:13.222
I remember from covering it that
same 

01:09:15.511 --> 01:09:17.574
famous story of you speaking to 
frank Paulson and advising him 

01:09:17.575 --> 01:09:19.575
against 

01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:23.070
allowing Lehman brothers go 
under.

01:09:25.364 --> 01:09:28.625
You foresaw the domino effect.
Did you draw a line between what

01:09:28.626 --> 01:09:33.355
you predicted then and where we 
are now?  Is that where this 

01:09:33.356 --> 01:09:35.356
shift began that you're laying 
out?

01:09:36.045 --> 01:09:37.484
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  I 
certainly did not anticipate 

01:09:37.485 --> 01:09:41.996
that at the time.  But looking 
back, yes, I think that there's 

01:09:41.997 --> 01:09:43.997
a lot in today's anger, 

01:09:45.467 --> 01:09:47.467
resentment, frustration, that is

01:09:49.567 --> 01:09:51.567
actually attributable to the 
legacy of the crisis.

01:09:52.846 --> 01:09:54.683
I think that we did a reasonably
good job in trying to strengthen

01:09:54.684 --> 01:09:59.376
the financial  system, avoid 
that people actually lose all 

01:09:59.377 --> 01:10:02.017
their savings, and that they be 
bankrupt all over those 

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:05.860
countries.

01:10:07.944 --> 01:10:10.396
But I think the fact that we 
addressed the issues of 

01:10:10.397 --> 01:10:13.064
institutions of the financial 
system at large, without doing 

01:10:14.484 --> 01:10:16.484
probably enough explanation as 
what it 

01:10:21.017 --> 01:10:23.017
meant for people, and the fact 
that many 

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:28.750
involved in those -- in those 
financial 

01:10:31.652 --> 01:10:32.693
deals got away with it and 
managed to reestablish 

01:10:32.694 --> 01:10:37.402
themselves, I think created a 
sense of impunity.  In other 

01:10:37.403 --> 01:10:39.403
words, some of the lower 
middle-class people thinking to 

01:10:41.213 --> 01:10:44.474
themselves, "Okay, I've lost my 
job.  I've lost my house.  And 

01:10:44.475 --> 01:10:48.149
those people, what have they  
lost?  Their bonus?  Yeah.  But 

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:50.581
that's about it."
And they reestablished 

01:10:50.582 --> 01:10:52.582
themselves.

01:10:54.094 --> 01:10:56.538
So I think this is not at the 
root of and the only component 

01:10:56.539 --> 01:10:59.204
of the frustration and the anger
that we see, 

01:11:03.131 --> 01:11:06.589
but it's certainly participating
and fueling it.  That's what I 

01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:10.266
call the sort of untold story of
the legacy of the crisis.

01:11:11.294 --> 01:11:13.294
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  So how do 
you address that?

01:11:14.361 --> 01:11:15.581
If that age of anger is 
simmering?

01:11:15.582 --> 01:11:17.599
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  I think, 
you know, in a way it's too late

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.600
to go back 

01:11:20.848 --> 01:11:23.089
to things that should have taken
place at that time, but we also 

01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:27.864
have the possibility with new 
technologies, digital age, that 

01:11:27.865 --> 01:11:29.865
is clearly in the 

01:11:31.515 --> 01:11:33.515
making at the moment, and at an 

01:11:34.785 --> 01:11:37.027
accelerated pace, to organize it
in such a way it's transparent 

01:11:37.028 --> 01:11:39.028
and accountable 

01:11:40.488 --> 01:11:42.488
and it includes people, that 
they're 

01:11:43.744 --> 01:11:46.240
plugged into that digital 
picture by being properly 

01:11:46.241 --> 01:11:48.241
trained, educated, and 

01:11:49.497 --> 01:11:51.130
skilled, and they don't feel 
there's emass collation that you

01:11:51.131 --> 01:11:53.131
have when 

01:11:56.668 --> 01:11:58.088
something is so out of it to you
and foreign to you that you feel

01:11:58.089 --> 01:12:00.553
that anger about it.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  You want 

01:12:00.554 --> 01:12:02.554
another 

01:12:06.261 --> 01:12:09.506
Bretten woods type summit.
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  There are

01:12:09.507 --> 01:12:11.507
so many 

01:12:13.596 --> 01:12:15.596
groups who want another 
Brettenwood?

01:12:16.043 --> 01:12:17.685
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  Who leads 
this?

01:12:17.686 --> 01:12:20.737
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Multiple 
leaders everywhere.  They don't 

01:12:20.738 --> 01:12:23.618
have to give advice and draft 
the programs and provide 

01:12:23.619 --> 01:12:28.337
technical assistance around the 
world to 189 countries.  But, 

01:12:28.338 --> 01:12:30.168
you know, the beauty of the 
institution that I have the 

01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:32.169
privilege to 

01:12:34.688 --> 01:12:36.688
lead is that in its articles, in
its 

01:12:39.179 --> 01:12:41.179
foundations, are the seeds for 
constant transformation.

01:12:43.725 --> 01:12:45.725
What is changing massively 
around it 

01:12:48.183 --> 01:12:50.443
calls for probably a different 
approach.  I think the digital 

01:12:50.444 --> 01:12:52.444
economy in which 

01:12:53.678 --> 01:12:55.678
we are moving, which is 
transforming the 

01:12:57.348 --> 01:12:59.348
financial sector, which is 
transforming 

01:13:01.813 --> 01:13:03.813
the existing relationship 
between value 

01:13:06.691 --> 01:13:09.409
and monetary costs, all that 
needs new thinking.  I think 

01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:11.410
it's more new thinking than a 

01:13:14.526 --> 01:13:16.526
reform of the Brettenwood 
system.

01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:19.019
&gt;&gt;  I know the IMF has written 
on this and talked about the 

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:23.527
demand for cash.  And money 
itself is changing.  Not just 

01:13:23.528 --> 01:13:25.528
how we think and talk about 
this.

01:13:27.869 --> 01:13:29.327
You mentioned Sintec in that 
context, financial technologies,

01:13:29.328 --> 01:13:31.821
and all the various forms of  
it.

01:13:36.991 --> 01:13:39.647
I mean there are advantages and 
disadvantages, these days it 

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:43.540
seems to be not very well 
understood, even by the public 

01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:48.659
at large.  How much more of this
needs to be led not by the IMF 

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:51.301
or these organizations but 
coming from the corporate world,

01:13:53.546 --> 01:13:55.546
coming from silicon valley.

01:13:57.233 --> 01:13:59.665
You have these hearings on 
capitol hill and the joke is you

01:13:59.666 --> 01:14:04.362
have CFO's coming up and the 
individuals asking them don't 

01:14:04.363 --> 01:14:05.396
even know how to use the 
websites that they're talking 

01:14:05.397 --> 01:14:10.748
about.  How do you regulate 
crypto currencies.  How do you 

01:14:10.749 --> 01:14:13.451
talk about all of this in a way 
that actually leads to some kind

01:14:13.452 --> 01:14:16.560
of regulation or reform?
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Well, 

01:14:16.561 --> 01:14:19.237
first of all, I don't think it 
should be entirely 

01:14:23.312 --> 01:14:25.741
left in the lands of hands of 
those corporate sector 

01:14:25.742 --> 01:14:27.742
representatives or 

01:14:30.063 --> 01:14:32.063
their legal departments, because
they're 

01:14:33.967 --> 01:14:35.213
dealing with common good and 
your privacy and their data and 

01:14:35.214 --> 01:14:37.214
they're 

01:14:38.559 --> 01:14:40.559
dealing with your freedom.

01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:45.122
So governmental authorities, 
parliamentarians, have to be 

01:14:45.123 --> 01:14:47.174
involved.  And they have to be 
helped along the 

01:14:50.341 --> 01:14:51.961
way for those who are not 
computer literate, those who 

01:14:51.962 --> 01:14:53.962
feel completely 

01:14:57.185 --> 01:14:59.411
alien to these digital  
transformations, they have to be

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:01.412
helped by people like 

01:15:02.515 --> 01:15:04.515
us, at IMF, with financial 
technologies, 

01:15:06.139 --> 01:15:08.611
because we try to grasp what it 
means, how it is formed, how 

01:15:08.612 --> 01:15:10.612
those technologies 

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.880
are used to shorten the 
circuits, to 

01:15:15.545 --> 01:15:17.545
enable payments, and to include 
people 

01:15:19.838 --> 01:15:21.080
that we're were not included in 
the banking sector, for 

01:15:21.081 --> 01:15:23.734
instance.
So it is a public 

01:15:23.735 --> 01:15:29.268
responsibility.  And it has to 
be done, again, in cooperation 

01:15:29.269 --> 01:15:30.087
with those engineers, in 
cooperation with those who 

01:15:30.088 --> 01:15:35.782
understand the future of data 
protection, who understand, you 

01:15:35.783 --> 01:15:37.783
know, how Cloud will 

01:15:40.405 --> 01:15:42.405
eventually, you know, be 
antibioticsible

01:15:44.353 --> 01:15:46.353
accessible or hackable.

01:15:47.817 --> 01:15:50.670
So there are many technologies 
that you don't master and I 

01:15:50.671 --> 01:15:52.671
don't, either, but 

01:15:54.347 --> 01:15:56.347
having enough knowledge to 
understand 

01:15:57.835 --> 01:15:59.835
the key principles that need to 
be 

01:16:01.761 --> 01:16:03.204
respected, it's on the shoulders
of the parliamenttarians and the

01:16:03.205 --> 01:16:05.911
governments because they today 
have the responsibility to 

01:16:05.912 --> 01:16:07.767
represent the people.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  You've 

01:16:07.768 --> 01:16:12.294
also answered the call for a lot
of parliamenttarians to get rid 

01:16:12.295 --> 01:16:14.295
of the 

01:16:15.349 --> 01:16:18.422
legal obstacles to the inclusion
of women in the economy.  Where 

01:16:18.423 --> 01:16:20.262
does that begin?
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Very 

01:16:20.263 --> 01:16:22.263
often it begins at home.

01:16:24.782 --> 01:16:26.782
About 90% of the countries in 
the 

01:16:28.076 --> 01:16:29.544
institution still have in their 
constitution or in the legal 

01:16:29.545 --> 01:16:31.545
system 

01:16:34.087 --> 01:16:36.134
discrimination against  women, 
barriers to their participation 

01:16:36.135 --> 01:16:38.135
in the economy, 

01:16:39.542 --> 01:16:41.542
to in inheritance

01:16:44.194 --> 01:16:46.036
when parents die, to owning a 
business, to their opening a 

01:16:46.037 --> 01:16:48.037
bank account, so 

01:16:51.354 --> 01:16:54.205
being able to bring calculates 
when they try to have a loan.  I

01:16:54.206 --> 01:16:56.665
think that's where the work has 
to begin.  We've demonstrated or

01:16:56.666 --> 01:16:58.666
observed in many 

01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:02.169
countries, such as some Latin 
America 

01:17:03.463 --> 01:17:05.522
countries like Peru and some 
African countries, as well, that

01:17:05.523 --> 01:17:07.523
when those 

01:17:08.974 --> 01:17:10.801
changes happen, it actually has 
consequences on the economy and 

01:17:10.802 --> 01:17:16.297
pushes growth and enables women 
to become better integrated into

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:18.298
the economy.  But it's not only 
that.

01:17:20.766 --> 01:17:21.980
It begins there because there 
should not be legal barriers and

01:17:21.981 --> 01:17:23.981
legal 

01:17:27.123 --> 01:17:28.146
constraints imposed by 
governments that prevent women 

01:17:28.147 --> 01:17:30.147
from playing their role in the 
economy.

01:17:31.217 --> 01:17:33.217
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  How much 
of an economic benefit is there?

01:17:33.871 --> 01:17:35.292
How do you quantify?
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Huge.  

01:17:35.293 --> 01:17:37.293
It's huge.  It varies.

01:17:39.364 --> 01:17:41.364
If you look at the Nordic 
countries, 

01:17:42.834 --> 01:17:44.834
you know, norway being clearly 
one of 

01:17:46.732 --> 01:17:48.732
the best performers, finland 
being very good, as well.

01:17:51.006 --> 01:17:53.869
From those countries, to say, 
India or Saudi Arabia, you can 

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:55.870
have an increase 

01:17:57.549 --> 01:17:59.392
in the economy which varies from
3% to 27%.  That's nothing to be

01:17:59.393 --> 01:18:01.851
turning your eyes away.  It's 
pretty big.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.165
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  Why the 
resistance?

01:18:05.166 --> 01:18:06.403
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  Ha.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  If you can

01:18:06.404 --> 01:18:08.404
make 

01:18:11.246 --> 01:18:11.740
the argument on  numbers, why 
the resistance?

01:18:11.741 --> 01:18:14.665
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  I think 
you're talking about something 

01:18:14.666 --> 01:18:18.975
that goes much, much deeper into
culture, into psyche, into the 

01:18:18.976 --> 01:18:22.854
way in which societies have been
built over the course of time.  

01:18:22.855 --> 01:18:24.855
You are also talking about the 
divide 

01:18:26.745 --> 01:18:30.261
between urban centers and rural 
areas.  You know?  India is a 

01:18:30.262 --> 01:18:32.262
case in point where clearly 

01:18:35.973 --> 01:18:37.973
in rural areas, in particular, 
women are 

01:18:40.054 --> 01:18:42.092
prevented from joining the flow,
from being economic partners, 

01:18:42.093 --> 01:18:44.093
and sometimes 

01:18:45.378 --> 01:18:47.839
from accessing sanitation.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  Bigger 

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.336
picture, because we're running 
out of time, I'd 

01:18:54.353 --> 01:18:56.353
be remiss if I didn't ask you

01:18:57.582 --> 01:18:59.214
about Brexit, and the forces 
sort of pulling at the global 

01:18:59.215 --> 01:19:01.215
order right now.

01:19:03.582 --> 01:19:06.150
That's a rejection of 
international organizations and 

01:19:06.151 --> 01:19:09.038
solidarity there.  Add that in 
to what you're seeing here in 

01:19:09.039 --> 01:19:12.331
the U.S., as well, in terms of 
that kind of rejection.

01:19:15.811 --> 01:19:16.840
It sounds like you're trying to 
swim upstream.

01:19:16.841 --> 01:19:19.282
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  One, 
first of all, I think the 

01:19:19.283 --> 01:19:24.390
situation has changed.  And is 
changing in the US.  When I look

01:19:24.391 --> 01:19:26.391
at the latest poll 

01:19:28.308 --> 01:19:32.417
produced, the shift is now into 
a majority of those polled.

01:19:35.262 --> 01:19:37.262
You can term polls in which ever
way you 

01:19:39.567 --> 01:19:41.664
want, but it seems there are 
more Brits who would rather 

01:19:41.665 --> 01:19:43.665
remain than exit.  Number one.

01:19:46.802 --> 01:19:48.706
Number two, I think a lot of the
campaign that took place at the 

01:19:48.707 --> 01:19:50.707
time, 

01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:56.669
two years ago now, was geared 
towards, "Watch out.

01:19:58.744 --> 01:20:00.744
The foreigners are going to take
your 

01:20:02.029 --> 01:20:04.274
meal away, and they're going to 
have -- they're going to go 

01:20:04.275 --> 01:20:06.507
first in the health benefit and 
health care system and 

01:20:09.556 --> 01:20:11.556
they're going to take jobs," and
it was 

01:20:13.829 --> 01:20:15.864
the fear of the foreigners.  And
unfortunately from within 

01:20:15.865 --> 01:20:17.865
Europe.

01:20:20.551 --> 01:20:23.408
And it was directed at people 
from Poland, Bulgaria and 

01:20:23.409 --> 01:20:25.438
Romania, who, by the way, have 
been extremely well 

01:20:29.315 --> 01:20:31.358
integrated  in, say, the German 
economy, as was demonstrated 

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:34.451
recently, in a country that 
needed additional skilled labor.

01:20:34.452 --> 01:20:37.144
So that fear factor that was 
raised 

01:20:40.827 --> 01:20:42.827
during the campaign may have 
completely 

01:20:43.893 --> 01:20:46.138
missed the opportunity that that
particular flow of migration 

01:20:46.139 --> 01:20:48.139
actually 

01:20:49.597 --> 01:20:51.597
produced in an economy nextdoor,
which was Germany.

01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:57.390
So that's a little bit beside 
the point.

01:21:00.347 --> 01:21:02.347
But I think there is regret in 
many, many European corners.

01:21:04.664 --> 01:21:06.759
I think there is more regret in 
the UK than there were only six 

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.760
months ago.

01:21:11.324 --> 01:21:13.783
And I think there is now the 
realization that there will be 

01:21:13.784 --> 01:21:15.784
more loss 

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.080
as a result of Brexit than was 
ever 

01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:22.267
mentioned, described, accounted 
for, by those who campaigned for

01:21:22.268 --> 01:21:24.268
the  Brexit.

01:21:27.397 --> 01:21:29.397
I can say that with relative 
confidence, 

01:21:30.471 --> 01:21:32.471
because when we produced the 
article 4 

01:21:33.541 --> 01:21:35.541
for the UK, which was the annual
audit 

01:21:37.195 --> 01:21:39.195
we do of all economies, we did 
actually 

01:21:40.303 --> 01:21:42.303
give -- we did give at the time 
three scenarios of Brexit.

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:46.634
One of which was the baseline 
which was pretty much in line 

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:51.125
with what everybody assumed, but
another one which was a dark 

01:21:51.126 --> 01:21:53.359
scenario which is very close to 
some of the numbers we're seeing

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.994
now.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  The dark 

01:21:54.995 --> 01:21:57.247
scenario?
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  In terms 

01:21:57.248 --> 01:22:02.146
of forecast coming up in case of
a Brexit development and in case

01:22:02.147 --> 01:22:04.147
of a no-deal 

01:22:05.235 --> 01:22:07.235
Brexit, which is what we had 
considered.

01:22:07.273 --> 01:22:09.936
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  Is that a 
warning to brace ourselves?

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.794
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  I think 
it was a very clear, you know, 

01:22:12.795 --> 01:22:14.795
assessment of what 

01:22:16.269 --> 01:22:18.114
the consequences would be as a 
result of a  no-deal Brexit 

01:22:18.115 --> 01:22:20.115
scenario, where the 

01:22:21.634 --> 01:22:23.659
terms of trade between the UK 
and its main economic and trade 

01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:25.660
partner, which 

01:22:28.358 --> 01:22:30.358
is the European union, would be 
done 

01:22:33.483 --> 01:22:34.709
under the WTO rules with no 
additional sweetener to WTO 

01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:37.781
rules.
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  The dark 

01:22:37.782 --> 01:22:41.476
scenario is a scary phrase to 
end on, but unfortunately I'm 

01:22:41.477 --> 01:22:43.728
told that we are --
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  No, there

01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:45.729
was 

01:22:47.943 --> 01:22:49.943
something interesting today,

01:22:51.694 --> 01:22:53.694
.  For those like me who would 
like to 

01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:57.682
keep the UK within the European 
union there is a perfectly 

01:22:57.683 --> 01:23:02.994
acceptable and legal way to 
revoke the article 50, which was

01:23:02.995 --> 01:23:05.028
the provision under which the UK
pulled out.

01:23:09.102 --> 01:23:10.740
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  You think 
it's a viable scenario?

01:23:10.741 --> 01:23:12.741
&gt;&gt; CHRISTINE LAGARDE:  At least 
it's legal.

01:23:12.786 --> 01:23:14.023
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; MARGARET BRENNAN:  I think 

01:23:14.024 --> 01:23:16.024
this is 

01:23:21.376 --> 01:23:22.829
the optimist you destroyed 
yourself described yourself 

01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:27.369
before.  I'm sure a number of 
people would like to continue 

01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:29.370
that conversation with you 

01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:33.321
offline, but I know we have to 
finish.  Thank you, madam 

01:23:33.322 --> 01:23:35.322
Christine Lagarde.
And thanks to all of you.

01:23:35.585 --> 01:23:37.836
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;  Well, the next move is up 

01:23:37.837 --> 01:23:39.837
the stairs 

01:23:41.452 --> 01:23:43.452
to your left, and dinner will be
served 

01:23:45.385 --> 01:23:47.385
and you'll get your table 
assignments up there.
