00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.792
 In the spa town of Buxton 

00:00:01.792 --> 00:00:03.166
 in Darbryshire, England 

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:06.001
there is a beautiful blue lagoon 

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.208
 it looks like a great place to go swimming 

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.458
 but you might want to read the signs first 

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:17.083
 The blue lagoon of Buxton 

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.834
 looks like something that was plucked out of the Caribbean 

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:22.500
 and dropped into the English countryside 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.291
 it’s in an old limestone quarry 

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.917
 that’s been left abandoned 

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:31.667
it’s filled in with this magical azure colored water 

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:33.709
 people love to go swimming there 

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:35.375
 they take little boats there 

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.083
 you can see youtube videos of people doing flips 

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:39.041
  and jumping into the blue lagoon of Buxton 

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:43.959
 there’s some things you should know about the blue lagoon 

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:45.667
 before you get into it 

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:49.458
 One sign reads

00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:52.750
 Warning! Polluted Water. Water is known to contain 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.291
 Car wrecks, rubbish, dead animals, excrement 

00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:59.001
 Dangerous to swim in due to high pH levels 

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.583
 this can cause skin and eye irritation 

00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:04.625
 fungal infections, thrush, it can cause thrush 

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.625
 general grossness 

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:11.583
 Think! Would you swim in ammonia or bleach? 

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:13.583
 and I’m going to guess the answer is probably not 

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:17.208
 so the water is not as beautiful and crystalline and pure 

00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:19.667
 as it might appear on first glance 

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:23.667
 but people go swimming there every summer 

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.001
 without fail 

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.917
 this really started to irritate the locals of Buxton 

00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:32.250
 which is in and of itself a small quaint spa town 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.667
 so it probably rubbed them the wrong way 

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:36.458
 that people weren’t going to the spas 

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:39.542
 but were going to swim in an abandoned limestone quarry 

00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:41.083
 that was filled with garbage 

00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:43.208
and as they kept telling people 

00:01:43.208 --> 00:01:47.625
the blue lagoon of Buxton has a pH level of 11.2 

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:50.291
 ammonia has a pH level of 11.3 

00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:53.208
these are super alkaline substances 

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:55.000
 it’s like diluted bleach 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.875
 bleach has an alkaline level of only 12.6 

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:00.875
 which isn’t a lot higher on the scale when you consider that 

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:03.667
 normal water is at a level 7 

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:05.875
 so the townspeople talked about various solutions 

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:07.667
 draining it wasn’t really an option 

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:10.208
 because it constantly refills with rain water 

00:02:10.208 --> 00:02:12.375
 they also talked about filling it in 

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:15.583
 but the cost and the effort was just prohibitive 

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:18.750
 so they came up with a more novel solution 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.875
 they dyed the lagoon black 

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.959
and in fact, it worked 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.166
 according to locals people stopped coming to swim in the lagoon 

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:33.250
 instead of looking like this beautiful little island paradise 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.458
 it looked like a cesspool 

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:39.875
 it looked like a pit of doom and despair 

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:41.959
which is exactly what they wanted it to look like 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.792
 so it was kind of a genius plan 

00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:47.083
 but there is one problem, they did this in 2013 

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.500
 as of right now 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.959
 the lagoon has gone back to it’s original beautiful blue color 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.250
and it’s only a matter of time 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.125
 before the families and the tourists 

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:03.667
start flocking to take a swim in the blue lagoon of Buxton 

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:06.208

00:03:06.208 --> 00:03:14.917
 and watch more videos here 

00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:17.667
 I think that there is something else going on here 

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:22.542
 which is that I don’t think the local towns people were so so concerned 

00:03:22.542 --> 00:03:24.458
about the well being of the people

00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:26.709
 who were going and swimming in this abandoned quarry 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.001
maybe they felt like it was a lawsuit waiting to happen 

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.166
although frankly that was on the quarry owners 

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:35.750
I think it was more that it was kind of embarrassing 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.917
and it was becoming so popular that it was clogging the streets 

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:40.125
and taking up parking 

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:43.250
and there is nothing that pisses off a small towner more 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.417
than when outsiders come and steal all the parking
