in dan had the idea to look at some work
 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.840
in dan had the idea to look at some work
that had been done in the 1970s a

that had been done in the 1970s a
 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.359
that had been done in the 1970s a
somewhat famous experiment by Ulrich and

play basketball passing balls around on

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719
play basketball passing balls around on
 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.830
play basketball passing balls around on
an empty basketball court and managed to

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840
an empty basketball court and managed to
 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.260
an empty basketball court and managed to
get the groups of people to overlap by

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270
get the groups of people to overlap by
 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.819
get the groups of people to overlap by
filming the most special mirrors and

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829
filming the most special mirrors and
 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.350
filming the most special mirrors and
then while people are watching these

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360
then while people are watching these
 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.180

basketball players they're supposed to
 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.709
basketball players they're supposed to
count the number of times the ball gets

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719
count the number of times the ball gets
 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.930

passed about halfway through the video a

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940
passed about halfway through the video a
 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.729

finding of his experiment was that many

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360
finding of his experiment was that many
 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.389

people who were counting the basketball

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399
people who were counting the basketball
 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.860
people who were counting the basketball
passes didn't see the woman with the

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870
passes didn't see the woman with the
 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.270
passes didn't see the woman with the
umbrella walking through and didn't

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280
umbrella walking through and didn't
 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.279
umbrella walking through and didn't
remember her being there at all this

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289
remember her being there at all this
 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.630
remember her being there at all this
funny thing about the experiment though

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640
funny thing about the experiment though
 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.310
funny thing about the experiment though
was that since it was film using the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320
was that since it was film using the
 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.780
was that since it was film using the
special technique with mirrors everyone

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790
special technique with mirrors everyone
 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.399
special technique with mirrors everyone
was sort of invisible and transparent

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409
was sort of invisible and transparent
 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.500
was sort of invisible and transparent
and you could see through them it was

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510
and you could see through them it was
 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.480
and you could see through them it was
very unusual looking display it's the

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490
very unusual looking display it's the
 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.620
very unusual looking display it's the
kind of thing that nowadays you would do

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630
kind of thing that nowadays you would do
 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.450
kind of thing that nowadays you would do
with digital video editing back in the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460
with digital video editing back in the
 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.640
with digital video editing back in the
1970s he used mirrors some people had

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650
1970s he used mirrors some people had
 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.960
1970s he used mirrors some people had
sort of dismissed the finding that

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970
sort of dismissed the finding that
 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.520
sort of dismissed the finding that
people missed this very obvious and

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530
people missed this very obvious and
 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.810
people missed this very obvious and
salient thing like a woman walking

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820
salient thing like a woman walking
 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.550
salient thing like a woman walking
through a basketball game because it was

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560
through a basketball game because it was
 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.340
through a basketball game because it was
a strange-looking visual display so we

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350
a strange-looking visual display so we
 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.620
a strange-looking visual display so we
decided to try to do a new version of

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630
decided to try to do a new version of
 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.510
decided to try to do a new version of
this experiment where all the action was

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520
this experiment where all the action was
 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.460
this experiment where all the action was
live and we had six people passing

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470
live and we had six people passing
 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.800
live and we had six people passing
basketballs around sort of choreograph

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810
basketballs around sort of choreograph
 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.240
basketballs around sort of choreograph
to not run into each other and to not

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250
to not run into each other and to not
 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.800
to not run into each other and to not
throw the ball in each other's face and

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810
throw the ball in each other's face and
 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.090
throw the ball in each other's face and
so on and that was a bit of a challenge

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100
so on and that was a bit of a challenge
 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.289
so on and that was a bit of a challenge
and setting up this experiment but

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299
and setting up this experiment but
 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.730
and setting up this experiment but
that's what we have students in the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740
that's what we have students in the
 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.319
that's what we have students in the
course for we managed to get it right

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329
course for we managed to get it right
 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.780
course for we managed to get it right
and then we had a woman walk through

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790
and then we had a woman walk through
 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.539
and then we had a woman walk through
carrying an umbrella just like nicer did

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549
carrying an umbrella just like nicer did
 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.609
carrying an umbrella just like nicer did
what was a little more amusing for us

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619
what was a little more amusing for us
 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:52.690
what was a little more amusing for us
though was that one of the other

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700
though was that one of the other
 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.980
though was that one of the other
professors in the department happened to

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990
professors in the department happened to
 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.420
professors in the department happened to
have a gorilla suit lying around in his

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430
have a gorilla suit lying around in his
 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.550
have a gorilla suit lying around in his
lab and we thought it would be fun to

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560
lab and we thought it would be fun to
 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.929
lab and we thought it would be fun to
have someone walk through wearing the

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939
have someone walk through wearing the
 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.789
have someone walk through wearing the
gorilla suit and see whether that was

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799
gorilla suit and see whether that was
 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.679
gorilla suit and see whether that was
noticed and we had first thought that

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689
noticed and we had first thought that
 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.230
noticed and we had first thought that
people would notice the gorilla walking

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240
people would notice the gorilla walking
 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.520
people would notice the gorilla walking
through the basketball game because

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530
through the basketball game because
 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.510
through the basketball game because
there's no longer this sort of

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520
there's no longer this sort of
 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.210
there's no longer this sort of
transparent see-through display and the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220
transparent see-through display and the
 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.530
transparent see-through display and the
gorilla actually stayed on the screen

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540
gorilla actually stayed on the screen
 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.119
gorilla actually stayed on the screen
for nine full seconds and one of the

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129
for nine full seconds and one of the
 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.890
for nine full seconds and one of the
versions of our video when we ran the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900
versions of our video when we ran the
 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.300
versions of our video when we ran the
experiment and our students went out and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310
experiment and our students went out and
 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.190
experiment and our students went out and
tested people on the Harvard campus we

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200
tested people on the Harvard campus we
 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.750
tested people on the Harvard campus we
found that about half of the people did

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760
found that about half of the people did
 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.510
found that about half of the people did
not at all notice the gorillas and in

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520
not at all notice the gorillas and in
 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.040
not at all notice the gorillas and in
fact were very surprised they hadn't

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050
fact were very surprised they hadn't
 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.059
fact were very surprised they hadn't
noticed the gorillas there were actually

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069
noticed the gorillas there were actually
 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.020
noticed the gorillas there were actually
sort of two findings from this

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030
sort of two findings from this
 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.120
sort of two findings from this
experiment one you can miss very salient

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130
experiment one you can miss very salient
 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.650
experiment one you can miss very salient
things like a gorilla walking right in

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660
things like a gorilla walking right in
 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.660
things like a gorilla walking right in
front of you and two that you're shocked

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670
front of you and two that you're shocked
 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.580
front of you and two that you're shocked
that you could miss it most people seem

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590
that you could miss it most people seem
 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.800
that you could miss it most people seem
to have the intuitive idea that they're

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810
to have the intuitive idea that they're
 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.240
to have the intuitive idea that they're
going to see this kind of thing and

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250
going to see this kind of thing and
 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.320
going to see this kind of thing and
they're really surprised when they find

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330
they're really surprised when they find
 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.170
they're really surprised when they find
out that they don't

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180
 
 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.850
 
but this experiment shows is that when

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860
but this experiment shows is that when
 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.140
but this experiment shows is that when
we're paying attention to something

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150
we're paying attention to something
 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.300
we're paying attention to something
basically doing a task that demands our

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310
basically doing a task that demands our
 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.160
basically doing a task that demands our
attention such as counting the passes of

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170
attention such as counting the passes of
 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.020
attention such as counting the passes of
the basketball in this case or really

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030
the basketball in this case or really
 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.280
the basketball in this case or really
any other kind of really attention

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290
any other kind of really attention
 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.400
any other kind of really attention
demanding task that we do we can

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410
demanding task that we do we can
 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.870
demanding task that we do we can
seriously overestimate our ability to do

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880
seriously overestimate our ability to do
 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.220
seriously overestimate our ability to do
other tasks at the same time and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230
other tasks at the same time and
 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.200
other tasks at the same time and
especially to notice and handle

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210
especially to notice and handle
 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.600
especially to notice and handle
unexpected or surprising things we think

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610
unexpected or surprising things we think
 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.670
unexpected or surprising things we think
that we're going to notice unexpected

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680
that we're going to notice unexpected
 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.140
that we're going to notice unexpected
things that come into our field of view

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150
things that come into our field of view
 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.400
things that come into our field of view
and we think we're going to pay

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410
and we think we're going to pay
 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.480
and we think we're going to pay
attention to the things we should pay

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490
attention to the things we should pay
 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.670
attention to the things we should pay
attention to but in fact when we're

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680
attention to but in fact when we're
 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.650
attention to but in fact when we're
focused on one task we're noticing and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660
focused on one task we're noticing and
 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.030
focused on one task we're noticing and
paying attention to a lot less than we

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040
paying attention to a lot less than we
 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.869
paying attention to a lot less than we
really think

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879
 
 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.699
 
this experiment implies a lot about our

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709
this experiment implies a lot about our
 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.119
this experiment implies a lot about our
behavior in everyday life for example

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129
behavior in everyday life for example
 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.670
behavior in everyday life for example
when we are driving and talking on a

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680
when we are driving and talking on a
 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.009
when we are driving and talking on a
cell phone at the same time we get the

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019
cell phone at the same time we get the
 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.420
cell phone at the same time we get the
feeling that we're actually driving just

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430
feeling that we're actually driving just
 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.430
feeling that we're actually driving just
as well as when we're not talking on the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440
as well as when we're not talking on the
 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.559
as well as when we're not talking on the
phone that's part of why we do things

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569
phone that's part of why we do things
 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.670
phone that's part of why we do things
like talking on the phone while we're

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680
like talking on the phone while we're
 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.320
like talking on the phone while we're
driving or even sent text messages or

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330
driving or even sent text messages or
 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.000
driving or even sent text messages or
read our email which are actually much

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010
read our email which are actually much
 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.530
read our email which are actually much
worse but even talking on the phone

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540
worse but even talking on the phone
 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.300
worse but even talking on the phone
while driving depletes a lot of your

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310
while driving depletes a lot of your
 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.589
while driving depletes a lot of your
attention talking on the phone while

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599
attention talking on the phone while
 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.360
attention talking on the phone while
you're driving is like counting the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370
you're driving is like counting the
 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.550
you're driving is like counting the
basketball passes in our experiment you

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560
basketball passes in our experiment you
 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.370
basketball passes in our experiment you
can still drive but what you're gonna

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380
can still drive but what you're gonna
 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.630
can still drive but what you're gonna
have a problem with is noticing

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640
have a problem with is noticing
 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.670
have a problem with is noticing
unexpected things and when you think

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680
unexpected things and when you think
 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.080
unexpected things and when you think
about it those are the really important

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090
about it those are the really important
 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.130
about it those are the really important
things to notice when you're driving

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140
things to notice when you're driving
 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.780
things to notice when you're driving
it's one thing to just drive down an

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790
it's one thing to just drive down an
 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.670
it's one thing to just drive down an
open highway at night it's another thing

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680
open highway at night it's another thing
 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.220
open highway at night it's another thing
to drive in the suburbs when someone

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230
to drive in the suburbs when someone
 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.270
to drive in the suburbs when someone
might be pulling out of their driveway

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280
might be pulling out of their driveway
 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.039
might be pulling out of their driveway
right in front of you or someone might

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049
right in front of you or someone might
 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.449
right in front of you or someone might
be stopping short right in front of you

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459
be stopping short right in front of you
 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.710
be stopping short right in front of you
and you want to have the reaction time

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720
and you want to have the reaction time
 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.509
and you want to have the reaction time
to be able to stop and not crash into

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519
to be able to stop and not crash into
 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.789
to be able to stop and not crash into
them or even worse someone pushes a baby

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799
them or even worse someone pushes a baby
 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.920
them or even worse someone pushes a baby
stroller out in front of the in front of

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930
stroller out in front of the in front of
 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.050
stroller out in front of the in front of
the road so we're actually a lot worse

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060
the road so we're actually a lot worse
 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.370
the road so we're actually a lot worse
at that than we think we are and we

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380
at that than we think we are and we
 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.170
at that than we think we are and we
should in fact put down the cell phone

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180
should in fact put down the cell phone
 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.050
should in fact put down the cell phone
while we're driving and perhaps even zip

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060
while we're driving and perhaps even zip
 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.370
while we're driving and perhaps even zip

it up in a briefcase or a purse or
 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.140
it up in a briefcase or a purse or
something like that those are some of

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150
something like that those are some of
 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.909
something like that those are some of
the implications for everyday life but

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919
the implications for everyday life but
 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.469
the implications for everyday life but
it's not just driving there are many

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479
it's not just driving there are many
 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.600
it's not just driving there are many
other situations like this for example

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610
other situations like this for example
 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.870
other situations like this for example
the security screeners at airports we

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880
the security screeners at airports we
 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.980
the security screeners at airports we
sort of have the impression that they're

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990
sort of have the impression that they're
 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.180
sort of have the impression that they're
paying attention to everything that's in

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190
paying attention to everything that's in
 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.190

but actually everybody has sort of an
 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.719
but actually everybody has sort of an
inflated impression of how much they're

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729
inflated impression of how much they're
 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.000
inflated impression of how much they're
paying attention to and we may not be as

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010
paying attention to and we may not be as
 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.890
paying attention to and we may not be as
safe as we think we are even with you

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900
safe as we think we are even with you

actually changed several times during
the course of this interview some people

the course of this interview some people
might have noticed some of the changes

might have noticed some of the changes
 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.029
might have noticed some of the changes
but it's probably unusual to notice all
