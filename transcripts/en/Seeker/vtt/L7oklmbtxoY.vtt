00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.410
When you watch DNews, or other awesome science
shows, people say: "this paper," "a new study,"

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.220
"researchers," or "a team from" -- but how
much money do we have to spend to get that

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.790
science?

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.860
Sup nerds, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.800
Science and money have always had a contentious
relationship.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.160
Alexander Graham Bell borrowed money from
the parents of a wealthy student to help create

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.210
the "harmonic telegraph."

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.410
Science needs capital, which can often mean
a trip to the capitOl.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.300
But, c'mon, who really PAYS for science?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.520
First, how much are we talking?

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.530
It depends on your lab, the university or
company, the type of science!

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.680
Getting telescope time is not the same as
finding and tracking thousands of participants

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.870
for a 10-year study…

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.640
BUT here's one example.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.280
Let's say you're hired at an average university's
biology department.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.030
You're going to be doing research there, so
you negotiate what's called a "start up fund"

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.250
which could be 400,000 dollars.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.200
"Wow," you think, "That's a TON of mulah!"

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.219
But we've just started!

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.059
From there, researchers need equipment, staff,
consumable products like pipettes, petri dishes,

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.249
beakers, plus bits-and-bobs for every stage
of the experiment.

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:10.939
To get money for that scientists have to apply
for grants…

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.240
I asked Dr. Joe Hanson of PBS's It's Okay
to Be Smart, a biologist, and he said, for

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.649
biomedical science the "gold standard of research
grants" is the National Institutes of Health

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.479
R01 grant; which could be 4 or 500,000 dollars.

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.609
Looking into it, there were 2,100 applicants,
and only 294 were awarded in 2015 (a 14 percent

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:31.609
award rate).

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.950
So, between start-up funds and a big grant
you might have 8 or 900K.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.670
That sounds like a lot, but even that can't
cover everything!

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.380
Plus, the university takes a cut of whatever
scientists win, sometimes as much as 50%.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.859
This is why scientists spend so much of their
time applying for grants.

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.069
Science is really expensive and time consuming,
and funding has to be in place before a single

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:53.880
bit of research can be started.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.559
As Scientific American wrote, "Scientists
spend too much time raising cash instead of

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:59.689
doing experiments."

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.709
So, where does this money come from?

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.500
Most science is funded by governments.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.859
In the U.S. it can come from the National
Institutes of Health, the National Science

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.819
Foundation, Defense Department, Department
of Education, or even the Fish and Wildlife

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:11.819
Service!

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.510
I mean, that's what the government does, it
collects taxes and distributes that money

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.569
for the good of us all.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.019
But since the 2008 Great Recession and 2010
Sequestration (remember that little diddy?)

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.260
science's funding has dipped significantly.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.650
This can mean fewer studies, fewer discoveries,
and fewer breakthroughs.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.109
Government monies are dispersed through grants,
offices, contracts and programmes… but though

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:38.329
most money comes from the gubment, they're
not alone at the table when the bill for scientific

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.329
research and development gets dropped.

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.329
In 2013, the European community contributed
over 19 percent of the world's science budget.

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.329
China contributed about 19 percent, by the
way, and the US around 28 percent.

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.329
In fact, most major political consortiums
in the world have interest in scientific research

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.329
(and not just because science is awesome).

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.329
Together, African countries contributed 1.3
percent of the continent's whole GDP to research

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.329
and development.

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.329
And while the Union of South American Nations
(UNASUR) is looking to establish scientific

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.329
integration in the near future, Brazil alone
committed 2.2 percent.

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.329
Lately, private companies have been paying
for more science, which can be controversial.

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.950
More than 75 percent of all clinical trials
in medicine are funded by private companies.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.230
The controversy comes, when the gal footing
the bill has a vested interest in certain

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.230
results.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.870
Think, drug or tobacco companies…

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.959
But not all private money is bad!

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.780
Some private studies are partnerships with
government grants, public universities, nonprofits

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.780
or foundations!

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.780
And in an ideal world, it wouldn't matter
who paid for it it would all just be science.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.930
Since the 1970s, when it peaked at 2 percent
of the GDP, the U.S. has spent less and less

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.159
on research and development.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.739
According to the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, we're now spending

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.989
zero-point-seven-eight percent of our GDP
on research.

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.819
Most of that, is the government, but these
days, some scientists are even looking to

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.920
the internet and crowdfunding to pay for their
experiments -- which a whole other monster.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.189
Think of all the stories about science we've
done on DNews, and the number of times you've

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:41.709
been blown away by a new healthcare technology,
advance in space travel, or paleontological

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.879
discovery -- those things were expensive and
hard-fought… which just makes me love them

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.879
more.

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.040
The research to do this video was SUPER fun,
I got neck deep into the budgets and excitement

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.879
of science around the world -- I dove wayyyy
into it.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.249
I like to say, the more I know about something,
the more I WANT to know about something…

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:02.310
Take something we all love, Movies -- did
you know: a preacher created flexible celluloid?

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.700
Or do you know why we use 24 frames per second?

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.409
What about how your brain sees all those still
frames as one moving image?

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.099
That's what my podcast show is about.

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.209
Over there I go all-in on whatever science
topic I can.

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.310
Last week, I looked at the history, science
and future of movies.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.060
Check it and lemme know what you think!

OR if you prefer to stick to DNews.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.199
NASA moves money to contractors and grant
winners all the time!

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.250
But what would happen if we doubled NASA's
budget… just… doubled it.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.449
Or Tripled!!

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:53.240
I looked into more money moving on this video.
