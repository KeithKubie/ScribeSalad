00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.799
So what if I can’t see the Milky Way at
night, it’s just a little light pollution

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.240
right?

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.480
Hey there stars, Sapna here for DNews.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.770
According to the Atlas of Artificial Night
Sky Brightness about 83% of humans on Earth

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.770
are exposed to night skies that are at least
10% brighter than natural levels, or what

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.400
the Atlas defines as “light pollution”.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.560
When I say pollution you probably think of
smog or oil spills or some other substance

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.800
we put into the environment that really mucks
up the place.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.730
By comparison then, calling an overabundance
of light “pollution” may sound a bit overdramatic.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.390
What effect can leaving the light on all night
really have on the environment?

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.000
As it turns out our love of light can mess
with both flora and fauna more than you might

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
think.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.530
Earth’s ecosystems have spent billions of
years adapting to a day-night cycle, but the

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.300
invention of artificial light and subsequent
vanquishing of the darkness is throwing some

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.050
organisms outta their groove in very profound
ways.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.670
Take for instance baby sea turtles.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.320
Those little guys hatch on the beach and it’s
imperative they get to the water before some

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.150
predator snatches them up.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.080
When they’re born at night they find water
by putting the dark and elevated silhouette

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.120
of land behind them.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.370
But lights from houses or roads along the
beach can disorient them, making them crawl

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.980
in the wrong direction until dawn when they’re
easy pickin’s.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.020
That’s if they even get hatched in the first
place: momma turtles that have been returning

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.150
to the same beach for decades may be discouraged
by the brightly lit shore and look for another

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.830
nesting site, or they could get disoriented
themselves and wander into traffic.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.850
Light pollution can effect some creatures
in the water also.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.780
Microscopic animals called zooplankton hang
out at lower depths during the day and rise

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.110
up to feed on algae each night.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.980
If the night sky is too bright, they don’t
rise up as high or in as great of numbers,

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.810
so they don’t eat as much algae, which can
in turn, contribute to an algal bloom.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.590
Coastal light can also hurt some coral species
in the great barrier reef, which rely on phases

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.830
of the moon to sync their release of sperm
and eggs into the water.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.619
If the moon’s phases are masked, then they
might not spawn at the right time and that

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.560
means less new coral.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.030
Light pollution isn’t great news for some
land creatures either.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.739
Birds that migrate at night are known to crash
into brightly lit towers or skyscrapers, or

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.569
circle them until they die of exhaustion.

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.519
Amphibians like salamanders that forage after
dusk will wait longer to come out since the

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.829
night sky is more brightly lit and they don’t
get as much food. and get this..

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.549
Some frog and toad males will not ribbit if
they’re well lit.. so then lady frogs won’t

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.530
holler back and mate with them.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.140
But if you don’t care about the frogs or
the salamanders or the birds or the coral

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.549
or the baby turtles, well you’re heartless
but you should still know that light pollution

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.609
probably affects you too.

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.579
First off if you live in a big city like New
York City like I do...we can all say goodbye

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.760
to the stars, unless something knocks the
power out like an earthquake did to Los Angeles

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.439
in 1994.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.010
Residents called Griffith Observatory asking
why the night sky looked different after the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.010
earthquake.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.420
They were seeing the Milky Way for the first
time.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.209
If it’s bright enough to read a book outside
at midnight, that’s a sign those bright

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.970
lights can keep you up by stopping you from
producing melatonin.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.159
Obviously that can cause sleep disorders,
but melatonin is also an antioxidant so it’s

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.650
possible that light is actually increasing
your risk of cancer as well.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.440
And of course keeping those lights on requires
energy, and if that energy comes from a fossil

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.349
fuel source, light pollution is causing good
old-fashioned regular pollution too.

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.380
By leaving the light on all night you are
literally burning the midnight oil.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.409
So if you can help it, stop leaving the light
on.

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.129
Light pollution can mess with your sleep,
but what can regular pollution do to the rest

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.129
of you?

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.150
Julia Covers that right here.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.299
Have you noticed the effects of light pollution
in your life?
