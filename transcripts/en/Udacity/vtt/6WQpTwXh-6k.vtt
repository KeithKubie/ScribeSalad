My name is Dana Abdul Jawad, I'm an Android

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:06.450
course manager at Udacity.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.980
I'm going to talk to you about The Android

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.980
application development program

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.509
in our partnership with one million arab coders

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.509
initiative.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.820
This program aims to teach students the basic

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.820
skills and expertise

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.980
needed in the field of Android Application

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.980
Development.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.860
In this program we start with the students

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.420
from scratch
whether in android programming or programming

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.420
as a whole.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.270
the program kicks off with teaching students

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.439
how to build interfaces

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.170
then we move to teaching them how to make

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.460
interfaces more interactive

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.000
The language we use is Java, which is one

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.929
of
the most popular programing languages.

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.469
After finishing the program students will

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.280
aquire the sklls and expertise needed

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.829
to independently develop themselves in the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.160
android app development field.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.600
As for the job opportunities there are many.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.399
You can work for a specialized company in
building android apps

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.590
with the most famous example being google

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.050
since
it's the source of the android system itself

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.920
Lastly, android developers could work as freelancers

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.830
without being full time employees at any company

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.090
as they can develop apps upon request from

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.140
clients whether individuals or companies

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.840
I would like to encourage everyone to apply

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.930
for this program

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.671
which was designed to start with the applicants

00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:36.840
from
scratch in the fields of android development

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.840
and programming

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.560
There's no previous level of expertise required.
