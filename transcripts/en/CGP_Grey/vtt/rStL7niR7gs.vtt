00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
Do you want to rule?  Do you see the problems in your country and know how to fix them?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.820
If only you had the power to do so.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.860
Well, you've come to the right place.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.480
But before we begin this lesson in political power, ask yourself why don't rulers see as clearly as you...

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.880
...instead acting in such, selfish, self-destructive, short-sighted ways?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.520
Are they stupid… these most powerful people in the world?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.440
Or is it something else?

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.720
The throne looks omnipotent from afar, but it is not as it seems.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.120
Take the throne to act, and the throne acts upon you.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.600
Accept that or turn back now before we discuss, the Rules for Rulers.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.800
*somber music*

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.360
No matter how bright the rays of any sun king: No man rules alone.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.800
A king can’t build roads alone, can’t enforce laws alone, can't defend the nation or himself, alone.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.400
The power of a king is not to act, but to get others to act on his behalf, using the treasure in his vaults.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.960
A king needs an army, and someone to run it.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.720
Treasure and someone to collect it.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.280
Law and someone to enforce it.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.260
The individuals needed to make the necessary things happen are the king's keys to power.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.520
All the changes you wish to make are but thoughts in your head if the keys will not follow your commands.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.080
In a dictatorship, where might makes right, the number of keys to power is small, ...

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.520
...perhaps only a dozen generals, bureaucrats, and regional leaders.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.240
Sway them to your side and the power to rule is yours, but...

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.820
...never forget: displease them and they will replace you.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.400
Now all countries lie on a spectrum from those where the ruler needs few key supporters to those where the ruler needs many...

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.040
...this foundation of power is why countries are different.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.400
Yet many keys or few, the rules are the same:

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.280
First, get the key supporters on your side.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.840
With them, you have the power to act; you have everything.  Without them, you have nothing.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.160
Now in order to keep those keys to power, you must, second:

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.200
Control the treasure.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.920
You must make sure your treasure is raised and distributed to you -- for all your hard work

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.840
-- and to the keys needed to keep your position.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.120
This is your true work as a ruler: figuring out how best to raise and distribute resources,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.640
...so as not to topple the house of cards upon which your throne sits.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.200
Now you, aspiring benevolent dictator, may want to help your citizens,...

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.720
...but your control of the treasure is what attracts rivals, so you must keep those keys loyal.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.320
But there is only so much treasure in your vaults, so much wealth your kingdom produces.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.880
So beware: every bit of treasure spent on citizens is treasure not spent on loyalty.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.000
Thus, doing the right thing, spending the wealth of the nation on the citizens of the nation,...

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.440
...hands a tool of power acquisition to your rivals.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:12.240
Treasure poured into roads, and universities, and hospitals, is treasure a rival can promise to key supporters if only they switch sides.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.120
Benevolent dictators can spend their take on the citizens, but the keys must get their rewards,...

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.200
for *even if* you have gathered the most loyal, angelic supporters, they have the same problem as you, just one level down...

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.960
Being a key to power is a position of power.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:41.240
They too must watch out for rivals from below or above: thus the treasure they get must also be spent to maintain their position.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.760
The loyal and dim may stay by your side no matter what,...

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:55.240
...but smart key supporters, will always watch the balance of power, ready to change allegiance if you look to be the loser in a shifting web of alliances.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.920
In countries where the keys are few, the rewards are great...

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.680
...and when violence rules, the most ruthless are attracted; and angels that build good works will lose to devils that don't.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:14.440
So buy all the loyalty you can, because loyalty, in dictatorial organizations of all kinds, is everything.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.280
For the ruler, anyway.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.200
Thus, the dictatorship exposed:

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.400
A king who needs his court to raise the treasure to keep the court loyal and keep raising the treasure.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.080
This is the self-sustaining core of power, all outside is secondary.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.560
Now a king with many key supporters has real problems:

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.840
not just their expense, but also their competing needs and rivalries are difficult to balance,...

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.560
...the more complicated the social and financial web between them all, the more able a rival is to sway a critical mass.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.520
The more key supporters a ruler has on average, the shorter their reign.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.840
Which brings us to the third rule for rulers:

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.120
Minimize Key Supporters

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.480
If a key in your court becomes unnecessary, his skills no longer required, you must kick him out.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.000
After a successful coup,  the new dictator will purge some of those who helped him come to power,...

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.480
... while working with the underlings of the previous dictator -- which from the outside seems a terrible idea.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.240
Why abandon your fellow revolutionaries?

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.800
Are the old dictator's supporters not a danger?

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.160
But the keys necessary to gain power are not the same as those needed to keep it.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:38.520
Having someone on the payroll who was vital in the past, but useless now is the same as spending money on the citizens: treasure wasted on the irrelevant.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.400
And by definition, a dictator that pulls off a coup has promised greater treasure to those switching sides.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.400
The size of the vault has not changed, so the treasure must be split among fewer.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:06:00.720
A dictator that sways the right keys, takes control of the treasure, cuts unnecessary spending, kills unnecessary keys, will have a long and successful career.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:08.520
Seeing the structure unveiled, you might be excited to get started and control a country to the benefit of you and your cronies,...

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:17.440
...or you might be exhausted, wishing to do good but seeing the structural difficulties, now turn to democracy for salvation.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.840
So let us discuss rulers as representatives.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.960
You again might have grand dreams of the utopia you wish to build, but: no man rules alone.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.800
And never more so than in democracy.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.800
Presidents and Prime ministers must negotiate with their senates and parliaments and vice versa.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.440
And they all have their own key supporters to manage.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:47.320
In a well-designed democracy, power is fractured among many, and is taken not with force but with words,…

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.160
… meaning you must get thousands or millions of citizens to if not like you on election day, …

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.120
…at least like you better than the alternative.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.160
With so many voters and such fractured power it's impossible to, as a dictator would,…

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.560
…follow these rules and buy loyalty.  Or is it?

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.560
Of course not.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.240
Don't think of citizens as individuals with their individual desires, but instead as divided into blocs:

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.520
…the elderly, or homeowners, or business owners, or the poor.  Blocs you can reward as a group.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.760
Democracies have wildly complicated tax codes, and laws, not as accident but as reward

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.240
for the blocks that get and keep the ruling representatives in power:

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.280
Farming subsidies, for example, have nothing to do with the food a nation needs, ...

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.000
...but entirely with how key the vote of the farming bloc is.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.400
Countries where farmers’ votes don't swing elections, don’t have farming subsidies.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.920
If a bloc doesn’t vote, such as younger citizens, then no need to divert rewards their way.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.200
Even if large in number, they are irrelevant to gaining power.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:02.960
Which is good news for you: one less block to sway and the treasure you give to your key blocks has to come from somewhere...

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:10.120
If you want long years in office, rule three is your friend in a democracy just as much as a dictatorship.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.200
You can't eliminate those who don’t vote for you, but there is still much you can do.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.480
Once in power, make it easier for your key blocks to vote and harder for others.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.800
Establish voting systems that reduce the number of blocs you need to win the more rivals you get,…

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.080
…very handy indeed.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.520
Draw election borders to predetermine the results for you or your cronies, …

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:38.680
…and have party pre-elections with Byzantine rules to determine who blocs even *can* vote for.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.880
Mix and match the above for even better power perpetuation.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.400
When approval ratings couldn't be lower, yet re-election rates couldn't be higher,…

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.880
… you'll know you've succeeded.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.760
Now, enough with thinking about the citizens.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.240
Even in a democracy there still are very influential individual key supporters

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:05.360
...you need on your side because their money or influence or favors keeps you in power.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.280
While you can’t just promise to give them treasure directly, as a dictator would,…

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.320
…you can create loopholes for their investments, pass laws that they’ve written, …

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.240
… or print get out of jail free cards for their actions.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.640
Not a wheelbarrow of gold to the door, but contracts for their business.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.600
You as ruler do have roads to build or computers to maintain or buildings to reconstruct.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.040
No man rules alone, after all.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.120
Or you could take the moral path, and ignore the big keys.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.760
But you'll fight against those who didn't.  Good luck with that.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.080
Corruption is not some kind of petty crime, but rather a tool of power, …

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.160
…in democracies and dictatorships, but more on that another time.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.200
So, accept the favors, sway the key blocs and you will get into power, …

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.040
… ruling with actions that look contradictory and stupid to those who don't understand the game —

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.520
privately helping a powerful industry you publicly denounced, …

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.600
… or passing laws that hurt a bloc that voted for you.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.040
But your job isn’t to have a consistent understandable ruling policy, …

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.000
… but to balance the interests of your keys to power, big and small.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.960
That is how you stay in office.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.200
Now with all this headache of being a representative, you may wonder,…

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.200
… looking at rule three why couldn’t you skip all this bloc-building, favor trading nonsense …

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.080
… and just bribe the army to take power?

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.600
We must finally turn to: taxes and revolts.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:36.760
You must understand rule  two and how the treasure is raised and used to hold a country together.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.800
If we graph the tax rate of countries vs the number of key supporters the ruler needs, …

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.360
… there’s a clear relationship.  More democracy, lower taxes.\

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.600
If you're sitting comfortably in a cushy democracy you may scoff at this, …

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:56.440
… but your fellow citizens who don’t earn enough don’t pay income taxes and get rebates, …

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.600
… bringing the *average* tax rate down.  In dictatorships, this doesn’t happen.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.680
Dictatorships often forgo tax paperwork in favor of just taking wealth directly.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.400
It’s common for the dictator to force farmers to sell their produce to him for little, …

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.120
… then turn around and sell it on the open market,

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.440
… pocketing the difference at an unthinkably high equivalent tax rate.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.560
So taxes in democracies are low in comparison to dictatorships.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.240
But why do representatives lower their take?

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.800
Well, cutting taxes is a crowd pleaser.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:36.920
Dictators have no need to please the crowds and thus can take a large percentage from their poor citizens to pay key supporters.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.440
But representatives in a democracy can take a smaller percentage …

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.920
from each to pay their key supporters, …

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.840
… because their educated, freer citizens are more productive than peasants.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.880
For rulers in a democracy, the more productivity the better.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.720
Which is why they build universities and hospitals and roads and grant freedoms, …

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:05.120
…not just out of the goodness of their hearts but because it increases citizen productiveness,…

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:13.120
… which increases treasure for the ruler and their key supporters, even when a lower percentage is taken.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.360
Democracies are better places to live than dictatorships,…

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.240
… not because representatives are better people,…

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:25.960
… but because their needs *happen* to be aligned with a large portion of the population.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.800
The things that make citizens more productive also make their lives better.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.160
Representatives want everyone productive, so everyone gets highways.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.080
The worst dictators are those whose incentives are aligned with the fewest citizens, …

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.040
… those who have the fewest keys to power.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.160
This explains why the worst dictatorships have something in common.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.920
Gold or oil or diamonds or similar.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:57.480
If the wealth of a nation is mostly dug out of the ground: it’s a terrible place to live…

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:04.160
… because a gold mine can run with dying slaves, and still produce great treasure.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.240
Oil is harder, but luckily foreign companies can extract and refine it without any citizen involvement.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:18.720
With citizens outside this cycle, they can be ignored while the ruler is rewarded and the keys to power kept loyal.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.120
Thus we live in a world where the best, smartest democracies are stable, …

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.320
…the worst, richest dictatorships are stable, and in between is a valley of revolution.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:35.400
The resource-rich dictators build roads only from their ports to their resources and from their palace to the airport, …

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:40.480
… and the people stay quiet not because this is fine or even because they’re scared, …

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:47.840
… but because the cold truth is: starving, disconnected, illiterates don't make good revolutionaries.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:57.280
Now a middling dictator without resources must, as mentioned before, take a large amount of wealth directly from his poor farmers and factory workers.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:04.160
Thus two roads won't do, and so he must maintain some minimums of life for the citizens.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:10.320
But keeping the work-force somewhat connected and somewhat educated and somewhat healthy …

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.280
… makes them more able to revolt.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:19.560
Now understand: the romantic image of the people storming the gates and overthrowing their dictator is mostly a fantasy.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:26.840
If you run a middling dictatorship, the people only storm the palace when the army *lets them* to remove you, …

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.720
… because you lost control over your keys and are being replaced.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:39.840
This is why after 'popular revolts’ in middling dictatorships, the new ruler is often the same as the old, if not worse.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:48.000
The people didn't replace the king, the court replaced the king, using the peoples' protest they let happen to do it.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.400
The very things a benevolent dictator wants to build to cross this valley …

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:58.640
… take treasure away from the keys to power and make the citizens more able to revolt, …

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.640
… often ending in a stronger ruler less likely to build bridges and more loyal to his keys.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.840
On the other side, the best democracies are stable not just because the large number of keys…

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.240
… and their competing desires makes dictatorial revolt near-impossible to organize, …

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.200
… but also because the revolt would destroy the very wealth it intended to capture.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.080
The high productivity of the citizens.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:30.200
Plus: those helping the would-be dictator in a democracy know he plans to cull key supporters once in power.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.320
That’s what’s a coup is.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:38.120
So potential key supporters must weigh the probability of surviving the cull and getting the rewards, …

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:43.320
… versus the risk of being on the outside of a dictatorship they helped create.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.600
In a stable democracy, that’s a terrible gamble:

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.720
maybe you'll be incredibly wealthy, …

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.800
… but probably you'll be dead and have made the lives of everyone you know worse.  The math says no.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:01.920
Being on the right side of a coup in a dictatorship means having the resources to get you and your family what the peasants lack.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:08.200
Health care, education, quality of life — this is what make the competition for power so fierce.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.320
But in a democracy most already have these things, so why risk it?

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.600
So the more the wealth of a nation comes from the productive citizens of the nation, …

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:23.680
… the more the power gets spread out and the more the ruler must maintain the quality of life for those citizens.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.320
The less, the less.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.240
Now if a stable democracy becomes very poor, …

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.840
… or if a resource that dwarfs the productivity of the citizens is found, …

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:40.720
… the odds of this gamble change, and make it more possible for a small group to seize power.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:48.920
Because if the current quality of life is terrible or the wealth not dependent on the citizens, coups are worth the risk.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.000
When democracies fall, these are usually the reasons.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.960
*somber music*

00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.840
These rules for rulers explain not only why some men are monsters and others are merciful, …

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:07.360
… but everything about politics: from war to foreign aid, to political dynasties, to corruption.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.240
All of which, we can talk about at another time.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.120
But for now, you aspiring ruler, may be disgusted by the world of politics, …

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.360
… and have decided to avoid it entirely, but you cannot, for rulers come in many forms.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:26.520
Yes, Kings, Presidents and Prime Ministers but also Deans, Dons, Mayors, Chairs, Chiefs.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:34.000
These rules apply to all and explain their actions: from the CEO of the largest global corporate conglomerate …

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.480
… who must keep his board happy, to the chair of the smallest home owner’s association, …

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.280
… managing votes and spending membership fees.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.080
You cannot escape structures of power.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.480
You can only turn a blind eye to understanding them, and …

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.960
… if you ever want the change you dream about, there is a zeroth rule you cannot ignore.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.080
Without power you can affect nothing.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.680
You may not like these rules, but surely, better you on the throne than someone else.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.680
And who knows, maybe you’ll be different.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.280
*somber piano music, slowly fading*

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:20.760
This video and its follow-ups are based largely on The Dictator’s Handbook by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alistair Smith, …

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.120
… which is simply the best book on politics written.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:32.080
There is far more detail and far more examples in it than I could ever hope to cover any series of videos.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.720
