00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.350
You think you’re a lightweight?

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.200
I almost got drunk of a slice of rum cheesecake.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.950
Wait - how is that possible?

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.349
Hey guys, Chastity here filling in for DNews.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.020
I don’t know about you, but when it comes
to drinking, I’m the queen of lightweights.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.720
I’ve been known to get drunk off of one
mixed drink.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.720
When I drink even a small amount of alcohol,
my face turns red almost instantly.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.289
See, my friends have been making fun of me
for it for years, but I’m putting it to

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.260
an end now, with SCIENCE!

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.349
The condition is called Alcohol Flush Reaction,
or AFR.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.680
It’s pretty easy to tell when you’ve got
it, since your face turns crazy red after

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.680
drinking.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.120
Other than facial flushing, symptoms of AFR
include flushing of the neck or other parts

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.330
of the body, heightened heart rate, headaches,
and nausea.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.500
Now this is even after as little as one drink.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.380
AFR is also known as the “Asian glow”
or “Asian Flush”, although Asians are

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.150
not the only ones who suffer from it.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.450
Over 500 million people worldwide experience
flush reactions, with between 36 to 50% of

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.480
them being of East Asian decent.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.949
Alcohol is typically metabolized in the liver,
where it first oxidized to acetaldehyde and

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:04.949
then to acetate.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.340
People with AFR carry a genetic mutation that
disables this process.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.719
They have an inherited deficiency in the enzyme
aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, or (ALDH2).

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:19.319
According to a PLOS Medicine study, approximately
8% of the world population is ALDH2 deficient.

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:22.310
ALDH2 is the enzyme that converts acetaldehyde.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.539
Without it, we’re left with an accumuation
of acetaldehyde up to 10 times the normal

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:27.539
concentration!

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.259
According to Robert Swift, a physician and
researcher at Brown University, Acetaldehyde

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.919
is like formaldehyde, which is embalming fluid.

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:36.849
It destroys proteins, and It destroys DNA."

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:39.909
Pretty nasty stuff, so imagine not being able
to break that down!

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:40.909
Bam!

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.359
Flushed faces, racing hearts, instant drunkenness.

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.899
Unfortunately, there is no cure for AFR since
it’s a genetic issue.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.029
The only way to prevent flush reaction is
to avoid alcohol completely.

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:52.529
But come on, that’s probably not going to
happen.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.599
So if you still want to drink but suffer from
AFR, here are some tips to cope with it, courtesy

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.950
of Health Xchange:
1 - Drink moderately.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.789
That’s two drinks for men and one drink
for women per day.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:02.789
2 - Avoid binge drinking.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:03.789
As a cue, wait until the redness subsides
before having another drink.

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:04.789
3 - Pick drinks with less alcohol content.

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.279
4 - Eat before and/or while you drink.

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:09.090
Fatty foods and carbs can slow down the rate
of alcohol absorption.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.390
and 5 - Drink plenty of water and/or non-alcoholic
drinks.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.870
Flush it out and quench your thirst.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.260
Also as a pro tip - if you’ve got the flush,
don’t wear red while drinking.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.120
You’ll end up looking like a giant tomato.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.049
