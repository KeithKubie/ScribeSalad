2
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.230
<v 1>in this course, we're going to move towards a new way of looking at verbs.</v>

3
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.160
This way is different from the concept of verbs that we talked about in the

4
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.460
introduction to the grammar of words. In those lessons,

5
00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:22.430
we treated verbs as a sort of action word,

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.530
but something else comes out when we put verbs in the context of sentences.

7
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.180
Let's look at the verb.

8
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.350
Give in a sentence like I gave it to him.

9
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.100
One thing you'll notice is that we have three noun phrases,

10
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.600
I it and a prepositional phrase to him,

11
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:43.400
which includes the Pronoun Him.

12
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.470
Let's start replacing these nouns with other nouns. We can switch them out,

13
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:53.270
right? We can say John gave it to him. John gave the bone to him.

14
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.750
John gave the bone to the dog. We're still fine there.

15
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.240
The sentence makes sense when we switch out.

16
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:01.700
Noun phrases and insert new ones ad hoc.

17
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.750
But what happens when we start switching out that verb?

18
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.450
Notice that we can say, I gave it to him or I said it to him,

19
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.560
but I bought it to him and I slept it to him.

20
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.360
Give us some trouble. We don't tend to hear sentences like that in English.

21
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.370
If you're a native English speaker,

22
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.180
you probably don't think that the verb makes much sense in that context.

23
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.070
So there's a fundamental asymmetry here between nouns and verbs.

24
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.600
The verb is doing something that's in a way more central than those nouns.

25
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.870
How do we describe this? Well,

26
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:42.560
instead of defining the verb as a word that talks about an action,

27
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.870
we can move to describing it as the essential function word in the sentence.

28
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.921
In fact,

29
00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:53.090
it almost seems to lay out the central structure of the sentence that we expect

30
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:57.230
to find used, including the number and type of nouns used.

31
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.900
Over the next few lessons,

32
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.440
we're going to take a look at the number and type of nouns and pronouns that get

33
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:07.640
used with different verbs. I said that the verb is a function word,

34
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.750
and that function word takes arguments. For example,

35
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:16.670
the verb give requires three arguments. As you continue along,

36
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:20.390
you'll learn what it means to say that give requires three arguments,

37
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.510
and that those three arguments are of different types.

38
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.540
