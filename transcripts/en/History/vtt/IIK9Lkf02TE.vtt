00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.000
[music playing]

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.500
NARRATOR: Sure,
most would say World

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
War I started with a gunshot.
[gunshot]

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.330
But there's a lot
more to the story.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.120
This is Leopold Lojka.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.830
He was born on
September 17, 1886,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.460
in the old Bohemian
village of Teltsch.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.330
Originally a horse
wrangler, Leopold

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.580
moved on to real horsepower
when he became Archduke Franz

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.710
Ferdinand's chauffeur in 1909.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.380
Archduke Ferdinand
was first in line

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.580
to the Austro-Hungarian
throne, then

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.330
occupied by emperor
Franz Joseph I.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.880
But serving as emperor wasn't
all it was cracked up to be.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.420
Austria-Hungary wasn't
exactly the most popular

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.170
European country at the time.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.880
1908, the Austro-Hungarian
empire annexes Bosnia.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.040
This ticks off
Bosnian nationalists

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.710
who wanted to unify all
southern Slavic countries

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.420
under one government.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.080
[cheering]

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.500
Tensions are still high in
1914, when Archduke Ferdinand

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.710
decides to visit Bosnia.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.580
If there were any place where
Ferdinand were to get got,

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.500
Sarajevo, Bosnia's
capital, would be it.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.580
Despite this, Ferdinand
decides to drive

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.790
around Sarajevo with the
top down in his limousine.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.120
Leopold Lojka is driving when,
out of the corner of his eye,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.580
he spots a small bomb
hurtling towards the Archduke

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.460
and his wife.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.460
He slams on the gas.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.790
And the bomb misses its target.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.790
[engine rumbling]

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.750
[bomb explodes]

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.120
[music playing]

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.580
The bomb was thrown by
Nedeljko Cabrinovic,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.580
a member of the young
Serbian nationalist movement.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.920
There are a few injuries.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.750
But Ferdinand and his
wife are unharmed.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.290
After gathering their
bearings, Leopold drives

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.620
on to a scheduled meet and
greet between the Archduke

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.420
and local officials.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.040
The officials want to take the
Archduke on a tour of the city.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.460
But Ferdinand, instead, decides
he wants to visit the wounded

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.000
victims from the bomb attack.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.670
He gets back into
the car with his wife

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.250
and has Leopold drive
off to the hospital.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.330
In all fairness to Leopold, he
didn't know the exact route,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.170
no map, no GPS.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.250
He made a mistake and turned
onto the wrong street.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.250
Unfortunately for Leopold,
and the rest of Europe,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.330
this was the street where
Gavrilo Princip, one

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.420
of the co-conspirators of the
earlier assassination attempt,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.830
happened to be having a drink.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.500
Princip can't believe his luck.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.250
He has an opportunity
to finish out what

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.790
he started earlier that day.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.250
[tires screeching]
[brakes whine]

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.250
[man gasps]

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.170
[gunshots]

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.170
[crowd screaming]

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.170
[music playing]

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.080
As the crowd tries
to subdue Princip,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.040
the Archduke and his wife
are left bleeding in the car.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.670
One bullet struck the Archduke
in the neck, the other,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.500
his wife in the stomach.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.170
Both die within the hour.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.380
[music playing]

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.170
In response to the assassination
of the heir to its crown,

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.540
Austria-Hungary seeks
support from Germany.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.960
Germany agrees.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.380
And Austria Hungary
declares war on Serbia.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.620
Russia, Serbia's ally,
mobilizes its forces.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.880
And as a result, Germany
declares war on Russia.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.830
Russia's ally,
France, then mobilizes

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.710
its forces, which causes Germany
to declare war on France.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.210
In turn, Great Britain
declares war on Germany.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.960
Austria-Hungary, then
declares war on Russia.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.670
Serbia declares war on Germany.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.210
And France and Great Britain
declare war on Austria-Hungary.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.040
[music playing]

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.080
The first World War
has begun and all

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.080
because of a wrong turn.
