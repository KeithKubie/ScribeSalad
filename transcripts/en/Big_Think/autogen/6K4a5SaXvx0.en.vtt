strike against them and if anything it

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520
strike against them and if anything it
 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.010
strike against them and if anything it
will increase the numbers of people who

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020
will increase the numbers of people who
 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.730
will increase the numbers of people who
are wearing these rather than do away

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740
are wearing these rather than do away
 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.859

countries in which Muslims are a
minority population in general and in

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950
minority population in general and in
 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.980
minority population in general and in
France in particular I think it's a

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990
France in particular I think it's a
 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.260
France in particular I think it's a
really bad idea to ban these things I

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270
really bad idea to ban these things I
 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.459
really bad idea to ban these things I

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469
think that certainly wearing a headscarf
 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.440
think that certainly wearing a headscarf
is a different thing from wearing a

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450
is a different thing from wearing a
 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.609
is a different thing from wearing a
burka actually but in either case there

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619
burka actually but in either case there
 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.029
burka actually but in either case there
is a certain there is at least in part

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039
is a certain there is at least in part
 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.699
is a certain there is at least in part
the notion that you have to cover women

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709
the notion that you have to cover women
 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.910
the notion that you have to cover women
to prevent the sort of sexual temptation

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920
to prevent the sort of sexual temptation
 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.580
to prevent the sort of sexual temptation
of men that they represent but there are

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590
of men that they represent but there are
 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.529
of men that they represent but there are

other it seems to me Muslims are not
 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.570
other it seems to me Muslims are not
alone in this Orthodox Jews women have

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580
alone in this Orthodox Jews women have
 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.059
alone in this Orthodox Jews women have
to cover their heads and wear long

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069
to cover their heads and wear long
 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.130
to cover their heads and wear long
sleeves and you know there's all kinds

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140
sleeves and you know there's all kinds
 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.970
sleeves and you know there's all kinds
of dress

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980
of dress
 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.100
of dress
for Orthodox Jewish women that also

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110
for Orthodox Jewish women that also
 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.039
for Orthodox Jewish women that also
indicate their inferiority but I think

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049
indicate their inferiority but I think
 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.990
indicate their inferiority but I think
no one would dare talk about

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000
no one would dare talk about
 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.240
no one would dare talk about
post-holocaust no one would dare talk

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250
post-holocaust no one would dare talk
 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.910
post-holocaust no one would dare talk
about or would have it a very difficult

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920
about or would have it a very difficult
 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.149
about or would have it a very difficult
time trying to ban certain of the

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159
time trying to ban certain of the
 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.610
time trying to ban certain of the
behaviors of Orthodox Jews would be

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620
behaviors of Orthodox Jews would be
 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.160
behaviors of Orthodox Jews would be
considered a legitimate interference in

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170
considered a legitimate interference in
 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.940
considered a legitimate interference in
religious practice Catholics your

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950
religious practice Catholics your
 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.030
religious practice Catholics your
Catholic nuns certainly still have to

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040
Catholic nuns certainly still have to
 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.710
Catholic nuns certainly still have to
cover their heads I mean there's there's

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720
cover their heads I mean there's there's
 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.559
cover their heads I mean there's there's
all sorts of religious practices in

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569
all sorts of religious practices in
 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.020
all sorts of religious practices in
which the inequality of women and men

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030
which the inequality of women and men
 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.479
which the inequality of women and men
are manifest in behavior and clothing

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489
are manifest in behavior and clothing
 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.630
are manifest in behavior and clothing
and the rest of it it seems to me a

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640
and the rest of it it seems to me a
 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.410
and the rest of it it seems to me a
terrible mistake to single out Muslims

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420
terrible mistake to single out Muslims
 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.259
terrible mistake to single out Muslims
at a time of clash of civilizations in

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269
at a time of clash of civilizations in
 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.509
at a time of clash of civilizations in
countries in which there's a tremendous

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519
countries in which there's a tremendous
 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.520
countries in which there's a tremendous
amount of class and other kinds of

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530
amount of class and other kinds of
 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.809
amount of class and other kinds of
economic and political discrimination

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819
economic and political discrimination
 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.420
economic and political discrimination
against them it doesn't seem to me to be

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430
against them it doesn't seem to me to be
 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.290
against them it doesn't seem to me to be
wise policy at all
