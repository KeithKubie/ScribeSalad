00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.150
Most people would consider all orders across hundreds

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.950
of stores, and all stock transactions for the New

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.270
York Stock Exchange to be big data. You

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.220
can imagine that the order details for a single

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.450
store or one person's individual stock portfolio, could

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.330
be stored in a traditional relational database system. Maybe

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.790
even a spreadsheet. But those traditional systems start to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.630
struggle with all the orders across the hundreds of

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.540
stores, and the entire data from the New York Stock Exchange.
