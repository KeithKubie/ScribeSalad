00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.210
Man, what is going on with Bruce Willis these
days?

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.670
Its sad, isnt it?

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.130
Its like he’s sleepwalking.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.880
Good Day to Die Hard is, like, the worst Die
Hard movie ever.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.880
No.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.490
Good Day To Die Hard is not a Die Hard movie.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.540
If the original Die Hard is Wrath of Khan,
then Good Day to Die Hard is The Voyage Home.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.540
Alright?

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.540
Its not even close.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.480
Olympus Has Fallen is more of a Die Hard movie
than Good Day to Die Hard.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.350
No, Olympus Has Fallen is Die Hard.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.250
Like, literally.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.250
Beat for beat.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.520
They just changed the setting and most of
the actors.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.980
Otherwise, same movie.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.350
Good Day to Die Hard wouldnt even have made
a good Taken sequel, man.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.829
Thats how lazy it is.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:41.960
Im on vacation!

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.960
Right.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.579
Lets cram a catch phrase in because Die Hard
movies are supposed to have quotable lines,

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.579
right?

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.579
But its a lame catch phrase.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:49.720
Thats what really bothers me.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.720
Right.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.770
It’s not even accurate.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.050
Like, hes in Russia to get his son out of
prison.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.679
Thats, like, the opposite of vacation.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.019
Right?

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.359
Yeah.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.040
Wait, did we just agree on something?

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.040
Yeah.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.760
Its blowing my mind.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.930
Feels weird, doesn’t it?

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.100
Well, its the first time you’ve been right
about something.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.460
I imagine that would feel weird, or strange.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.720
All Im saying is Bruce Willis is making either
terrible movies these days, or just doing

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.940
walk-on cameos in terrible movies.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.310
Alright, GI Joe Retaliation, you have both
Expendables movies, you’ve got Surrogates.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.560
The list goes on--
Looper.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.860
Dude, Looper is great!

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.860
Im telling you.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.250
Ive told you that several times.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.250
Well, I wouldnt know.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.680
Somebody wont let me watch it.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.680
Cop Out.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.660
Man, don’t even get me started on Cop Out.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.730
Why?

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.570
Kevin Smith, man.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.880
I f*cking hate that guy.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.060
Dude, I know Cop Out is not great, but Chasing
Amy is great.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.670
Jay &amp; Silent Bob still makes me laugh.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.990
You dont like Kevin Smith movies?

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.670
I didnt say anything about his movies, man.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.050
I hate him.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.430
Dude, how can you hate Kevin Smith, man?

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.170
He makes funny movies, gives awesome talks,
hes got, like, a trillion kick-ass podcasts.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.170
Podcasts.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.760
2003 called.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.390
They want their cutting edge media format
back.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.670
Well, now thats just an ignorant statement,
man.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.710
Podcasts has never been more popular.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.910
Well, maybe if we wasnt doing so many f*cking
podcasts he would have time to answer my fan

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.910
mail.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.390
You sent him fan mail?

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.300
What did you send him?

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.520
I sent him a picture I wanted him to sign.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.340
Well, what was the picture of?

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.280
Me.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.790
You sent a famous actor and movie director
a picture of yourself and asked him to sign

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.150
it and you are surprised that he didnt do
it?

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.140
Not surprised… vengeful.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.900
Ive been plotting my revenge ever since.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.370
Can you get this?

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.740
I cant get this.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:02.960
Well, all Im saying is… people usually get
autographs from the star—

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960
Exactly.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.240
Can you imagine how rare it would be?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.320
Think about what Im gonna be able to sell
this thing for.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.050
Alright, nobody on the planet has a picture
of me autographed by Kevin Smith.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:22.620
Well, rarity is only good enough when youve
got demand.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.740
People have to want the thing that youre trying
to sell, alright?

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.160
I could put a jar of my own crap on Ebay and
call it a one-of-a-kind item.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.590
And that may very well be true.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.620
But that doesnt mean anybodys gonna buy it.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.069
I think you underestimate the kind of people
that hang out on the Internet..

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.069
Somebody would totally buy that.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.569
But I also think you underestimate people
who like my videos.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.540
They might want a photo of me.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.490
I dont want to brag or anything, but have
you seen the YouTube stats?

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.690
We have got, like, tons of subscribers now.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.209
You only got most of those subscribers because
Kevin Smith tweeted about you in the early

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.209
going!

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.410
Well, I know.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.810
Thats all well and good.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.370
But if he thinks thats gonna square things
for his sins against me personally, well,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.220
hes got another thing coming.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.730
Well, Im just saying people dont like your
channel because of your looks.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.599
And they dont want pictures of you autographed
by Kevin Smith, alright?

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.000
Thats not what they want.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.510
Well, I cant sell that anyway.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.560
At least not until I get it.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.600
You are never gonna get it.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.530
Thank you, En Vogue.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.460
Heres your damn toy.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.090
How did you do that?

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.720
Youve gotta look at the packaging, buddy.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.980
This is for big kids.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.310
5 and up.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.350
You know what?

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.150
F*ck your face.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.540
Im out of here.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.770
Do you want me to autograph a picture of you?

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.850
Probably worth as much money.
