JENNY MURPHY: Hey everyone.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.500
Welcome to another session
of the Google+

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.620
platform office hours.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.542
So this week we're going to be
watching a really cool demo of

00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:15.430
a really cool hack that was
written by some students at

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.950
University of Washington.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.310
And we have one of them on now
and hopefully some more later

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.310
who will field some questions
and talk a little bit about

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.580
their hacking experience on
the hangout chat platform.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.570
And then after that we're going
to field some questions

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.810
that you either asked ahead
of time, or you

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.810
can ask us live now.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.150
There's actually a link
in the post on

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.180
Google+ developers page.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.180
So I guess to get started let's
do some introductions.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.270
So we're just going
to go around.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.320
First, we're going to start with
everyone in the room here

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.076
at the Google Plex.

00:00:49.076 --> 00:00:52.610
I'm Jenny Murphy, I'm a
developer programs engineer

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.935
here at Google.

00:00:53.935 --> 00:00:56.190
And I work on the Google+
platform,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.900
mostly on the rest APIs.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.500
And I'm also kind of
MCing this video.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.599
And next to me I have--

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.540
MALE SPEAKER 1: I'm [? Trai ?]

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.750
I'm also a developer of
programs engineer.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.670
I also work on the Google+
platform, and I also work on

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.380
the Google API PHP
client library.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.250
JOHN: I'm John Bavary, develop
advocate on Google+.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.830
And I deal a lot with hangouts
and stuff like that.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.700
JENNY MURPHY: And how about our
guests, starting with the

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.350
green background--

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.590
SUI: Hey, I'm Sui.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.550
I'm an undergrad computer
science student from

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.110
University of Washington.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.530
And I'm a senior this year.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.000
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.398
And last but not least--

00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:43.648
Min?

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.140
MIN: Hello, I'm Min.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.260
I'm a computer science
engineering major, and I'm a

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.510
this year too.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.410
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.080
So we're going to
switch over now.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.980
Because they were writing
a hangouts app, we can't

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.990
actually show you a hangouts app
in an on-air hangout yet.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.750
We were going to do the really
crude method of playing a

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.270
video that they recorded of
their really cool hack.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.640
So we're going to switch over
now, so bear with us as we

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.975
switch the microphones around,
we'll be back in a sec.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.290
FEMALE SPEAKER 1:
Hi everybody.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.440
So we viewed this Google hangout
karaoke application,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.600
which is called Google Idol.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.694
Now we are going to give
our brief introduction

00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:37.944
of how to use it.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.610
SUI: So now we will be
showing our search

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.520
and add song feature.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.990
So we're going to go to add
song, and then we're going to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.210
look for Britney Spears.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.235
FEMALE SPEAKER 1:
I can't scroll.

00:02:57.235 --> 00:03:03.070
SUI: Baby one more time.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.160
Click Search, and there will
be a bunch of videos.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.010
I think maybe this one
might be nice.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.230
And I have just clicked on this
music video and then it

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.955
will add it to the queue that
we have on the left.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.390
On the right we see buttons for
different sound effects.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.280
So here we have doh sound, doh,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.620
laughing sound, [LAUGHTER]

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.270
Applauding,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.810
And

boos, [BOOING]

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.780
And at any time during the song
session users can click

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.840
on the sounds to make
sound effects.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.660
And we also have two
instrumental sounds that can

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.506
be also played at any time.

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:01.392
So a drum.

00:04:01.392 --> 00:04:03.170
[DRUM BEATS]

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.740
And also piano.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.920
[PIANO MUSIC]

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.830
And the users can use these
to enhance their karaoke

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.080
experience.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.899
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: And to play a
video, or karaoke video, we

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.675
can just click on the
video in this song

00:04:23.675 --> 00:04:26.110
queue area to our left--

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.460
so, click.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.840
And it appears in the
center screen.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.770
SUI: For the demo, we decided
to sing jingle bells.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.170
We had other songs in the
previous version of the demo,

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.790
but because of

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.600
copyright issues [BOOING]

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.840
We tried to look for songs that
were written way before

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.510
the copyright years.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.485
And so here's jingle bells.

00:04:53.485 --> 00:05:04.730
[JINGLE BELLS PLAYING]

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:18.440
[GIRLS SINGING JINGLE BELLS]

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:39.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.295
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Why am I the
only person singing here?

00:05:43.295 --> 00:06:43.324
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:43.324 --> 00:06:48.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.090
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: One cool
feature of our app is the real

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.060
time voting.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.940
So while someone is performing,
or at any time, we

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.410
can all cast votes.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.160
So here I'll cast vote two.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.720
And SUI, vote something.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.400
And then Min--

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.330
Min?

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.950
OK.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.880
And in real time our
vote changes.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.810
So it reflects what we think
about the current song and

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.060
current performance.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:34.520
SUI: So now you can see the
spotlight in front.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.770
MIN: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.050
SUI: So the speed of
light is actually

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.760
controlled by your volume.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.980
So let's see--

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.240
so whenever like one of the
persons is making some noise

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.515
the dots are speed up.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.040
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Min,
say something.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.310
SUI: I don't see the dots.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.935
SUI: I see it.

00:08:03.935 --> 00:08:06.320
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I see it.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.250
Keep talking.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.480
Min, keep talking.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:10.680
MIN: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.480
SUI: Just say something.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.730
Say hi.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.330
MIN: Hi.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.115
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:08:21.115 --> 00:08:22.032
SUI: That's so cool.

00:08:22.032 --> 00:08:23.180
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.290
JENNY MURPHY: OK, so you've now
seen a hangout app running

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:32.799
in a video, in a web browser, in
a hangout, screen share, in

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:33.485
your web browser.

00:08:33.485 --> 00:08:36.440
So if that wasn't enough
pillaring and letter-boxing, I

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.010
don't know what is.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.710
In post production we're
going to clean that up.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.390
So if you didn't get a great
view of that video it will be

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.070
spliced in once we upload
to YouTube.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.280
So thanks for bearing with
us with that experiment.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.900
But, the app was awesome.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.380
MIN: Thank you.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.140
JENNY MURPHY: Really cool.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.800
Really cool work.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.840
So if you don't mind, I'd like
to ask you guys a couple

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.250
questions, or five questions
about your development

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.980
experience.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.720
Just chime in, either of
you or you both can

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.100
answer it if you like.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.530
So, have either of you or did
anyone on your team have any

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.380
development experience writing
real time applications like

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.190
that before--

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.720
where there's collaboration
between a bunch of people?

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.810
SUI: I have done some real time

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.230
chatting application before.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.490
But it wasn't like
real time gaming.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:32.010
And I also had done a couple
of other hackathon events.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.750
For [? arrow ?]

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:40.460
I built this little I enjoy a
game application for toddler.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.700
And it was like a mask game,
using speech recognition

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.760
technology.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.110
But I don't think I have done
any social gaming things.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.360
That's my experience.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:02.795
MIN: For me I really didn't
have any experience before

00:10:02.795 --> 00:10:05.740
doing the hangout app.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.790
I mainly just developing
web applications,

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.050
nothing real time.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.640
Or not to be any real
time aspect to it.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.770
So yeah, that was the
first time for me.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.160
JOHN: I just want to know,
what was your first time

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.998
experience since you guys
never really had done

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:26.464
anything like that?

00:10:26.464 --> 00:10:29.831
Has it been hard, was there
a learning curve?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:38.050
SUI: Yeah, I think the hardest
part actually was the initial

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.100
set up stage and then the
final integration stage.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.245
So we had to start one day
before to get familiar with

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:49.350
the API, and then try to set
up the simple application.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.290
And to make sure all the

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.440
configuration are set up correctly.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:02.510
And also, I think our goal with
hangout API was using

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.490
sort of live socket
technology.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.870
So we have a lot
of [? states--

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.850
like state, exchange state,
those kind of things.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.080
I haven't really done
those things before.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.070
So you it take a while to get
familiar with a concept like

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.268
how to add space and remote
space, and then exchange

00:11:22.268 --> 00:11:23.360
things, those kind of things.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.410
JOHN: So when you say a while,
how long was the hackathon?

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.410
SUI: It was 24 hours.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.180
JOHN: OK, OK.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.380
Relatively short in the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.950
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, so did you
guys actually do all that

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.420
development in 24 hours
during the hackathon?

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.940
Because that's a really
polished hack.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.370
SUI: Yeah, well, I would
say it wasn't that

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.350
polished after 24 hours.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:52.180
I had to spend a day
afterwards to

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.580
actually polish the UI.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.880
But for limited to that
24 hours, I think

00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.890
we did a good job.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.820
And we actually used up
the entire 24 hours.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.650
We didn't get any sleep
at all, that was hard.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.930
But we were really determined
though.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.850
We think we are going
to win something.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.680
JENNY MURPHY: Wow, that's really
some dedication there.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.730
That's very impressive.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.340
So while you were developing it,
what did you find the most

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.820
challenging part of
your experience?

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.140
SUI: Min, you want to take it?

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.030
MIN: Well, I think because we
weren't familiar with the API

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:39.210
itself we had to read a
lot of documentation.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:49.430
So before the competition we
were sort of experimenting

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.510
with the sample applications.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:58.460
And so that helped a little bit,
but when we actually were

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:08.420
developing application we did
use some of their codes

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.340
tailored to our application.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:16.500
But it's always very limited
in some aspects.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:22.290
And so, I guess the learning
curve to learn the API and the

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.420
technologies, and the very fact
that we're just using

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.780
javascript to make an
application was a

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.475
challenge in itself.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.700
Other than that--

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.610
I guess a trying challenge was
the fact that we couldn't do

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.770
the main feature that
we were thinking of.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:52.940
So we were trying to cope with a
way to share the video after

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.190
the hangout.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:01.070
So we're recording a video and
audio files and then sharing

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.110
it, that was our goal.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:08.490
At that time I don't think the
Google API supported that, at

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.090
least not to my knowledge.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.800
And so we had to work
around that and

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.050
come up with new features.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:22.590
So I guess that was our biggest
challenge, other than

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.690
the developing aspect.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.860
JENNY MURPHY: Well given the
challenges you faced you guys

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.910
did some amazing stuff.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.070
So this kind of leads into
my next question--

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.420
what is on your dream list
for hangouts apps?

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.660
What feature would you really
like to see added to the

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.960
platform for this application,
or any other things you're

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.130
brainstorming?

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.800
SUI: OK, so as he mentioned
before, we were really

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.650
expecting doing the
recording part.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:54.120
But I know a Google hangout
has recording feature, but

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.540
maybe not for API
to my knowledge.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.590
JENNY MURPHY: You're right,
it's not available yet.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:07.310
SUI: OK, so we were thinking it
would be cool to recap the

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.660
entire karaoke experience, and
people were having a lot of

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.540
fun afterward.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.990
And another thing we
were thinking--

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:22.780
was there a way to manipulate
the speaker's voice so we can

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.610
add more DJ mixing effects
like autotune

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.000
those kind of things--

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.680
so make the experience fuller.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.960
JENNY MURPHY: That would be
really cool, autotune and then

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.950
hangout karaoke.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.320
That would help a lot
of us singers.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.160
Very cool.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.130
So, now that you've written that
neat application, what's

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.460
next for that app?

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.190
Are you going to continue
development on it?

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.690
SUI: Yeah--

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.040
I don't know but them.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.790
I definitely want to keep
doing, working on this.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:07.415
And if possible we can
collaborate with people from

00:16:07.415 --> 00:16:10.780
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], or collaborate
with the API so it

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:16.170
can more exposed to a more
available technology we can

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.850
use and into our application.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:25.910
JENNY MURPHY: Great, great.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.110
Well that's all the questions
on my list for you today.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.220
So do you guys have anything
you'd like to add before we go

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.825
and field questions from
the community?

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:40.410
SUI: Not really.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.285
JOHN: I was going to ask--

00:16:42.285 --> 00:16:44.058
you talked about how you were
going to enhance this app, do

00:16:44.058 --> 00:16:45.810
you have any ideas for
a new app that you

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.490
guys are looking at?

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.910
SUI: A new app?

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.131
JOHN: Yeah, do you have any
crazy things you want to start

00:16:51.131 --> 00:16:57.550
in maybe in more
than 24 hours.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.350
SUI: Maybe not a Google hangout
application, but there

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.830
are a lot of a mobile
application I want to make.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.825
Maybe a Google hangout
mobile application.

00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:07.830
A mobile version of this.

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:08.270
JOHN: Good.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.710
Cool idea.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.587
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, there's a
lot of good features there.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:14.380
JENNY MURPHY: If we have
features like that, you'll be

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.609
the first to hear.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.609
We'll let you know right away.

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:18.930
SUI: Yeah, I'm looking
forward to it.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.190
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.640
OK, so shall we switch over and
answer some questions from

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.230
the web developer community?

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:33.520
JOHN: So we, as always, we put
on our admins page the topic

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.720
for the speaker, a description
of the office hours, and then

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.480
he will present inline comments
and questions they

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.564
have. As usual we have a bunch
of feature requests, which we

00:17:41.564 --> 00:17:44.320
are always happy to see and
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] as feedback.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.020
We would like to throw those
off to the feedback tool.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.610
And as we mentioned, there's a
feedback tool in the lower

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:53.670
left hand side.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.670
That's the best place to submit
feature requests around

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.310
the web experience--

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.307
each mobile app has
it's feedback

00:18:01.307 --> 00:18:03.470
mechanism for that as well.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.170
But for development questions,
we have a few.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:09.980
JENNY MURPHY: Do you want ask
the media server one?

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.170
JOHN: So Joshua asked
about media servers.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.010
So his question is, in the media
server app example, it

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.190
mentions only one media resource
can be active at a

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.210
time, image or audio.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.960
Does this mean I use the hide
the image, overlay the play

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.140
the audio file and vice versa?

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.010
Does it mean I can have
one of each type?

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:29.120
So this is a good question.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.380
Definitely for anybody who
hasn't looked at the media

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.560
stuff, it's really awesome and
interesting part of our API.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.380
The way the plug-in works--

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.445
if you overlay an image, or if
you play a sound, that uses a

00:18:41.445 --> 00:18:43.070
piece of memory.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.700
And in the first release, memory
management it was good

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.980
but limited.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.560
So we recommend only to do one
overlay at a time and not to

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.040
swap to many, because then
you're going to run into these

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.130
bad states memory.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.130
The plug-in is being constantly
improved, so we've

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.240
got to get to a place where
you actually have multiple

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.080
overlays and swap
between them.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.980
This would give you
animation effect.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.790
You could try that today, but
it's probably going to work.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.708
And different systems with
more or less memory will

00:19:11.708 --> 00:19:12.980
behave differently.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.790
In subsequent releases, we're
just improving the plug-in

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.610
better and better.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.780
So you can now reliably
do that.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.710
I haven't tested it lately,
but there will an upcoming

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.240
plug-in update that should
be able to support that.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.950
The API won't change, so you
still do that with the API

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.730
today, just better memory
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:32.920
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.200
So I'm going to ask a question
of you, Jonathan.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.630
So it appears several
places in the

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.120
stream, people are asking--

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.820
how do I get hangouts on air?

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:44.110
JOHN: Yes, I actually
posted to our common

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:48.320
FAQs in that thread.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.650
Right now, users are selected
by Google who can host

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.420
hangouts on air.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.995
They reach out to us, we're
expanding this growing white

00:19:56.995 --> 00:20:00.770
list and of course reach out and
we'll try to see if we can

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:01.740
accommodate you.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.880
As we're building out the
infrastructure, as we're

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.580
building up the product, we're
slowly adding people to that

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.920
user base when it's ready
for mobile and general

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.420
availability.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.670
The + pages are great places
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:16.920
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.790
JOHN: Ah--

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.640
JENNY MURPHY: Sure.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.940
So I'll ask another one.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.060
So [? Kosokay ?] asks, when can
we expect to have a menu

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.510
on the left with that lists all
the Google and we have 1.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.950
Not referring to the profile tab
which lists external sites

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:41.900
we've +1, but instead the
content that's in Google .

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:46.670
To many of us here this is the
missing important feature.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.060
There are favorite posts, it
would be incredibly useful to

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:55.120
have that list. Answer it.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.610
So this is a great feature
request for the Google

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.020
application.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.340
It's not something well
that's really key to

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.330
the platform itself.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.960
So we really can can't
talk to it too much.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.650
But, there's a great little
send feedback tool in the

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.490
bottom corner of-- depending
which language you're using--

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.360
bottom left or bottom right
corner of Plus.google.com.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.000
So I strongly recommend you take
this feedback, hit that

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.790
button, and then describe
it in detail.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.310
And all that feedback
gets read.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:27.250
It all goes to a person, you
may not get a reply.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.300
But some of it gets aggregated
and we listen to all of it.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.365
JOHN: OK, apparently my volume
is a little bit low, so I'm

00:21:38.365 --> 00:21:40.200
going to try to speak a little
bit louder, it wasn't a

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.430
problem last time.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.270
Jean-Francois--

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.020
I'm not that much of
a [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.160
Jean asks, geolocation for
hangout members displayed in

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.070
the hangout?

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.630
And that's a great idea.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.580
Certainly it's something
that you

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.460
integrate into the hangout.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.460
I'll take that as feedback
for the hangouts team.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.650
But if you're interested in
coding, that sounds like a

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:02.900
cool little add-on.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:08.760
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.700
So another question, which is
not in the comment stream, but

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.030
I've been hearing a little bit
lately is, what is with the

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.480
new profile badge?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.970
So if you didn't notice,
yesterday we released a new

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.490
feature for the Google platform,
we released a new

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.000
social plug-in.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.940
And it is a badge, just like the
badge that was previously

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.090
available for your Google pages,
except it works for

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.350
your profile.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:34.620
And let me actually bring up
an example on the website.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:40.400
You can see it in action.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.790
So I've zoomed in here
quite a bit.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.550
You can see that I've just taken
my personal hub page,

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.910
and I've just added
the Google badge.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.910
And what it allows you to do is,
it allows visitors to your

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.470
website to easily add you
to one of their circles.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.290
So if you have a hub page, or a
personal profile page that's

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.860
on a website, like your blog for
example, this is a great

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.710
feature you can put there.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.750
Let me actually show you the
configuration tool for it.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.180
So like everything else,
you can start at

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:11.200
developers.google.com/plus
and you can find it

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.370
on the plug-in section.

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.110
It's under badge--

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.520
and now badge has two different
configuration tools.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.930
And there are two configuration
tools because

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.980
they're just a little
bit different.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.060
When you go to this page, if
you're logged in to Google

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.210
developers, you're going to
see your badge right away.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.340
It's going to pre-populate
your profile ID.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.370
If it doesn't pre-populate,
you can hit a button that

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:37.900
would be over here to login.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.060
And it will get at all set up.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.270
Just like the other badge, the
configuration options allow

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.460
you to change the color--

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.780
so like for my darker layout.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.920
You can also change the width
so it will fit in different

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.600
spots, so you can make it 100
pixels across, for example.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.690
And the badge above
will change to

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.450
reflect those tweaks.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.360
And then scrolling down,
you get the code

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.900
which is right here.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.830
Which is just a few different
chunks of code which you paste

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.653
into your website, and
then the badge

00:24:08.653 --> 00:24:10.320
will just start working.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.320
So the first start is the
authorship link, which is just

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.210
how we figure out that link
between your profile page and

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:21.350
your webpage and validate
that link.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.970
The next section is a big
chunk of JavaScript.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.450
And this asynchronously
loads the JavaScript

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.800
that renders the badge.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.136
Let me try to make it a little
bit bigger, it's

00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:32.910
kind of small up there.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.295
This asynchronously includes a
JavaScript that will render

00:24:36.295 --> 00:24:39.000
the badge, and if you notice
it's identical to all the

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.840
other social plug-ins.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.930
So if you're using a different
social plug-in like the 1

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.210
button, you don't need
to add this again.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.660
And finally is the
badge itself.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.760
So this code at the bottom--

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.440
zoom in a little more--

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.960
is the code for the
badge itself.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.860
So you place this on your
page where you want

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.740
the badge to render.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.080
And this is automatically
updated based on the changes

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.570
you made above.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.950
So that's the new profile badge,
don't check it out.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.890
And if you have any questions
you know where to find us.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.960
JOHN: I just want to add
approach-- you mention that if

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.890
you're logged in it
automatically

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:13.340
adds your Google ID.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.960
But if you are building a site
for somebody else or for a

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.060
friend, you can actually take
their Google ID off their

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.090
profile and create
a badge for them.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.000
Right?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.090
JENNY MURPHY: That's correct.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:27.470
So if you go to somebody's
profile page--

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.530
let me zoom in quite a bit--

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.350
you can see their ID is this
number that's in the URL when

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:35.810
you're viewing their profile.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:37.680
So if I'm viewing this person's
profile, who just

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.330
happens to be me in this silly
example, I can go over and

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:42.620
paste it into here.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.990
I just pasted the same number
over it because it's me.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:50.310
And then it will create a
badge for that person.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:54.300
JOHN: We have a follow
up from Joshua--

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.370
when the app is hidden because
of clicking on the full video

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.620
feed or settings, et cetera,
then the app tab seems to

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.130
trigger the app to load again
including API ready.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.530
Is this intended or do we detect
if the app has been

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.910
previously loaded, this
will not call

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.620
unique functions again.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:16.170
So, I the answer to your
second question

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.480
is we have is visible--

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.660
I'd have to call back on
register whether or not the

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.910
app is being currently shown.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:28.020
I'll have to reach out to you
directly to see what you mean.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.560
Because that might just be a
bug because the developer

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.270
sandbox is this custom
environment.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.720
Yeah, that sounds like to
a bug to me, and we

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.040
can look into it.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.910
But for the visibility stuff,
yeah, there's a user callback

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.920
for is visible, I believe, the
right [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.582
And then you can say whether or
not your app is being used

00:26:47.582 --> 00:26:50.020
by the correct [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.970
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, hangouts
apps are still in developer

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.936
preview, so there occasionally
are little bumps

00:26:53.936 --> 00:26:56.280
and bugs like that.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.110
Thanks for pointing
it out to us.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.950
We'll dig into it after
we finish recording.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:06.070
Did you verify that you gave
him the correct call?

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.530
JOHN: It's different, a little
bit different, Because we

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:11.900
renamed the app, the
events in v0.2.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.300
But is on app visible
dot ad or Google.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.350
So if you go to
developers.googleplus.com

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:23.470
click on the hangouts link,
there's an API reference.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.370
And that has all of our events,
I'm sure you are

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.260
looking at it, for anybody
who hasn't seen it.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.580
In the hangouts name
space we have--

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.900
is the API ready?

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.770
Is the app visible?

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:34.840
Things like that.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.120
So your app can be reacted
to states.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:45.110
JENNY MURPHY: Great So we're
going to check the questions

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.840
feed one more time, but
we may be pretty much

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.510
done for this week.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.840
Does anyone in the room have
anything they'd like to

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:58.850
discuss or ask questions
about at this time?

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.190
Great.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:04.450
SUI: I just have a
question, sorry.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.570
I just wondering to do we have
a way to publish application?

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.365
Is there like an app store or
a market or something for

00:28:11.365 --> 00:28:14.500
Google hangout application?

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.830
JOHN: The platform itself is
still in developer preview.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.400
During the developer preview,
the only way to add additional

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.120
users is directly to include
them into your team.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.310
SUI: OK.

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.590
JOHN: In terms of distribution,

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.350
discovery, and all that.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.700
That will be defined and
revealed once we

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.520
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.200
preview as something general.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.580
Certainly the idea is
to not use as toys.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.590
And to have people actually
use and enjoy your apps.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.450
So more information on that will
be coming as available.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.740
JENNY MURPHY: In other words,
we're working on it, hang

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:49.056
tight, it'll be awesome
when it's ready.

00:28:49.056 --> 00:28:49.500
SUI: All right.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.513
JENNY MURPHY: I promise
awesome.

00:28:50.513 --> 00:28:53.275
JOHN: I +1 that.

00:28:53.275 --> 00:28:53.569
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:28:53.569 --> 00:28:54.460
Well, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.480
MIN: I have one other
question--

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.700
I was having trouble getting
onto the hangout because it

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.220
kept freezing up when I
was trying to join.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:13.110
What ended up solving was I
excited the Gmail and or the

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:18.000
Google+ page once I joined
the hangout.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.260
Like right before you entered
the hangout, I excited all the

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.130
other application
and it worked.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.470
Is that a bug on my part?

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:32.311
I think our other teammate is
having the same problem.

00:29:32.311 --> 00:29:34.390
She couldn't join because
it was keep freezing.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.000
JOHN: My first reaction is it
might be a bug in the plug-in.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Or a particular bug given
your environment

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.690
and operating system.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.860
After this we'll just chat to
learn about your particular

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.370
set up and see if you have
an old plug-in version.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.920
There's a couple of scenarios
where that might be the issue.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.354
But yeah, the point of hangout
is to be part of hangout.

00:29:58.354 --> 00:30:01.230
They classify that as a bug.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:02.530
MIN: Right.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.910
JENNY MURPHY: Well, I think
that unless anyone has

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.960
anything else they'd like to
chat about, I think that wraps

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.610
it up for this week.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.010
So thanks all for bearing with
us, everyone out there.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.290
It took us a couple more
minutes to get

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.060
started than usual.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.140
And the video was
tiny, I know.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.150
But check it out in the polished
version that we'll be

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:23.758
posting to
YouTube.com/googledevelopers.

00:30:23.758 --> 00:30:25.270
All right, bye everybody.
