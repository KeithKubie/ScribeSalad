00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One of the other interesting observations about customer development

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is this notion of the pivot.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The pivot was a term that my best student ever Eric Reese coined

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
when he noticed the arrow between customer validation

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and customer discovery, and he actually gave it a name,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which I think is incredibly accurate.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
A pivot says what do you do when your hypotheses

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
don't meet reality?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And this is such a neat observation about startups

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and why what we now know is much different than before.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What we now know instead of firing executives

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
when our business model doesn't match what's going on

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
outside in the real world we fire the model,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and we simply say, "Hey, our hypotheses were wrong,"

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
so because we've been building the product iteratively and incrementally

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and keeping our burn rate incredibly low

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a pivot is a substantive change to one or more of the business model components.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It just simply says, "Hey, this isn't our customer segment."

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
"Our customer segment is really here," or "Wait a minute."

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
"Our revenue model shouldn't be freemium."

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
"We should be charging for it from day 1," or "Wait a minute."

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
"We've been using the wrong distribution channel."

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
"We need a direct sales force," or "Gee, we have the wrong partners."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
By the way, an iteration is a minor change to one or more

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
of the business model components.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
For example, an iteration would be going from charging from

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
$9.99 to $6.99.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
A pivot would be a change of "Gee, our pricing is going from freemium to subscription."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That's a substantive change.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The key idea here is a pivot allows you to get out

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and make changes.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Remember, typically only the founders could do pivots,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
but it's actually the heart of what makes customer development

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
radically different than what's come before.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The other thing to notice about pivots

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
is that you want to keep them up

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
at a constant speed and a constant tempo,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and you want your entire company operating with speed and tempo

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in decision making just like a metronome.

00:02:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It's constant, it's consistent, and it's relentless.
