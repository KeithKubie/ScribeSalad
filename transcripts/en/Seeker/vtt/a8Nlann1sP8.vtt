00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.549
Sexsomnia: it sounds like a made-up disease,
but ask any psychiatrist and they’ll tell

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.059
you it’s very real, and very, very serious.

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:18.490
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - with what
is quite possibly, one of the weirdest afflictions

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.980
we’ve seen yet, here on Dnews.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.769
A man from Sweden was recently acquitted of
rape, after it was revealed that he suffers

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.700
from sexsomnia - which is a fancy way of saying
“sleep-sexing.”

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.220
According to officials, the man had no recollection
of the incident, and was completely asleep

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.380
while it happened.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.300
Turns out his ex-girlfriend, also claimed
that he once tried to have sex with HER while

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.000
asleep, but she stopped him - at which point
he woke up, acting confused and asking what

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
had happened.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.700
Now whether or not you believe THIS guy’s
story, it turns out sexsomnia is a very real

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.640
disorder - and this isn’t the first time
it’s been used to acquit someone of rape

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.640
charges.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.150
So what is sexsomnia?

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.520
And how common is it really?

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.260
Well, the disorder was first described in
1996, but the actual term ‘sexsomnia’

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.170
wasn’t coined until 2003, when researchers
published an article in the Canadian Journal

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.619
of Psychiatry describing 11 different cases
of people who had engaged in sexual behaviors

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.619
while asleep.

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.930
Technically, it falls into the category of
parasomnias - sleep disorders, which is what

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.399
happens when your brain gets caught in between
the stages of falling asleep and waking up.

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.999
Now typically, when you sleep - you go through
cycles consisting of 4 distinct stages.

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:30.530
The first 3 stages, are what we call Non-rapid
eye movement, or NREM, sleep.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.979
This is when your brain is still functioning
relatively normally - and your mental activity

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.210
is very thought-like and organized.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.909
The 4th and final stage of sleep, is rapid-eye
movement, or REM.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.310
And this is your deepest form of sleep - your
muscles become paralyzed, your eyes are quickly

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.170
darting back and forth, and you tend to have
very bizarre, almost hallucinogenic dreams.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.369
Sexsomnia, like most other sleep disorders,
happens during those first 3 phases - NREM.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.090
So people who don’t progress through the
sleeping stages normally, for whatever reason

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.039
- will get stuck in NREM sleep.

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.819
And because your muscles aren’t paralyzed
during that phase, you can still move freely

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.320
- even though technically, you are asleep.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.190
Medically speaking, it’s an extremely rare
disorder, affecting less than 1% of the population.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.560
But there are outside factors that can trigger
an episode: stress, sleep deprivation, sleeping

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.090
pills, excessive consumption of alcohol or
drugs, and physical contact with another person

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.370
in bed, can all increase the likelihood of
an episode occurring.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.000
The two most common types of parasomnia, sleep-walking
and sleep-talking, typically co-exist with

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
sexsomnia.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.760
So for cases like the one in Sweden, doctors
will usually look for a history of those other

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.980
disorders, when determining their diagnosis.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.170
Unfortunately, as devastating as sexsomnia
can be for its sufferers, and their victims

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.920
- there’s really no “cure” for the disorder.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.200
Most doctors just recommend that you completely
avoid any and all triggers.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.700
But in extreme cases, the first line of treatment
is usually Clonazepam, also known as Klonopin

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.060
here in the US.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.450
Sadly, that’s only a short-term solution,
since Klonopin is a benzodiazepine - which

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.090
is one of the most highly addictive classes
of drugs out there.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.591
Now - switching gears for a second, I wanna
remind all you guys that I host another another

00:03:09.591 --> 00:03:14.370
show here on Discovery called TestTube, that’s
a lot like Dnews - but more focused towards

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.430
current events.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.070
Trace hosted an episode recently on the legalization
of marijuana, and what the real effects of

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.650
those laws are.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:31.520
So if you’re interested in learning more,
you can find that episode - along with many

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.010
others - over at youtube.com/testtubenetwork.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:43.910
In the meantime, let us know in the comments
below - if you, or anyone you know, has ever

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.050
suffered from sexsomnia.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.010
That’s it for me, but as always - thank
you guys for watching!
