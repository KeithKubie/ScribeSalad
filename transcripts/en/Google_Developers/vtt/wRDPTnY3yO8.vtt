&gt;&gt; TENG: Hi there, my name is Karen Teng,
and I lead the development effort over at

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.680
Adaptive Blue. Adaptive Blue is a New York-based
startup, focused on using semantic technologies

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.689
to create a better web browsing experience.
&gt;&gt; What is your extension about?

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.770
&gt;&gt; TENG: Get Glue is an innovative social
recommendation network from movies, books,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.140
and music. The Get Glue browser extension
brings filtered friend reviews, personal recommendations,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.270
and contextual content to popular sites around
the web, such as Wikipedia, Amazon, IMDB,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.720
and hundreds more. Get Glue can understand
that you're on a page about a recognized object,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.390
like a movie, book, or album. When that happens,
it calls the Get Glue API, which then determines

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.680
which object it is. The Get Glue API also
returns information about that object, like

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.000
core information, recent visitors, and similar
things. The output from these calls are then

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.390
transformed via XSL to create the HTML of
the Get Glue bar.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.770
&gt;&gt; How does Glue determine what is currently
being viewed by the user?

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.710
&gt;&gt; TENG: Each object on Get Glue has its own
identifier that is generated from its primary

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.799
key attributes. These key attributes are category
specific. For example, books can be identified

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.950
by title and author, and movies by title and
director. When somebody visits a book on a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.920
recognized site, we extract the title and
author from the page, and query a semantic

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.170
database to find a match. Querying a centralized
and authoritative source helps us normalize

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.090
across different spellings and editions to
ensure that the same book across sites is

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.479
recognized. Semantic DBs are also category
specific. For example, we use Amazon for books

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.479
and Netflix for movies.
&gt;&gt; Why do Glue's social features belong in

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.149
the browser?
&gt;&gt; TENG: The browser acts as a lens as the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.840
user surfs around the web. And this lens is
an ideal layer to introduce contextually correct,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.579
highly relevant information for the user.
Social connections happen to be a specific

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.270
type of contextual information that can be
surfaced by the browser. Get Glue is capable

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.529
of understanding the context of a page, and
is then able to pull in the right contextual

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:09.229
information from across the web automatically
onto the page. The extension pulls information

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.640
that provides the best experience for the
user, regardless of what the website operator

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.640
wants to surface on their page. For example,
when a user looks at a movie on Amazon, they

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.680
cannot only see filtered friend reviews for
that movie, via the Get Glue extension, but

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.540
they can also watch the trailer, or add it
directly to their Netflix queue.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.530
&gt;&gt; What was your experience like developing
a Google Chrome extension?

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.350
&gt;&gt; TENG: We found that developing an extension
for Chrome was a different experience than

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.420
doing it for Firefox and Internet Explorer.
The main difference is in the philosophy and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.660
the architecture of Chrome add-ons, which
in turn guided us to a different kind of implementation.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.790
Get Glue is a sophisticated add-on, which
includes semantic analysis of information

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.500
on the pages, focuses on the content of hundreds
of popular sites, and surfaces friends' recommendations.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.350
Basically, it wasn't exactly trivial, and
the port to Chrome required substantial effort.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.300
Our main focus was on preserving a common
code base between the browsers while fitting

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.020
into Chrome's model of background pages and
content scripts. Once we've figured out the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.810
best way to re-factor our code to make the
two sides communicate, the process became

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.820
straightforward. Overall, we found the Chrome
platform to be very flexible easy to code

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.100
on. The documentation forms were excellent.
&gt;&gt; How did your vision evolve as you were

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.100
working on your extension?
&gt;&gt; TENG: Since we already had a working extension

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.761
for Firefox and Internet Explorer, our main
focus was on building the Chrome extension

00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:31.510
in a way that fit our architecture, and reuse
most of the code. Throughout the process,

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.530
we've focused on optimizing our code, ensuring
that the extension worked quickly and did

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.230
not degrade the user's main experience, which
is surfing the web.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.230
&gt;&gt; What were some challenges you faced when
writing your extension?

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.100
&gt;&gt; TENG: One area that gave us trouble when
porting the extension was that there was an

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.930
architectural mismatch. Our code was relying
on synchronous calls which were impossible

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.290
within Chrome. So, we mimicked the behavior
of synchronous requests by creating a cache

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.400
facade within the content script. This is
done based on the suggestion from the Chrome

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.280
team, who was very helpful throughout the
entire process of the port.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.250
&gt;&gt; How did you promote your extension?
&gt;&gt; TENG: It's important for an extension developer

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.391
to find additional promotional opportunities
beyond the great value that the extension

00:04:11.391 --> 00:04:15.260
gallery provides. Promoting the extension
on the Get Glue website has definitely helped

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.079
with adoption. We show a specific "add to
your browser button" for Chrome users that

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.190
includes a Chrome logo, and we've heard that
the familiarity helps them convert. The Get

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.510
Glue service rewards users for specific achievements
by awarding them with stickers. Individuals

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.510
are prompted to add the extension in order
to earn a unique sticker called "add-on adhesive".

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.639
&gt;&gt; What advice can you give someone before
starting to work on a Google Chrome extension?

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.780
&gt;&gt; TENG: The advice is to think about whether
they're building a cross-browser solution,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.910
or just for Chrome. If the extension is for
Chrome only, then it should be designed to

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.910
take maximum advantage of Chrome's infrastructure,
and native UI. If the goal is to build a cross-browser

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.190
solution, then a lot more time needs to be
spent in the architectural phase and making

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.340
sure that mismatches between the platforms
are understood and accounted for.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.889
&gt;&gt; What are the next steps for your extension
and your involvement with the platform?

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.920
&gt;&gt; TENG: We're solely focused on a single
Get Glue extension. We follow an aggressive

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.020
release schedule and are routinely shipping
updates for the extension. It's great that

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.490
Chrome makes the upgrade process so seamless
for us, so that we can be confident that everybody

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.590
is on the most recent version. We've upgraded
twice already and both times, it's been seamless

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.380
and awesome.
&gt;&gt; Come meet the Adaptive Blue team at the

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.750
Google IO conference.
