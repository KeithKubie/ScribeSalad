00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.368
Tonight--
[laughs]

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:04.470
Hi, my name is
Anais Fairweather,

00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:07.673
and tonight I'm gonna tell
you the story,

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:13.513
the true story behind
"A League of Their Own."

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.148
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.117
 - We start our story with
 Marge and Helen Callaghan,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.921
 two sisters growing up in
 Vancouver, Canada.

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:24.023
 These two women
 are natural athletes.

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:25.558
 They're so [bleep]
 sick and tight,

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:27.193
 and they're like,

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:30.930
 yeah, we joined a fast-pitch
 softball league together.

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:34.634
 Okay, so now we're gonna fast
 forward a little bit to 1942.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.669
 We're in the midst
 of World War 2,

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:40.039
 and the draft is going
 on full force.

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:43.342
 Now this [bleep]ing guy,
 the commissioner of the MLB,

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:46.212
 Kenesaw Mountain Landis.

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:47.513
[groans]

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:49.148
I hate saying that name.
- [laughs]

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:50.383
 - He's like,

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.819
 I'm the numero uno
 commissioner

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:56.355
 of major league
 and minor league baseball,

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:58.691
 and while I'm calling
 the shots,

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:01.627
 everyone's being [bleep]ing
 drafted into World War 2.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.863
 So he's like, okay,
 I'll put my big boy pants on.

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:05.098
 I'ma figure this out.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.066
 He calls Philip K. Wrigley.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:10.436
 Philip K. Wrigley is, like,
 chomp, chomp, hello?

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.972
 And Kenesaw Mountain Landis
 is like,

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:16.008
 oh, my man,
 3,000 minor league players,

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:18.411
 major league players
 are gone to war.

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:19.912
 So Philip K. Wrigley's like,

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.381
 okay,
 I've got an idea for you.

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:24.550
 We are gonna capitalize

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:28.221
 on the popularity
 of women softball.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.789
 Badass women.

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:32.625
And it's, like,
the '40s, right?

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:35.628
That's--that's a crazy time
to do this.

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:39.899
 So Philip K. Wrigley
 and his buddy, Ken Sells,

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.969
 go out scouting
 all throughout the Midwest.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.571
 And lo and behold,
 who did they run into

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.507
 but Helen and Marge Callaghan.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.875
 - What are they doing there?

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:52.578
 - They are playing
 fast-pitch softball,

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:55.314
 and Helen and Marge are like,

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:59.519
 uh, we are dominating
 this field.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.922
 Philip and Ken run out
 to this.

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:04.824
 They run out to the field
 and they're like,

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:07.426
 you, the both of you,
 we need you both.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.095
 You got to be
 on our [bleep]ing team.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:12.498
 And they sign on the
 dotted line at $75 a week.

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:15.668
So they're both on
the Minneapolis Marionettes.

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:20.006
[both laugh]
No, Millerettes.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.341
 So Marge and Helen are like,

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:24.810
 we're on this team,
 this is [bleep]ing tight.

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:26.846
 They're playing
 doubleheaders,

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.215
 in, like, 115 degree weather,

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:30.917
 and Philip K. Wrigley's like,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.485
 I know how to sell a product,

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:36.289
 and I need these women
 to look like women.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.559
 These chaperons are like,
 I am going to make sure

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.894
 that their hair is curled,
 their lipstick is on,

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:43.529
 their makeup is fully done,

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:45.364
 their skirts are ironed

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:47.533
 before they head out
 onto the field.

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:50.236
 People are full to watch
 these women

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.171
 in these adorable dresses

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:54.173
 play [bleep]ing baseball
 like men.

00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:56.842
 And Marge Callaghan,
 Helen Callaghan,

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.679
 are [bleep]ing knocking
 this shit outta the park.

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:02.215
Women are stealing bases.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:04.717
 They're like,
 what's up, mother[bleep]?

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.953
[laughs]

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:10.122
I don't know why that's funny,
but it's funny.

00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:15.561
[both laughing]

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:18.965
Now, Philip K. Wrigley looks
at this and he's like,

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:21.701
 these aren't women
 playing baseball.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:25.905
 These are [bleep]ing
 baseball players.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:28.541
 [bleep] yeah, dude!

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:31.344
 It's so badass, right?

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:35.047
[ice jingling]

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.716
- This is my seventh inning
stretch.

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.952
- This is mine.

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:42.421
- All right, let's play ball.

00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:45.291
- Yeah, okay.

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:50.997
 So 1945 comes, right?
 And World War 2 is ending.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.000
 Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams,

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.736
 the major, minor league
 players come back

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.605
 and they're like,
 hi, everybody, yeah,

00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:01.607
 we've been at [bleep]ing war.
 It's terrible.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.310
 We're ready to hit
 some balls.

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:07.680
 So they--they--and it ends up
 fizzling out.

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:09.882
 30 years passes,

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:13.719
 and this story is forgotten
 until 1985.

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:17.757
 There was a reunion,
 Helen Callan-delays.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.758
 - [laughs]

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.693
- This is harder now

00:04:20.726 --> 00:04:22.061
than it was earlier.

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:23.629
- But you're still doing it.

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:28.701
 - Kelly hand-delay,
 Helen's oldest son, was like,

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:31.103
 I'm gonna [bleep]ing
 record this shit.

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:33.339
 He whips his out
 his camcorder,

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:37.443
 and all these old ladies
 are [bleep]ing playing ball

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:40.913
 like they did
 back in the [bleep]ing '40s.

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:42.615
 Kelly Candaele creates

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:45.084
 "A League of Their Own"
 documentary.

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:46.852
 it's a huge [bleep]ing deal.

00:04:46.885 --> 00:04:49.655
[bleep]ing Penny Marshall sees
this documentary.

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:51.624
 She's like,
 what the [bleep]?

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:54.794
 I didn't know this shit
 existed in history.

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:59.365
 Oh, maybe I should make
 a movie about this story

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:05.504
 because it's important
 for women of all ages.

00:05:05.537 --> 00:05:08.240
 And if it wasn't for
 "A League of Their Own,"

00:05:08.273 --> 00:05:11.110
 nobody would have ever known

00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:16.349
 that women can throw a ball
 like the [bleep]ing men.

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:18.384
 [inspirational music]
