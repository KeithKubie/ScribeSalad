00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.130
The 1700s in Europe
are often referred

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.220
to as the Age of Enlightenment.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.470
It was a time, we'd come
out of the Renaissance.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.850
We'd rediscovered science
and reason and in the 1700s,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.800
we saw that come about with
even more progress of society.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.410
As we exit the 1700s and
enter into the 1800s,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.880
we start having the
Industrial Revolution.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.020
And people saw the steady
march of human reason,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.610
of human progress.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.420
And because of this, a
lot of people were saying,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.760
hey, humanity will
continue to improve.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.080
It will improve
forever, to a point

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.610
that poverty will go away.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.120
We will turn into this
perfect utopian civilization

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.130
without wars, without
strife of any kind.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.295
And there was something
to be said about that.

00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:44.670
You had significant
improvements.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.700
In fact, you had even
more dramatic improvements

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.890
once the Industrial
Revolution started.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.680
But not every one in the
late 1700s was as optimistic.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.660
And one of the more famous
not-so-optimistic people

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.530
was Thomas Malthus,
right over here.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.900
And I will just
quote him directly.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.780
This is from his "Essay on
the Principle of Population."

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.550
"The power of population
is so superior to the power

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.440
of the earth to produce
subsistence for man,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.260
that premature death must,
in some shape or other,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.720
visit the human race."

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.900
Very uplifting.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.340
"The vices of mankind are
active and able ministers

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.050
of depopulation.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.450
They are the precursors in
the great army of destruction,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.550
and often finish the
dreadful work themselves.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.850
But should they fail in
this war of extermination,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.500
sickly seasons,
epidemics, pestilence,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.120
and plague advance in
terrific array, and sweep

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.100
off their thousands
and tens of thousands.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.920
Should success still be
incomplete, gigantic,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.660
inevitable famine
stalks in the rear,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.690
and with one mighty blow
levels the population

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.790
with the food of the world."

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.820
So not so uplifting of a
little quote right over here.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.730
But this was his general sense.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.230
He lived in a time
where people were

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.330
being very optimistic
that progress,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.060
the march of progress,
would go on forever

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.870
until we got to some
utopian civilization.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.990
But from Thomas
Malthus' point of view,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.600
he felt that if people
could reproduce and increase

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.680
the population, they
will, that there's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.890
no way of stopping them.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.630
So from his point
of view, the way

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.460
he saw it-- so let
me on that axis--

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.680
let's say that that
is the population,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.170
and that this axis
right over here,

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.780
let's say that that is time.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.580
So by his thinking--
and everything

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.610
that he'd seen in reality
up to that point would back

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.930
this up-- that if people
had enough food and time,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.060
they would reproduce,
and they would reproduce

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.270
in numbers that would
grow the population.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.930
So in his mind, the population
would just keep on increasing.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.800
It'll just keep on increasing,
until it can't support itself

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.780
anymore, until the actual
productivity of the land

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.430
can't produce enough calories
to feed all of those people.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.450
So in his mind, there would
be some natural upper bound

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.170
based on the actual
amount of food

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.620
that the earth could support.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.320
So let's say that
this is-- let me

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.600
do that in a different
color-- so in his mind,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.220
there was some upper
bound, and once you

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.180
get to that upper
bound, then all

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.026
of a sudden, the vices
of mankind will show up.

00:03:26.026 --> 00:03:27.900
And if those don't start
killing people, then

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.290
all of these other things
will, epidemics, pestilence,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.770
plague, and then famine.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.440
People are actually
starving to death.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.507
So in his mind, once you
got to this level, maybe

00:03:37.507 --> 00:03:39.090
you had a couple of
good crops, people

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.160
are feeling good about
themselves, they overpopulate.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.120
But then, all of a sudden,
you have a bad crop,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.640
or because you have
a bad crop, people

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.190
start fighting over
resources, and wars happen.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.460
Or maybe the population is so
dense that a plague develops.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.060
And then you have a massive
wave of depopulation.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.020
And so you would just
oscillate around this limit.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.090
And this limit some people
refer to as a Malthusian limit,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.020
but it's just really
the limit at which

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.210
the population can
sustain itself.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.090
And from Thomas
Malthus' point of view,

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.770
he did recognize that there
were technological improvements,

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.990
especially in things
like agriculture.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.040
And that this line
was moving up.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.300
He had seen it in
his own lifetime,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.000
that this line had moved up.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.620
But from his point
of view, however

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.450
far you moved this
line up, the population

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.130
will always compensate
for it and catch up to it,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.300
and eventually get to
these Malthusian limit.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.480
And then the same
not-so-positive things

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.620
that he talks about
would actually happen.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.850
And some people now
say, oh Thomas Malthus,

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.000
he was so pessimistic.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.420
He was obviously wrong.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.460
Look at what's happened.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.690
We have so much food on
this planet right now.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.580
We've gone through multiple
agricultural revolutions,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.720
and they are right.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.910
In the last 200
years, since Malthus,

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.420
so since the early
1800s, we really

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.830
have been able to
outstrip population.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.460
So this line up here
has been moving up

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.490
much faster than
even population.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.990
So right now, we actually
do have more calories

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.880
per person on the
planet than we've

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.730
had at any time in history.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.820
But it's not saying that
Thomas Malthus was wrong,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.820
it's just saying that maybe
he was just a little bit

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.386
pessimistic in when that
limit will be reached.

00:05:23.386 --> 00:05:24.760
Now the other
dimension where you

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.560
might say that he was maybe
wrong was in this principle

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.150
that a population will
increase if it can increase.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.440
If there is food, and if there
is time, people will reproduce.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.100
And a good
counterpoint to that is

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.690
what we've now observed in
modern, developed nations.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.150
And so this right over here
shows the population growth.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.380
I got this from the World Bank.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.810
But the population growth of
some modern, developed nations.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.660
And you can see the United
States is pretty low,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.660
but it's still positive.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.560
It's still over half a percent.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.850
But even that adds up
when you compound it.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.520
But if you look over
here, Japan and Germany--

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.860
and Japan and Germany
have less immigration

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.570
than the United States,
especially Japan--

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.250
they are actually negative.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.850
So just this population
left to its own devices,

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.210
especially if you
account for people not

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.530
going across borders, just
the population itself growing,

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.240
they actually have
negative growth.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.670
So there's some reason to
believe that this is evidence

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.540
that Thomas Malthus was wrong,
or not completely right.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.380
He didn't put into account that
maybe once a society becomes

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.130
rich enough and educated
enough, that they might not just

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.680
populate the world, or have
as many kids as they want,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.400
they might try to
do other things

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.050
with their time,
whatever that might be.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.960
So I just wanted to
expose you to this idea.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.070
Time will tell if Thomas
Malthus, if we can always

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.130
keep this line of food
productivity growing faster

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.440
than the population.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.196
And time will tell whether
our populations can become,

00:06:54.196 --> 00:06:55.820
I guess we could say,
developed enough,

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.300
so that they don't inex--
I can never say that word.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.490
They don't always
just keep growing.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.300
Maybe they do become a Japan
or a Germany situation.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.610
And the world
population, especially

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.560
if we have a high
rate of literacy,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.390
eventually does level off.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.870
So it never even has
a chance of hitting up

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.830
against that Malthusian limit.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.880
But I thought I would
introduce you to the idea,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.421
and now you can go
to parties and you

00:07:18.421 --> 00:07:21.820
can talk about things
like Malthusian limits.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.740
And if you want to know
what country is maybe

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.130
closest to the Malthusian
limit right now--

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.750
and we've talked about this
before-- but a good case

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.750
example is something
like Bangladesh.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.570
They are, right now, the
most population-dense country

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:36.130
in the world.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.130
They have 900 people
per square kilometer.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.750
And just to give you a
sense of perspective,

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.209
that's 30 times more dense
than the United States is.

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:46.250
So if you took every person
in the United States,

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.840
and turned them into 30
people in the United States,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.792
that would give you a sense
of how dense Bangladesh is.

00:07:51.792 --> 00:07:53.500
And it's probably due
to a certain degree

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.770
that it's a very fertile land.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.070
The river delta of the
Ganges essentially makes up

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.370
the entire country.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.370
But they do, they have
in the past, had famines.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.080
They've gotten a
little bit beyond that.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.910
But still, you do
have major problems

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.040
with flooding and resources.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.203
So hopefully they'll be able
to stay ahead of the curve.
