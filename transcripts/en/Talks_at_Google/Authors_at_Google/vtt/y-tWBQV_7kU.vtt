00:00:00.948 --> 00:00:03.318
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.810
MARK LEYNER: Thanks for coming.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:15.420
I think I'm going to read from
this book "Gone with the Mind."

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.100
"Gone with the Mind"
is about-- I really--

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.484
that's a questionable word, I
think, about, with my books.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.780
It's a very
indeterminate fluid kind

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.460
of idea, what any of these
things are about in that sense.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.120
But in this book,
there is a kind

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:47.100
of given, which is that I,
in sort of my present state--

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.200
I'm 60.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.460
I am supposed to do a reading
at a mall in New Jersey.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.250
And my mother drives me, which
says something about, I guess,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.390
my feelings about where
my accomplishments at this

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.130
point in my life, that
my mother has to drive me

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.230
to my own reading in a mall.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.400
But it gets worse actually.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.750
The reading is in the
food court of a mall,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.900
and no one comes,
absolutely nobody, zero.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.120
I thought that might happen.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.980
I've been waiting, in doing
readings for this book,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.780
to do one where no
one came and that

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.600
would be-- I would
then have been sucked

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.090
into the vortex of my own book.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.070
You ruined it.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.860
Anyway, no one comes
to the reading.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.650
There are two Panda Express
workers in the food court

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.960
who are sitting sort of
off in the periphery.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.570
And I kind of pretend
they're there for the reading

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.620
and try to include them.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.700
Like I'll say something
and say, right?

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.860
And they'll say, "We're
not at the fucking reading.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.946
We're on break."

00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:51.570
You know, they get
really incensed when

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.350
I try to include them.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.050
So that's sort of the book.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.510
My mother introduces me
for about 40, 50 pages,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.480
talking mostly about
her pregnancy with me

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.890
and what it was like to be a
woman in the late 50s in Jersey

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.390
City, New Jersey
and being pregnant.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.390
And then I come on and really
never get to the reading.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.400
I just sort of do
what I'm doing now.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.240
I just endlessly
contextualize the reading,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.080
but never actually get to it.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.430
And then there's a Q&amp;A.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.230
There are no questions really.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.390
My mother disappears
and I panic.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.930
And I run all over the mall
trying to find her, and find

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.060
her in the ladies room.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.540
And she's in a stall.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.570
And she says, come in.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.810
I want to show you something.

00:02:45.287 --> 00:02:46.870
I don't want to tell
you what happens.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.900
It's just, spoiler alert.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.600
So there's an
interesting character

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.232
in the book called
the Imaginary Intern.

00:02:57.232 --> 00:02:59.440
And I was going to read you
a couple of little things

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.700
about The Imaginary Intern.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.120
But I'm going to wait.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.900
And if there's time,
let's see how we feel.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.100
There's sort of two
little set pieces.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.660
I don't want to
make this too long.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.540
It's in the middle of the summer
and lunchtime in the summer.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.210
So I don't want to
go on and on here.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:22.110
So I'm going to read you a
piece about a job I once had.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.665
And then I'm going to read you
a piece about my urologist.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.620
I have a picture
of my urologist.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.755
I'll show you.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.820
It's a special treat for today.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.250
I'll show you that.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.760
I'll show you that when it's
time, when it's appropriate.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.340
And if, when I'm
all done, you're

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.310
just dying to hear a little
bit about the Imaginary Intern,

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.890
we'll do it.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.650
Let's see.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.561
Let's see how we feel
when it comes to that.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.770
"In the '80s, I had
a job as a waiter

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.490
at a place in Jersey City
called the Summit House.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.320
And one of the first
tables I ever waited on

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.290
was a deuce in restaurant lingo,
a middle aged married couple

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.029
for whom Friday night dinner
at this particular spot

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:22.340
was a custom, a ritual
they'd really spruce up for.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.950
He always in a carefully pressed
polo shirt, seersucker jacket,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.490
and dark slacks, she in some
sort of floral print dress,

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.560
pretty earrings, a pretty
tortoise shell comb

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.700
in her hair, that sort of thing.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.190
The husband pronounced
his Rs as Ws,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.950
a speech defect called
R-labialization,

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.480
most famously portrayed,
of course, by Elmer Fudd.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.200
So this exceedingly pleasant,
exceedingly soft spoken guy

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.140
would, each and
every Friday evening,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.750
invariably order a "Wob
Woy," very "dwy," a "wum"

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.680
and Coke for my wife, the
"pwime" "wib" very "wawe,"

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.170
and the "bwoiled scwod."
'And would it be possible

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.010
for my wife to have
that with "wice"

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.570
instead of "fwench fwies,"'
he'd politely ask each and every

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.980
time.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.780
I never questioned the
authenticity of the order.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.210
Yes, it seemed
improbable that someone

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.930
who couldn't
pronounce the letter R

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.950
would never, just randomly in
the course of events, order

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.320
anything R-less, say a
gin and tonic or a scotch

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.410
or a steak or a veal chop
or spaghetti and meatballs

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.550
or a chicken pot pie.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.550
But I just figured
he knew what he

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.590
liked, knew what his wife
liked, and that was that.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.220
He seemed like a perfectly
decent sort of guy,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.360
and I had absolutely no
reason to doubt his sincerity.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.860
And there'd always be dessert,
the inevitable "bwead" putting

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.200
and "wed" velvet
cake, and at least

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.280
two "bwandies," all
of which added up

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.870
to a hefty check for two
people with a potentially

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.260
substantial tip.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.630
So you want to be as
accommodating as possible.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.690
One Friday night-- this must
have been after waiting on them

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.000
for two or three weeks
in a row, the husband

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.217
asked me some variation on
the question, assuming you

00:06:31.217 --> 00:06:32.800
don't want to be a
professional waiter

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.240
all your life, what do
you really want to do?

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.970
And I said that I wanted
to be a writer someday.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.150
And he said that he and
his wife loved to read.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.740
And I asked who are
your favorite writers.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.080
And he thought for a
moment and he said,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.340
'I love Joseph "Conwad,"
"Waymond" Chandler,

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.680
and especially "Gwaham Gweene."'

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.190
Now at this point, I
remember I did look around,

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.110
feeling momentarily that I might
be being punked in some way,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.940
in some sort of Candid
Camera stunt or something,

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.430
that someone had
put him up to this.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.210
But again, I really
had no reason

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.580
to think-- in fact it seemed
a little crazy for me to think

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.200
that this seemingly
guileless person was

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.110
in on some sort
of elaborate prank

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.120
that was taking
weeks to develop.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.050
And who'd want to do
this to me anyway?

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.250
I barely knew any of the other
waiters or staff at this place.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.660
But still, no R-less writer?

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.820
No Melville, no
Poe, no Hemingway,

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.780
just 'Conwad' and
'Gweene.' I mean, come on.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.600
What are the odds here?

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.080
I was just about to
head back to the kitchen

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.880
to pick up one of my
other table's orders

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.650
when the guy said,
I also love music.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.220
I took a deep breath.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.800
'Oh,' I said.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.100
'What kinds of music?'

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.900
And again he thought
for a moment or two.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:07.300
And then he said, I love
the "Wamones," "Woxy"

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:13.200
Music.' And especially, and
this he said in a much louder,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.200
more declarative voice,
'especially Guns N' "Woses."'

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.180
And at this moment,
I was positive I

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.090
heard people sniggering,
that there were

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.830
little contingents
of my cohorts huddled

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.140
in corners of the
dining room barely able

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.630
to control their laughter.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.630
And I felt this
radiant heat rising

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.789
from the back of my neck.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:39.340
And I felt as if my face must
have been bright, bright red

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.380
with humiliation.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.240
And although I never actually
saw anyone laughing at me,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.600
I knew that they were.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.360
Who they were and why they did
that to me, I'll never know.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:57.520
And yes, it's possible that
a middle aged man from Jersey

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.370
City with R-labialization
could like

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.970
'Wob Woys,' 'pwime wib,'
'Gwaham Gweene,' and Guns

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:09.000
N' 'Woses.' But it's such a
remote possibility it has to be

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.350
pretty much inconceivable.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:15.930
Someone or some people
were behind all of this.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.940
And their identities
will also remain forever

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.250
in the nine enigma file.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.520
And I also like to think that
this particular event, I guess

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.990
because I felt so
abjectly alone,

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.200
so on display at that
moment in that dining

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.860
room full of people,
in that particular food

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.020
court, that this event
not only instilled

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.590
in me a wariness
and a hypervigilance

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.440
and suspiciousness and maybe
even paranoia that have never

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.920
abated, but also a weird
masochistic love of precisely

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.230
this sort of public humiliation.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.700
And I'm not saying
that's necessarily

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.170
a good thing or a bad thing.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.520
I'm just saying that
that's probably why

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.270
we're all here this morning.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:10.717
And again, I'm extremely
grateful for the opportunity."

00:10:10.717 --> 00:10:11.550
Thank you very much.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:31.440
Now, this is an
issue of-- I don't

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.000
know if it's this year's last
year's, "Best of New York."

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.250
It includes all
sorts of categories.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.660
Here's a little section,
best doctors in New York.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.920
This is David
Samadi my urologist.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.480
I just show this
to you so you can

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.440
visualize the person
I'm going to be

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.140
talking about-- dapper guy.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:06.400
And when I started
seeing David, Dr. Samadi

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:13.890
and I guess he Googled me,
found out I was a writer,

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:20.150
and became interested in the
notion of perhaps the two of us

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.930
collaborating on
his autobiography.

00:11:26.104 --> 00:11:30.190
It may seem odd.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:35.900
So sometimes we would meet at
the bar at the Four Seasons

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:41.810
hotel, which is much
more pleasant then

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:48.380
the intimidating environment
of a doctor's office.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.133
Anyway, this is a bit
about the two of us.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.500
"Once Samadi and I
were having a drink

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.650
at the bar at the
Four Seasons hotel

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.610
up on 57th street
near his old office.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.760
And he was saying
to me, 'You know,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.900
once they're
diagnosed with cancer,

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.900
they forget about the
blueberries and come

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.570
to me,' referring
I think to men who,

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.930
when contemplating
cancer in the abstract,

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.670
are willing to consider all
sorts of alternative treatment

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.750
modalities, but when actually
diagnosed with the actual

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:33.320
disease in their actual bodies,
want the fucking cavalry called

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.540
in.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:39.980
Samadi's a very interesting
guy with a very Dickensian

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.610
biography.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.300
He was born and raised in
the Persian Jewish community

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.050
of Iran.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.920
And then after the revolution,
when he was only 15 years old,

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.470
moved to London with his little
brother, just the two of them,

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.190
completely on their own.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.470
When I met him, he
was the vice chair

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.530
of the Department of Neurology
and the chief of robotics

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.700
and minimally invasive
surgery at Mount Sinai.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:09.160
And now he is at
Lenox Hill Hospital

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.060
where he's the chair of
urology and the chief

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.100
of robotic surgery.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.300
In 2012, sometime--
I don't remember

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.970
the month-- I was
diagnosed with high grade,

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.940
capsule contained Gleason
7 prostate cancer.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.830
And I pretty much
knew from the moment

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.030
I first sat down
in his exam room

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.160
and we discussed my
situation that I wanted

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.550
him to perform the surgery.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.480
Of course I got
a second opinion.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.500
I went down to Johns
Hopkins and consulted

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.080
with a very renowned
urologist down there.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.900
This is an episode that
my mom and I have entitled

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.650
fingerbanged in Baltimore.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.390
In addition to the
eminent neurologist,

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.950
there seemed to be
a veritable chorus

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:59.320
line of interns, half a dozen
eager young men lined up

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.720
snapping on their latex
gloves waiting to stick

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.050
their fingers up my ass.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.130
It was like being in some sort
of sick Busby Berkeley routine

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.200
with a Giorgio
Moroder soundtrack.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.770
All the urologist I've ever met
exude a certain morbid elan.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:21.940
After all, their [FRENCH]
is the digital rectal exam.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.290
I became so accustomed
to the procedure

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:32.040
that once I reflexively
dropped my pants and bent over

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.750
at the dentist's office.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.638
The hygienist looked at me like,
dude, it's just a cleaning.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.620
But with Samadi
there's a flamboyance,

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.320
a swaggering fighter
pilot sort of bravado

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.110
that I responded to very keenly.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.980
He really does possess
this imperturbable aplomb

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.040
and a kind of-- I don't
know any other way

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.190
to describe it-- a kind
of star quality that

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.950
inspires absolute confidence.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.460
We're there at the Four
Seasons, at the bar,

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.190
and he's explaining
the anatomy to me,

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.860
how the prostate is embedded
within various crucial nerves

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.400
that control urinary continence
and erectile function.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.680
And he's joking with me
that God put the prostate

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.480
in such a difficult
place in order

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.770
to make it even
harder for Samadi

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.010
to challenge his virtuosity.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:23.780
But he said that he,
Samadi, was like Tom Cruise

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.600
in that scene in
Mission Impossible"

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.260
where the guy's dangling
in midair by the two wires

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.890
and without triggering any
of the laser sensors, hacks

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.640
into the CIA computer.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.700
In other words, Samadi
stealthily enters the body,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.420
deftly delicately
removes the prostate

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:46.440
and gets out, without so much
as even grazing a single nerve,

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.840
leaving you in full
possession of your manhood

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.420
and your dignity.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:55.880
And I was so inspired
by what he was saying,

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:01.990
by his zeal, his steely
self-possession, his sangfroid,

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.670
that-- and I'm not
being facetious here--

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.740
I suggested we just
go into the men's room

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.700
and that he remove my
prostate right then and there.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:16.160
That's how charismatic he is.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.130
That's the complete, absolute,
let's do this allegiance

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.880
he instills in his patients.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.070
Granted I had several
cocktails in me.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.700
I remember thinking to
myself at Mount Sinai,

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.430
just as they administered
the anesthesia, if you end up

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:41.430
incontinent and impotent,
don't be a baby, deal with it--

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.150
and then laughing.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:48.500
That would actually
make me a baby.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.290
I mean those are pretty much
the two key characteristics

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.880
of a baby.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.740
And then waking up in
what felt like an instant,

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.180
an enormous pain, and with
a catheter stuck in my dick

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.610
and like five big
holes in my belly

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.235
like some innocent
bystander in a drive by.

00:17:05.235 --> 00:17:08.339
But the good news was-- and
I wouldn't know this for sure

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:11.520
for a while-- but I am neither
incontinent nor impotent,

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:17.869
and all praise, all glory
goes to David Samadi.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:22.450
I was extremely,
fanatically devoted

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.540
to doing my kegel
exercises, which

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.170
one does postsurgery to
ensure full restoration

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.920
of urinary continence.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.770
I put my gym rat
instincts, honed

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.700
over the course of a
lifetime, to good use here.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.370
I did those kegels
a dozen times a day,

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.490
counted them off on a set
of orange prayer beads

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:47.130
that I bought just
for that purpose.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.650
I still do them, a
set in the morning

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.710
and a set before I
go to sleep at night.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:56.010
And I now have-- and I say
this with a complete lack

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.240
of humility-- the
strongest urinary sphincter

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.605
muscles in the world.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:11.171
I think they will long
outlive the rest of my body.

00:18:11.171 --> 00:18:13.420
In fact, you know how people
say that cockroaches will

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.410
survive a nuclear armageddon?

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.670
I think cockroaches and
my urinary sphincter

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:21.490
will survive the
nuclear armageddon.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.420
And I think that at some
point, the cockroaches

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.830
will ask my urinary
sphincter to be their leader.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.801
I guess this is my own version
of Manson's Helter Skelter

00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:32.300
scenario.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.230
Because of what he did for me,
I've got David Samadi's back

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.770
for life.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.390
I consider him my homeboy.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.030
And I consider his
robot my homeboy too.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.040
When old Yurok Indians
get sick, eels,

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.310
along with acorn
soup and seaweed,

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.630
are the food they crave.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.680
When I return home
from the hospital,

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:04.750
I wanted Peeps and Peanut M&amp;Ms,
cocktail weenies and marzipan.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.830
But I was only
allowed clear liquids

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.350
at first and then
soft food, pabulum.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:21.550
Is there a less virile look
to present to one's wife

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:25.590
than an open plaid robe, a
catheterized penis, and a urine

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:30.160
collection bag
taped to your thigh?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.830
What can you do with
this, I mean fashion wise,

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.730
tape the bag at a
sort of rakish angle?

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.130
I would look in the
mirror myself and think,

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.760
this must be the most
abject, undignified,

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.620
de-eroticized version
of a man possible.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.310
I should read you
the instructions

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.640
they gave me at the hospital.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.820
There are like 23
pages of instructions.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.360
It was like a fucking novel.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.750
Take one cipro two
times a day, one

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.650
Colace every eight hours, 50
milligrams of Lopressor two

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.610
times a day, one oxycodone
every four hours,

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:10.920
plus applying antibiotic
and lidocaine to the entry

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.820
side of the catheter; rinsing
the urine collection bags;

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.010
repositioning the taping
of the catheter and the bag

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.070
to prevent blistering; what
to do if you experience

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:26.950
abdominal distension, bladder
spasms, bloody drainage,

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:31.490
ankle swelling, perineal
discomfort, scrotal swelling,

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.860
painful sneezing; what to
eat until you pass gas;

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.500
what to eat once
you have passed gas;

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.857
when to call to get the results
of the pathology report;

00:20:40.857 --> 00:20:43.440
about whether there's additional
cancer in surrounding tissue;

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.730
when to call to schedule
the removal of the catheter.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:56.430
Anyway, Mercedes--
Mercedes is my wife--

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.970
Mercedes would
bring me scrambled

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:04.480
eggs and toast or macaroni
and cheese or just pastina

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.390
with butter or whatever.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.260
And she would have made exactly
the same thing for herself

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.000
so I wouldn't be envious
of what she was eating.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.526
And I'd say, 'You don't
have to do this you know,

00:21:19.526 --> 00:21:21.430
sit here with me and eat it.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:25.650
It couldn't be all that
appetizing.' And she'd say,

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.030
I want to.'

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:30.050
And when we were
finished eating,

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.800
she would lie next to me,
my catheter trailing down

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.230
the side of the bed
into that bag that I

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.200
would lay on the floor.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.970
And she'd hold my hand.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.780
And I don't think I
ever felt more loved

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.650
than at that very moment.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:52.380
It was just the most
wonderful thing.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:58.150
Isn't it crazy that when I was
in this abject, humiliating

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:04.590
state, somehow that week was
a kind of honeymoon, really,

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:09.060
like a kind of honeymoon
in Paris or something?

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.610
It was.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:16.260
And if I were to make a coat of
arms, an escutcheon, or perhaps

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.620
a new tarot card to represent
love, to represent caring,

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.840
it would feature a catheter,
a dish of scrambled eggs,

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.530
and clasp hands.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:29.840
It was just the most
beautiful thing anyone

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.760
had ever done for me.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.010
It was the most romantic
thing in the world

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:42.140
for Mercedes, this
sweet, sweet person,

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:47.130
to hold out her hand
to me like that.

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:55.410
It was just the most-- it
was just the happiest moment

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.900
of my life."

00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.516
Thank you.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:11.950
So what would you like?

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.060
I could read you about
the Imaginary Intern

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.172
or you could ask
me some questions.

00:23:16.172 --> 00:23:18.380
I don't know if you do you
have questions about this.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.950
I think I probably covered it--

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.570
[LAUGHING]

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:23.854
--comprehensively.

00:23:23.854 --> 00:23:25.270
But if you don't--
no, I'm joking.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.000
You may.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.787
You may have.

00:23:26.787 --> 00:23:27.620
What would you like?

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.882
What time is it?

00:23:28.882 --> 00:23:29.590
How are we doing?

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] 30.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.640
MARK LEYNER: Oh, OK.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.490
I'll do these
really quickly, just

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:38.605
to give you-- this is a very
interesting kind of phenomenon,

00:23:38.605 --> 00:23:40.560
the Imaginary Intern.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:48.180
There was a bathroom
in my house.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.260
I live in Hoboken
across the river.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.730
And when I would
sit on the toilet

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.660
and look down on the
floor, there was a tile,

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.610
and it was cracked.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.540
And it was cracked in such a
way that it looked like a face

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.170
to me.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.730
And the face became
more and more real to me

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:06.840
as years went by
and became someone

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.190
I called the Imaginary
Intern, and who

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.190
would just help me with things.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.490
I mean, this may
sound crazy to you,

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.960
but there was
something quite real

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.320
about the Imaginary Intern.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:31.100
I don't know, it may
be symptomatic of maybe

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.130
not growing up
with a real brother

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.960
or maybe I need
more friends or I'm

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.780
just this very isolated sort of
person, a very insular person.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:44.050
But I really cherish
this . relationship.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:48.170
And the Imaginary Intern
helped me a great, great deal

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.099
writing this book.

00:24:50.099 --> 00:24:51.890
And then in the middle
of writing the book,

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.850
the Imaginary Intern vanished.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.500
And it was very sad for me.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.010
And that's sort
of a tragic thing.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.680
And I talk about that in
the book a little bit.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.950
So I'm just going to read
you four really little things

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:10.730
about the Imaginary
Intern, just for a sort

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:12.270
of clinical purposes.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.500
This may be happening to a
friend of yours or something.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.330
This may be useful to you.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.682
Here I describe how the
Imaginary Intern came to be.

00:25:22.682 --> 00:25:24.390
"I was sitting on the
toilet one morning,

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.970
gazing down at the tiles
on the bathroom floor, just

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.405
staring at the vein patterns.

00:25:29.405 --> 00:25:33.230
And the craquelure on this
one particular tile and I

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:34.620
discerned a legible face.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.540
I discerned the lineaments
of the Imaginary Intern

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.670
in the craquelure of a
tile on the bathroom floor.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.670
That's exactly how the Imaginary
Intern was conjured up.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.350
This is a textbook
delusion of reference,

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:51.190
specifically a pareidolia,
a psychological phenomenon

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.160
that involves seeing
meaningful patterns,

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.130
frequently faces, in
random information.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.580
A common example of
which is something

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.820
like seeing the face of Jesus
in a Cool Ranch Doritos,

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.180
or something along those lines.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.480
And the Imaginary
Intern initially

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.490
functioned mainly as a kind of
archivist or production manager

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.970
"Gone with the Mind," helping
me collate and categorize

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.280
autobiographical material.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.010
But soon he became
more like a, I

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.240
don't know, more like
a coach or a trainer.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.020
You know that term
in pharmacology,

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.310
mechanism of action?

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.870
It's the specific
biochemical interaction

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.620
that basically enables a
drug to do what it does.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.460
When you're writing something,
its mechanism of action

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.210
is a very difficult
thing to identify.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.870
It's a very subtle,
very elusive thing.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.880
But it really is the
crucial fucking thing.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.270
And when I felt like I had
lost that, that I suddenly just

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.990
didn't know what it
was, or when, you know,

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.480
I just felt kind of
discouraged or dispirited

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.540
about how it was all
going, the Imaginary Intern

00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.930
would exhort me.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.080
He'd pumped me up.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.310
He'd be like, Denzel Washington
can land the plane upside down

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.840
stinking drunk and you can't
write an autobiography,

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.080
a book about your own life?

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.350
Are you fucking kidding me?'"

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:22.720
So that's just an example of
the kind of real exhortations

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.200
and assistance I would get
from the Imaginary Intern.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.560
And I'll read a section
just to give you

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.230
a sense of our
relationship in terms

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:39.570
of it being a kind of
intimate relationship of two

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.500
close friends.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.540
"The Imaginary Intern
and I used to love

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:50.310
this commercial for Dove
Dry Spray antiperspirant.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.240
There'd be a series of women.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:58.790
And each woman would raise one
arm in a gesture pretty closely

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:03.520
resembling the Roman salute,
spray on the antiperspirant,

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.370
stroke her underarm
with the index

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.560
and middle fingers
of her other hand,

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.790
and then snap her fingers to
demonstrate that the product

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:14.370
goes on instantly dry.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.620
Both of us, the Imaginary
Intern and myself,

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.670
thought that it was
exceptionally beautiful.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.050
And if he was watching
TV and it came on,

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:27.170
and I was doing something
somewhere else in the house,

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.100
he'd call out.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.250
He'd call out, Mark.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.530
One time he actually called
me Tweezers, like the kids

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:34.780
did at summer camp.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:38.460
He was like, 'Tweezers,
the Dove commercial is on.'

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.595
And we started doing the
gesture for each other,

00:28:40.595 --> 00:28:46.220
a quick swipe of the armpit
and then the finger snap.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.360
It was a cute little
thing between us,

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.830
our little gang sign I guess.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:51.420
But it's odd.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.430
As time went on, it somehow
came to mean something

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:56.530
much more to us.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.700
It came to represent-- and
this was a completely tacit

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.670
understanding, not something
we ever broached out loud.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.420
The gesture, [SNAP],
came to represent,

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:12.350
to symbolize equanimity
in the face of death,

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.170
and perhaps-- and I
say this in hindsight--

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:30.890
perhaps even an
infatuation with death."

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:36.540
The reading that I do in
the book at the food court

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.690
is part of something
called-- apparently

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:43.020
they have a reading series in
the food court of this mail,

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.160
and it's called Nonfiction
at the Food Court,

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.510
or something like that.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.175
That's the series
I was reading in.

00:29:52.175 --> 00:29:56.120
It comes into play a bit.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.080
"The Imaginary Intern really
did fervently believe, as do I,

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.150
in this whole idea
of staying secret,

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.830
of shunning the spotlight.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.710
And a friend of
mine once suggested

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:12.460
that someone make a documentary
about the Imaginary Intern,

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.620
set up cameras all over the
house like in that movie

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.480
"Paranormal Activity."

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:22.090
And I told the Imaginary Intern
about it, and he freaked.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.480
He hated the idea.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.900
And I immediately regretted
having told him about it.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.720
It was a huge mistake.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:32.330
And sometimes I think that
that's actually why he left.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.790
He just want it to be
completely off the radar,

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:36.970
left alone, completely
inconspicuous,

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.270
completely off camera.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.310
I don't know if he'd been
abused in his life or what,

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.570
but he just wanted to
be able to relax and act

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.130
as loony and as
dorky as he wanted to

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.860
without having to worry about
what anyone else thought.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.820
And I think the idea
of a documentary

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.140
just really shook him up.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.610
It really spooked him.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.440
And I think I mentioned
before that I've

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:04.310
tried to reconjure his face
from the configuration of cracks

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:07.830
in the tile floor
of other bathrooms.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.390
In fact I was
sitting on the toilet

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.030
in the mens' room in the
Nordstrom at this mall

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.550
actually, and I
thought I discerned

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.230
his face in some
craquelure on the floor.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:21.400
And I remember I was
concentrating so hard on it,

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:25.890
trying so hard to force a
jumble of disparate features

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:30.980
into a recognizable physiognomy
that I was actually straining,

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.690
you know, pressing in that way
that can cause hemorrhoids.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.900
So I had to stop.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:43.880
I've had that sudden frisson,
that jolt of, it's him,

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.140
many times.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.760
And I'll squint and I'll
look from different angles,

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.170
and it's inevitably
a false alarm.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.710
It's not him.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:32:00.570
And it's a big, big
letdown, it really is.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:04.890
It's a shitty feeling
But that's what

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:10.130
nonfiction is people, shitty
feelings and encounters

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:11.750
with death.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:18.100
And that's why we're
here this morning."

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:18.623
Thank you.

00:32:18.623 --> 00:32:19.896
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:19.896 --> 00:32:24.710
Now I want to read you
one last little thing,

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:31.490
and then we'll see.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.690
"I don't know if
you guys have ever

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:37.170
run into people who do
this cute sort of thing

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:41.630
when you're talking to
them, where if you say XYZ,

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:44.500
they'll say you're XYZ.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.110
I knew this girl who used
to do it all the time.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:50.300
Like I'd say something
like, 'There's a hegemonic

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.730
comparative in cross-training
sneakers.' And she'd say,

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:58.980
'You're a hegemonic imperative
in cross-training sneakers.' Or

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.730
we'd be out at a
restaurant, and I'd say,

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:06.420
'That pasta looks like a bowl
of infant foreskins.' And

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:12.130
she'd say, 'You're a bowl
of infant foreskins.'

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:15.520
So once the Imaginary
Intern said to me--

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.210
and I don't remember
what the context was--

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:23.270
but he said that memory, and
in a sense autobiography,

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:27.520
is like a rash that
blossoms and fades.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.530
And I said to him, 'You're
like a rash that blossoms

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:38.560
and fades.' And then,
after he was gone,

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:44.070
I realized that he actually was
like a rash that had blossomed

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:53.192
and faded, an ache that
time will never assuage."

00:33:53.192 --> 00:33:56.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.900
Thank you.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:05.450
You're the greatest
audience I've ever had,

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.154
as I expected you to be.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.850
I don't know what more to say.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:19.880
Do you have any questions
about anything at all?

00:34:23.817 --> 00:34:26.440
AUDIENCE: Why did you decide
to write an autobiography?

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.000
MARK LEYNER: Oh,
I think you have

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.208
to come up to the microphone.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:35.682
Take your time.

00:34:35.682 --> 00:34:36.598
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:42.502 --> 00:34:45.060
Hello.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.948
Why did you decide to write an
autobiography at this point?

00:34:55.284 --> 00:34:56.284
MARK LEYNER: Here's why.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.320
When I'm writing a
book, I look at my work

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:12.710
in a way that may be different
from the majority of writers.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.200
I get the sense that it is.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.190
I'm not the sort
of writer or person

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:22.340
who thinks there are
things I need to get out,

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:25.680
there things that I
need to convey to people

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.540
or there's some sort of an inner
narrative that I'm storing up

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.200
and I need to convey
in some way or that I

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.530
have certain incredible
theories or sentiments that I

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:39.380
need to convey.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:46.270
Books to me are always-- I think
I was very influenced by when

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:50.060
I was a teenager, or let's
say 14, 15, 16, by the way

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.750
painters thought
about their work

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.390
and painters would think about
doing a series of paintings

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:57.240
with certain kind of
technical problems

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.604
or certain aesthetic
technical problems

00:35:59.604 --> 00:36:00.770
that they were dealing with.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:04.810
And then another series
would be somehow maybe a kind

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:07.920
of dialectic with the last
series or something very

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.156
different or a kind of perhaps
advancement on the ideas

00:36:11.156 --> 00:36:12.030
of that or something.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.960
And that's sort of how I
think about these things.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.250
So for the longest time,
most of my life as a writer,

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:21.220
I had very much avoided
what you would call anything

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.300
autobiographical,
because I just thought

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:29.720
that was the least interesting
part of what I know or think

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.910
about.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:36.280
So I somewhat arbitrarily
just embargoed all of that.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.490
And then I had stopped
writing a little bit

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:43.960
and was doing movie
and TV kind of writing.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.310
And then when I came
back to writing books,

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:52.630
I wrote a book called The
Sugar Frosted Nutsack."

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:59.720
And it had nothing of me in it.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.710
My other books had had a kind
of very fictionalized version

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:08.712
of me, a very, very hyperbolic,
artificial version of the I,

00:37:08.712 --> 00:37:12.180
the first person subject.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:16.180
Then that book
had nothing of me.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.730
It was about a set
of gods and goddesses

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.960
and a person named
Ike who believed--

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.920
like was the only person
on Earth who believed

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.720
in these gods and goddesses.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.030
Which as I point out doesn't
mean they didn't exist,

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:31.520
it just meant they
chose to only be

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.060
in the head of this one person.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.210
I think that's
perfectly plausible,

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.640
that gods and goddesses would
be-- could behave that way,

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.680
probably would behave that way.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.670
So this book I decided,
let me try to do something

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:50.140
where I'm in every--
something auto--

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:55.770
like see what was that fear
or objection to talking

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:59.270
about, you know, musing.

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.860
I really think we all have a
kind of finite set of stories

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.777
that retrospectively determine
who we think we are and how we

00:38:05.777 --> 00:38:07.860
present ourselves to other
people or to ourselves,

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.130
you know, maybe 20 stories.

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:12.240
And you find yourself
drinking is good for this.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.280
You find yourself telling all
of them, in any given night.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.070
After a number of hours,
you will dip into those

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.140
and exhaust them by 2:00,
3:00 in the morning,

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:24.240
and just start again.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:31.990
So I said, let's think
about that and use those.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:37.400
And we discovered, it's just as
interesting and uninteresting

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.050
as all the sort of
miscellaneous detritus

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:43.720
that you use in
your writing anyway.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.702
It's the same.

00:38:44.702 --> 00:38:46.160
You know, the sort
of membrane that

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.900
separates what you think of as
yourself and the outside world

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:53.370
is very porous and it's the
same stuff floating in and out.

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:56.700
So why I spent my whole life
avoiding it, I don't know now.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.406
But now that's out
of my system, so--

00:39:03.629 --> 00:39:05.795
AUDIENCE: So I think you
just answered my questions,

00:39:05.795 --> 00:39:07.000
so I'll ask a different one.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.630
When you wrote the previous one,
"The Sugar Frosted Nutsack,"

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:13.740
when you started that book,
how much of its structure

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:16.370
did you already have in mind?

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:17.942
Did you already
have it or did it

00:39:17.942 --> 00:39:19.150
merge as you started writing?

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.420
MARK LEYNER: That
book, which I'm

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.670
assuming, out of my
saintly humility,

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:33.460
that you haven't
read, again, I have

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.840
very-- I don't know what you
call them-- architectonic

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.900
or geometric senses of books.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.600
I really have an idea of
what the shape of a book is.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.590
And it's much more
important to me

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:51.460
than the story or
the characters.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.804
The shape of that book
was a kind of vortex.

00:39:55.804 --> 00:39:57.470
And in fact at the
end, there's an image

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:02.120
at the end of the entire
book being embroidered around

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.060
and around and around
and around like a vortex

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:10.220
in a baseball cap, until you get
to that little nub on the top

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.680
and the book's sort
of ending there.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.570
And that's how I always
imagined that book, some sort

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.520
of spinning and spinning
and then getting

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.560
in tighter and tighter and
tighter whirls of the vortex.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.690
This book, "Gone with the Mind,"
I had, from the beginning,

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:33.810
an idea of doing a book
in the form of a reading,

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.970
in kind of three
acts, that there'd

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:42.960
be an introduction,
the reading, and a Q&amp;A.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:51.290
I found almost no advice you
get as a writer is useful.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.320
And almost everything
I've ever been told

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:57.840
I've been most successful
by doing the opposite.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.280
And I still try to do that.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:04.520
If I show something to someone
and they say, oh it's very,

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.500
I don't know, it's
pornographic, I'd

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.360
just try to make it
more pornographic.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.770
Or it's self-indulgent, I
make it more self-indulgent.

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:16.142
Just do the opposite.

00:41:16.142 --> 00:41:17.930
Or it's too
sentimental, I make it

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:23.500
sickening like drenched
in molasses sentiment.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.850
They're just showing me
the direction to go to.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.210
So what was I going to say?

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:38.865
I lost my train of thought.

00:41:38.865 --> 00:41:41.580
What were we talking
about, because there

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:46.290
was a kind of advice
someone gave me about this,

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.740
and now I can't
remember what it was

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.250
and what I did opposite to it.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.080
Let me think for a second.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.491
We're talking about this book.

00:41:56.491 --> 00:42:00.964
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] talking
without interrupting yourself,

00:42:00.964 --> 00:42:03.805
and [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:03.805 --> 00:42:04.680
MARK LEYNER: Exactly.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.980
Well, it'll come to me or not.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.260
Anyway, I wish I could remember.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.090
It was so brilliant.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:21.130
Let me just think for
a second about this.

00:42:25.002 --> 00:42:27.570
I don't know, lost it.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:35.320
OK, I'm a reliable lecturer
here, half demented.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.681
Can't even think of what the
beginning of his own sentence

00:42:38.681 --> 00:42:39.180
was.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.910
Anyway, thank you so
much for coming today

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:46.400
in the midst of such an
infernal day out there.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.800
It was great, great to
meet you in this forum.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.850
[APPLAUSE]
