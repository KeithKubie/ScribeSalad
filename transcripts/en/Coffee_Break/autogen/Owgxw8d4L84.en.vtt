it it looks like this and at this point
I use a little macro that I created to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
I use a little macro that I created to
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.420
I use a little macro that I created to
count of all the 15-minute increments so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
count of all the 15-minute increments so
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.060
count of all the 15-minute increments so
I can see that oh I spent you know this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
I can see that oh I spent you know this
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.190

percent reading etc then we put in the
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.109
percent reading etc then we put in the
date and hit this button which saves the

at any given time during the day which
 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.899
at any given time during the day which
is really cool and this brings us full

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909
is really cool and this brings us full
 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.989

dedicated to the right things how much
 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.180
dedicated to the right things how much
of it could have been better allocated

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190
of it could have been better allocated
 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.780

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560
this sample week you can see how much I
 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.770
this sample week you can see how much I
read how much it worked out how much

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780
