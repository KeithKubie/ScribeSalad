00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:09.005
Let's say the 2011 nominal GDP is: 15,294.3 billion dollars.

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.088
And I didn't just make this number up.

00:00:11.088 --> 00:00:16.202
This is actually the advanced estimate of what 2011 GDP was in the fourth quarter.

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:18.342
This is just a fourth quarter number.

00:00:18.342 --> 00:00:29.424
They took the fourth quarter number and they that analysed this to get to this 15 000 billion, which is esentially 15,294.3 trillion dollars of GDP.

00:00:29.424 --> 00:00:36.168
Let's say the GDP deflator, relative to 2010, you always have to know what you're taking your deflator relative to,

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:43.603
is a 102.5 and this is, once again, the 2011 GDP deflator.

00:00:43.603 --> 00:00:53.028
And one way to interprate this is if the base year is 2010, that means that prices in 2010 could be viewed as being at 100

00:00:53.028 --> 00:00:57.937
and that now, we're in 2011, we're in 102.5.

00:00:57.937 --> 00:01:04.200
Another way to think about is that generall level of prices, that we have talked about it, this is not an easy thing to measure

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:12.604
But if attempted to that the generall level of prices has gone up by 2.5 %, when form 100 to 102.5.

00:01:12.604 --> 00:01:19.800
Now that is the way that we know the nominal GDP is, the GDP measured in 2011 dollars,ofen called the current dollar GDP.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.669
We know the deflator is, can we figure out the real GDP in 2011

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:31.936
and that will be the real GDP in 2010 dollars, when we have the deflator relative to 2010.

00:01:31.936 --> 00:01:43.468
So to do that we just have to remember that the ratio between our nominal GDP and our real GDP is going to be the ratio,

00:01:43.468 --> 00:01:49.604
you can viewed as current dollar vs. 2010 dollars.

00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:58.509
Or another way of viewing it, is the ratio between our deflator, which is 102.5

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.409
and 100, which is esentially you could use it as kind of deflator in 2010

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.173
or just setting that level of prices to be 100, a prices now are 102.5 .

00:02:10.173 --> 00:02:20.503
So taking it in that way, our nominal current dollar GDP is 15 294.3 billion dollars

00:02:20.503 --> 00:02:24.420
we can viewed that it's 15.2943 trillion, eiter way.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.647
Our real GDP is what we want to figure out.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.467
We do not know what it is.

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:32.741
But we know the deflator, we know that things are gotten 102.5 more expensive

00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:38.603
or that deflator is a 102.5.

00:02:38.603 --> 00:02:43.543
And then we can just solve for the real GDP.

00:02:43.543 --> 00:02:47.133
And the 102.5 over 100, you might be able do this in your head,

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:52.672
this whole expression right over here just becomes 1.025.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:03:04.335
And so you have this 15 trillions divided by 1.025 or you can divide both sides by 1.025

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:07.542
and multiply both sides by the real GDP.

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:25.277
So let's do that. Multiply both sides by the real GDP, divide both sides by 1.025.

00:03:25.277 --> 00:03:30.532
Now, of course, this cancels with that, that why we have multiplay both sides by the real,

00:03:30.532 --> 00:03:35.937
And then this cancels with that and we get our real GDP.

00:03:35.937 --> 00:03:46.866
Our real GDP is equal to our current dollar GDP.

00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:58.587
15 294.3 billion dollars divided by essentially the ratio between our deflator and the 100, divided by 1.025.

00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:04.916
If I were in charge of naming macroeconomic concepts I would actually made this the deflator

00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:12.200
I would set this at 1 and I would call this 1.205, because then you wouldn't had all this sillines multiplaing and dividing by 100.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.916
You just say: Hey, let's take our current dollar GDP, divide it by the deflator, I guess you could say world - deflated, to get the real GDP.

00:04:19.916 --> 00:04:21.669
That's just make a lot of sense to me.

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.604
But either way, that's essencially what simplify too, this is our current dollar GDP, our nominal GDP

00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:32.800
dividing it by, what I would prefer to call the deflator, but you could use it as the deflator divided by 100

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.810
and that gave us a real GDP.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.084
We just deflating the current dollar one, and how many the calculate to figure this one out.

00:04:40.084 --> 00:04:58.604
So let's get the calculator out, so 15 294.3, this is in billions, divided by 1.025, gives us 14 921.3

00:04:58.604 --> 00:05:04.469
So let me take this to the screen that I can remember that says. I have a bad memory.

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:27.855
This is our real GDP, our real GDP is equal to 14 921.3 billion dollars.

00:05:27.855 --> 00:05:41.500
You can also write 14.9213 trillion dollars.
