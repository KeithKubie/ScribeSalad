00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.144
- [Instructor] In drawing
the slope field for the

00:00:02.144 --> 00:00:05.167
differential equation, the
derivative of y with respect

00:00:05.167 --> 00:00:07.750
to x is equal to y minus 2x,

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:10.814
I would place short line segments

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:13.336
at select points on the xy-plane.

00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:15.176
Complete the sentences.

00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:17.617
At the point (-1,1) I would draw

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:20.927
a short segment of slope blank,

00:00:20.927 --> 00:00:22.368
and like always pause this
video and see if you can

00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:25.437
fill out these three blanks.

00:00:25.437 --> 00:00:29.030
The short segments that
you're trying to draw

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.085
to construct this slope field,

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:34.178
you figure out their slope based on the

00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:35.729
differential equation
so you're saying when

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:38.147
x is equal to -1 and y is equal to 1,

00:00:38.147 --> 00:00:40.938
what is the derivative
of y with respect to x,

00:00:40.938 --> 00:00:42.994
and that's what this
differential equation tells us.

00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:46.645
So for this first case, the
derivative of y with respect

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:50.812
to x is going to be equal to
y, which is 1 - 2 times x,

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:54.405
x is negative 1,

00:00:54.405 --> 00:00:57.088
so this is going to be -2
but you're subtracting it

00:00:57.088 --> 00:00:58.962
so it's gonna be +2,

00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:01.502
so the derivative of y with
respect to x at this point

00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:04.662
is going to be 3, so I would
draw a short line segment

00:01:04.662 --> 00:01:07.162
or a short segment of slope 3,

00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:11.329
and we keep going, at the point (0,2).

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.529
Well let's see, when x is 0 and y is 2

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:18.930
the derivative of y with
respect to x is going

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.513
to be equal to y which is 2 - 2 times 0,

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.959
well that's just going to be 2.

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.889
And then last but not
least, for this third point

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:31.390
the derivative of y with
respect to x is going to

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.557
be equal to y which is 3
- 2 times x, x here is 2,

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.683
2 times 2, 3 - 4 is equal to -1,

00:01:48.463 --> 00:01:50.722
and that's all that problem asks us to do,

00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:52.931
now if we actually had
to do it, it would look

00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:55.518
something like, I'll try
to draw it real fast,

00:01:55.518 --> 00:01:58.020
so let's see, let me make sure I have

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.855
space for all of these points here,

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:03.188
so that's my coordinate axis

00:02:07.042 --> 00:02:11.209
and I want to get the point (0,2),

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.675
actually I want to go all the way to (2,3)

00:02:16.675 --> 00:02:18.730
so let me get some space here,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.147
so 1, 2, 3, and then 1, 2, 3,

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.251
and then we have to go
-1 and once we might go

00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:32.256
right over here, and
so for this first one,

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:34.567
this exercise isn't asking
us to do it but I'm just

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:37.980
making it very clear how we
would construct the slope field,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.147
so the point (-1,1), a
short segment of slope 3,

00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:47.391
so slope 3 would look something like that,

00:02:48.684 --> 00:02:52.851
then at the point (0,2) a slope of 2,

00:02:53.738 --> 00:02:58.243
(0,2), the slope is going to
be 2 which looks something

00:02:58.243 --> 00:03:02.410
like that, and then at the point (2,3),

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.495
at (2,3), a short segment of slope -1,

00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:10.662
so (2,3) a slope segment of slope -1,

00:03:11.852 --> 00:03:13.552
it would look something like that,

00:03:13.552 --> 00:03:15.385
and you would keep doing
this at more and more points,

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:16.966
if you had a computer to do
it that's what the computer

00:03:16.966 --> 00:03:19.370
would do, and you would draw
these short line segments

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.021
to indicate what the
derivative is at those points

00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.616
and you get a sense of,
I guess you would say

00:03:25.616 --> 00:03:29.783
the solution space for
that differential equation.
