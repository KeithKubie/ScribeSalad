when I was a child I was fascinated by

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730
when I was a child I was fascinated by
 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.900
when I was a child I was fascinated by
telepathy in science fiction in fact I

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910
telepathy in science fiction in fact I
 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.299
telepathy in science fiction in fact I
tried really hard to read other people's

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309
tried really hard to read other people's
 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.060
tried really hard to read other people's
minds to project my thoughts into other

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
minds to project my thoughts into other
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.669
minds to project my thoughts into other
people's heads and I came to the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
people's heads and I came to the
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.060
people's heads and I came to the
conclusion that maybe telepaths do walk

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
conclusion that maybe telepaths do walk
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.519

realized that with all the
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.529
realized that with all the
electromagnetic probes that we have of

and so we're way past simply

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640
and so we're way past simply
 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.219
and so we're way past simply
understanding the way in which the brain

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229

radiates radio we're at the point now

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
radiates radio we're at the point now
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.899
radiates radio we're at the point now
where we can actually interface the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909
where we can actually interface the
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.630
where we can actually interface the
human brain with a computer and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
human brain with a computer and
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.780

eventually with an exoskeleton by which

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
eventually with an exoskeleton by which
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.809

they can become Iron Man

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819
they can become Iron Man
 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.600
they can become Iron Man
and so Ironman is not simply a question

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610
and so Ironman is not simply a question
 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.880
and so Ironman is not simply a question
of science fiction it's something that

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890

laboratory in addition to putting a chip
 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.160
laboratory in addition to putting a chip
on top of the brain you can actually put

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170
on top of the brain you can actually put
 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.800
on top of the brain you can actually put
sensors directly into the brain itself

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810

you do is you put the patient in an MRI

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950
you do is you put the patient in an MRI
