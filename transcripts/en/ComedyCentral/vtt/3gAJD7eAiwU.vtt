00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.238
 The most important election
 in America is tomorrow...

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:07.841
Get out and vote for Roy Moore.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.676
 ...so I went down
 to Alabama last week

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.378
 to see how the people
 were fighting back

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.213
 against the liberal media's
 despicable lies.

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:14.381
 I read a poll

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.650
that said that 40%
of the people of Alabama

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.752
are more likely
to vote for Roy Moore

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.722
after allegations that he
sexually molested teen girls.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.190
We're seeing
Roy Moore supporters

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.158
actually say they're now
 more likely to vote for him

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.293
because of the allegations.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:27.661
So I'm going to talk
to Republicans

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.297
to see how they defeated
fake news yet again.

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:32.332
Road trip, baby!

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:35.636
Uh, but Jordan wouldn't let me
rent a Dodge Charger,

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:39.273
uh, so I had to rent
a Chrysler Pacifica.

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:40.908
It sucks.

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:42.876
(bleep) him.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.344
There's a lot of fake news
going around.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.780
I think it was just an attack,
a way to eliminate somebody

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.981
that they knew
they couldn't beat.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.583
Even if it's true,

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:52.019
um, I don't want to give up
a Senate seat.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.353
Right.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.055
 These Alabamians
 weren't going to fall

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.091
 for some bogus media narrative
 built off of evidence,

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.260
 facts and eyewitness accounts.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.029
 But was there anything
 Roy Moore could do

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:03.397
 to lose their vote?

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:05.966
I mean, there's murder,
there's...

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:09.002
If I had been a victim, I
certainly wouldn't vote for him.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.038
So that's nine people
that probably aren't voting

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:13.340
-for Roy Moore?
-Well, absolutely.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.709
If they came out and they said,
"He shoplifted."

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.611
I wouldn't vote for him then.

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:21.381
'Cause these are the, um, people
we want our kids to look up to,

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:23.650
and I think they should live
to a higher standard.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.519
-Amen to that.
 -Of course, everybody knows

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:28.355
 that shoplifting is
 the lowest form of humanity.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.357
Are you more excited
to vote for Roy Moore

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:31.959
after these allegations
came out?

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.262
Yes. It's like, um, being a mom,

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.597
you don't want to see
your children bullied.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.433
You got after the bully.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:40.801
-He's older than a child.
-Right.

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:42.936
-And he's being accused
of going after children, -Right.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.005
-but that's.. but he denied it.
-Right.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:47.140
 Exactly.
 The real victim is Roy Moore.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.976
 How can anyone survive
 under these attacks?

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:51.011
 He was going to have
 to live with this

00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:52.579
 for the rest of his life.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.348
(horn honking)

00:01:54.348 --> 00:01:57.184
(whooping)

00:01:57.184 --> 00:01:59.486
-(honking continues)
-Yeah! Yeah!

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.555
Roy Moore loves kids.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:04.024
 Sadly, some young people
 in Alabama have been abused

00:02:04.024 --> 00:02:06.593
 and taken advantage of
 by the mainstream media.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:08.962
Do you believe the allegations
against Roy Moore?

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.264
-I certainly do.
-You believe those women?

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:14.434
-Yes.
-He denied the allegations.

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:17.104
And?

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:18.805
There's the witnesses
at the mall,

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.308
there's, you know,
the witnesses of the employees,

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:24.311
there was that security guard
who did say that it happened,

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.146
you have the victims themselves.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.682
Just disregard all of that
on his word?

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:30.550
Yeah. It's he said/they said.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.085
 Nothing riles me up more

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.954
 than thinking
 about the fake news media.

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:36.456
They love to use facts
and evidence against people,

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:38.225
and I hate it!
Why can't they go to Canada?

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:39.459
Go to Canada!

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.161
Go to the ocean.
Drown yourselves.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.164
Anyway, it's fun
to be in Alabama. Roll Tide.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.866
 The only way
 to fight the MSM lies

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:47.334
 is to hear the unfiltered truth

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.036
 straight
 from the horse's mouth.

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:50.504
 The horse in this analogy

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.372
 is human stallion Steve Bannon.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:53.740
(neighs)

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.442
 And, just my luck,
 he was speaking

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:56.843
 at a Roy Moore rally.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.613
Fake news. Fake news.
You're fake news, dude.

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:01.515
Everybody's fake news.
You're fake news.

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.350
Oh, whoa. No.
Sorry, that-that's Fox.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.518
They're good.

00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:09.189
 Here I am at the rally.
 Look at all this excitement.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.024
They're here
to support their man,

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.893
to defeat the liberal media,

00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:14.728
to defeat the fake news bias
and narrative

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:16.396
that's been shoved
down the people of Alabama.

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:17.864
Come on.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.300
We're not going
by what the liberal news says.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.736
I could give a damn less
about what they say.

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:24.304
-Shame on them.
-Yeah. -Shame.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:26.239
-Shame, shame, shame.
-Yeah.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.008
It's just, uh, an attack.

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.143
Uh, it's just dirty politics.

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:33.346
The allegations
are kind of ridiculous.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.115
-For... It was 40 years ago.
-Yep.

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:37.217
-So what if he dated teenagers?
-Yep.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.885
I dated teenagers when I was 30.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.954
-Exactly. You take... You...
-Roy was... No, I was 20.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:43.190
-Roy was 30. So... -I... Yeah.
He was 30, and then...

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.825
-But they were 14.
-Exactly.

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:46.493
 Whatever the numbers were,

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:48.395
 they were adding up for me.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.363
-I thought you were Eric Trump.
-I mean...

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:51.665
-that's one of the nicest
compliments -(chuckles)

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:53.033
-I've ever received.
-Well...

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.102
 I was having
 the time of my life.

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:57.070
 It felt great
 to have everybody agree with me

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.173
 and not challenge my support
 of an alleged child predator.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:01.908
I think common sense tells you

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.510
-there's nothing to this.
-Exactly.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.779
Common sense tells you
one man denied it.

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.280
Nine women said it happened,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.515
-but he denied it, so...
-Yeah.

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:09.816
Go, Roy Moore.

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.686
Judge Roy Moore
has more honor and integrity

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:14.154
in a pinky finger

00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:16.990
than your entire family has
in its whole DNA.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.626
(cheering, applause)

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:20.694
Judge Roy Moore.

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:21.995
(cheering, applause)

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:27.000
That's the man with all
the allegations, right there.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.468
 Look at Roy Moore on stage.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.237
 He's not touching anybody.

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:32.372
 Where's that story, CNN?

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:34.875
They think people in Alabama
are stupid,

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:38.111
that they're gonna bring this up
a month before the election

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.247
and we're gonna fall for it? No.

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:41.848
-You hear that, liberal media?
-(chuckles)

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:43.150
People are more excited to vote

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.518
for an alleged predator
right now.

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:46.153
They're not less excited.

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:47.521
-Exactly.
-Absolutely.
