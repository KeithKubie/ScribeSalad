00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
DANIEL: Question from Andrew
about commas in prices.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.075
I think it was a dot, but
if it wasn't, that's

00:00:05.075 --> 00:00:06.500
just a typo on me.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.050
So, not 100% there, but I'm
pretty sure it was a dot.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.520
But yes, prices need to have
periods and not commas.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.240
Please file bugs on all
these open source

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.090
libraries that I showed.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.240
If, for some reason there's a
feature that isn't out there,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.659
as I'm documenting these, if
you go to the Python client

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.660
library, you can click view
source and then within there,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.730
there are subtabs.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.740
There's a changes subtab.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.535
I've made probably 10 commits in
the last five days, because

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:46.530
as I'm documenting it, I'm
finding things I'd like to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.440
document aren't necessarily
there.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.270
So as we make this big
documentation push, a lot of

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.880
these missing features
are going to show up.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.720
LUKE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.030
Yes, OK, so Luke says dry run
is not where you expect it.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.190
It's under Product.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.500
It's not under Product Entry.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.170
The reason dry run and warnings
in .NET are under the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.650
product query class is because
that's really where the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.900
query's being built, right?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.690
And the product entry class is
for the body of the request

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.910
whereas the URI is something
distinct from the body, right?

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.640
So the query class takes a
product entry, but the query

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.126
itself needs to build the
entry in some way.

00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:51.020
I'm not a C# guy, but the
guys who designed it--

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.410
that was their closest
equivalent of using a keyword

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.400
parameter in Python or PHP.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.280
Dynamic languages like Python
and PHP just really are not

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.920
the same animal, and so you do
have to make compromises, and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.520
the APIs won't always
look the same.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.770
But for the most part--

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.530
Andrew, your question
about 1 MB cap--

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.932
so you mean request size like
headers plus payload?

00:02:27.932 --> 00:02:29.182
ANDREW: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.765
DANIEL: I take it you don't
have a microphone, Andrew?

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.850
So for those watching the
YouTube video, if you can't

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.080
see already, Andrew was asking
if the 1 MB cap on requests

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.290
applies to the request size,
or just the XML payload.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.480
And I believe he's asking if
it's body, headers, and any

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.380
other information with the
request, or if it just replies

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.120
to the body.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.940
So off the top my head, I
believe it's just body, but

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.320
I've never really
looked into it.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.705
So I can ask, and I will post
to the forum and answer.

00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:11.800
I'm going to type real quick.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.962
Hopefully it's not too loud.

00:03:13.962 --> 00:03:15.212
ANDREW: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.290
So the next question Andrew is
asking is, if he GSIPs the

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.540
request will that
change things?

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.790
No.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.550
As with feeds, you can also send
zipped feeds, so we're

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.530
going to be able to detect
the way you zipped it.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.680
And if the way we've detected
you zipped it doesn't actually

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.880
unzip, then we're just going
to reject the request. And

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.660
they'll be either a generic
error, or they'll be a

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.480
specific error.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.730
I'm not sure off the top of my
head if there is a couldn't

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.040
unzip error.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.640
But we'll just reject the
request and tell you, zip it

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.440
in a better fashion.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.040
But for the most part, we're not
going to have any issues

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.600
unzipping it.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.540
There are pretty great libraries
out there for doing

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.461
that, and internally we don't
have issues with it.

00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:09.711
ANDREW: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.552
DANIEL: So the next question
Andrew is asking is, if I zip

00:04:16.552 --> 00:04:20.140
it, and it ends up as 0.9
MB, but when it's

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.930
unzipped, it's 2 MB.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.140
Will I still be under the cap?

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.540
Yes.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.820
All we care about is what's
going over the wire.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.860
When you're talking about the
quality of an API, one of the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.272
issues you want--

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.070
all right, hold on one second.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.090
Thanks, Jasmine, for
all your help.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.460
She's got to go.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.030
She's plus eight from me right
now, so it's late for her, but

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.155
it was great to have
your help here.

00:04:44.155 --> 00:04:45.405
Have a great day.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.236
Back to Andrew's question.

00:04:51.236 --> 00:04:53.310
The quality of the API--

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.300
you're really worried about how
fast requests come in, and

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.410
how fast it takes to receive
them, right?

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.460
And then how fast you
can send a response.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.020
The issue is the speed that it's
going to take for you to

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.850
send that 1 MB.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.250
We don't care about anything
after that.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.560
Once it gets there,
it gets there.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.090
Processing 1 MB, processing
2 MB, it's not that hard.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.350
It's a pretty small size.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.420
However, sending it over
the wire is the

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.450
bottleneck there, right?

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.840
And so, we don't care if
it unzips to 2 MB.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.830
Question from Luke.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.010
I mentioned quota limits.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.800
What's the limit?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.700
By default--

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.290
I don't know the limit
off the top my head.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.310
It's always changing.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.265
We don't publish it for a
reason, because it's changing,

00:05:39.265 --> 00:05:42.310
because it's subject to
change, et cetera.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.710
But what I'll say is, if you
need more quota, and you're

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.010
not doing something malicious,
we'll give you more quota.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.900
So if you run into it, then
just let me know.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.840
Post it on the forum, or get in
touch some other way, and

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.470
we'll increase your quota.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.230
But the quota is in such a way
that, unless you are one of

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.440
the biggest internet retailers
in the world, you probably

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.900
won't have to worry about it.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.660
But like I said, there are
channels for you to get your

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.712
quota increased if there
is a use case for it.

00:06:16.712 --> 00:06:18.200
So don't be worried
about that.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.606
So any other questions?

00:06:26.606 --> 00:06:27.830
LUKE: Daniel, can
you hear me OK?

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.170
DANIEL: I can.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.850
I can.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.030
LUKE: I just unmuted myself.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.870
On the quota limit thing, the
reason I ask is that, if I'm

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.550
batching requests, but I'm doing
this in an automated

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:43.060
way, I might be firing out
100 a minute to you.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.590
DANIEL: Gotcha.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.480
So that's a good point.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.730
I'm sorry that I glazed
over on that.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.920
There are two different
types of quotas.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.080
There's a daily quota, and
that's really just what I was

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.010
talking about, but there's
also a QPS quota, right?

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.510
You guys know what
denial of service

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.880
attacks look like, right?

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.650
And so, to protect against that,
any service is going to

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.540
have some sort of QPS limit.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.930
And so, like Luke said, if you
do send up 100 batch requests

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.090
in a minute, you may
get dinged for QPS.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.620
So a few things you can do.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.975
One is-- and I don't
recommend this--

00:07:15.975 --> 00:07:20.320
but if you don't have any cap,
or any sort of guard against

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.210
how quickly you're
sending requests

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.370
relative to each other.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.740
Like, four in the same second.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.750
If your system allows it, then
you should have an error catch

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.790
where you're going to see the
error corresponding to--

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.480
it's something like "internal
reason, exceeded quota".

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.890
It's on the error code list
in the documentation.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.500
But, have some catch, and then
just do exponential back off.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.660
So you sleep a second, make
the request again.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.710
OK, it didn't succeed,
double the time.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.560
OK, so then we go up to two
seconds, and just do an

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.000
exponential back off, and
obviously exponential growth

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.110
is pretty fast. So you
don't want to back

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.340
off infinitely, right?

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.900
You don't want to back
off until 2 to the

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.190
100th second, right?

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.470
Have some safeguard in there,
but up to a certain threshold,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.710
that's really your best bet.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.100
But I would say, have some
sort of throttling.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.230
If you're running more than one
process, have some sort of

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.070
shared queue, or a set of shared
queues where you can

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.960
see how quickly you're
doing that.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.230
Thanks for the point, Luke.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.720
There are QPS limits, and you
will hit them if you have a

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.560
lot of updates all at once, or
if you're doing one of these

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.059
bi-monthly or semi-monthly
cleans, and you're sending a

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:37.893
lot of requests at
a small part.

00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:39.890
LUKE: I have a couple
more questions--

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:40.530
DANIEL: Like Andrew
says, exponential

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.409
back off is your friend.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:42.010
Sorry to interrupt.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.740
LUKE: I have a few
more questions.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.160
Should I ask them
all in a row?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.930
DANIEL: If other people don't
have questions, I

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:47.760
don't have an issue.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.290
If people have an issue,
let's take turns.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.300
So it sounds like
it's all you.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.380
LUKE: Right, good.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.840
OK, so MCA.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.960
We just had the joy of that.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.870
Actually, I have another
quick one.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.640
You said they're human
over there, right?

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.681
DANIEL: Yes.

00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:12.220
LUKE: I requested
the MCA account.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:12.980
They declined it.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.100
They don't give you a reason.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.390
Then after you got it passed
for me, I requested they

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.146
reestablish API whitelisting,
they declined that, too,

00:09:20.146 --> 00:09:20.492
without a reason.

00:09:20.492 --> 00:09:23.780
DANIEL: That's a process
that's still being

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.800
straightened out.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.190
The number of API users is
much higher than the

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.290
number of MCA users.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.010
I chatted with the ops folks
about that, and it was really

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.570
just a miscommunication
in process.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.590
You're sort helping us dog
through the process in some

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.200
ways, right?

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.780
For the most part, if all else
fails, I'm your support

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:54.960
channel, or my peers within
the commerce team.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.150
That shouldn't have happened.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.780
I'm sorry it happened.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.260
It's a process that's a little
less clean than the overall

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.070
API process.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.930
LUKE: Well, at least they
declined me quickly.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.390
They didn't make me wait a
week and then decline me.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.490
On the MCA, it looks like the
verify claim of the sub

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.700
account URLs is a
manual process.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.950
Is that right?

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.690
DANIEL: Yes and no.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:28.060
If you're literally verifying a
URL with Google for the very

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.960
first time, yes, it's
a manual process.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.630
And it doesn't have
to be that manual.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.610
A lot of times, they'll give you
some hex digest, and you

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:46.960
say, put a page at URL, slash,
this long link with a

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.965
particular token in it.

00:10:47.965 --> 00:10:49.810
And that's sufficient
for verification.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.200
So you can script a lot of
that process and take the

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.000
human part out of
a lot of that.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.830
But for the most part, if
you're using an MCA as a

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:03.790
marketplace, then you're going
to want your clients with the

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:07.555
sub accounts to do
that anyway.

00:11:07.555 --> 00:11:10.340
LUKE: OK, so you're saying if
they claim the URL in their

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.720
merchant-center account, and I
then consume it through the

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.480
API, then--

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.460
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.050
DANIEL: That's a special
use case.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.350
We can talk offline about that
for non-standard fixes.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.400
But for new accounts you're
creating, if you're using a

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.240
URL different than the URL
on the parent, then you

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.110
will need to verify.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.970
If you are using the URL
on the parent, or some

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.106
sub-domain, or something like
that, from the parent, you

00:11:36.106 --> 00:11:37.640
don't have to worry about it.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.280
LUKE: These are private
URLs that they

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.620
have owned and purchased.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.180
So yeah, they're going to
be different domains.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.550
DANIEL: Yeah, that will need
to be a manual process.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.610
But there are pretty sufficient
docs on the

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.590
Merchant Center for that.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.060
So if that's something you
wanted to provide for your

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.160
clients, just say, hey,
go to this link.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.700
If you have any issues,
let me know, or

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.230
escalate to this forum.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.980
There's a lot of support
channels in place for that.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.150
LUKE: OK.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.590
And also, it doesn't look like
we can set the business

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.190
information and the customer
service information on the sub

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.640
account through the Manage.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:16.400
DANIEL: Yeah, all attributes
are those documented on the

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.090
documentation.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.190
Hold off on your questions
for a second, Luke.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.940
John Strakjs, J-S, I believe--

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.490
I don't know if I pronounced
that right--

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.350
has a few questions.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.085
So we're going to let him ask
his questions for a sec.

00:12:30.085 --> 00:12:31.860
JOHN STRAKJS: Hello, Daniel.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.880
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.600
DANIEL: Strack or Strash, or--

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.180
JOHN STRAKJS: It's Strack-en.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.900
DANIEL: But your email-- how
do you say Strak J-S?

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.490
JOHN STRAKJS: Oh, how
do I say Strak J-S?

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.720
DANIEL: That's how you say it.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:42.810
All right--

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:43.420
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.500
DANIEL: Cool.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.400
All right, anyhow--

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.650
JOHN STRAKJS: Yeah, so I've just
got a couple of questions

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.330
about MCAs.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.760
We've been using them for some
time, and we have a Java

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.210
program, which works fine.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.280
First question is--

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.530
there's quite a lot
of attributes--

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.910
when you go onto the merchant
manually, there are lots of

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.000
fields to put in.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.100
Via the MCA, those fields
are not there.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.700
And I wonder whether, at some
point, the MCA API is going to

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.310
be changed to take in those
extra attributes.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.320
DANIEL: A few things.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.040
I wish I would have mentioned
this in the slides.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.430
We do have--

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.910
I'll post a link to it here.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.950
Sorry for my loud typing.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.200
We do have an issues--

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.100
it's an empty Google code
hosting project just with

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:38.556
issues, for you to
vote up issues.

00:13:38.556 --> 00:13:40.450
Man, I can't find it.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.590
Hold on a second.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.360
Sorry.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.985
So you can go there and vote for
features like that or just

00:13:44.985 --> 00:13:46.000
post them on the forum.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.640
Say, we want them.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.780
But that's a feature that
we've discussed.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.070
Not necessarily everything
that you can set on the

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:55.980
merchant center.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:01.935
But things like tax, account
level tax or

00:14:01.935 --> 00:14:03.070
account level shipping.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.420
Things like that we've discussed
and probably will be

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.940
adding, but I haven't
seen a design doc or

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.680
anything like that.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.220
So we're not at that point yet,
but it certainly things

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.470
we're open to.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.330
JOHN STRAKJS: Excellent, OK.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.080
What I'll do is, I'll look on
there, and I'll put some

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.900
suggestions in.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.200
DANIEL: OK, great.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.340
Yeah, so everyone, if you
want to look in chat--

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:27.680
if you go to code.google.com/
p/shopping-API-issues, you can

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.930
actually vote up issues or
create new issues, and I will

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.070
relay them to the teams who
are actually building this

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.260
stuff and adding features, and
doing things like that.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.060
JOHN STRAKJS: I think you're
trying to actually connect to

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.590
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], because we've
got several hundred

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.420
shops, which we kind of manage
under our accounts.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:49.130
And it's trying to connect to
our account, with maybe--

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.950
DANIEL: So you're saying they're
not managed by the

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.750
MCA, but you'd like to inherit
them programmatically.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.260
JOHN STRAKJS: Inherit
is a good word.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:02.970
Yes, a shop may not be
registered as a merchant, but

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.855
we will actually set them
up via our API.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.010
DANIEL: So I guess I'm
a little confused

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.340
at what you're asking.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.810
So their account is managed
by the MCA account?

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:18.630
JOHN STRAKJS: That's correct.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:19.975
Exactly right.

00:15:19.975 --> 00:15:21.920
DANIEL: And what is it that
you'd like to do?

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.370
You'd just like to set
account-level settings for

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.350
them, is what you're saying?

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.310
JOHN STRAKJS: Yes.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.370
I'll give you an example.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.055
Say someone actually has a real

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:32.650
shop, with a real location.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.440
Now, it'd be fantastic
to be able to--

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.520
but they haven't got a Google
Merchant Account.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.580
So we're managing their
products for them.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.470
What we'd really like to do is
to upload them, and connecting

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:44.780
up with their address.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.610
So that if they're using--

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.140
DANIEL: Oh, like local.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.270
JOHN STRAKJS: Exactly
right, yes.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:54.170
DANIEL: OK, we just launched
support for local products.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.000
It's a little bit of a
fragmented process.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.485
They need to sign up for a
Google Places account.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.840
Let me try to find
a link for this.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.380
You can keep talking, and I'll
try to talk while I'm

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.540
googling for it.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.650
But, they need to sign up for
a Google Places account, and

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:19.800
then they can actually
link that.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.000
But it's not exactly easy
to do with the API yet.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.600
But it's something we're
looking into.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.680
We are launching a new
feed to manage local

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.150
product data, though.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.390
But there's still, like I said,
a bit of fragmentation.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:40.570
Let me find it--

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.330
nearby stores, create
an account with

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.690
Google Local shopping.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.760
So here is a relevant link.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.030
I didn't read it, but I read the
headline, so I think it's

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.660
the right one.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.500
Yes.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:17:01.040
So there is a track of related
Merchant Center posts about

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.200
it, but there's no great way
through the API to just

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.160
specify it.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:12.060
But it's something that we're
really hoping to make less

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.359
fragmented.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:17.180
But I think that may require
something like a Google Places

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.545
API, which doesn't really exist
in the capacity that

00:17:20.545 --> 00:17:21.300
you'd like it to.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:21.700
JOHN STRAKJS: Right.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.180
Thanks so much for answering
that question.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.120
My second question, I think,
is tied into our account in

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.160
that we can update our MCA
accounts, but we can't create

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.510
any new ones.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:32.220
We seem to have hit a limit.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.190
We have a manual workaround
at the moment.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:39.250
Presumably one day, that'll be
resolved, and we'll be able to

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.180
create more accounts.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.800
DANIEL: So the MCA quota is
not the same as your items

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.040
quota, or account level
items quota.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.620
And even that stuff
can be a pain

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.700
sometimes, as Andrew knows.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:57.800
But MCA quota, they actually
look at your account before

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.060
they approve more quota.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.990
And then they say, if you have
a bunch of accounts that

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.200
aren't being used, then
please delete them,

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.480
or things like that.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.890
If you want to email
me offline, we

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:08.850
can deal with this.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:13.500
I don't know what your current
account limit is, but for

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.270
marketplace has sort of backed
off on the original quota.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.560
And supplemented it
a little bit.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.160
Though, like I said, it's
really case by case.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.750
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.460
JOHN STRAKJS: I suspect we've
got a couple of sub accounts

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.500
which are empty.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.765
Maybe what we need to do is go
around and have a little tidy

00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:36.240
up and delete those.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.970
Which might then
help the quota.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.610
DANIEL: Right.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.470
Yeah, if you're getting to that
point, and you have a

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.970
bunch of accounts that are full
of data, then, obviously,

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.680
it's pretty clear cut.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.650
You just need more accounts.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.320
But if you're using it as a test
account, and you leave

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.450
some of the accounts you created
while testing just

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.790
around, then it's a little
more involved decision.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.490
JOHN STRAKJS: Excellent.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:03.740
Thanks so much for answering
those questions.

00:19:08.903 --> 00:19:11.270
DANIEL: Luke, do you have some
more ques-- oh, looks like

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.030
Andrew has a question.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.430
ANDREW: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.640
DANIEL: Andrew's question is,
you said we should keep track

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.400
of the unique URL for managing
each product.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.960
In my software, I've been
generating these URLs using

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.420
the product ID and other
relevant data when I need

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.390
them, rather than
storing them.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.280
Are there any plans to change
these URLs in the near future?

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.550
DANIEL: No.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.540
That would be a huge
breaking change.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.690
When I said keep track,
that was more like a

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:38.170
generalization, and you've
captured that generalization

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.100
perfectly, right?

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.540
You already have the data needed
to construct the URL.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.680
It's four things.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.830
It's the channel, online or
local, the language, the

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.430
product ID, and the
country, right?

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.530
So that's already embedded
within the product.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.800
So if you're keeping your
product data local, you're

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.630
good to go.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:58.830
No, we don't intend on making
such a huge breaking change.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.900
Thanks for the question.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.200
Yeah, smiley face
out of Andrew.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.830
All right, Luke do you
have a question?

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.800
LUKE: Yeah, I think
I have one more.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.700
I noticed something.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:12.220
I didn't read up on it, but
the data quality service--

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.470
what can you say about that?

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.430
DANIEL: It's brand new.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:19.273
We will be posting about it
soon, but nothing to say about

00:20:19.273 --> 00:20:22.020
it right now.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:22.260
Yeah, brand new.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.092
It's been up for like,
four days.

00:20:26.092 --> 00:20:28.240
LUKE: I was going to say, are
your own people using that to

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.380
judge our data quality, so that
if we use it, then we--

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:36.780
DANIEL: No, it's intended for
merchants and developers, not

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:37.740
for internal use.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.760
LUKE: OK, so yours might
be stricter.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.310
DANIEL: Yeah, the data quality
folks are in a completely

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.340
different part of Google.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.240
So I don't actually interact
with them a whole lot other

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.440
than, like, when I have
upset developers.

00:20:51.762 --> 00:20:54.440
LUKE: I was just wondering if
I used it, if I could avoid

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.980
running into any problems.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.460
DANIEL: You probably could.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.500
But like I said, we're going
to launch it formally soon,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.395
and I'm going to hold off on
talking about until then.

00:21:05.395 --> 00:21:07.400
LUKE: OK, I think that's
it for my questions.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:07.820
I think I'm good.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.060
DANIEL: Cool.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.340
So this was great.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.700
I think everyone has their
current questions resolved.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.690
But as we all know, we probably
have bugs in our code

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.590
that we don't know about.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:23.490
So we'll find out some more
questions as we go.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.350
Thanks, everyone.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.660
This was great, and I look
forward to doing another one,

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.920
probably in two weeks.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.800
But you're all in a G+ circle
that I have, so I'll just post

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.640
to that circle.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.580
I'll post to the forum,
may send an email.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.320
I'll probably stop sending
emails, because it's a pain to

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.940
bcc a list of 40 plus people.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.360
But anyhow, thanks everyone.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.790
Have a great day.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.570
And it was a pleasure
talking to you.
