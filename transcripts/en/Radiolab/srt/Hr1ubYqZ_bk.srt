1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,850
You are listening to
radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,230
N y. S. C e.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,823
Okay.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,630
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm
Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,620
And today we have a little experiment
in democracy, diversity and division.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,990
Yeah. Comes to us from our reporter,
producer Simon Adler. Okay. All right.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,310
Sign. Okay. What, what
do you have to tell me?

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,710
So couple months back,

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,850
I took the train down to
southern Brooklyn, 95th Street,

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,720
bound to a little neighborhood called

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,130
Bay Ridge that's known for its portrayal
in the movie. Saturday night fever.

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,000
[inaudible]

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,560
w w you weren't heading there for
disco? Uh, no. Uh, not exactly.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,590
The auditorium appears to be a filling up.

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,910
I was actually down there to go to this
Catholic High School Auditorium. Huh?

16
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,610
How you doing? Hey Sir, to the
Classic High School Auditorium,

17
00:00:57,611 --> 00:01:01,210
sloping down with the stage in front
and like an American flag on one side of

18
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:05,440
the stage in a New York state flag
on the other, maybe a thousand seats.

19
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,900
And I would say half of them
are filled. Like surprisingly,

20
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:12,430
there's a big turnout for this thing.
Look familiar. Have you seen me before?

21
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,220
Well, mid this question
handsome. Oh. And uh,

22
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,390
it would not be unfair to say that
the crowd has an average age of 62.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,860
The reason I was there. So, uh,
what brings you here tonight? Uh,

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,220
Tom seated debate was to watch the local
candidates for the New York City city

25
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:33,910
council. Duke it out. Who's most likely
to do something for you, do you think?

26
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,150
I have no idea. I've
been hurt on both sides.

27
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,840
And can I ask you a question or two? As
I was talking to people beforehand, uh,

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,670
weaving in and out of the rows of chairs,

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,430
the issues that people
were concerned about, uh,

30
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,350
were really what you would expect

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
will be in this
neighborhood for five years.

32
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:52,850
I've been fighting for a light at this
level of politics. In the meantime,

33
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:56,210
I get aggravated. We have to run for our
lives when we cross the streets. Yeah,

34
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,940
it's horrible. You know, small stuff.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,820
Taking away the 5 cent
bottle tax with you,

36
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,110
drink a lot of mountain dew or something.

37
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:07,040
So the 5 cents are going to have my
water bottles. It jumps up the price.

38
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,850
When I buy those, I'm
24 packs of water right

39
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,620
places. We're about to be

40
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,270
eventually the MC for the evening.

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,390
This woman in her seventies
dressed from head to toe in pink,

42
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,070
walks out onto the stage.

43
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,820
Jace is America in action.

44
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,080
We Paddock Hooray selection here.

45
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,900
She invites the candidates up,
five Democrats, four Republicans.

46
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,770
They sit down at their respective
tables and okay, we're ready.

47
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,310
It gets underway. You know,
and I'm all get set, go.

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,553
And at first

49
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,390
I have a city council woman,

50
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,240
I will help them make sure that those
that have limited in common on fixed

51
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:47,850
income,

52
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,320
it's pretty dry.

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,640
You have enough resources and the
help to take care of that path.

54
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,103
[inaudible] yeah,

55
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,690
so you don't have to put them down
and they don't have to put them out.

56
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,030
But then about an hour, hour and a half
into it, there's this moment where,

57
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,200
what are your solutions for the
overcrowding in schools in this district?

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,170
Bug Panel. One of the
Republican candidates, this guy,

59
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,900
Bob Kapono goes off on this riff.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,440
It's a matter of budgetary priorities.
It takes some money to build schools.

61
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,120
So perhaps if we put an end to some of
the cities, sanctuary city policies,

62
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,550
like spending $27 million to defend
those here illegally will commit felonies

63
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,080
for deportation perhaps. And you'd have
more money to build more public schools.

64
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,690
[inaudible]

65
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,710
and then just as it seems like people
were settling down against the next

66
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:44,550
question. [inaudible]

67
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,093
Devil's breath, right

68
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,110
man on the far right side
of the auditorium stands
up and then goes on to say

69
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,220
the Arab people and the
freaking Asians out of here.

70
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,720
[inaudible]

71
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,960
why are you selling your houses?
You're letting everybody take over.

72
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,783
Yeah.

73
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,660
Everybody sort of sat up
in their seats and uh,

74
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,050
nobody was quite sure if this
thing was gonna escalate.

75
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,570
And shortly after he said this,
one of the candidates up on stage,

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,880
this tall guy like six foot three,

77
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,910
salt and pepper beard stood up from behind
the table and actually walked out in

78
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:38,160
front of it. I want to say something,
at least forgive me. And uh, and said,

79
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,880
that is an elephant in the room and
it's called racism and discrimination.

80
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,160
And this give you that
the right to be here.

81
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,700
You don't have enough [inaudible] to
build the message for Trump and to the

82
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:51,630
world that the people of the 43rd
district are not afraid to send the first

83
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,070
American city council to represent

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,433
[inaudible].

85
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,730
So the reason I was at this debate
is um, like it feels right now,

86
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,460
like America is just at its own throat.

87
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,360
It's certainly as divided as I've ever
seen it and I just keep wondering like in

88
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:19,590
this moment, can one person
stand for all of us anymore?

89
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,610
And here you've got this guy, the
guy you just heard other Ellia team,

90
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,470
a Palestinian American trying to win an
election in one of the most conservative

91
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,450
and most divided neighborhoods in New
York and he's running on behalf of a group

92
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:36,990
of people who currently are at
the flashpoint of those divisions,

93
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,150
Arab American Muslims. And just to
make things a little more common.

94
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,490
Okay. The other Elliot team

95
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,670
is a Christian. That grace
of our Lord is the Christ,

96
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,960
the love of God and the communion of
the Holy Spirit. Christian minister.

97
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,843
[inaudible]

98
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,640
yeah, we've been the one in the office.
Yeah, it was [inaudible] check, check,

99
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,483
check.

100
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,160
I sat down with him in his office
for the first time this past march.

101
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,720
I am an Arab American Palestinian
Christian Lutheran Pastor in southwest

102
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:21,310
Brooklyn running for office.
That doesn't say that for me.

103
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,190
Can you say that once more
in Arab American Palestinian
Lutheran Pastor in south

104
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:36,551
was to Brooklyn who is running for city
council because I want to bring a new

105
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,890
bold, fresh, inclusive,

106
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,540
powerful voice to present our district
and city council is that you've got a

107
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,440
nice cadence there. You though you
said that you know, being a preacher,

108
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,320
you know it helps a little bit
to what's this guy's backstory?

109
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,660
How did he end up being in Brooklyn and
running for the seat for Cities Council

110
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,990
world?

111
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,990
So he was born and raised in Bethlehem
on the West Bank in a Palestinian,

112
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:06,720
a Christian home into a family
that was poor to a middle class.

113
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,980
His father was a carpenter and made
most of his money, was the carving.

114
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:14,000
You know those little like nativity scenes
with the wooden camel and the wooden

115
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,100
Christ. He carved those for a living.

116
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,700
My mother was housewife and she
helped my father in the factory.

117
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:24,110
They worked extremely hard to
provide for us a good life. So it's,

118
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:28,310
it was amazing, wonderful symbol
life. It wasn't a complicated.

119
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:32,990
So I went to school, grew up in
the church and after high school,

120
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,440
Ellia team went into the seminary
of the Bisley Himba College.

121
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,350
And then when he was in his
second year, this was 1989,

122
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,780
I was arrested by the
Israeli soldiers. Um,

123
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,120
I was picked up from
my bed, from home, uh,

124
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:51,840
three in the morning and
the took me to prison. Uh,

125
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,610
for what reason? I don't know.

126
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,790
I never been given a
reason why I was arrested.

127
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,540
I never been convicted of anything.
I was picked up from my bed, uh,

128
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,890
three in the morning from my
father's house and taken to prison.

129
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,300
I was in a solitary
confinement in a small cell.

130
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,340
He says that the Israeli
soldiers basically tortured him,

131
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,600
hitting me and putting me outside against
the wall with a bag of my head under

132
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:21,530
the rain and the cold. And they kept
asking me, you tell us what you did wrong.

133
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,170
Tell us what you did wrong. I said,
I have nothing to tell you. Uh,

134
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,380
and a few months later, he was
released with no explanation.

135
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,750
This was a bizarre experience. When he
got home. After I get back from, uh,

136
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,220
Kmart from prison, there was a lot of
people came to our house. They will say,

137
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,960
oh, look, see what they did to you. Now
you have to do this to them. You know,

138
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,670
they'd come to recruit you a to belong
to a political party. In this case,

139
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:49,100
it was the Palestinian
Liberation Organization,

140
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:53,660
which at the time was explicitly an
armed resistance movement that often

141
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:57,870
targeted Israeli citizens. And
the, they will say, oh, look,

142
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,230
see what they did to you and now you
have to do this to them. And I said,

143
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:05,700
absolutely not. Uh, this is not the
way I want to live the rest of my life.

144
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,960
You know,

145
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,430
I always wanted to be engaged in
a place where I can bring hope.

146
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,780
I can, uh, help people. And, uh,

147
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,930
the only way I can do that was through,
uh, being, uh, become a minister.

148
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,030
So he doubled down in his
studies, finished seminary
with working in Palestine.

149
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,840
And then in the early nineties, uh,

150
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,380
he was actually sent to start a new
Lutheran Church in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.

151
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,810
So, uh, I came to Brooklyn 1995.

152
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,830
I remember on the first day I was
shocked because Viking Down Fifth Avenue,

153
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,580
if you take the whole neighborhood
in, and we are in Bay Ridge,

154
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,410
which I actually did not too long ago on
eight bike. Uh, what you notice is, uh,

155
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:56,340
on the right we have Leif
Erickson park a nod to the, uh,

156
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,260
neighborhoods Scandinavian past this
sort of crazy mix of different kinds of

157
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:04,320
people. The Bay Ridge Bakery,

158
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,490
beautiful neon sign looks like it
hasn't changed much since the 1960s.

159
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,700
Johnny pumps a firemen
bar, firefighter bar.

160
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,023
Did I hit record?

161
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,530
I did hit record. I write skinflint pub.

162
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,250
It's sort of like looking at a geological
cross section of the neighborhood's

163
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,250
history, the bean post pub, the
Schnitzel House. On the left,

164
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,940
you can see how groups of people layered
themselves on top of groups of people

165
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,690
making themselves part of one of the
most deeply mixed neighborhoods in the

166
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:40,320
country. And when you get
just a little bit south,

167
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,420
it's impossible to not notice. One of
the latest groups trying to settle in

168
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,800
[inaudible] furniture almost got hit
by a car on the Yemen cafe, El Zahar.

169
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:55,160
Hello. Meet women walking
around and do job.

170
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,860
I've got a hookah lounge who
can nuts. That sounds nice.

171
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,040
Turkish Kebab as are. And how

172
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,370
large is the Arab community
in the 43rd district?

173
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,890
We don't have the exact, because again,
Father Leo team, when the sensors,

174
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,170
the Bartman kid 10 years ago,

175
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,590
they told the Arab community if
you are an Arab chick white, uh,

176
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,440
so we don't have specific numbers,

177
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,370
but the estimates I heard are
somewhere between 20 and 30,000. Wow.

178
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,520
Living in southwest Brooklyn,
that's a huge community. Yeah.

179
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,660
I mean that's only about 10% of
the total population. But uh,

180
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,970
in a Democratic primary for city council,

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,440
we need only about 4,000 votes
to one 4,000 votes total. Yeah,

182
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,690
that's it. That's it. Wow. Yeah.

183
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,720
I mean the turnout is very low and we
have an open seats so we'll have a bigger

184
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:48,960
chance winning because we're not
running against an incumbent. How,

185
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:53,770
what's the margin of victory typically?
Uh, they can be squeakers I mean a just,

186
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,460
uh, several years

187
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,870
back, uh, the race was
won by just 31 votes. Ah,

188
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,160
31. Yeah. So, so it would seem
that if this guy can just, well,

189
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,510
despite the fact that there's never
been an Arab American on city council

190
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:11,800
before, uh, it seems that if he can get
out the, uh, the Arab American vote,

191
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,850
he's got a shot shot. I mean, you just
told us there's a lot of Arabs there,

192
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:20,500
so he should, he should own this
election. Yes. But at the same time,

193
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,950
the neighborhood is such a microcosm.

194
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,840
I think that Islam is an evil
ideology. That's what I think of,

195
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:32,160
like everything that's going on. This
is Kayla. Kayla Santos, who also,

196
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,670
she's the former deputy director of the
Arab American Association of New York.

197
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,910
I am from, I'm what you
call it. And she said,

198
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,350
if you look around the neighborhood,

199
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:44,490
you'll see all these sort of national
level issues playing out on the ground.

200
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,241
It's like a, you know,

201
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:49,950
like a shadow play or something
and I fucking take the travel ban.

202
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,040
I mean you've got one of the
largest Muslim neighborhoods
in the country, right,

203
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,700
right next to all of these
people who voted for Trump,

204
00:12:56,701 --> 00:13:00,450
who support the travel ban. No
immigration whatsoever, none,

205
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,330
zero and shifting national demographics.

206
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,630
We're one of the last remaining New York
City neighborhoods where there is still

207
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:09,150
a strong white working class

208
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,140
that is in the process of
being priced out. Gentrified.

209
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,640
[inaudible] is really hitting white people
hard and so clearly there's going to

210
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:23,641
be tension there like we've just got a
lot of the elements of the struggles and

211
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:27,610
the anxieties that are going
on on a national level. So

212
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,390
candidate log 1:10 AM
with all of this in mind,

213
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,240
we still are there in
search for new voters.

214
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,470
Their Elliot team ended up signing up
along with the help with his came pain

215
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:44,950
manager. He's full of dad
jokes. It's kind of amazing.

216
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,290
The woman you just heard a
couple of seconds ago. Kayla? No,

217
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,110
I'm the campaign manager for
Elliot Team for City Council.

218
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,830
Have you guys become like best
friends? She is my mother-in-law.

219
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,530
Why do you call me your mother-in-law?

220
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,520
Cause I love my mother in law set
out to represent the Arab community.

221
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,230
I am a candidate glowing with no
other candidates have gone before.

222
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,620
Captain Sea captain
encourage this captain Kirk,

223
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,010
captain huddles.

224
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,650
Was it the fruit? But Dad
joke aside, it's true.

225
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,660
He really is trying something that's never
been tried before and one reason that

226
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:26,950
it's never been tried before is that
those 20 some thousand Arab Americans for

227
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,680
the last 20 years they've been hiding.

228
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,400
Like for me just it's been unnerving to
to be in a district where you don't feel

229
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:36,670
like people are watching out for you in
your community. This is Linda Sarsour.

230
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,690
I have Palestinian Muslim American
community organizer born and raised in

231
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:41,021
Brooklyn,

232
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:44,980
New York and she says the key thing to
know is that not long after the nine 11

233
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:49,450
attacks, the u s government in 2003
did engage in a registration. Yeah.

234
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,030
She program

235
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,330
a registry called n Sears,

236
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,570
the national security entry
exit registration system,

237
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,160
which meant that males over the age of
16 who were from these like 29 countries

238
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:05,420
of origin countries that had a historic
connection to terrorism, Bangladesh,

239
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:09,230
Pakistan, Iran, Iraq,
Egypt. Go down the list.

240
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,580
People from those countries that
were visitors, temporary workers,

241
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,730
non US citizens had to come and formally
register with the federal government.

242
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,440
That really told me, give me people,
Muslim people treating us like animals.

243
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,483
That's it.

244
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,440
Linda was there with some of these men
providing translation services in this

245
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,890
post office like room where there are
all these windows the men would be called

246
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,330
upon at a time, photographed,
fingerprinted, look at their passport,

247
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,910
asked them general questions and I
noticed that at one point that there were

248
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:43,750
some men that were being told to either
leave or just go home and got some

249
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:47,620
stamps in their passport with future
appointments or they were telling them to

250
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:48,520
go to the 10th floor.

251
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,640
That's when my like something
like I got punched in the stomach,

252
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:54,220
like I felt really nauseous. I
was like, what's going on here?

253
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,140
So when I went to ask the officer,

254
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,110
she was told the 10th floor
was the FBI headquarters.

255
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,140
This wasn't just some
information gathering operation.

256
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,030
They were planning to deport people.

257
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,360
And as this realization sunk
in throughout the waiting room,

258
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,300
I can't tell you the faces
that these people had,

259
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,970
like they didn't know
what their destiny was.

260
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,590
And in fact about 10% of those that
did go register were put on deportation

261
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:21,520
proceedings and many of them were
deported. No going home, no packing a bag.

262
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,500
And I think that's
where the divide starts.

263
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,540
And so the Arab American population in
New York and a Bay Ridge learned it was

264
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:33,430
better to not show up, to not be
counted. And then just a few years later,

265
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,470
the Associated Press came out
with their investigative reports.

266
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,940
The Associated Press reports,

267
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:42,941
details how police used informants and
New York police department has operated

268
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:45,890
on intelligence unit targeting Muslims.

269
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:50,891
Turns out that after nine 11 the NYP was
putting large sections of the community

270
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,300
under varying degrees of
surveillance. This is not a Puzo.

271
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm a reporter for the New York
Times based in Washington and he,

272
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,930
along with this team at the AP
back in 2011 broke this story.

273
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,050
We found out there was a unit
called the demographics unit,

274
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:09,530
secret team of NYP d intelligence
officer. These detectives,

275
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,400
they were mapping the human terrain of
New York snooping around neighborhoods

276
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:17,360
going into different shops, all the
Muslim, what's your shops? The cafes,

277
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:19,730
the bookstore's bars and nightclubs.

278
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,380
Restaurants could bars marking down
things like they play Al-Jazeera and it's

279
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:28,160
this far from a mosque. Informants
known as mosque crawlers.

280
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,300
Our mosques were under surveillance and
so the Arab community in Bayridge who

281
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,820
had done nothing wrong,
they were terrified.

282
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,850
I mean the police were even
keeping track of their kids,

283
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,390
like which parks do our kids
where, where we're playing soccer.

284
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,860
Couple of things worth
noting here, one, in the end,

285
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,100
the operation never turned
up any terrorists and to
when those things happen,

286
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,400
none of their local representatives,
no state legislator,

287
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,980
no local elected officials stood
up and said, this is wrong.

288
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,020
Don't target my constituents. You know,

289
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:00,510
these are these people are
from my district, nothing.

290
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,660
And what that does is it makes you feel
like the people quote in power don't

291
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:07,740
care about us. Like we
were out on our own.

292
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,760
And I started realizing that there was
going to have to be a moment where we had

293
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:15,720
somebody in, in the local
area, somebody who is Arab,

294
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,800
stand up and protect us. And this
is where Al Elio TeamSTEPPS in?

295
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,350
No, not quite yet.

296
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,850
So first Linda started to raise these
thoughts with the moms and business

297
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:27,290
leaders,

298
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,300
whole bunch of leaders from different
institutions and they decided that the

299
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:33,390
first step was to run a candidate,
um, for the New York City Council.

300
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,110
The idea was start small and start in a
place where they have a strong base bay

301
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,390
ridge, which also happened to be Linda's
neighborhood. And according to her,

302
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,080
a lot of the unions and a lot of the
people in the politics were like, Linda,

303
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,360
this is your seat. You
have to run for the seat.

304
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,900
So I saw it like unfold
before my very eyes.

305
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,940
But Donald J.

306
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,940
Trump is calling for a total and
complete shutdown of Muslims entering the

307
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:04,110
United States. The politics
changed. I think Islam hates us.

308
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:07,230
You know, nobody talks about we need
American Muslims on our front frontline.

309
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,420
Yes, we have to look at my
politically correct radical Islamism.

310
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,150
We have to see what's happening and
I'm joining me now as let as our floor

311
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,250
executive director of the Arab in this
new political climate I profile and grew

312
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,200
and as our sewer, Jesus, Linda Sarsour.

313
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,220
I started doing a lot of national work.
She was on all the cable news shows,

314
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,920
became a national figure and
really a polarizing one. What

315
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,550
why is that? Well, in large part because,

316
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,410
and I'm sure she would
hate me saying this,

317
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:40,390
but her brand oddly is very similar to
Donald Trump's. She can be very reactive.

318
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,330
She's just going to say it
like it is. I say straight.

319
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,700
I'm very Brooklyn and maybe too,
cause I was born and raised here,

320
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:48,700
but I tell it like it is. I don't really,
more than just telling it like it is,

321
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,990
she's a provocateur.

322
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,980
She's tweeted some tongue in cheek posts
about how sharia law wouldn't be that

323
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:57,160
bad. More recently she called
the CNN anchor, Jake Tapper,

324
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,990
a member of the outright. I mean,

325
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:03,991
she's Brash and feminist poster child
Linda Sarsour that this sour sour Linda

326
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,530
Sour tits are the
conservative media. Yeah,

327
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,290
I don't need counseling after
I hear Linda Sarsour speak,

328
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,930
I just need a bucket jumped all over for
it. There is the witch Linda sourcer.

329
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,980
She is a radical antisemites.

330
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:19,930
I did not submit to you taking these
missteps and warping them into totally

331
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,590
unfounded claims. Linda Sarsour, um,

332
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,440
she is an extremist who has
backed terrorists and that
the space won't be happy

333
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:29,490
until this whole goddamn country
is Muslim. Very conscious. Emily,

334
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,000
thank you for being Tracy.

335
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,970
So it just didn't feel right at the
moment and didn't want to run for the New

336
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,140
York City Council. And so after
four or five years of planning,

337
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,920
organizing and laying the groundwork
so that Linda Sarsour could run and

338
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,370
represent

339
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,230
the Arab community, there was
suddenly this moment of, Oh God,

340
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,123
what are we going to do?

341
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,060
You know this by the way again is
Kayla Santo Sue Oso who at the time was

342
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:01,180
working with Linda at the
Arab American Association.

343
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,300
And then I remember a moment when at the
association I walked in and I said to

344
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:09,700
her like, I just got out of a meeting
that Father Kay was in and I was like,

345
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,100
well, at that time I was like, I think
I was calling him reverend Elliot team.

346
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,320
I don't remember what we wrote when
I was calling him, but I was like,

347
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,560
don't you think he'd be a great
person to run for council?

348
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:20,530
And she like slammed her hand down
on the table and she's like, Kayla,

349
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,150
I was just thinking about the same
thing. It was like a light bulb went off.

350
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,240
So, uh,

351
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,020
we both like started going through our
heads of like why he meets us in the

352
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:34,990
middle, got all these connections with
people outside of the Arab community.

353
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:36,820
He's a parent, a public school students.

354
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:39,520
He worked at an Orthodox Jewish
hospital. He's the clergy,

355
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:43,270
the liaison to the NYP. Di Is Lutheran.
He's Arab, but he's Christian,

356
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,610
he's not Muslim.

357
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:49,320
And they started thinking like he's going
to be able to get votes that no other

358
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:50,154
Arab could

359
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,670
like, oh my God, he's like
the most intersectional.

360
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,100
Let me not use that jargony term.

361
00:21:56,101 --> 00:22:00,900
He's like the person with the most
complex identity that might just be so

362
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:02,250
complex that it'll work.

363
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,140
And so the reached out to me on this
said, listen, we want you to do this.

364
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,501
And you know,

365
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:11,160
he thought about the fact that doing this
it would require him to quit his job.

366
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,540
It would be tough on his family,

367
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,720
but it felt again like here
was an opportunity to help
the people around it to

368
00:22:17,821 --> 00:22:21,900
help the people in my
community. So, so I think,

369
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,670
I'm not sure if it's like the end of
the September where I became like,

370
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,080
yes, 100%

371
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,030
[inaudible]

372
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,470
and so I would bring my
Bush to Sydney Council.

373
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,540
A couple months later I announced on
February 26 this is not only my campaign,

374
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,050
this is yours. Lasage restaurant,

375
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,820
a local Lebanese restaurant. Yes.

376
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,520
Keith upfront shouting into the
microphone, blowing out the speakers.

377
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:57,560
Every single seat was filled. We
are going to win as we go into it.

378
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,720
And His message to them was essentially
we cannot sit and live in the shed

379
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,810
anymore. We have to be engaged.
We have to be involved.

380
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:07,940
We had to be part of the
decision making of this country.

381
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:12,941
We have to bring our perspective to the
table because the fact is other people

382
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:16,690
cannot represent us. So
let's not stick this to me.

383
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,490
We have to present ourselves.

384
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,480
I'm really getting lucky
with the book in the splits.

385
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,570
It's your relationship with
God. I don't think so. And

386
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,710
pretty much right off the bat,
those words like us and ourselves,

387
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,040
they presented a series of challenges
for father led team. Uh, the first one

388
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,750
being a large number of Arab
Americans who are American citizens,

389
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,830
but they are not registered and they
refuse to be part of the political system

390
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:56,600
in this country because
they don't trust it.

391
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,870
Like here is a community that has avoided
government to the nth degree for the

392
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,370
past decade and a half. So what does he
do? Well, during the month of Ramadan,

393
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:09,740
which is the holy month, and
three or four nights a week,

394
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,800
he would show up to the mosques with a
stack of literature and a larger stack of

395
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,550
voter registration forms.

396
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,610
They might if I leave my backpack
in the car here on the night.

397
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:21,770
I tagged along with him
and his campaign manager,

398
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:24,890
Kayla is mosque is actually
technically outside. It was hot,

399
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,060
muggy Elliott team was dressed
in his minister garb, you know,

400
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,120
suit and collar and I'm used to the boards
and as we walked into the mosque and

401
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,120
I take my shoes out here,

402
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,100
it wasn't at all clear to
me how this was going to go.

403
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,960
Considering what's happening
in the Middle East,

404
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,690
the ward and the division
and the different groups.

405
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,070
I was not sure if they were ready to
support the candidacy of an Arabic

406
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,903
Christian to represent them.

407
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:55,150
So we're standing in the back of this
huge room that has like green carpet and a

408
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,960
low low ceiling.

409
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,670
There are like 700 people there
standing shoulder to shoulder,

410
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,860
all praying in unison,

411
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,940
have to do this ritual four times.

412
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,250
And then there was a break in the prayer

413
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,080
are going to allow me to speak no to
address the peoples who didn't know that I

414
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:21,110
am here. So we sort of tiptoe
through all these people.

415
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,830
They're up at the front of
the moon, they introduce him

416
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:32,870
[inaudible]

417
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,530
and he launched into this space

418
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,310
just in the middle of prevented my
disability to New York [inaudible]

419
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,870
basically saying, you know,

420
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:45,820
this is our historic opportunity for the
Arab community to send their first ever

421
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,770
Arab American to city council.

422
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,450
And even with the language barrier,

423
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:56,440
you can hear the passion in this
speech and to respond to that was

424
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:58,923
tepid

425
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,440
at best. Yeah.

426
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,400
So when he was done,

427
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:13,020
we headed out to the front of the
mosque and as the service led out,

428
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,540
this sea of 700 people come
crashing out of the mosque

429
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,770
so that my liquor, you
haven't had good luck.

430
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,760
Their excitement for
him is on open display.

431
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,380
They're giving him hugs, they're
saying we're behind you. We love it.

432
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,990
I believe in this guy.

433
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:37,500
I think he is the best candidate in the
field and he will well represent the

434
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:38,010
community.

435
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,760
Only you can represent the
community. We are behind you. 100%

436
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,640
yeah, establish [inaudible]

437
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,570
and that evening, 1225 in the morning,

438
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,450
we are at mosque number two
we went to a second mosque.

439
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,700
[inaudible] need to go and then
a third. Are you doing good?

440
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,260
Get to see each time that same energetic
response, people are just pouring out.

441
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:08,000
He seems to know everyone and
most importantly, all of the pins

442
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,400
people were signing his petition to get
on the ballot. Okay. 39 Harden Avenue.

443
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,380
Okay, so just sign here and registering
to vote. It would just tell him please.

444
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,860
No, just throw him. So you
just registered to vote? Yes.

445
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:26,610
This is my first time registering many
of them for the first time. The best.

446
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,760
Did you just register on first time?

447
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,030
First Time only for him. You're
just a voter. You know what I mean?

448
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,400
Oh, what's up brother?

449
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,720
Ultimately everybody thinks we're insane
when we say we're investing a fair

450
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:46,570
amount of our resources and people who
have never voted before and people are

451
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:49,990
kind of like, what? You know, like
don't do that. It's a waste of money

452
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,130
because for many of these people,

453
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:55,010
the whole thing about registering
and then later voting,

454
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,900
it was a foreign language to them.

455
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,010
Sometimes when he'd ask
people to register to vote,

456
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:06,130
they'd respond back while we ordered the
give you money and there's 10 but this

457
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:07,070
is the process.

458
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,760
Other people thought that just registering
to vote was the same as voting for

459
00:28:10,761 --> 00:28:14,730
him. I said, no, no, you're the black
vote for me. The potter, September 12.

460
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,490
But I signed the papers two weeks ago
and on top of that we did see signs of

461
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:23,650
that mistrust of government. I
have the register. You don't,

462
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,780
you want to get the first era
of American and city council

463
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,200
[inaudible] the first
time for a lot of people.

464
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,150
[inaudible] hiding under the radar.

465
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,090
But still, this is crazy. I didn't
think that we would get this much

466
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,510
after going from mosque to
mosque through all of Ramadan,

467
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,790
by like three months before the election,

468
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,010
we have registered close to 300
voters. So just at the mosques. Yeah.

469
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,590
And do you think, do you think you
can get those 4,000 votes from the,

470
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:59,520
from the Arab community alone?
We, we are, uh, you know, uh,

471
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,810
uh, not counting on the Arab.

472
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,460
We can think about 1000 votes
from the Arab community.

473
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,680
Wait, only a thousand votes.
Yeah, just a thousand.

474
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,650
Didn't you just say they were tens of
thousands of Arab Americans living there?

475
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,030
Well, yes, there are. There
are. So, but first of all,

476
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,980
if I get this correct,

477
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:22,010
about 250 Arab American votes were
cast in the last council primary 250

478
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,180
even getting to that 1000 number
was going to be a heavy lift.

479
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,320
And there's one more wrinkle
here. So I'm in Brooklyn.

480
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:35,770
We have about 800 families
that attend our church.

481
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,470
The folks you might expect to
be his most ardent supporters,

482
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,980
other Arab American
Christians. We main Orthodox

483
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,750
church in Egypt, like Sharif here,
Sharif, s. H. E. R. I. F. Um,

484
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,030
I am a deacon in the church. We're
gonna vote failure. I don't know. Yeah,

485
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,910
they were really interested
in supporting him.

486
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,820
Will you be voting for Father Heather
Elliott team? No. No, no, no. No.

487
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,970
You won't be. No. The beginning of my
campaign, I tried to reach out to them.

488
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,560
No. For me personally,
no. I feel pushback. No,

489
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,270
no. I don't know. Why is that
and what, what, what's going on?

490
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,870
Well, the Arabic Christians
in our districts are, uh,

491
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:18,670
the vast majority are
Republicans. Uh, so yeah,

492
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:22,990
I will say 95% of them are Republicans.

493
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,810
So that's number one. Number two,

494
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,160
you have the situation in Egypt
where Christians are being,

495
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:35,140
um, four now been killed after bombing
Christian churches in Egypt, uh,

496
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,520
of churches are being burned.

497
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,160
George's Church and Taunton
ripped apart these radical groups,

498
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,890
isis claiming responsibility.

499
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,140
Many of the dead are children.

500
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,660
Um, yeah, you, you see
there's tensions. Well,

501
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:53,460
and so is there a level of distrust
in the Christian Arab community of you

502
00:30:53,461 --> 00:30:58,461
because you are so close with
the Muslim Arab community here?

503
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:02,160
I mean, I will give you an example.
I have very close, a friend of mine,

504
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:05,610
his name is Francois. And so
people went out to him and saying,

505
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,810
we cannot support him. And he
said, why not? Why? He said,

506
00:31:09,811 --> 00:31:14,100
because he's very close with the Muslims
and they will take advantage of him.

507
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,800
So, but this is the dynamics,
this is what's happening.

508
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,610
So eventually they decided
only going after the Arab vote.

509
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,790
Wasn't the right numbers game, like
that's just not, it's just not gonna work.

510
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,850
And so what that meant was I need to
get 3000 votes from non Arabs in the

511
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:30,690
district to win this election.

512
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,501
In other words,

513
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:37,030
he was going to have to convince the
majority white voters that he could

514
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:41,140
represent them too, which wasn't
going to be easy. All right.

515
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:45,370
Walking down fifth year, as I discovered
when maybe a month before the election,

516
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,820
I went on a stroll to try to take the
pulse of some of the neighborhoods,

517
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,570
white residents. Have you lived here
in Bay Ridge for awhile? All my life.

518
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,070
Has the neighborhood changed
a lot? Yes. It's more,

519
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,210
it's more foreigners than American. Scary.

520
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,120
Listen to us

521
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,260
as 78 year old Irish woman.

522
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,160
You have newcomers
coming into our district.

523
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,030
What do they know about it? Nothing.

524
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,090
They do not know.

525
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,890
And when I asked them about Father
Lee team specifically, what did,

526
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,220
do you know anything about him?
No, I don't. And I don't care to,

527
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,570
honestly, I'd never heard of
them. The one that's running

528
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,150
right, he's Egyptian.
He's Palestinian. Okay.

529
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,510
Pouch still Egyptian. That's how I feel.

530
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,250
I just completely turns

531
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,950
me off. And just to be clear here,
you're a democrat. Yes. Yeah. Cool. Yeah.

532
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,970
Yeah. These are Democrats.

533
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,780
If anybody asks me to the vote for
Donald Trump or he was running,

534
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,040
I would turn around and Hell No.
But I feel this is our country.

535
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,600
This is America.

536
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,010
And I feel American person
should be in for office.

537
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,130
Was that representative of
what you heard? Was that, uh,

538
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,490
on that street on that day? Yes. Uh,

539
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:11,650
but clearly it's not like everyone down
there has these opinions and this by no

540
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:14,420
means excuses their behavior or language,

541
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:19,421
but I think it explains some of it that
they see rent prices going up and dozens

542
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:22,430
of new Arab folks moving into
the neighborhood every month.

543
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,790
But these are not the gentrifying
forest though. This is oddly enough,

544
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,240
the Arab immigrants and even
more so the Chinese immigrants,

545
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,640
they in some ways are, let's talk
about the issues that I hear and,

546
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,760
and every issue, jumping back to the
debate from the top of the piece,

547
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:41,330
this is one of the Republican candidates,
Liam McCabe, overcrowded schools,

548
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,970
whether it's infrastructure
and transportation,

549
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,330
it can be traced to one particular
issue in South Brooklyn.

550
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,000
And that isn't illegal home
conversion. Absolutely.

551
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,390
Developers or landlords are
taking these single family homes,

552
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,690
knocking out all the walls on the
ground floor in the second floor,

553
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,690
and then putting up these,
uh, these temporary walls,

554
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:07,990
building these very tiny cramped domiciles
that they can then rent out to 10 or

555
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:14,150
15 families. Oh. And what
that does is first of all,

556
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:17,270
it's incredibly unsafe for the
people living in the house,

557
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,260
but also it's putting stress on
the sewer system and streets. Uh,

558
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:23,520
it causes classroom sizes to go up. Uh,

559
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,190
housing prices go up because there are
just less actual single family homes on

560
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,110
the market. Uh,

561
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,870
it's making the neighborhood more
dense than it was ever meant to be.

562
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,640
And so for a lot of these people who have
lived in this neighborhood for a long

563
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,474
time, uh,

564
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:41,890
I think it feels like their daily lives
are being effected by these forces

565
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,370
outside their control and they are
reacting emotionally to those things.

566
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,830
So you're fighting for 'em I'm fighting
for the district fighting to make sure

567
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,780
the quality of life. Just one example,

568
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,740
there's a couple months
before the election lea team
was going around knocking

569
00:34:55,741 --> 00:34:58,880
on doors. And what are your
views on illegal immigration? Uh,

570
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,140
we need to do the immigration reform.

571
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,810
We need to make sure the undocumented
are protected. Our sanctuary city. No,

572
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,540
no, you don't read my book.
It's not a sanctuary city. No,

573
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,280
I'm interested in to follow federal
law. I get my clock out of my sight.

574
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,490
Alright, thank you. Thank you.

575
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,350
You paid it all

576
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,450
in several of the Republican candidates.

577
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,340
You know, I deeply believe
that illegal immigration has,

578
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:29,230
it is a big group because of this.

579
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,260
We're trying to harness those emotions.

580
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,690
Come here legally. Get a
handout. Public health benefits.

581
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,570
That must stop it.

582
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,310
[inaudible]

583
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,800
one Republican candidate wrote about me.

584
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:47,150
I am a radical leftist Palestinian clerk.

585
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,780
Presumably they're using the word
cleric insinuating that you are not,

586
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,110
are not in fact Christian but you are
Muslim. Is that the insinuation there?

587
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,050
Yeah, I mean that is part of the plan.

588
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:01,100
They tried to use the feel of
the people against my candidacy.

589
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:06,490
Then the comments and the need
that post it is just terrifying.

590
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,060
I'm going to hang him. For
example, one guy said all this one,

591
00:36:11,061 --> 00:36:15,110
I cannot read it on radio, but I
will show it to you. Read it. He,

592
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,960
he's a fucking asshole and
should be treated as such.

593
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,220
I have lived in this community for the
best 22 years and never in my life faced

594
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,210
anything like this.

595
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,130
And does really interesting because the
attacks not only coming from Republicans

596
00:36:28,131 --> 00:36:31,820
but also coming from Democrats
in the race a but the Democrats,

597
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,770
they don't kind of under the table. Oh,

598
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:37,580
your team claims that some
of the Democrats are making
the argument that yes,

599
00:36:37,581 --> 00:36:42,140
he might be able to win a democratic
primary. Uh, but because he's Arab,

600
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:46,580
he won't be able to win the general
election. So don't waste your vote on him.

601
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,030
And Justin Brandon, who's
really the establishment,

602
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:54,350
Democratic Front runner in the race,
his flyers and his lit says, oh,

603
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,360
what a neighborhood, our guy, uh,

604
00:36:56,361 --> 00:36:59,600
so for me as an Arab American who are
living here, what that supposed to mean,

605
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:04,830
it is a [inaudible] a statement
of exclusion and that I,

606
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,490
I'll just say on that, uh,

607
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,190
as a white dude from Wisconsin,
when I see that flyer,

608
00:37:13,191 --> 00:37:17,270
I don't see that division in
that. Am I just blind to it?

609
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,123
We,

610
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:23,960
you have to understand the context of
the neighborhoods and the context is

611
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,290
everything wrong in the neighborhood is
[inaudible] the Arab and the Chinese,

612
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,160
you know, if the streets is dirty
because of these dumb erupts, you know,

613
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:36,350
like when I go out and say I'm fighting
for the community and say Hasi is just

614
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:39,530
only fighting for his community,
it means only the Arab people.

615
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:43,160
But if somebody else said the word
community, it's okay. It means everybody.

616
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,190
And I don't mean to push
back, but it seems like, okay.

617
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,960
It seems like you two are essentially
doing the same thing to one another. Yeah.

618
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,700
He's saying, when you
say the word community,

619
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:55,910
it's only about the Arab community.
And when he says our neighborhood,

620
00:37:55,911 --> 00:37:58,550
you're saying he's just talking
about the white folks in Bay Ridge.

621
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,040
Isn't it the same thing
happening in both directions?

622
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,540
It could be a, but we need to
understand the backgrounds.

623
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,880
We have a president who
use so much rhetoric.

624
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,670
He came up with the Muslim
ban and building the wall and,

625
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:18,620
and attacking minorities
and people of color. Uh,

626
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,330
our councilman and his staff never took
a stand on these issues and came out in

627
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:25,790
support of the Arab and
Muslim community. That's,

628
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,980
you have to look at the history and, well,

629
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:32,450
it seems like maybe his opponents are
playing up this kind of identity politics

630
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,250
over and over again. I saw
Elliott making explicit

631
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,280
attempts to reach out across
those boundaries. I like this.

632
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,810
And Republicans take this, for example,

633
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,910
at this noisy firefighter bar,

634
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,480
he strolled up to this table of burly
white men and just started giving hoax.

635
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,800
And I mean, just listen to
how Brooklyn he sounds here.

636
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,990
Let's do that once more. Are you filming?

637
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,840
Is he behaving like you'd
be like, yes please.

638
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,110
The whole thing has been
a really delicate line.

639
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,000
Kayla Santos who so because we
really want it to be honest and,

640
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,230
and not adjust too much. Um,

641
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,830
but while also like letting people know
that this campaign wasn't just for the

642
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:16,870
Arab community, it was for them as well,

643
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,160
nine,

644
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,970
nine to 59 and so the campaign
was also focusing on things that,

645
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,270
well, things that mattered to
everyone. What's happening here,

646
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,750
they're doing a complete
renovation of the station.

647
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,220
There's no r train at the station,

648
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,310
you know, a real daily life concerns.

649
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,190
The physician is going to be closed
for at least five months. As you see,

650
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:37,024
it's chaotic.

651
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,080
On a cloudy morning lea team set up a
podium right in front of the cordoned off

652
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:44,830
staircase of a closed subway station and
railed against the MTA for doing with

653
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,640
next to no warning at all these repairs
that were really just cosmetics weren't

654
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:51,520
needed at all. We think
about our students,

655
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:55,610
we think about our small business
owners a months about shoves,

656
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:00,790
who will be affected, impacted for the
closing this station for no reason.

657
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,390
I mean,

658
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,940
what's more unifying here in New York
then complaining about the subway to

659
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,230
improve the city. And he also
went after specific groups,

660
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,870
groups who were traditionally white.

661
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,620
I just want to say thank you so much
for this opportunity to invite me to be

662
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,180
with you tonight. Uh,

663
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,640
like on this rainy Thursday night in this
wide WCA multipurpose room that felt a

664
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:27,490
lot like an elementary school cafeteria.

665
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,780
And I thank you for inviting me to share
my reasoning why I'm running for city

666
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:32,614
council.

667
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:37,710
And also to tell you that I will be very
proud to be the first one to represent

668
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:43,090
the democratic socialist in City Hall,
who, who are the Democratic Socialists?

669
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,030
These are the Bernie Sanders people.

670
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:50,860
And the important factor now is there
are lots of anti-establishment white

671
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:51,940
people in this district.

672
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,400
This neighborhood in the presidential
primary went Bernie and went Trump.

673
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,130
He beat Hillary. He beat Hillary
in this district. So, oh,

674
00:40:58,131 --> 00:41:01,250
your team has to put
on the clothes of yes.

675
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,730
A Brooklyn Jew and
watching him try to do that

676
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,840
couple of things struck me. It said
that was born and raised in Bethlehem,

677
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,560
Palestine. Uh, and my father
actually also carpenter,

678
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,780
no, no relation.

679
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:20,790
Not In this first how he was intentionally
bringing parts of himself to the for

680
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,020
uh, well pushing other
parts into the background.

681
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,670
So I'm going to tell you that uh,

682
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,650
we have some commonalities together and
second we are committed to justice and I

683
00:41:30,651 --> 00:41:32,600
think that's why you are
here tonight, right? Yeah.

684
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,160
Otherwise you all in the wrong room.

685
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,323
No.

686
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:39,740
How we highlighted specific policies
that represented those parts of himself.

687
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,000
Issues like economic justice. If
free education, our universities,

688
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:48,170
I have two daughters in college
and I know how much it cost me.

689
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,640
I know that my wife and I,

690
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:52,970
we have to get a second job to be
able to pay for them to go to college.

691
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,730
So they decide to support them or no?

692
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,690
Well in fact they did.

693
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,980
He was endorsed by the
Democratic Socialists of America,

694
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,990
both the local and national chapters of
the organization, which was a huge deal.

695
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,300
Yes. 100%. And that was like,
hey, we are a business now.

696
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:14,750
It's now it's interesting, right?

697
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,590
Because with that endorsement
came some real support.

698
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:20,140
I came to the campaign through the DSA.

699
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,620
DSA seemed like a good conduit locally.

700
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:28,480
They committed hundreds of volunteers.
We had 150 200 volunteers yesterday.

701
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,520
The sort of manpower that allowed
them to flood the neighborhood

702
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,340
and knock on thousands of bottles.
Michael, I mean need to about

703
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,690
trying to convince people to vote.

704
00:42:43,691 --> 00:42:46,840
Flint people understood the
stances on the legislation.

705
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,590
Really excited about
that. I'm feeling good,

706
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,873
Dara,

707
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,540
and more than just helping them knock
on doors because of the national

708
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,820
endorsement on many evenings of the week,

709
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,650
they actually had folks from all over
the United States phone banking for him,

710
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,760
calling from places like Florida
to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Again,

711
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,890
pitching people to vote
for father your team.

712
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:15,780
I'm trying to show that my
candidacy for city council.

713
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,000
It is for everyone in this
district and this is this.

714
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,710
I find this so fascinating about you
that I see such a contradiction in

715
00:43:25,711 --> 00:43:28,260
everything you're saying there that
you're saying you want to represent the

716
00:43:28,261 --> 00:43:31,440
whole community, which I'm sure
you do, but at the heart of it,

717
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:35,430
like what's motivating that is wanting
to give voice to this group of people

718
00:43:35,431 --> 00:43:40,380
that don't have a voice. Absolutely. I
mean that is 100% and I cannot deny that.

719
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:45,410
I mean one of the most motivating factors
me running because I wanted to make

720
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:50,790
sure my community has a
voice and has representation,

721
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,900
but I'm running to the
present everyone, you know,

722
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,500
I mean at this weird,
because you know, uh,

723
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,440
was that a question in
your mind going into this,

724
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:09,390
like how do I walk this
in incredibly tiny,

725
00:44:09,391 --> 00:44:13,050
tight rope of telling the Arab community,

726
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:16,860
I am you and this is our moment,

727
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,500
but simultaneously telling the
majority of the neighborhood like,

728
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:25,770
but I'm still you too. Like
don't worry. I can be both.

729
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,740
People have to understand my identity.

730
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,830
I mean I went and knocked
on thousands doors.

731
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,950
We talked to people and my,

732
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:39,090
my talking points of the door
was always, I'm a father of four.

733
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:43,650
My wife is a school nurse. Um, uh,
I love this community. And then the,

734
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,050
I didn't speak on the, about
the Arab and Muslim community.

735
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:49,410
I spoke about affordability,
livability in the community.

736
00:44:49,411 --> 00:44:53,550
We spoke about transportation, we
spoke about, uh, police accountability.

737
00:44:53,551 --> 00:44:57,050
We spoke about things that people in the
community said in this district said,

738
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,250
yes, we are going to support you.

739
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,910
We need somebody like you
who can go and our behalf.

740
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:08,040
So at the end of the day,
uh, my identity is who I am.

741
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:13,490
I am running as who I am and I will not
allow anybody to take that away from me.

742
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:20,030
And so just a couple of days before
September 12th, uh, before the election,

743
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,850
I checked in with Kayla to
see how things were looking.

744
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,520
How many days do we have
left here? Five days.

745
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:27,343
Okay.

746
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,950
Yeah. And apparently she told me, uh,

747
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:38,020
as l u team and his canvassers had
been going around to all of these doors

748
00:45:38,021 --> 00:45:42,070
knocking. They had been taking
notes on people. And in those notes,

749
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,770
each person was given a
number from one to five

750
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,200
based on their level of support.

751
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,080
One is like that person
was so pro Elliot team,

752
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,450
you didn't even need to go to that
door. You're just marking them down.

753
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,570
Five is like, sorry, I'm
voting for somebody else.

754
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,940
Twos and ones are positive ids

755
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,440
and just a couple of days before the
election, an election, I'll remind you,

756
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:03,840
they only need 4,000 votes to win.

757
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:07,680
The number of positive
ids they had was 5,500

758
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,020
so you currently have 5,500 give
or take. Yeah, ones and twos.

759
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:13,230
Yeah,

760
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:17,180
so will be very interesting to see how
the prime minister will be translated in

761
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:19,700
numbers when the September 12 comes.

762
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,370
Okay,

763
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,850
well we're going to take a break and
when we come back it'll be election day.

764
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,840
Election Day.

765
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,280

Jad Roberts, Radiolab, and we're
going to go back to Simon Adler.

779
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:24,630
Should we do election day? Yeah,
yeah. Let's have an election. Okay.

780
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:29,410
What happens? So the election, uh,
this is September 12th. All right,

781
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:30,070
so it is six

782
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,070
in the morning when he
17 son is yet to rise.

783
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:38,650
We are outside the a l e a team
a get out the vote headquarters.

784
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:39,484
Here we go.

785
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:41,670
Where's the lift that we're
using for that, ma'am?

786
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:47,280
And so I show up at six in the morning
and everything is already a buzz already

787
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,340
over there. It's crazy. There were
dozens of volunteers, staff workers.

788
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,270
You're all so amazing. Thank
you for coming this morning.

789
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:57,200
I'll bring around these plastic folding
tables that were set up everywhere.

790
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,620
Don't leave without one or two signs.

791
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,670
So what we're going to do is we're
going to give you a giant stack of

792
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:06,300
literature. Says, all right, sweet. And
shortly, shortly after I got there, uh,

793
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:10,280
Kayla [inaudible], Father
Elliott team both arrived

794
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,393
[inaudible]

795
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,050
we're matching. That's pretty awesome.

796
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:23,050
No, it's got the memo. Yeah, right.
They were in a matching Democrat,

797
00:48:23,051 --> 00:48:26,650
blue Kayla in blue jeans and a
blazer father Elliott team, uh,

798
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,320
in an Oxford with the,

799
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:33,160
the white collar and blue through
saying today's election that wow,

800
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:36,190
this is a September 12th and
as quickly as he arrived. Yeah,

801
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,950
no, uh, no opposition, insight and uh,

802
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:43,720
enjoy yourself was sent out
to start that. Oh yeah. 86th,

803
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,710
beautiful day in the neighborhood.

804
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:50,070
And so a sub beautiful
day in the neighborhood.

805
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,920
We hopped in his car and that was
sort of the beginning of the day.

806
00:48:52,921 --> 00:48:56,640
And really his job was just to shake as
many hands of as many people as he could

807
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,390
in as many different disparate
parts of the district as possible.

808
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:03,270
Are you boarding today? The hot
southeast you speak Arabic or English,

809
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,370
what should be

810
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:06,790
be the basis of whether
or not you win a race,

811
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:11,080
his Id and pull id as many
positive ideas as you can.

812
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,860
Pull out as many of those
people on election day pull out,

813
00:49:14,861 --> 00:49:17,350
meaning pull them to the polls. Exactly.

814
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:22,060
Get as many of your positive ideas out
to the polls as you can and for their

815
00:49:22,061 --> 00:49:25,840
campaign to do this, we have to
effectively have two different operations.

816
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,380
First and foremost.

817
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,120
I know, sorry [inaudible].

818
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,830
There's gotta be an Arab community
operation. You've worked,

819
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:37,840
so we have likely Arabic speakers.

820
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,940
Their assumption was that an Arab voter
is going to need their handheld much

821
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,510
more tightly to get them to the polls.

822
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,360
It's like a lot of these people have
never been to the polls before and so,

823
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,790
okay, can you just give her a message?

824
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:53,340
Then they had like six people on their
phones just going down these lists.

825
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:57,390
I'm calling to speak to
[inaudible] calling people saying,

826
00:49:57,391 --> 00:50:00,840
have you come out and voted today?
The family, thank you so much.

827
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:03,360
Simultaneously, that same
person who has been called,

828
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,440
I'm basically the person that actually
make sure that you go boat is being

829
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:11,730
flanked by a group of canvassers.
All right? This is a Mohammad

830
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:14,660
marching up to their apartment
and banging on their door saying

831
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,100
one C, two e BD,

832
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:25,950
four a and 40 come out and vote.
We're gonna pull you out to you eyes.

833
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,010
Know what

834
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:28,910
time we're going to say like,

835
00:50:28,911 --> 00:50:31,640
what time are you going to the polls
up from the wartime nine or, yeah,

836
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:36,000
nine [inaudible]. We need you to
go, go father k needs you to go.

837
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:36,870
I met him.

838
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,640
They had this very, uh,

839
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,780
long script they would go through and
I don't remember all of the Arabic,

840
00:50:42,781 --> 00:50:45,150
but they would often say, so are
you going to the polls today?

841
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:48,390
And the response would be,
and Shalla like God willing.

842
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,530
And they weren't supposed to accept
that. They'd have to say, no, no, no, no,

843
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:56,250
no, no, no, no, and Charlotte tomorrow,
today, not God willing. You Willing?

844
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:59,520
And then they would have to get them to
say either like I promised on my head or

845
00:50:59,521 --> 00:51:01,890
I promise on my heart. And
if they got either of those,

846
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:05,940
then they felt like they had imposed
social pressures that would work on the

847
00:51:05,941 --> 00:51:06,680
Arab community. Yeah,

848
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,540
and then on top of all this,

849
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,870
we have to do the standard operation of
get out the vote with the triple prime

850
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:12,231
voters,

851
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:17,000
which is like the voters that have
that reliably vote in primaries in this

852
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:20,460
community. Largely white, largely
over the age of 50 all right.

853
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:24,470
Saint Nicholas old folks home, he voted.

854
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,620
I am back again going into nursing homes,

855
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,780
sending out even more canvassers and even

856
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,440
the occasional shout out the passenger
window of your car and early on in the

857
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:40,630
day back at the campaign headquarters.

858
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:43,160
All right. If I need to
read that [inaudible] yeah,

859
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:48,070
I need somebody who's a free now when he
needs it to go become a quote from him.

860
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,290
It was clear just how complicated and
resource intensive running these two

861
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:56,690
parallel campaigns was. Just a
couple of people at to vote a,

862
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:00,150
I'm going to say the that'll your team
had just received a call from several

863
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:03,600
Muslim women saying that they needed
a ride to the polls. His wife,

864
00:52:03,601 --> 00:52:06,360
grace was going to go pick them
up, but she needed someone to,

865
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,370
I mean the, and you know I'm going
to go with them to get the voters.

866
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,100
So this organizer said she would
do it, but she, no, no, no.

867
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:17,730
You can leave the table.
You guys do. Yeah,

868
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:18,723
I'll deal with it.

869
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,260
Pain directors, Andy, it
said no, you've got to stay.

870
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:24,840
Don't text whatsapp. WHATSAPP. I
live with a girl. Take this one.

871
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:28,080
I'll take care of this. Can
pick up a voter. Yes. Mohamed,

872
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:33,650
can it be Mohammed like just
send Mohammad [inaudible]

873
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,920
it turns out, uh, Mohammed doesn't speak.

874
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,350
Somebody speaks Arabic, which no,

875
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,530
look necessarily eventually turned
out to not actually be a problem.

876
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:45,320
So why doesn't Mohammad please
those I know. I know. I know.

877
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:46,990
So why does it mamas, they can too much

878
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:51,650
come here. So go.

879
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:57,110
But then we dad pointed out
earlier that if these are women,

880
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,730
it would be more appropriate for all
those going to pick them up to be women.

881
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:02,390
Um, [inaudible] you know,

882
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:06,240
cultural stuff that say what can be here.

883
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:10,480
I can take my place for a little
bit. I'll think your president.

884
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,170
So finally busy day, hectic.

885
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,930
They said we. Dot. Just go. Yeah, exactly.
And this was all for just two votes,

886
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,350
but I will say despite all
that, midway through the day,

887
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,500
it did appear like this two
pronged approach was working.

888
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,010
This is his first time voting. I

889
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,620
voted yes. Good. Yeah,
I did. Yeah, you did

890
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,780
those 50 doors. 50 doors. Yeah. 71 people,

891
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,390
canvassers. We're getting good feedback.

892
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:38,100
And on the street that that Adam anthem,

893
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,930
both first time voters will
have just told him Arab folks

894
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:45,480
and hello, I bought it
for your white folks.

895
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,290
We're coming up to him and saying
like what happened about hey,

896
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:50,483
we voted for you.

897
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,490
[inaudible] this is rob yet the canvasser
who's been with the campaign from the

898
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:59,040
beginning. You don't understand what this
means for the Abbey medical community.

899
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:03,000
You only know what it means.
So it's pretty personal.

900
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:09,080
Have you voted today right?
I'm going to get all the money.

901
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,570
You're getting emotional. I
don't want to be emotional.

902
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,110
My husband is banned in Malaysia
because he swim yet, man.

903
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,100
Okay, Ken, do this
cause I'm chilling. Yes.

904
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,910
Yeah, that's good. Have
you voted. Thank you.

905
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:29,710
So yeah, it is very personal.

906
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,083
Okay.

907
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,340
But then, hi,

908
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:40,640
how are you in Elliott team's car
at about two in the afternoon.

909
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,140
How's the numbers looking?

910
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:45,770
They got their first sense of what
voter turnout was looking like.

911
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:54,983
Yeah,

912
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,170
right, right. Yeah.

913
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,430
So the numbers side of that
were underperforming in a
few poles sites where we

914
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:14,020
should be doing better.
And you know, uh, sorry,

915
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:16,870
let me start that again.
I'm like frazzle now. Um,

916
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,700
this is Mohammad con the campaigns
treasurer. Yeah. The number said that,

917
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,590
you know,

918
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:27,040
poll sites where we have strong support
are showing lower turnout than we are

919
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:31,030
hoping for. Um, so obviously we
don't know who people are voting for,

920
00:55:31,031 --> 00:55:34,490
but we're guessing that since the
last people are voting their overall,

921
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,430
that means that less
folks are voting for us.

922
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:40,120
And then pull sites where we know our
opponent has strong support and we're

923
00:55:40,121 --> 00:55:41,440
seeing higher turnout.

924
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,000
And so w what are the
strategies to remedy that?

925
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,960
So we just need to allocate more
canvassing resources to areas where we see

926
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:54,760
underperformance so we can
turn more people out to vote.

927
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:58,000
So go knock on those doors
hard, knock on the doors,

928
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,460
pull people out of their
homes and make sure they vote.

929
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,920
And so with about four
hours remaining. Yep.

930
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,690
So right now it's all about
talking to individuals,

931
00:56:07,691 --> 00:56:10,690
dragging people off the streets.
All of the leaders of the campaign,

932
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,930
including Linda Sarsour. You literally
got to find people that are recognizable.

933
00:56:13,931 --> 00:56:16,600
If hit the streets, I'd go to shops.

934
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,940
I got Steve at the move
of North Bay Ridge.

935
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:21,880
They were literally going into
Arab owned stories, telling them,

936
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:24,280
you gotta go to the polls and you
did not. I'm taking you right now.

937
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,160
Barbershops, Delis, hookah,
lounges. Yeah, he's going go vote.

938
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,360
This symptom is $80 fee to vote.

939
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,800
[inaudible] changing his clothes.
You're going to vote. See,

940
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:37,240
they could have two votes.
And while this was happening,

941
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:39,540
I don't live in a district.
I'm here to help out my way.

942
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:43,630
I'm here to canvas for the final
push of volunteers. We're showing up.

943
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:47,110
It's a good time to push again.
Yeah. Do we go a fourth pass?

944
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,270
Yes. Go, go, go, go. Let's go. Let's
go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

945
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:52,620
Come on.

946
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,690
And when they got the updated
turnout numbers. Yeah.

947
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:54,930
Yeah.

948
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:59,030
We have two of our poll sites that have
been hit at 115% of turnout already seem

949
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,180
to be working. So we just got
to keep that up. What's the,

950
00:57:02,181 --> 00:57:04,940
what's the emotion at the
moment? Yeah. I don't know.

951
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,090
I mean it's a close race there. I like it.

952
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,760
At least it feels like it based on the
turnout numbers that we're seeing in the

953
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:11,840
way that turnout is happening.

954
00:57:11,841 --> 00:57:15,530
There's basically two strongholds that
are currently developing North Bay Ridge,

955
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:16,483
South Bay Ridge.

956
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,470
Oh, a South Bay Ridge,
which is largely white,

957
00:57:19,471 --> 00:57:23,370
seems to be turning out hard for the
establishment candidate, Justin Brannan.

958
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:28,290
Uh, and North Bay Ridge is where, uh,
the majority of the Arab Americans live.

959
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:31,100
And in that moment, uh,
the campaign makes it,

960
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:36,140
um, so at this point we're zeroing in
all of our efforts on just, you know,

961
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:37,880
everything north of 75th street,

962
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,280
that the only way to win is to push
hard to get as many votes as they can in

963
00:57:45,081 --> 00:57:49,460
those Arab American neighborhoods and
essentially right off trying to convince

964
00:57:49,461 --> 00:57:52,160
the white voters. So this is
like, you know, we got it.

965
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:55,250
It's our people are going to make the
difference. It'll be good for our people.

966
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:56,100
Yes.

967
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,740
We're doing good. We've got to
stay in our town. Yeah, that's it.

968
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:01,650
And the focus on our part of town. And so

969
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:04,140
would like an hour
remaining. Everyone went out.

970
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:06,870
Let's do this for one final point.

971
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:10,920
Sure. [inaudible]

972
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,280
I see

973
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:16,443
when I come back,

974
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,990
cars were driving by honking their
horns for him in southwest Brooklyn.

975
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:23,100
Really believe this

976
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:27,510
just wrote the 12 hour shifts.

977
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,950
[inaudible] thank you so much.

978
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:40,680
Thank you so much my man.
Thank you so much brother.

979
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,990
Thank you. I'll be in my
living room as I'm going.

980
00:58:42,991 --> 00:58:47,610
I'm going to all the best companies. Can
you take a picture of us? Sure. Yeah.

981
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:05,110
[inaudible]

982
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:07,270
uh, by my watch, it is a nine o'clock.

983
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,150
[inaudible] the campaign is over.
[inaudible] shall love. I didn't,

984
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:20,010
I was with lea team right when we
hit nine o'clock. And in that moment,

985
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,000
I don't know from where, but someone
handed him what's up baby. Okay.

986
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,750
An infant. And he was just
standing on this dark street, uh,

987
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,820
his back against a minivan,

988
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:36,590
his face illuminated by the light pouring
out from his campaign headquarters

989
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:42,370
with this baby in one arm and his cell
phone press tightly up against his ear

990
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:43,903
asking Kayla,

991
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:49,800
I don't know what the
numbers were looking like.

992
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,920
We're still counting.

993
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,780
All of his volunteers,

994
00:59:56,781 --> 01:00:01,190
staff and supporters were gathering in
the patio of this bar pizzeria called the

995
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:06,191
firefly that over to the soul waiting
there for Elliot team to arrive as well as

996
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,394
the results.

997
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:12,970
Kayla called me as I was woken up to the
firefly pizzeria because at that time,

998
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:16,340
the numbers from South
Brooklyn came in. She said,

999
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,200
I've added these results with what we
already know. And uh, she said, uh,

1000
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:21,853
we lost.

1001
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,160
Mm.

1002
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,060
The moment before I
walked into [inaudible]

1003
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:35,440
badly, let's see about
the fight or flight.

1004
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:50,283
[inaudible]

1005
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:03,990
after word got around that they
had in fact lost on Linda Sarsour.

1006
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:08,740
So, um, stood up on this picnic
table and addressed everyone.

1007
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,000
I know a lot of folks who are here
who are not children of immigrants,

1008
01:01:13,001 --> 01:01:15,130
or if you're not Arab American or Muslim,

1009
01:01:15,131 --> 01:01:19,510
you do not understand what this campaign
meant to us and to our communities.

1010
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:23,230
And for us it is not over. And
I want to say to father, father,

1011
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:30,550
father color did not have to do this.
He did not have to quit his job,

1012
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:34,810
a father of four. But
Father Heather did it.

1013
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:40,210
He did it to help us build the political
voice that we knew we always had in

1014
01:01:40,211 --> 01:01:44,120
this community to allow people to
pay attention to us and our issue.

1015
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,300
Guys, we're doing this
again without any backup.

1016
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,003
[inaudible]

1017
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:09,740
wait, so we lost do we to, do
we know, do they know why? Yes.

1018
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,760
So ended up losing by
a just under 700 votes,

1019
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:17,800
which is about 7% of the total votes
cast, which we know what, what, uh, what,

1020
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:20,190
what accounted for the
difference? Yeah. We, we can't

1021
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,650
know for sure why, uh,

1022
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,620
because the voter records
don't come out until December.

1023
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:29,400
But there are a couple of things
that we do know. One was that, uh,

1024
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:34,080
there were no Arabic translators
at the polls. Really? Yeah.

1025
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:38,160
You see how far I can get?
I'm just following. We
actually had reporters, Syrah,

1026
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:41,970
Karrie go down into one of the polling
locations to see exactly what was going

1027
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:42,190
on.

1028
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:42,640
Hi.

1029
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,750
Can I just ask what languages you guys
are translating Cantonese and Mandarin?

1030
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:52,300
I bet you kintone Spanish.
English to Spanish. Okay.

1031
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:54,700
Is there somebody a, an Arabic translator?

1032
01:02:55,790 --> 01:03:00,050
Fortunately Arabic is not a approved
language for him to have an interpreter in

1033
01:03:00,051 --> 01:03:03,230
Brooklyn will actually in New
York. I believe it's sustainable.

1034
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:08,690
Turns out what languages are provided
in any borough of New York City.

1035
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:14,020
A are decided upon based on census data
and because there is no census data.

1036
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:18,020
Oh, come on in Arab community.
So angry. Yeah. That's why.

1037
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:22,070
Did they say you can't come here? Like
are they or do they just go neutral?

1038
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:24,620
Well, the, the problem was, uh,

1039
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:28,490
the interpreters that the campaign was
attempting to provide for these folks at

1040
01:03:28,491 --> 01:03:31,580
several of the polling locations, they
were actually turned away from the polls.

1041
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:34,310
I told you by the New York state
officials, by the election, people,

1042
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:38,020
by the folks working the
polls were really, which I,

1043
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,240
which it turns out is illegal.
They were illegally turned away.

1044
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,870
They were illegally turned
away. But, um, despite all that,

1045
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:49,930
they did in fact get out
more Arab American voters
than have ever turned out for

1046
01:03:51,171 --> 01:03:55,760
a race like this, like by a
factor of four by oh four.

1047
01:03:55,830 --> 01:04:00,260
That's interesting. Where they ended up,
uh, coming up short, it would seem, uh,

1048
01:04:00,261 --> 01:04:04,910
is with the white voters and uh, nobody
has a perfect explanation for this,

1049
01:04:04,911 --> 01:04:05,380
but I,

1050
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:08,870
I did talk to some political movers and
shakers down in the area and they, uh,

1051
01:04:08,871 --> 01:04:12,980
they offered up sort of three different
explanations. Um, one is that, uh,

1052
01:04:12,981 --> 01:04:16,130
the message that he was delivering to
the white folks just failed to connect.

1053
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:20,150
The second one is that, uh, having
these two campaigns at the same time,

1054
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:21,980
one for the Arabs, one
for the white folks,

1055
01:04:21,981 --> 01:04:23,870
that that just damned
him from the beginning.

1056
01:04:23,871 --> 01:04:26,030
Just like in terms of resources
or in terms of messaging,

1057
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:29,810
all of the either a and then
the third one is that, uh,

1058
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:33,530
this had nothing to do with him. This
had nothing to do with this campaign.

1059
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,490
Just in this moment there were not enough
white folks who would be willing to

1060
01:04:37,491 --> 01:04:41,030
vote for an Arab candidate.
Uh, no matter what.

1061
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:45,170
No, no. It's nice to hear,

1062
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,750
to be able to speak back to it.

1063
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,110
We're emotionally, where are
you? Are you like, all right.

1064
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,560
Have you or you like gotten past

1065
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,600
a couple of weeks after the election? Um,

1066
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:02,460
I headed back down to Bay Ridge to sit
down one more time with father lea team.

1067
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,110
Well, the truth is that I
haven't taken a day off yet. Why?

1068
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:11,100
Because I've been so busy. Why
are you doing this to yourself?

1069
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:14,280
Not doing this to myself. It is just a, a,

1070
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:18,220
the outcome of this campaign
has been unbelievable. So

1071
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,780
the moment we finished with the campaign,

1072
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:23,860
we continued to meet to discuss the
political power that we have built,

1073
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:25,600
whether we are going to do with it,

1074
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,080
because we have almost 3000
people came out and voted.

1075
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:31,780
We can make a difference in any election.

1076
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,080
And that's why I said we
cannot slow down. Now.

1077
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,210
We need to continue to
educate the community.

1078
01:05:37,211 --> 01:05:40,150
We need to continue to be engaged with
them. We cannot lose the momentum.

1079
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:44,650
We cannot afford to lose the
momentum. We just can't. So this is,

1080
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:46,820
are you a politician
now? Like in that way,

1081
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,520
this is the will of the
community. We have demands,

1082
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,490
we have political power and um,

1083
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:59,020
we have an address now and the
address is Heather Elliott team. Uh,

1084
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:01,990
so elected officials,
we will not talk to us.

1085
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,110
You come and speak to us
through Heather Elliott team.

1086
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,830
That's the only way you can talk to us.

1087
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:11,260
[inaudible]

1088
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:15,970
wow. Yeah. I feel like what
struck me in that conversation,

1089
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:17,530
uh,

1090
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:22,530
with like he spent his entire campaign
trying to speak to all sorts of different

1091
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:26,620
groups. He was saying, I can represent
you all. I am yours. Everyone,

1092
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:28,900
but in that final conversation, uh,

1093
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:34,140
what I heard from him in that it was a
can becoming more and more a voice of

1094
01:06:34,351 --> 01:06:38,250
just one group, one
community, his community.

1095
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:43,970
Mm. Well that's, yeah, but I sat
co, you know, this is the game.

1096
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:48,740
I feel like this is him recognizing the
nature of the game and deciding to come

1097
01:06:48,741 --> 01:06:51,220
from a position of strength.
And I say awful. I'm also,

1098
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:56,060
you want him to basically tightened his
grip on the Arrow vote and then walk

1099
01:06:56,061 --> 01:06:57,800
into room after room. Of
course, New York City, you say,

1100
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:01,970
when you want to our votes deal
with me. I've got votes to push.

1101
01:07:01,971 --> 01:07:05,390
I've got votes to given with hold
of my boss. I tell you what I want.

1102
01:07:05,391 --> 01:07:10,391
I want that community to step out and be
heard and have a voice and this is how

1103
01:07:11,421 --> 01:07:14,270
it happens. I think it has to,
if you believe in this system,

1104
01:07:14,271 --> 01:07:19,271
it has to be possible for someone talented
enough to be able to stand up and say

1105
01:07:19,401 --> 01:07:20,810
two things at the same time.

1106
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,950
Two things that seem contradictory that
he does believe in and that has to be

1107
01:07:24,951 --> 01:07:28,550
possible. Yeah, I understand that.
But I mean in this particular moment,

1108
01:07:28,551 --> 01:07:29,510
in this particular, I mean,

1109
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:33,400
I don't think identity politics is a
choice in this moment. You know? I mean,

1110
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,860
you remember the woman who was like
still Egyptian, still Egyptian.

1111
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:40,250
He's being seen as one
thing that he is not,

1112
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:43,970
that that doesn't mean
choosing what do you do?

1113
01:07:43,971 --> 01:07:47,030
You can't just like pretend to have a
rainbow coalition when there's no chance

1114
01:07:47,031 --> 01:07:48,860
of that or you can fight.

1115
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:51,450
Ah, you got that out of your system.

1116
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:58,670
Yes. Sorry, just you were saying
through your piece here. I'm sorry. Yes.

1117
01:07:59,060 --> 01:07:59,910
So how does he feel?

1118
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,900
Yeah, I was going to
say, oddly enough, uh,

1119
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,360
I tried to put all of this
in front of him. Well,

1120
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:12,310
that uh, that brings me actually to the
question that I think is at the heart of

1121
01:08:12,311 --> 01:08:17,300
everything I've watched is you were
really trying transcend identity politics.

1122
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:22,040
You were trying to at one time speak to
those people and yet at the same time

1123
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:26,900
say no, that my Arab ness has nothing
to do with this. You tried to do both.

1124
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:27,770
And I think

1125
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:28,603
that,

1126
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,190
I worry that that is why it didn't, yeah.

1127
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:32,063
Work.

1128
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:35,423
Mm. I don't know.

1129
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,753
Yeah.

1130
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:41,890
Uh, I have to think about
what you just said, but, uh,

1131
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:47,770
uh, you know, I went out there as myself
as an Arab American Lutheran Pastor,

1132
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:53,220
but I had to take stands on issues that
really mattered to me and to the things

1133
01:08:53,711 --> 01:08:55,540
that I am passionate about.

1134
01:08:56,020 --> 01:09:00,100
What does that mean? You're sort of a
better person than you are a politician?

1135
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,960
I like to see myself like that.
Definitely. I mean, I did,

1136
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,440
I did what I thought, what my team
thought was the right thing to do.

1137
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,063
And, uh,

1138
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,240
would you, would you run again?

1139
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:23,110
Uh, sure. Yes.

1140
