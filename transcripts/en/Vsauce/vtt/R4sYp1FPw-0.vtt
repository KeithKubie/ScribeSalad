00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.259
A tentacle dress and cheeseburgers flip flops.
It's episode 15

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.399
of LÜT.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.519
Keep your doors open with NeatoShop's
gross gutsy zombie

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.059
doorstop.
Or be a superhero with these hoodies.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.260
Look how serious he is.
Keep your dog warm with this scarf.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.600
I mean, let's talk about the Millennium
Falcon. Or a Star Wars flight jacket from

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.380
adidas.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.400
Studio Swine makes these glasses.
They're just

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.880
artwork for now, but are made out of
human hair. A strange, but renewable

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.809
resource.

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.360
These sticking peel stickers let you give
your electrical sockets fun

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.540
faces and Arlyn emailed me this Rubik's Cube

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.629
for the blind. You can also pick up a
stack of Rubik's Cube colored sticky

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:44.430
notes or

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.789
these notes that are reminders and Tetris.

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.300
ShanaLogic provides awesome things.
Currently

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.460
they're sold out of these earrings,
but have plenty of kitty tied to a balloon

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.719
necklaces. But if you wanna know the
animal on your necklace,

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.890
Uncommon Goods will send you a mould to
stick on your pet and send back.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.140
Then they'll make you a custom necklace
in the shape

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.000
of your dog's nose.
Japan Trend Shop carries these samurai

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.770
underpants authentically designed after
the style of famous historical

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.650
warriors. And Peter Bristol makes this
informative dresser

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.600
that removes all confusion, while Miriam
Liebana has designed sperm shaped

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.450
cutlery

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.549
that brings meals to life.
Speaking of manly,

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.530
floss your power with this tactical
grilling apron and a handmade ring

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.890
scale replica

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.320
of a .44 caliber chamber.
For 10 bucks you could split your music with his

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.320
branch between your friend and your other friend.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.159
And for 80 bucks you can deconstruct the
lamp into its constituent

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.920
pieces. The cord itself wraps around
to produce

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.320
the lamp shade. Keep acting smart with a
working feather pen and quill set,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.869
then go against the flow and watch a 3D movie

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.240
in 2D.
These glasses from ThinkGeek

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.399
isolate one layer of a 3D movie and give you a nice

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.770
flat picture. Your free thing this week
comes from "guardianjuan" who recommends

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.980
HardlyWork.in,

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.100
a site that can adapt your
Facebook into what looks like a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.060
spreadsheet.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.660
Now you can waste time at work
and look like the hardest-working

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.489
employee. Perfect.
Back in Kansas I found some great

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.930
confusing fireworks. The poopy puppy
actually makes a flaming

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.670
bowel movement and this depressed
middle-aged man? Well, he's part of the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.830
500 grams of

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.800
black powder baby boomer explosive.
Almost as cool

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.300
is Blonde Joke, an explosive covered in

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.550
blonde women. Yeah, I don't know either.
But what I do know

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.270
is that you should subscribe to
Vsauce for more LÜT.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.680
And as always,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.360
thanks for watching.
