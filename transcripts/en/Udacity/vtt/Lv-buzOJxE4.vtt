00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We're almost there. Things are coming together very nicely.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The only thing we're missing is set anchors.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We have to somehow take a row and the row number within the board

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and figure out where all the anchors are and what the values of those anchors are.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
To find the anchors we can do that within the row.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
An anchor is something that's next to an existing letter.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That will get most of the anchors but not quite all of them,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
because notice if we didn't have this row here, we wouldnâ€™t know that that spot is an anchor.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
To find all the anchors, we're going to have to look at all the rows

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or at least the two adjacent rows on either side.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
To find what the anchors are in terms of the set--can anything go there as in this anchor,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
as in this anchor, any letter can appear there, or is it a restricted set like this one.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That we're also going to have to know--what are the other cross words?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Here, if there's only a U there and nothing down below--

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
this is the edge of the board or there is empty stuff down below--

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
then this anchor can only be the letters that fit in there to make a word going in this direction.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Let's dive right into defining set anchors.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This is different than most of the functions written so far in that it actually mutates the row

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
rather than returning a result.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We start in the normal way. We're going to iterate over the row--the good parts of the row.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Then what I'm going to do is take the i-j position on the board

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and find all the neighbors for that board--

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that is all the squares in the in the north, south, east, and west location.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Then I'm going to say what are the anchors?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Well, if the square is the star, the starting square, then that's an anchor by definition.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Otherwise, if the square is empty and any of the neighbors is a letter, then that's an anchor.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now, I've arranged that neighbors(board) is a function that returns the neighbors in this order--

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
north, south, east, and west--and now I'm saying we're operating on a row,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
if the neighbor to the north or the south is a letter,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
then we have a cross word that we have to deal with.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
If not, then it's an unrestricted anchor.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What do I want to do if I have these crosswords?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I want to find the crossword on the board. What does that mean?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
In this location right here, which would be row 2 and column 2,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I want to say that the word on the board is an empty square followed by a U.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
If I go into the interpreter, I want to be able to have this interaction where here is my board.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now if I find crosswords within that board from position 2, 2--that's that position right there

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
right after the A and above the U--what I want to say is that there is a word,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and the word is a dot followed by a U--there it is.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If we fill in that anchor, we're going to have a word, which is a dot followed by a U.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Where does the word start? Well, it starts in position 2.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It could have started someplace else.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
If we had a big board, there might have been a word that started all the way up here and went down.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
For example, we're not actually going to call find<u>cross</u>word on positions that aren't anchors,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
but if we did, it would still work.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
If we find cross words from position 1, 2--that's the where the A is--

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
what's the cross word that intersects through that A? Well, that's JAG.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It begins in row number 1.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now we're up here, we found the cross words,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
we found the row that the cross word begins in, we found what the word is,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and now we're saying we're going to fill in this location. It's going to be an anchor.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It's anchor where the letters are all the letters with which we can replace the dot in dot U

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and make something which is a word.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
We can go back to our interpreter and test that out.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We can say if W is the dot U, then what is this anchor of all the letters

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
where W replaced by a letter is in WORDS.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
That's the anchor with X, M, and N as possibilities.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Now we're going to say insert that anchor into row[ i ].

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Insert into this spot to the right of the A above the U the anchor

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that says an X, an M, or an N can occur right in that location.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
That's setting the anchor if there are cross letters above or below.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Otherwise, we have an unrestricted anchor.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
For example, this anchor here to the left of the D--any letter can go in there.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
We've already defined the global variable any to be the anchor that allows any letter to occur.
