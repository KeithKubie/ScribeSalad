00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:10.516
What's your sign?

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:12.006
In Western astrology,

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:16.386
it's a constellation determined by
when your birthday falls in the calendar.

00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:19.897
But according to the Chinese zodiac,
or shēngxiào,

00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:24.387
it's your shǔxiàng, meaning the animal
assigned to your birth year.

00:00:24.387 --> 00:00:28.458
And of the many myths explaining
these animal signs and their arrangement,

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:32.188
the most enduring one is 
that of the Great Race.

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:36.358
As the story goes, Yù Dì, or Jade Emperor,
Ruler of the Heavens,

00:00:36.358 --> 00:00:41.348
wanted to devise a way to measure time,
so he organized a race.

00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:43.928
The first twelve animals to make it
across the river

00:00:43.928 --> 00:00:48.028
would earn a spot on the zodiac calendar
in the order they arrived.

00:00:48.028 --> 00:00:50.679
The rat rose with the sun
to get an early start,

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.078
but on the way to the river,

00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:54.989
he met the horse, the tiger, and the ox.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.809
Because the rat was small
and couldn't swim very well,

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.168
he asked the bigger animals for help.

00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:01.909
While the tiger and horse refused,

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.389
the kind-hearted ox agreed
to carry the rat across.

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:08.370
Yet, just as they were about
to reach the other side,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.109
the rat jumped off the ox's head
and secured first place.

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:14.509
The ox came in second,

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.979
with the powerful tiger right behind him.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.129
The rabbit, 
too small to battle the current,

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:22.541
nimbly hopped across stones and logs
to come in fourth.

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:25.619
Next came the dragon,
who could have flown directly across,

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.199
but stopped to help some creatures
she had encountered on the way.

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:32.609
After her came the horse,
galloping across the river.

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.100
But just as she got across,
the snake slithered by.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.480
The startled horse reared back,
letting the snake sneak into sixth place.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.400
The Jade Emperor looked out at the river

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.420
and spotted the sheep, the monkey,
and the rooster all atop a raft,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.060
working together to push it 
through the weeds.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.391
When they made it across,

00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:53.020
the trio agreed to give eighth place
to the sheep,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.660
who had been the most comforting
and harmonious of them,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.330
followed by the monkey and the rooster.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.391
Next came the dog, 
scrambling onto the shore.

00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:02.510
He was a great swimmer,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.180
but frolicked in the water for so long
that he only managed to come in eleventh.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.381
The final spot was claimed by the pig,

00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:11.750
who had gotten hungry and stopped
to eat and nap

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.881
before finally waddling 
across the finish line.

00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:19.561
And so, each year is associated with one
of the animals in this order,

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:22.645
with the cycle starting over
every 60 years.

00:02:22.645 --> 00:02:24.461
Why 60 and not twelve?

00:02:24.461 --> 00:02:29.371
Well, the traditional Chinese calendar
is made up of two overlapping systems.

00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:32.281
The animals of the zodiac are associated
with what's called

00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:36.891
the Twelve Earthly Branches, or shí'èrzhī.

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:41.101
Another system, the Ten Heavenly Stems,
or tiāngān,

00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:43.562
is linked with the five classical elements

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:45.292
of metal, xīn,

00:02:45.292 --> 00:02:46.864
wood, mù,

00:02:46.864 --> 00:02:48.602
water, shuǐ,

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.212
fire, huǒ,

00:02:50.212 --> 00:02:52.252
and earth, tǔ.

00:02:52.252 --> 00:02:55.521
Each element is assigned yīn or yáng,

00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:57.581
creating a ten-year cycle.

00:02:57.581 --> 00:02:59.853
When the twelve animals
of the Earthly Branches

00:02:59.853 --> 00:03:02.032
are matched with the five elements

00:03:02.032 --> 00:03:04.693
plus the yīn or the yáng
of the Heavenly Stems,

00:03:04.693 --> 00:03:07.614
it creates 60 years 
of different combinations,

00:03:07.614 --> 00:03:11.424
known as a sexagenary cycle, or gānzhī.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:16.390
So someone born in 1980 would have
the sign of yáng metal monkey,

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.903
while someone born in 2007 
would be yīn fire pig.

00:03:20.903 --> 00:03:24.913
In fact, you can also have an inner animal
based on your birth month,

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:27.962
a true animal based on your birth date,

00:03:27.962 --> 00:03:31.773
and a secret animal based on 
your birth hour.

00:03:31.773 --> 00:03:34.196
It was the great race 
that supposedly determined

00:03:34.196 --> 00:03:37.213
which animals were enshrined 
in the Chinese zodiac,

00:03:37.213 --> 00:03:39.094
but as the system spread through Asia,

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:42.463
other cultures made changes
to reflect their communities.

00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:44.803
So if you consult the Vietnamese zodiac,

00:03:44.803 --> 00:03:47.684
you may discover that you're a cat,
not a rabbit,

00:03:47.684 --> 00:03:49.353
and if you're in Thailand,

00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:53.284
a mythical snake called a Naga
replaces the dragon.

00:03:53.284 --> 00:03:55.844
So whether or not you place stock 
in what the zodiac says

00:03:55.844 --> 00:03:57.744
about you as an individual,

00:03:57.744 --> 00:04:00.644
it certainly reveals much about
the culture it comes from.
