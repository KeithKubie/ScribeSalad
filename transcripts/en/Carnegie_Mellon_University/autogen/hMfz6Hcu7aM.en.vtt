00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:02.089
 
when we say bit more about that

00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099
when we say bit more about that
 

00:57:02.099 --> 00:57:04.069
when we say bit more about that
no and that fascinated me too and I just

00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079
no and that fascinated me too and I just
 

00:57:04.079 --> 00:57:05.749
no and that fascinated me too and I just
remember going back over my material and

00:57:05.749 --> 00:57:05.759
remember going back over my material and

and just seeing this come out time and
 

00:57:07.739 --> 00:57:09.739
and just seeing this come out time and
time again and to me there's really

00:57:09.739 --> 00:57:09.749
time again and to me there's really
 

00:57:09.749 --> 00:57:11.719
time again and to me there's really
something that this is connected to the

00:57:11.719 --> 00:57:11.729
something that this is connected to the
 

00:57:11.729 --> 00:57:13.549
something that this is connected to the
generational question right it's a

00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559
generational question right it's a
 

00:57:13.559 --> 00:57:14.989
generational question right it's a
generation that isn't necessarily

00:57:14.989 --> 00:57:14.999
generation that isn't necessarily
 

00:57:14.999 --> 00:57:18.529
generation that isn't necessarily
straight from from school into jobs it's

00:57:18.529 --> 00:57:18.539
straight from from school into jobs it's
 

00:57:18.539 --> 00:57:21.620
straight from from school into jobs it's
it's a generation that is whether you're

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:21.630
it's a generation that is whether you're

you're facing the industrialization

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:26.130
you're facing the industrialization
 

00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:28.940
you're facing the industrialization
you're facing all of these you know this

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:28.950
you're facing all of these you know this
 

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:31.940
you're facing all of these you know this
world that really doesn't necessarily

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:31.950
world that really doesn't necessarily
 

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:33.259
world that really doesn't necessarily
offer you jobs doesn't necessarily offer

00:57:33.259 --> 00:57:33.269
offer you jobs doesn't necessarily offer
 

00:57:33.269 --> 00:57:35.329
offer you jobs doesn't necessarily offer
you community and and this is you know

00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:35.339
you community and and this is you know
 

00:57:35.339 --> 00:57:37.249
you community and and this is you know
why like the projects and the places

00:57:37.249 --> 00:57:37.259
why like the projects and the places

why like the projects and the places
that did provide some sense or even

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:40.700
that did provide some sense or even
 

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:43.069
that did provide some sense or even
communities that were more cohesive as

00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079
communities that were more cohesive as
 

00:57:43.079 --> 00:57:44.870
communities that were more cohesive as
deindustrialization begins and people

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880
deindustrialization begins and people
 

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:47.299
deindustrialization begins and people
begin to to move and and be displaced

00:57:47.299 --> 00:57:47.309
begin to to move and and be displaced
 

00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:49.969
begin to to move and and be displaced
into different areas again structures of

00:57:49.969 --> 00:57:49.979
into different areas again structures of
 

00:57:49.979 --> 00:57:51.380
into different areas again structures of
community and kinship begin to break

00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:51.390
community and kinship begin to break
 

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:53.059
community and kinship begin to break
