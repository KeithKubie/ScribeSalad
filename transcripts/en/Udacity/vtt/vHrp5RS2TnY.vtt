00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.510
The solution for
this is that in cycle 13,

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.800
we have already issued all the
instructions so no issue will happen.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.030
We have already begun execution
of all these instructions,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.932
so the correct answer obviously, will
not be that something else executes in

00:00:13.932 --> 00:00:16.590
13 because we have
already begun execution.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.770
We have already seen that
this begin executing in 13.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.320
But, that's not the question.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.140
The writing of the results, neither of
this can write the result in 13, and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.610
all the other results have
already been written.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.480
For commit however,
this result has been written in 12.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.830
This is the very first instruction
that we are going to try to commit, so

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.090
this instruction will
actually commit in cycle 13.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.940
So the correct answer is C for

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.990
commit, one because this is
the instruction that commits.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.994
So this is also what
happens in cycle 13.
