00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.634
This money is to get
my wizness - 

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:03.269
woman-owned business - 
up and running.

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:05.371
Oh, you mean phone wigs?
I'm using mine right now.

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:06.606
Yeah!

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.307
I mean, Ilana in real life - 
every once in a while,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.710
she'll, like, wear a wig
to a party.

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:12.011
I love wigs. I love hair.

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:14.180
This is the kind of wig you get
buried in.

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:16.783
In prior seasons,
Ilana's had, like, wigs sewn

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.686
into the back of her helmet.
Or do you wanna tell 'em...

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:24.157
I kept Abbi's stunt double wig
to just wear and be her.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.325
So weird.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:27.560
Wigs!

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:29.028
Ilana's Phone Wigs - 

00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:30.730
they are a key prop
from this season.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.699
They were designed and created 
by Marcel Dagenais,

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:35.001
our key hair guy.

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:37.403
Phone wigs have
never been made before,

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:39.772
so it was a lot of engineering
to figure it out.

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.274
Honestly, I wouldn't
normally do this,

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.508
but I believe
it pitched it.

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.777
And then it was like...
Another wigs invention?

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.345
It's the same as the helmet.
We were like...

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:47.847
Yeah. But it's - 
I guess it's a theme.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.215
But it's so funny.
And then we like...

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:50.416
So stupid.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.251
  went nuts with, like,
who she would make.

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:55.588
There's one for Abbi...
Ilana... That's Lincoln...

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:56.822
Jaimé...

00:00:56.856 --> 00:01:00.893
This one was made out of a wig
that Ilana wore in Season 4.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:05.498
That's the Ross... The Rachel...
Gunther, from “Friends”...

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.601
That's Michelle Obama... 
And, uh, Bernadette Peters.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.370
A lot of times, I'll see them
on camera and I'm like, “Ah!”

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:12.638
You know? So

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.540
usually, I ask props
to bring 'em by me

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:17.410
to get a little coif,
to do a little pick.

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:19.145
The Ilana ones, anyways.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.490
Wizness!
