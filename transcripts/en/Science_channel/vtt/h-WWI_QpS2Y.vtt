00:00:04.534 --> 00:00:07.367
Narrator: MOUNTAIN BIKE TIRES
ARE TRUE TRAILBLAZERS,

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:10.601
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED
FOR OFF-ROAD RIDING.

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:12.534
WIDER THAN
REGULAR ROAD TIRES,

00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:15.767
MOUNTAIN BIKE TIRES
HAVE RAISED KNOBS OR LUGS

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:18.801
THAT ADD STABILITY
ON UNEVEN TERRAIN.

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.767
BUILT TO WITHSTAND THE TRAIL,
THESE TIRES CAN HANDLE IT ALL.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:29.133
WHEN THE RUBBER HITS THE DIRT,
IT'S ALL ABOUT CONTROL.

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.834
MOUNTAIN BIKE TIRES ARE DESIGNED
TO GRIP THE GROUND

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:33.934
AND PROVIDE TRACTION
OFF-ROAD.

00:00:35.934 --> 00:00:39.200
FIRST, DESIGNERS USE
A COMPUTER MODEL OF A TIRE

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.901
TO SIMULATE THE EFFECTS
OF DIFFERENT RUBBER COMPOUNDS.

00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:45.767
CONSTRUCTION BEGINS
WITH RUBBER COMPOUNDS

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:49.467
BEING MIXED TOGETHER
TO CREATE PARTS OF THE TIRE.

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:52.601
INGREDIENTS INCLUDE SYNTHETIC
AND NATURAL RUBBERS,

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:55.701
SULFUR,
AND OTHER CHEMICALS.

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:59.267
ROTATING SPIRAL BLADES
BREAK DOWN THE MATERIALS.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:02.300
FRICTION FROM THE MIXING
HEATS AND SOFTENS THEM.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.334
THIS TRANSFORMS
THE INGREDIENTS

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:06.901
INTO A DOUGH-LIKE
RUBBER COMPOUND.

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:11.200
POWERFUL ROLLERS SQUEEZE THE
COMPOUND INTO THICK LONG SHEETS,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.934
AND BLADES CUT THE ROLLED RUBBER
INTO NARROW STRIPS.

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:18.734
THEN, THE RUBBER TRAVELS
THROUGH MORE ROLLERS

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:22.834
THAT SQUEEZE IT DOWN
TO THE DESIRED THICKNESS.

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:27.434
THE RUBBER SHEETS LAND ON
A CART, READY FOR USE.

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:30.901
♪♪

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:33.067
TECHNICIANS INCASE
STEEL BEAD WIRE

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:35.100
WITH ONE OF
THESE COMPOUNDS.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.167
THE BEAD WIRE IS
THE PART OF THE TIRE

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:39.467
THAT CONNECTS TO
THE WHEEL'S RIM.

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:42.267
AS STEEL WIRE TRAVELS
THROUGH AN APERTURE,

00:01:42.267 --> 00:01:46.133
THE RUBBER IS EXTRUDED
TO FORM THE CASING.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.033
THE MACHINE DELIVERS
THE BEAD WIRE

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:50.868
TO A SPINNING DISK.

00:01:50.868 --> 00:01:52.901
THE DISK WINDS
THE BEAD WIRE,

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:56.300
SHAPING IT INTO RINGS,
WHICH FIT TO A WHEEL RIM.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.634
♪♪

00:02:01.634 --> 00:02:04.067
TO MAINTAIN THE DIAMETER
OF THE WIRE,

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:06.634
THE TECHNICIAN TAPES
THE ENDS TOGETHER,

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:09.701
HOLDING THE SHAPE UNTIL
THE NEXT STAGE OF PRODUCTION.

00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:14.968
NEXT, RUBBER SHEETS WITH
VARYING CHARACTERISTICS

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.934
ENTER AN EXTRUDER.

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:18.567
USING HEAT AND PRESSURE,

00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:21.601
THE EXTRUDER FORCES THE RUBBER
THROUGH DIES.

00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:24.234
THIS PROCESS MERGES
THEIR CHARACTERISTICS

00:02:24.234 --> 00:02:26.300
INTO A SINGLE SHEET.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.033
THE SHEET WILL BE USED
TO MAKE THE BICYCLE'S TREAD.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:35.133
THE TREAD RUBBER TRAVELS
THROUGH A CHANNEL OF COOL WATER.

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:37.767
MEANWHILE, ROLLERS COAT FABRIC
WITH RUBBER

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:41.000
TO MAKE PLIES
FOR THE TIRE CASING.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.834
A MOVING BLADE
CUTS IT INTO STRIPS.

00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:46.801
THIS RUBBER
IS NATURALLY TACKY,

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:49.200
SO THE PIECES
CAN BE EASILY SPLICED.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.901
THE SYSTEM FEEDS THE STRIPS
TO TIRE-BUILDING MACHINE.

00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:00.234
A SKILLED ASSEMBLER WRAPS
THE STRIPS TO THE MACHINE DRUM

00:03:00.234 --> 00:03:01.934
TO FORM THE TIRE CASING,

00:03:01.934 --> 00:03:04.667
AND SPLICES THE RUBBER
WHERE THE ENDS MEET.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.601
NEXT, ROBOTS SLIDE TWO
WIRE BEADS AROUND THE CASING.

00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:15.234
THE ENDS OF THE DRUM
FOLD THE SIDES OF THE CASING

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:17.367
OVER THE BEAD WIRES.

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:19.767
THE TECHNICIAN APPLIES
RUBBER-COATED FABRIC

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:22.701
TO THE BEAD WIRES,
STRENGTHENING THE AREA.

00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:28.300
THE TREAD RUBBER
IS PLACED IN THE CENTER.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.534
A ROLLER APPLIES PRESSURE
AS THE DRUM SPINS

00:03:31.534 --> 00:03:34.734
TO WIND THE TREAD
AROUND THE CASING.

00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:38.534
THEN, THE ENDS ARE
PRESSED TOGETHER MANUALLY.

00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:41.701
AND ONE MORE TURN OF THE DRUM
SECURES THE TREAD RUBBER

00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:42.767
TO THE CASING.

00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:48.567
ONCE VENT HOLES HAVE BEEN
CUT IN THE RUBBER,

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:52.334
IT'S OVER TO AN EXPANDING MOLD,
WHERE THE TIRE TAKES SHAPE.

00:03:57.067 --> 00:03:59.701
THE TECHNICIAN INSERTS
A RUBBER CURING BLADDER

00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:02.000
TO MAINTAIN
THE SHAPE OF THE TIRE.

00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:10.367
THEN, HE PLACES THE MOUNTAIN
BIKE TIRES IN CURING MOLDS.

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:11.901
THESE INDIVIDUAL MOLDS

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:14.234
WILL STEAM-COOK THE TIRES
UNDER PRESSURE

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:15.701
TO FURTHER SHAPE THEM.

00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:22.434
THIS PROCESS FORMS KNOBS
AND OTHER PROTRUSIONS

00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:23.901
ON THE TIRE SURFACE

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:26.434
THAT ARE DESIGNED TO GRIP
A RUGGED TERRAIN.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:31.701
LIKE A BIG WAFFLE IRON,
THIS MOLD HAS COOKED,

00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:34.334
AND FORMED
THE MOUNTAIN BIKE TIRE.

00:04:34.334 --> 00:04:37.200
THE TIRE IS THEN PLACED
ON A RACK TO COOL.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.501
NEXT, THE BIKE TIRE
UNDERGOES A DURABILITY TEST

00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:47.434
WHILE A COMPUTER MEASURES
ROLLING RESISTANCE.

00:04:47.434 --> 00:04:50.367
THAT'S THE ENERGY LOST
WHEN THE TIRE ROTATES,

00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:55.534
AND AN INDICATION OF
HOW EASILY THE TIRE WILL ROLL.

00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:56.834
THIS MOUNTAIN BIKE TIRE

00:04:56.834 --> 00:05:00.067
IS NOW CLEARED
TO TRAVEL OFF THE BEATEN PATH.
