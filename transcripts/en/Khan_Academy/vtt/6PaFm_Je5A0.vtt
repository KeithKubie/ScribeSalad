00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.110
Welcome back.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.800
So where I left off, we said
that we had this, I guess you

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.450
could call it, equation or this
function, although I didn't

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.110
write it with the function
notation, where I said, the

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.540
distance is equal to 16 t
squared, and I graphed it, it's

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.100
like a parabola, right,
for positive time.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.960
And then we said, well, the
velocity, if we know the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.190
distance, the velocity is just
the change of the distance

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.360
with respect to time.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.080
It's just, the velocity is
always changing, you can't

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.560
just take the slope, you
actually have to take

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.920
the derivative, right?

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.760
So we took the derivative with
respect to time of this

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.915
function, or this equation, and
we got 32t, and this

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:33.210
is the velocity.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.060
And then we graphed it.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.130
And then I asked a question.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.160
I was like, well, we want to
figure out, if we were given

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:47.080
this, if we were given just
this, and I asked you, what is

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.920
the distance that this object
travels after time, you

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.130
know, after 10 seconds?

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.240
Let's, you know, let's say this
t0 is equal to 10 seconds.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.150
I want to know how far is this
thing gone after 10 seconds.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.450
And let's say you didn't know
that you could just take the

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.605
antiderivative, let's say we
didn't know this at all, and

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:04.840
let's say you didn't know that
you could just take the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.860
antiderivative, because we just
showed that, you know, the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.990
derivative of distance is
velocity, so the antiderivative

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.670
of velocity is distance.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.700
So let's say you couldn't just
take the antiderivative.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.140
What's a way that you could
start to try to approximate

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.780
how far you've traveled
after, say, 10 seconds?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.330
Well [? as I said, ?]

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.520
you graph this, and you say,
let's assume over some

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.580
change in time, velocity is
roughly constant, right?

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.390
Let's say velocity
is right here.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.370
So you could approximate how
far you travel over that small

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.020
change in time by multiplying
that change in time, let's say

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.900
that's like, you know, a
millionth of a second, times

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.940
the velocity at roughly that
time, or maybe even the average

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.940
velocity over that time, and
you'd get the distance you've

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.390
traveled over that very small
fraction of time, right?

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.770
But if you look at it visually,
that also happens to be the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.470
area of this rectangle, right?

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.320
And what we said, is if you
want to know how far you travel

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.160
after 10 seconds, you just draw
a bunch of these rectangles,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.520
and you sum up the area, right?

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.550
And you could imagine, and you
don't have to imagine, it's

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.380
actually true, the smaller the
bases of these rectangles, and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.610
the more of these rectangles
you have, the more accurate

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.840
your approximation will be,
and you'll approach 2 things.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.640
You'll approach the area under
this curve, right, almost the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.740
exact area under this curve,
and you'd also get almost the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:47.030
exact value of the distance
after, say, 10 seconds

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.130
in this case, right?

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.100
But 10 didn't have to
be an exact number.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.290
It could have been a variable.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.310
So this is something
pretty interesting.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.100
All of a sudden, we see
that the antiderivative

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.450
is pretty darn similar to
the area under the curve.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.800
And it actually turns out
that they're the same thing.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.600
And this is where I'm
going to teach you the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.930
indefinite integral.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.860
So the indefinite integral, I
don't know how comfortable you

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.010
are with summation, I remember
the first time l learned

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.170
calculus, I wasn't that
comfortable with summation, but

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.030
it's really, all the indefinite
integral, is is you can kind of

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.590
view it as a sum, right?

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.130
So now, you'll maybe understand
a little bit more why this

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.860
symbol looks kind
of like a sigma.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.270
That's actually how I view it.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.320
And please look it up so
you can see properly

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.250
drawn integrals.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.830
But in this case, the
indefinite integral is just

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.700
saying, well, I'm going to take
the sum from t equals 0, right,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.910
so from t equals 0, to let's
say in this example, t equals

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.560
10, right, because I said 10.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.660
From t equals 0 to t equals 10.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.150
and I'm going to take the sum
of each of the heights, the

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.810
height at any given point,
which is the velocity.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.720
And then, what's the
formula for the velocity?

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:13.140
It's 32t and then I'm at
times the base at each

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.620
of these rectangles, dt.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.440
And so this is the
definite integral.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.620
The definite integral is
literally, and they never do

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.050
this in math texts, and that's
what always kind of confused

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.560
me, is that you can kind of
view it like a sum, like this.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.090
It's kind of the sum of each of
these rectangles, but it's the

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.680
limit, as-- if these were
discrete rectangles, you could

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.110
just do a sum, and you could
make the rectangle bases

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.870
smaller and smaller, and have
more and more rectangles,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.210
and just do a regular sum.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.870
And actually, that's how, if
you ever write a computer

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.770
program to approximate an
integral, or approximate the

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.640
area under a curve, that's
the way a computer program

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.020
would actually do it.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.480
But the actual indefinite
integral says, well, this is a

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.310
sum, but it's the limit as the
bases of these rectangles get

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.230
smaller and smaller and smaller
and smaller, and we have more

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.940
and more and more of
these rectangles.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.310
So as these dt's approach 0,
the number of rectangles

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.880
actually approach infinity.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.950
So I'm actually going to, I'll
do that more rigorously later,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.780
but I think it's very important
to get this intuitive feel

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.680
of just what an integral is.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.930
It isn't just this voodoo
that happens to be there.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.160
But anyway, so going
back to the problem.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.360
So the integral from-- this
is now a definite integral,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.670
extending from t equals
0 to t equals 10.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.020
This tells us 2 things.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.300
This tells us the area of the
curve from t equals zero to t

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.360
equals 10, right, it tells us
this whole area, and it also

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.580
tells us how far the object
has gone after 10 seconds.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.320
Right?

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.450
So it's very interesting.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.770
The indefinite integral
tells us 2 things.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.160
It tells us area, and it also
tells us the antiderivative.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.360
Right?

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.130
We're already familiar with
it as an antiderivative.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.220
So let me give you
another example.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.760
Actually, maybe I'll stick
with this example, but

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.650
I'll clear it a bit.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.310
Actually, maybe I should erase.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.810
Erasing might be a good
option with this one,

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.190
since it's fairly messy.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.830
I think you know all
this stuff now.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.760
I just need space.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.372
Maybe, OK, so we have that
indefinite integral.

00:06:20.372 --> 00:06:22.040
And we could actually
figure it out, too.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.470
I mean, well, after t
seconds, [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.920
So and the way you evaluate an
indefinite integral, and let me

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.780
show you that first, is that
you figure out the integral.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.740
So let me just say, let
me continue with the

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.060
problem, actually.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.790
As you can tell, I don't plan
much for these presentations.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.170
So the way you figure out the
indefinite integral, is you

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:46.300
say, and sometimes they won't
write t equals 0 to t equals t.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:54.610
They'll just say from
0 to 10 of 32t dt.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.370
Right?

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.770
And the way you evaluate
this, is you figure out the

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.780
antiderivative, and you really
don't have to do the plus c

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.330
here, so the antiderivative, we
know, is 16t squared, right?

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.440
It's one half t
squared times 32.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.690
So that's 16t squared.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.010
And we evaluate this at ten,
and we evaluate it at 0, and

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.680
then we subtract
the difference.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.250
So we evaluate this at 10,
so 16 times 100, right?

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.060
That's evaluated at 10,
and then we subtract

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.155
it, evaluate at 0.

00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:26.320
So 16 times 0 is 0.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.960
So after 10 seconds, we
would have gone 1600 feet.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:41.230
And also, the area under
this curve is 1600.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.200
So let's use this to do
a couple more examples.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.990
And actually, I want to show
you why we do this subtraction.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.560
Actually, I'm going to
do that right now.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.110
Let me clear it.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.850
Oh, that's ugly.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.100
I'll now do it more
general, actually.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:20.600
Let me draw this twice,
once for the distance, and

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.480
once for its derivative.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.580
So let's say that the distance,
yeah, well, let's just say it

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.670
looks something like this.

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.580
Let's say you start at some
distance, and then it

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.350
goes off like that.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.410
Right?

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:47.190
So let's say we call
this distance b.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.160
Well, let's just call this,
you know, I don't know, 5.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.450
Right?

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:56.600
We start at 5 feet, and then
we moved forward from there.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.600
And this axis is of course
time, this axis, maybe I

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.590
shouldn't do 5, because
it looks so much like s.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.280
That's 5, 5 feet.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.420
And this is the s,
or distance, axis.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.270
And actually, I just
looked at the clock.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.310
I'm running out of time.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.120
So let me continue this in
the next presentation.
