&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Welcome to Authors at Google.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.260
It is my great pleasure to introduce my good
friend and award winning author Hallie Ephron

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:25.430
to you all here at Cambridge today.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:38.109
Hallie and I met when we worked at Digital
more than a few years ago and I've always

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.890
been a great fan of her work.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.800
Hallie grew up in Hollywood in a family of
writers.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.039
Her parents were Henry and Phoebe Ephron who
were screenwriters for Fox and wrote screenplays

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.149
for movies such as "Desk Set" with Hepburn
and Tracy and "Carousel," the famous musical.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:59.219
She grew up in a house filled with books and
sisters.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.549
She's three of four sisters, all of whom are
well-known writers.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.080
Nora, Delia and Amy among others.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.570
She went on to become a teacher and writer.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.810
She wrote her first novel "Amnesia" with a
good friend, the neuropsychologist Donald

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:41.280
Davidoff who wrote under the joint pen name
of G.H.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:51.659
Ephron, and published five novels in the Dr.
Peter Zak series which was really good, I

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.670
edited one of the books.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.670
I would recommend them.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.250
She made a big splash writing solo when she
wrote the riveting psychological suspense

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.620
thriller "Never Tell A Lie" which was published
in 2009.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.170
Publishers weekly called it "stunning" and
"a deliciously creepy tale of obsession,"

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.170
which I agree with.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.170
You kind of do write creepy tales of obsession
don't you for such a regular person.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.170
[laughs]

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.170
It was translated into seven languages.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.359
It was a finalist for the Mary Higgins Clark
award of the mystery writers of America.

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:15.810
It was actually adapted into a lifetime movie
"And Baby Will Fall."

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.810
Her new novel which she'll be discussing today
presumably is "Come And Find Me" which is

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.810
now in its third paperback edition.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.810
Yay.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.810
And it's the story of a recluse who lives
and works online in the cyber security industry

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.299
who must brave the real world when her sister
goes missing.

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.030
Booklist called it "a suspenseful tale of
high-tech skullduggery that even low-tech

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.030
readers will appreciate."

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.319
Certainly everybody in this room will do so
also.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.790
She loves to teach and she gives writing workshops.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.230
I keep emptying my bank account trying to
buy everything she's written because in addition

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.060
to fiction she's written "Writing and Selling
Your Mystery Novel: How to Knock Them Dead

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.060
with Style."

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.060
And "The Everything Guide to Writing Your
First Novel."

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.150
Plus "The Bibliophile's Devotional" and "1001
Books for Every Mood."

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:05.150
So please join me in welcoming Hallie Ephron.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.540
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Thanks.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.739
[Applause]

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.969
Just a reminder, if you don't have a copy
of the book there were five there.

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.989
There's a sign-up sheet over there cause we
didn't get quite enough.

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.549
Amazon divided it into three shipments and
only one arrived.

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.230
And I also put some cards over there so if,
I have a website and it's on here and there's

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.230
the contact button.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:40.659
So if a question occurs to you either about
writing, your writing, my writing, life in

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.739
Milton, Massachusetts whatever.

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.900
You can e-mail me after, I do read my e-mail
and I'm happy to answer.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:56.709
Jonathan is one of these people who when you
send your published book which I always do

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:57.709
to.

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.390
Or he's actually one of the great friends
who knows that you come to book signings of

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.739
authors and buy a book.

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.049
Thank you Jonathan.

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.379
He will within 10 minutes have found a typo
that eluded you.

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.209
Probably on the first page, possibly even
in the title of the book.

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.540
[laughs]

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.590
But he's really a great editor and I thank
him for helping me along the way.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.850
I worked with Jonathan at Digital and he didn't
say this but it was 30+ years ago.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.360
I know because I was pregnant with my first,
my second child and she's now 33.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.660
So that was back when there was no UI.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.230
There was no user interface.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.280
It was just a black screen with an operating
system prompt.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.310
It said VMS angle bracket as I recall.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.670
And you were expected to go from there.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.120
And we did.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.870
But amazingly we had e-mail.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.560
And we had a dreadful application called "Phone."

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.150
Or was it called telephone?

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.150
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Phone.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.150
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Phone.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.560
That everyone hated because it allowed you
to interrupt people in the middle of what

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.280
they were doing in their life.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.620
How about that?

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.870
Nowadays, it seems like people are on their
phones or on their computers and annoyed when

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.400
life interrupts.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.880
I think that's more.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.000
So the world was a little bit upside down
then.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.120
The Internet was still being invented.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.150
And I remember there was an MIT project then
called Project Athena where they were playing

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.890
around with something called Boxer.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.210
Does anybody have any idea, well anyway it
was the first tinkering around with the idea

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.009
of connecting one piece of information with
another.

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.010
Which is really what the web is about.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.580
That's why it's called the web.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.580
Yeah.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.020
Anyway, I had no idea I'd ever write fiction.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.900
And I was tired, getting tired of explaining
to everyone why I was only one in my family

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.160
who didn't write.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.000
[laughter]

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.720
But it took me about 10 more years.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.720
In the 1990s, actually in the late 80s I started
to write.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.810
And I can still remember, I wrote a book with
a friend of mine whose brother was murdered.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.970
He was shot to death in an insurance office
where they both worked.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.140
They were partners.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.900
And her client had come in angry about a settlement
for a fire.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.050
And shot him, because she was home with her
son who'd hurt his ankle that morning.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.220
And so needless to say, she was guilt ridden,
grief stricken.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.850
And took years to basically come back out
of the house and we spent a long time writing

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.500
a book which I never published.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.770
But I do remember sitting at Digital and sending
you know 30 pages to the printer because I

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.870
was too cheap and printers were huge back
then.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.020
I mean you know it cost you a fortune to have
a printer in your house.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.050
And running to the printer to grab it before
anybody could see that I was not doing my

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.100
work in my cubicle.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.170
I was writing my first novel.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:10.010
But I did leave, well I don't think they had
been bought by anybody by the time I left.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.590
But you left long before me.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:19.440
Yeah and so it was in, I got my first book
published in the early 1990s.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.620
And as Jonathan said it was a serious novel
that I wrote with a writing partner.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:30.030
And it was great for me because my co-author
was a psychiatrist, not a psychiatrist, a

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:35.600
psychologist, a neuropsychologist who still
runs the unit at the McLean, which is the

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.960
great psychiatric hospital.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.730
So we wrote stories about a character who
runs a unit at the McLean, but we called it

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.910
something else and we put it in the Bermuda
triangle between Belmont and Cambridge.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:56.040
And they were all stories about things like
memory and delusions and dementia and fear

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.760
and shame.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.280
Things that psychologists understand.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.280
And I didn't.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:07.720
So I was, I was afraid my Don was gonna wanna
write, he was afraid I was gonna make him

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.720
write.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.740
So it's really a great partnership and I learned
that I could write and I could write this

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.740
kind of stuff.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:19.400
This kind of slightly creepy, scary but intricately
plotted.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.400
You know a mystery has to be intricately plotted.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.031
And so when we stopped writing together I
was afraid I wasn't ever gonna to have an

00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:28.480
idea for a book.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.339
Because all the ideas, many of them had really
been generated by Don.

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:38.130
I had done all the writing but I hadn't really
come up with the premises.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.050
Finally one day I found an idea at a yard
sale.

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.050
I love yard sales.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.900
I went to a yard sale at a house near mine.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:50.030
My daughter had played at this house, it's
a big, old, Victorian beautiful on the outside,

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.030
horrible on the inside.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.490
And they were taken down walls and making
it into a great house.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.490
And so I was chatting up the woman in the
driveway.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:02.730
And I said, you know did you change the ceiling
in the kitchen.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.190
I mean I knew, I recognize the toilet they
were throwing away.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.240
I really knew that house.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.330
So I, she said, finally, "Would I like to
go inside and look around?"

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.810
I said "Oh I'd like to, yes very much."

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:18.110
She said well go ahead there's no one inside
just help yourself you know your way.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.330
So I went, there's something very creepy about
going into someone else's empty house.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.340
I went and I'm looking around, I go upstairs.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.010
Finally on the second floor the mystery writer
in me kicked in and I thought what if a woman

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.000
goes to a yard sale, somehow she talks her
way into the house.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.940
She goes inside and she never comes out.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.140
And I went home, very quickly.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.140
[laughter]

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.670
I didn't want to stay in that house any longer.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.070
And I started to write.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.680
I didn't know who the woman was who came to
the yard sale, but I knew she was nine months

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.680
pregnant.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.820
I didn't know what the connection was between
her and the woman throwing the yard sale but

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.670
I knew that the woman throwing the yard sale
was also nine months pregnant.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:10:00.960
And I proceeded to write this book completely
ignoring all the rules that I have set forth

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.990
in my "Writing and Selling Your Mystery Novel:
How to Knock Them Dead with Style."

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:11.640
Because I just wanted to see who these characters
were and where it took me.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.580
As a result the writing process was very ugly.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:19.140
It took about two years whereas a serious
novel usually took me a year.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:24.640
But the result was something quite different
than anything I had written before.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.130
I got a much better contract.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.760
I got a much better agent.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:35.810
I saw, I finally stopped doing all the freelance
work that I had been doing up to that time

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.120
in order to support my writing habit.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.000
And I started to really feel like a writer.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.480
So that book was a really great experience.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:50.560
It was sold to lifetime movie network and
then of course I was paranoid that I was never

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.570
gonna come up with an idea for my next novel.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.839
As I am now having just turned in my third
novel, I don't know what I'm gonna write next.

00:10:56.839 --> 00:11:00.970
The trough between books is very difficult
place to be.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.860
But, "Come And Find Me."

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:14.570
You know ideas come from the weirdest places,
and this one I think it started, I blog with

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.700
a bunch of other mystery writers on a blog
called Jungle Red Writers.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.050
And every once in a while we offer a book,
a free book.

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.420
Fairly often actually.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:29.500
And when that happens, we get this deluge
of commenters that we know could care less

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.950
about Jungle Red Writers.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.670
But it turns out that there are, but they're
real.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.200
It's not a bot or anything.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.170
And they're different because we actually
try to contact them and see if we're just

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.000
getting the same e-mail from the same person
over and over.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.030
We're not.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:53.550
And it turns out there are these websites
that tell people about contests.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.190
And then people who go every day, and then
they entered every contest.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.590
And that's what they do.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.270
And at the same time I had a neighbor who
never left her house.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:06.890
But she always got these package deliveries.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:11.900
And I thought, well what if you know the neighbor
is one of these.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.990
Cause if you enter enough contests, you win
a fair number of them.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.040
So these packages just kept arriving.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:25.540
And you know, her only contact with the world
seemed to be the UPS man.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.890
So I started thinking about it, and I started
coming up with the story of a woman.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:39.690
Who, and this is Diana in "Come And Find Me,"
who is at home.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.649
And she's at home because she's afraid to
leave the house.

00:12:42.649 --> 00:12:47.250
But she runs, and this was where I had to
figure out how could you, was there a way

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:54.730
that you could run a computer security business
from your house and never leave it?

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.990
And could you actually live that way?

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.940
And I started thinking about the Internet
and how it connects people.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.020
But also allows people to isolate themselves
physically.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.750
And also, allows people to get spoofed.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:14.860
You don't really know that an e-mail is coming
from the person that it says it's coming from.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:21.390
When I look at my pinhole camera in the frame
of my MacBook, I often wonder if someone's

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.970
looking back at me.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:28.550
So it's also a place that can generate a fair
amount of paranoia and you just really don't

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:34.550
want to think about it too much, or you become
a little bit crazy.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:39.730
So I started to research, I've been a long
time out of the computer business.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:43.890
And never been a gamer.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:49.310
You know really, the mouse and the just completely
slays me.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.680
I don't really know what I'm doing with the
mouse buttons.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.910
So I knew I needed to do some research.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.280
So I got in touch with this guy named Jeff
Bardin.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.590
Has anybody heard of him?

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:07.480
He's a security expert, and I wanted to find
out from him first of all what were the greatest

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.529
threats on the Internet?

00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:15.279
I wanted there to be something at the core
of this novel that was not a terrorism and

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:17.490
not robbing a bank.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.850
I have no interest in either of those things.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.370
I wanted something that would be personally
scary.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.530
High-stakes, but at a personal level.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.730
And so I met with him and he told me.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.490
You know I said can somebody live in their
house and have a business.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.080
And he told me about Second Life.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.500
I'm sure most you know about Second Life.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:43.080
Well in my book, it's called Otherworld cause
I didn't want to get sued.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.810
And he was telling me you know about the porn.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:55.300
About the cyber terrorism that you know people
are actually training terrorists in Second

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.050
Life.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.612
As well as, just normal people wandering around
and you know, going from island to island

00:15:01.612 --> 00:15:07.790
and buying things in Second Life and finding
like-minded people.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:13.470
And so it had this, it has the positive and
the negative side that I wanted, cause that's

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:22.420
what I see in computers is both a very positive
and a very scary side.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.760
So I of course figured, well, nothing with
computers scares me.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:34.950
I've been online for years and years and years
and it's just not a scary thing.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.181
So I went to SecondLife.com and created an
avatar and that was fun.

00:15:39.181 --> 00:15:43.660
It was like my Betsy McCall doll, you know
getting her dressed and figuring out not so

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.110
easy for me how to make her move forward and
not bump into furniture.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:52.540
And then flying which is very cool cause you
kind of felt like, kind of felt like Harry

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:58.089
Potter on the back of Buckbeak, cause its
first person you know you're watching and

00:15:58.089 --> 00:16:00.370
flying over and it was very cool.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.339
And then I fell in the ocean.

00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:06.500
And I couldn't get her out, I mean I just
could not figure out how to get the character.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.630
And I was like breathless.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.170
You know gasping.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:15.260
And I thought, you know you really do connect
with your avatar.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.269
And I also, I was three hours into this odyssey
and realizing that there was not enough time

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:24.680
in the world for me to get as good as I needed
to get to really learn about Second Life.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.230
So back up and I started to call.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:32.500
You know I put out something on Facebook to
all the people that I had worked with you

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.630
know from HP.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.870
I've listed a startup, I was in all kinds
of computer companies.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:41.880
Somebody must know somebody who plays in Second
Life and works in Second Life.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.370
I wanted both experiences.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:52.200
So I connected with someone at Raytheon who
conducts training.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.970
She creates training events for them in Second
Life.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:17:01.250
And so I went and sat next to her and rode
shotgun and watched her and took copious notes

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.839
on how you do all the things that she did.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:13.699
And while she was showing me a place where
they were having training, this virtual metal

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:16.800
cylinder dropped over her avatar.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:22.110
And she explained to me that there were griefers,
these were people who had managed to get into

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:24.490
this place cause there wasn't enough security.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:28.680
And again, it was just so creepy, you know
that this could happen.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.970
And she was telling me that there was a lot
of porn in Second Life.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:42.020
My second guides to Otherworld were a couple
who lived up in one of the northern suburbs

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:46.380
in the house that, I gotta put this house
in this book one day.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.530
It was shag carpeting and cigarette smoke.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:56.850
And coffee that smelled like they never started
over with the coffee.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.580
And the house; very nice people.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.230
But I was, sneezing and gasping for breath
within 2 minutes.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.240
A lot of dogs too.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.170
A lot of dogs and cats.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.420
But they kind of just hang out in Second Life.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:18.050
And so again you know I sat next to the husband
in this case and he showed me how he could

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:22.890
see which of his friends were online and how
to go where they were and the coordinates.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:28.540
Just tried to get enough information that
I could make myself feel credible without

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.540
really learning Second Life which I really
did not.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:38.430
I'm not, as I said it really did not interest
me to really experience it.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.820
So I, so that was my adventure on Second Life.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:50.500
And you know I was able to see where it could
be both scary and fun.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.920
And also helpful.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:19:01.630
As I was talking to Jeff Bartin I mean I wanted
some way that there would be a danger here

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.520
as well.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.030
One of the things that he started telling
me about was just how everything is on the

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.980
network and therefore vulnerable in its way.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.870
So just take a hospital for instance.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:21.320
The security cameras are networked.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:27.790
The machines that monitor your vital signs
are networked.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:33.470
All your data that your doctor has about you
is potentially on the network.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:39.380
The machine that administers morphine when
you need a hit is.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.170
DNA profiles.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.710
And on and on it goes.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.650
And you know you can start to get paranoid
and start to, what I did was start to spin

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:58.380
a what if there were a hacker who could use
those vulnerabilities to hold hospitals and

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.080
insurance companies for ransom.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.440
And I mean that's really, the other person
that I did a lot of research with, not a lot,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:10.510
I spent a couple hours with him is a former
hacker who now works for computer companies.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:15.929
And he was telling me how in the early days
of hacking, it was kind of cowboys.

00:20:15.929 --> 00:20:17.710
People were doing it for fun.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.090
And to show that they could.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.090
And to one up each other.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:28.450
It was a very kind of male and juvenile in
its way.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.490
You know kind of showing off.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.470
And that now things have changed quite a bit.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.289
That it's really much more a business.

00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:37.970
And people make a lot of money.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.980
And there's a lot of dollars at stake.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:48.919
So, I mean I wasn't really interested in the
hacker in the Ukraine who's getting into computers

00:20:48.919 --> 00:20:50.760
and getting people's credit card.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.900
To me that's got no juice as a mystery story.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:59.600
But I was interested in the potential of getting
in and getting DNA profiles and what you could

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.730
do with that.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:05.200
Getting in and monitoring people in the hospital
when they didn't know they were being monitored.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.120
That seemed like much more of a personal violation.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.120
And so that's kind of what leads into the
subplot.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.830
I also got really interested in the idea of
an avatar.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.860
That this is a person that you create online.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.870
Your personality but in a way in a Halloween
costume.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.580
You know you could be whoever you wanted to
be.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:37.300
A third apparently of the avatars in Second
Life that are female are really you know controlled

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.590
and created by men.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.340
So you have no idea.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:47.240
So it's a great opportunity to try on different
personas, to try to be someone you're not,

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.770
to fool people or take advantage of them.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:56.570
And my feeling was that for my character who
was stuck in a house her avatar would be a

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.940
way for her to get out.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:04.510
For her to be person she used to be but online.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:09.760
Having said that, and all that computer stuff,
the other thing that always drives me, the

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:16.480
creepy part is, I come from a movie family,
I always think very cinematically about the

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:24.400
books that I'm writing as if the narrator
is a camera in one of the characters heads.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:32.370
And I always, always am going for what I call
the light bulb in the milk moment.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.020
If you've ever seen Alfred Hitchcock, and
Alfred Hitchcock is my idol, I mean if I could

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:41.790
write books the way, that make you feel the
Way, Alfred Hitchcock does when you're at

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:46.400
the end of the second act moving into the
third act and winding up.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.080
I always remember the movie "Suspicion."

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.549
And "Suspicion", some you will know.

00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:59.810
Joan Fontaine is the wife, she's upstairs,
an invalid in bed, awash in satin sheets.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.809
And she's sure that her husband is trying
to kill her.

00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:09.890
Her husband, Cary Grant is climbing the stairs
at that moment carrying a silver tray and

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.990
on the tray is glass of milk.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.700
And Hitchcock does you know the famous back
and forth between them.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:25.100
You know we hear her, we see him, little closer
to her, a little closer to him, until we come

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.360
right in on the milk.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:34.350
And he never has to say anything because we
know there's got to be poison in that milk.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:38.059
And the milk seems to glow.

00:23:38.059 --> 00:23:42.100
And of course the trick was Hitchcock put
a light bulb in the milk.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.690
I mean, he was not subtle.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.690
[laughter]

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.789
But you don't realize that when you're watching
it.

00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:51.559
And for me always when I'm writing, I'm reaching
for that kind of a moment.

00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:56.309
What I love about it is, milk is nourishing.

00:23:56.309 --> 00:24:00.090
Warm milk is what puts you to sleep, relaxes
you.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:06.530
It's this very nourishing thing, and yet he
twists it and makes it scary.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.070
And so in my books I'm always going for that
moment.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:14.460
In "Come And Find Me," Diana is home.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:21.270
She's got her house surrounded with surveillance
cameras and she can look at them anytime she

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.270
wants.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.900
And she checks in every once in a while.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.160
And there on her front fence is a cardinal
sitting.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.730
A little while later she checks, the cardinal
is back.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:36.460
The third time she checks and the cardinal
is in the same place.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.080
That's a light bulb in the milk moment.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.970
Because she realizes she's not seeing what's
outside.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:46.470
Someone has replaced her video feed with a
continuous loop.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:51.210
And that's, she's not really, something else
is going on out there and she can't see.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.590
So inside becomes scarier than outside.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.630
And she finally leaves the house.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:07.250
So that's just a little insight into where
I, into where I'm thinking when I, cause I

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.240
do set them in the suburbs.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.070
I do set them in places that should be not
scary places.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:18.850
But I'm always trying to make them scary.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.660
I thought I would read just a little bit from
the book.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.850
This isn't anything about computers.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.809
One of the other things I wanted to write
about with this book was the relationship

00:25:29.809 --> 00:25:35.440
between sisters.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.440
I have a lot of them.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:43.260
And so what drives Diana out of the house
is that her sister is missing.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.330
And this is a scene where she's talking to
her mother.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.400
She's managed to leave the house.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.860
She knows something is wrong.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:26:00.200
And she knows that her sister should've called
her mother, so she calls her mother.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:05.280
"What's wrong?" her mother said the minute
she heard Diana's voice on the phone.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.539
"Why should there be something wrong?"

00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:10.130
"Because you never call me, I call you.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.700
Your sister calls me, that's the way things
work in this family."

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.160
"So has she?"

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.220
"Why is it always a contest?"

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.010
Diana took a breath, "Let's start over.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:20.310
Hi Ma, how are you."

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:25.110
For the last five years her mother had lived
in Jensen Beach Florida in a condo surrounded

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.250
by golf courses.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:30.740
"Men golfed" she explained to Diana, forever
hopeful that she'd find a better partner than

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:35.190
Diana's father who disappeared from their
lives long before he'd taken off with the

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:39.350
woman who Diana and Ashley referred to as
Tiffany, because that was her favorite place

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:40.630
to shop.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.990
She had not long after been replaced by Tiffany
2.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:47.440
"Sorry, do I sound cranky?" her mother said.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.370
"I can't complain, a few creaky joints.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.679
I've always thought that was a figure of speech.

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:54.070
But it turns out they do creak and click.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.070
It's unnerving.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.080
I mean I make a fist and the knuckles make
a sound.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.940
And my back, my doctor tells me to walk more,
says it's normal for my age.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.920
Do you think he's just telling me that because
there's nothing for it?

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.900
Like I said, I can't complain."

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.730
Her mother snorted a laugh, "Guess I can.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.230
Hah, in fact I'm really good at complaining.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.820
But actually, on the whole and considering
everything I'm good.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.260
Hey, I beat the big C. What else can he throw
at me?

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.810
Carpe diem, that's what I say.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.570
Carpe diem every single goddamn day.

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:27.700
How about you sweetie pie?"

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.550
Her mother actually paused.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.520
Diana waited until she was certain that her
mother wasn't going to answer the question

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.520
herself.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.220
"I'm good."

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.750
"Good, just good?

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.340
That's nice I guess.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.470
You getting out of the"
"Some."

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:42.470
"Good.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.830
I'm glad you're getting out.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:47.090
And if you're not taking a vitamin D supplement,
you should be.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:50.429
You don't want osteoporosis to get you when
you're my age."

00:27:50.429 --> 00:27:52.200
There was a moment of silence.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.620
"You know, all I want is for you to be happy.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.880
Your sister tells me"
"So did she call?"

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.039
"Last week.

00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:02.480
She was supposed to call this morning, Monday
morning she always calls."

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.480
Monday morning.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.450
Ashley usually answered her messages and showed
up at work too.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.240
"Has something happened to your Sister?" her
mother asked.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.590
"Because all weekend I felt something was
off.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.920
I thought it was me.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.030
Then today she doesn't call and you do.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.020
Is something up?"

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.840
"Nothing's up.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.590
I haven't actually talked to her either."

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:22.690
"Since?"

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:23.780
"Friday."

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.179
"Ah, did you check her apartment?"

00:28:26.179 --> 00:28:28.030
"She's not answering her phone."

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:30.440
"Because she's not there, or"

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:34.960
The silence that followed felt laden with
the accusation and an image of Ashley lying

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.450
on her kitchen floor paralyzed and unable
to reach for the phone.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:40.450
Her mother went on.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.860
"I'm sure she'll turn up hon, she always does.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.929
Try not to worry about it too much."

00:28:44.929 --> 00:28:48.049
Two years ago Diana would've been the one
trying to reassure her mother.

00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:49.070
"Good advice."

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.740
"I'm full of good advice, don't you know that?"

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.820
"Thanks mom, I'll call.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.030
I'll tell her to call.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.030
Bye."

00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.330
"Shhh." her mother cut her off.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:03.270
From the day she'd been diagnosed with cancer
Diana's mother had insisted that they never

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.450
end a conversation with any version of goodbye.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.669
"Sorry.

00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:11.470
I meant talk to you soon", Diana said.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:12.690
"Knock wood."

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:19.690
So that's the character who is about to leave
her house.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:23.360
So I thought I would take questions at this
point.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.590
Anybody working on a book?

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.440
Anybody interested in the writing process?

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.440
The book?

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.950
You name it.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:30.950
Yes.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.390
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Do you outline?

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.440
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Do I outline?

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.590
I do.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.950
I never follow it, but I do outline.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:39.950
[laughter]

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:43.470
I have people say, people often ask you know
do you know the ending before the beginning.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:47.140
And I always say, "I think I do but I'm usually
wrong."

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.850
But that's the thing about an outline.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:52.490
You know it's like any work process.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.429
You know you have enough colleagues that some
people never bother to make lists.

00:29:56.429 --> 00:30:01.210
Other people are compulsive list makers, even
if they never read them.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:05.700
So I do make an outline because I feel like
it gives me training wheels.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.870
And then I can start writing.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:10.610
And then I almost immediately go off.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:16.059
Because characters when you put them on the
page are never quite the way that you thought

00:30:16.059 --> 00:30:17.059
they would be.

00:30:17.059 --> 00:30:18.470
Which is a good thing.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:22.150
Because I feel like if I can surprise myself,
I can surprise the reader and that's a great

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:26.419
thing to be able to do in a mystery, is to
create a character that people think is going

00:30:26.419 --> 00:30:28.610
to go this way and then goes that way.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.870
And then, well that's interesting.

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.110
Why did they do that?

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:36.500
So as a writer I'm constantly having to change
the outline.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.549
I change the outline as I go.

00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:41.530
So as I write, I rewrite the outline.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:44.929
And by the time I'm done I have an outline
that does reflect my book.

00:30:44.929 --> 00:30:45.929
And I use it.

00:30:45.929 --> 00:30:48.450
It's a very useful thing.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:53.970
But the other thing that happens as your character
goes off the rails you have to change the

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.620
back story.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:00.220
Back story is the stuff that the writer knows
about the character but the reader doesn't.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:05.230
So when I put a character on a page, I know
all kinds of things about her or him that

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.230
you don't know.

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:08.990
I know where she grew up, I know if she went
to college.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:10.840
I know if she hates her father.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.240
I know she smokes.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.970
I know what kind of car she drives probably.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.960
I know what kind of car she'd never drive.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:23.490
And so all that stuff and why, is in my head.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:28.520
Sometimes I'll actually write it in a character
bible they call it.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.160
Just a bunch of stray notes about a character.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:37.740
But as a character surprises me, I have to
go back and change my assumptions about who

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.679
that character is, to change the back story.

00:31:40.679 --> 00:31:44.950
So it's kind of a shifting back and shifting
forward always.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:51.240
This, I just turned in a new book called,
what is it called?

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.940
It's called, "There Was an Old Woman."

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.110
And I got to page 125.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.610
And I had an outline for the whole book.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:02.029
But I couldn't write another page.

00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:05.610
I just got stuck, I was bored.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.070
And I went back, I went forward.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.000
I did everything I could think of.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.529
Everything everyone's ever told me about writer's
block I tried.

00:32:13.529 --> 00:32:16.740
And finally I just decided to throw away the
first 125 pages.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:22.360
Of course I didn't throw it away, I just put
it in the out file which I start the minute

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.289
I start a book.

00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:28.280
And I realized I had started the book in the
wrong place.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.850
So I started over.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:35.960
And wrote my way up to where I had been and
was able to use some of what I had and then

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.960
move forward.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.310
But it was, I think you just have to be fearless
as a writer.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:46.350
And though you have an outline, don't think
that you can follow it.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.760
I mean I think it's like many project plans.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.080
I mean every once in a while you'll hit a
bump in the road that you weren't expecting

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:57.360
and you have to change all your assumptions
and then change your milestones on where you're

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.700
going, it's kind of a similar thing.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.700
Other questions?

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.700
Yeah.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.700
&gt;&gt;Male #2: You mentioned the Jungle Red Writers..

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.700
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yep.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:07.330
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Do you get together as a group
and critique each other's work in the blog?

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:10.840
&gt;&gt;Hallie: No but that's a good question.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:18.460
He asked if the people that I blog with, I
blog with some really wonderful mystery writers.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:26.630
Deborah Crombie, Rhys Bowen, Julia Spencer
Fleming, Hank Phillippi Ryan.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:31.680
And I do ask Hank to read my work cause she's
a good friend.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:40.160
But for the most part, I don't ask anyone
to read my work until I'm done.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:45.440
And that's because I don't, I'm too ready
to slash and burn.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.840
And I, the slightest, I mean I don't own my
words at all.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:56.000
I'm very easy with criticism, but a little
over easy.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.010
Because sometimes you throw away what you've
got before you realize what you wanted to

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.010
say.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:06.290
So I feel like I at least have to get those
first 300 pages out.

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:11.010
And know where I'm going before I give it
to somebody to critique.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:15.310
Then I'll be happy to change anything, but
at least I know what I meant to say.

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:18.330
Because otherwise you end up writing someone
else's book.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:21.179
And that's not a good thing.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:25.850
You don't even know what you wanted to say
in the first place.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:31.520
So I do have people read it, and I have a
wonderful literary agent who always after

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:37.429
I've made what I think is the best book I
can, she reads it and I usually get a lot

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:44.690
of notes they call it, from her and I revise
it and then I send it to my editor.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.970
Fortunately I'm under contract right now,
so I have an editor and a deadline which is

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:49.580
a wonderful thing.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:54.070
And I'm just working my way through my notes
now on the new manuscript.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:35:00.270
And it's quite, it's quite a bit more than
I thought I was gonna get I must say.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:01.590
But it's always getting better.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.839
But at least I knew what I wanted say in the
first place.

00:35:03.839 --> 00:35:08.410
You know, you don't even know what your themes
are, I never know what my themes are in my

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:10.160
book until I'm done writing.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.060
And then I look and I say, I mean, "Never
Tell a Lie" was about what it's like to be

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:18.349
completely at that period of vulnerability
when you have your first child and you've

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:21.010
been out in the working world the whole time.

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:28.770
It's also about the mess that your high school
experience permanently leaves in your head.

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:32.310
And "Come and Find Me" is about trust.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:37.240
It's about knowing who you can trust and about
how you deal with people who betray you.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.280
Trust and betrayal.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:45.160
And you know, I just tell the stories and
then realize later what I'm writing about.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.640
I mean I just don't, you don't want to shortcut
that process.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.160
Did you have a question?

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.160
Yeah.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.680
&gt;&gt;Male #3: There are a lot of books that you
probably would like to be reading.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.680
How do you find the time?

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.680
Do you read them all?

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.210
Do you read the newest?

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.619
Do you read the classics?

00:36:01.619 --> 00:36:03.480
I mean what do you do for, how do you get
the time?

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.050
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, one of the things.

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:10.170
One of the things I do as a sideline is I
review crime fiction for the Boston Globe.

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:13.790
I have a column that runs every other month
in the globe.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:18.950
And so I'm always chipping away at, it's only
three books every other month, that is not

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.390
a lot of books.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:28.640
But I get about 60 books every two weeks delivered
to my door.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:33.910
So I have to sort through them and make a
short pile of the ones I'm interested in reading.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:37.680
And I start a lot of books that I don't finish.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.200
I hate to review a book I don't like because
I hate to read a book I don't like.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.260
What is more painful than reading a book you
don't like?

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:48.530
So I would rather leave enough time to put
it aside.

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:49.930
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Why bother?

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:50.930
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Exactly.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:51.930
Exactly.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.000
And then also there so little ink for authors
right now.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.320
I mean there's so few newspapers being printed,
there's so few real book reviews.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.320
Almost none.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.290
It's such a fraction of what it used to be.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:06.490
So I really don't want to be putting negative
reviews out when I could be telling people

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.700
about books to read, not books not to read.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.800
What is the point?

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:16.010
So having said that, I start a lot of books
but I also have my pile of, I mean I just

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.780
finished all the "Hunger Games."

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:19.780
[laughter]

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.790
Which I loved, I have to say, but I'm a big
Harry Potter fan too you know, I love the

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:24.790
Harry Potter fans.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:28.760
All of the books, I read them all.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:33.070
I just read the book, one of the books that
was nominated for the Edgar this year which

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.080
I loved.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.940
It's called "The Devotion of Suspect X."

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.550
Has anyone read that?

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.760
Oh it's brilliant.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.339
It's about a, it's about a mathematician.

00:37:44.339 --> 00:37:49.940
It's about a woman who killed; you know in
the first scene a woman kills her ex-husband.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:58.220
And her neighbor is going to work with her
to hide, you know, to figure out how she's

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.220
gonna get away with it.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:08.080
He was awful in abusive and the guy is a kind
of Aspergersy mathematician.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:15.130
And his nemesis is a physicist that he went
to university with.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:18.030
And there's all, it's just, it's diabolical.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:21.589
And it's got a plot twist I did not see coming.

00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:23.950
It's got a great plot twist.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:27.420
So I've also got my stack of books you know
that I want to read.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.420
I want to read Gilead.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:34.100
I got a lot of books, all kinds of books that
I just don't get to.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.100
Yes.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:45.300
&gt;&gt;Male #4: The description you have of you
know how people's lives are so networked and

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:50.940
you know we're so vulnerable with all this
information.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.683
It reminded me of "The Net" you know the Sandra
Bullock movie.

00:38:54.683 --> 00:38:55.683
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah.

00:38:55.683 --> 00:38:56.683
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I was wondering where that fits
in and now it's been what, 17 years since

00:38:56.683 --> 00:38:57.683
it came out?

00:38:57.683 --> 00:38:58.683
&gt;&gt;Hallie: That's true.

00:38:58.683 --> 00:38:59.683
I had forgotten about that movie.

00:38:59.683 --> 00:39:00.683
Yeah.

00:39:00.683 --> 00:39:01.683
&gt;&gt;Male #4: [Inaudible] things may have changed
or how we've accepted things that.

00:39:01.683 --> 00:39:03.630
&gt;&gt;Hallie: I think we've accepted a lot of
things.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:09.330
One of the things that is key in this book
is a flash mob.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:15.320
And of course, when the net was written, flash
mobs hadn't yet been invented.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:21.190
But I think there's a playfulness about the
Internet that was not.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.839
Because it's just a part of your life.

00:39:22.839 --> 00:39:24.599
I mean it's just there.

00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:27.800
I think it was much newer then.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.320
And I think, but I love the playfulness of
it.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:36.710
I love Facebook, I love being able to connect
to people I don't know.

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:40.339
I like trying to assess out which people are,
are not real.

00:39:40.339 --> 00:39:41.339
[Laughs]

00:39:41.339 --> 00:39:48.560
I don't know, I guess, I think it's possible
to take it a lot less seriously than.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.230
But I do love those.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:53.690
Has anybody seen the new "Sherlock Holmes"?

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:54.890
Yeah.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:40:01.670
On public television, there's a new "Sherlock
Holmes" with Cumberbatch, great name.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.310
It's the name of the.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:09.010
But what's cool about it is it's set in the
present and it's full of computery things.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:14.450
You know they're like little butterflies that
pop up every once in a while.

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:25.210
And it's extremely cool that, and weird because
I always think of Sherlock Holmes as the perfect

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:29.990
vehicle for steam punk.

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:35.100
Which in its way is sort of a twisted version,
cause it's set in the old-time me.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:40.030
But this is taking the same idea but setting
it absolutely in modern day.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.250
I think it's very cool.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:43.670
Anyway, I think it's become more playful.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.640
I think were less afraid.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.450
I think we know, I think we've just stop worrying.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:50.990
Because how can you do otherwise?

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.750
I mean, you know.

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.829
I mean you don't get those e-mails every other
day.

00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:58.599
Oh my God, there's a virus.

00:40:58.599 --> 00:41:02.410
And, all that stuff has really settled down.

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:06.420
And I think people have gotten smarter about
protecting, I hope, our computers.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.710
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Overloaded and turned it off.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.950
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah I think, I think you're right.

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:12.349
I think you're right.

00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:13.349
Yes.

00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:20.710
&gt;&gt;Male #5: So you wrote a book on how to write
a mystery novel.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:21.710
&gt;&gt;Hallie: I did yeah.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:22.710
&gt;&gt;Male #5: And you decided that wasn't right
thing to do?

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:23.710
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Oh no no.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:24.800
It's just that that process that I talked
about in that book didn't work for the book

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.800
I was writing.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.100
&gt;&gt;Male #5: So are you going to rewrite the
book?

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.400
&gt;&gt;Hallie: No, because it's chaos.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.780
You cannot recommend chaos to people.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.020
[laughter]

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:43.250
I mean, what I say in "Writing and Selling
Your Mystery Novel" is that writing a novel

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.170
is a very personal process.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:48.730
Everyone will do it differently because we're,
you have to take advantage of your strengths

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.790
and we all have different strengths.

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:55.790
And so, on the other hand, it doesn't hurt
to hear how other people do it and try some

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:59.230
of those techniques that they have and see
if they work for you.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:02.031
So I kinda hedged my bets when I wrote it.

00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:03.490
And I still believe that.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:09.690
And I also think that different books write
differently.

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:14.220
This book for instance, "There Was an Old
Woman," I knew the ending.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.910
It's the first thing I knew.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:19.500
I absolutely knew the ending, never gonna
change.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.450
That's the ending.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:26.790
There's a huge plot twist at the end and I
had it from the beginning.

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:35.970
In "Come and Find Me" there's a final scene
where she confronts the person who's been

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:39.700
jerking her around.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:47.410
And I knew she was going to one up him.

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:53.060
She was gonna, she was gonna get him.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.030
But I didn't know how.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:59.130
And so, I mean I just, I was afraid of writing
up to that point cause I was gonna have figure

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:00.130
it out.

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:01.140
And I did.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.820
So it's just, it's very different everybody
right.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:07.940
But I do think, I mean I remember when I was
first starting, the first writing conference

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.940
I ever went to.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.410
And they're great to go to if you're a writer
cause you hear all kinds, you hear every writer

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.160
tell their process and it's so different.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.130
So you just give up of there being one way.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:21.700
But I remember there was the keynote speaker
was some very well published writer.

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.609
You know Pulitzer Prize winner, blah blah
blah.

00:43:23.609 --> 00:43:29.869
And she said, somebody asked her, "What's
your writing process?"

00:43:29.869 --> 00:43:34.430
And she said, in all seriousness, "It's magic."

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:42.060
And you know, I thought that's like saying
"I can do it and you can't."

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.060
You know?

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.410
It's the ultimate auteur.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.951
And it really turned me off, that was before
I wrote my book.

00:43:48.951 --> 00:43:50.770
I thought that's bullshit.

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:52.630
There's a million ways to write a book.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.140
So tell us what yours is and we'll find out
what some.

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.090
And then you put it together for yourself.

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.460
It's just a process to an end.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.460
Yes.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:02.869
&gt;&gt;Male #6: It sounds little bit like Nash,
you know John Nash when he went crazy right?

00:44:02.869 --> 00:44:12.080
It's like how come you didn't know that becoming
the Emperor of Antarctica was weird.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:19.280
He said, "Well it came to me the same way
the mathematical ideas came to me."

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.320
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.390
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Sorta the same way.

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:27.680
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Well see that's the problem with,
the kind of books that I write really do have

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.160
a form.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.740
And that's one of the things that I write
about in that writing book is what is, what

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:41.660
do people expect when they pick up a book
that's been shelved with the mystery books.

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:44.480
You know, there's a certain expectation.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:50.040
And that's not to say you have to write a
book that conforms to those expectations but

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.589
readers will not be happy if they pulled it
off the mystery shelf and it doesn't feel

00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:55.660
like a mystery.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:59.550
So what I was writing about a lot was the
structure of a mystery.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:05.950
It always always opens with a scene that throws
a character off-balance.

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.590
Just like a movie actually.

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:11.260
Movies always open with those, start noticing.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:16.109
I mean they always open with, it doesn't have
to be a dead body, it can be a guy parking

00:45:16.109 --> 00:45:22.040
his Porsche at the apartment building, coming
up the stairs walking down the hall.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.020
The door to his apartment is ajar.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.170
He pushes it open all the furniture is gone.

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:31.150
And there's a red stiletto heel in the middle
of the bare floor.

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:32.150
That's a great opening.

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:33.790
I mean I haven't written that one yet.

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:34.790
[laughter]

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:35.790
But I will one day.

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:37.450
That's a short story.

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:40.560
So you know, it's a what's going on here moment.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.770
And that's how you always want to always start
a book it's with that.

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:44.859
Then you move on.

00:45:44.859 --> 00:45:46.080
You start the first act.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.140
And there's a twist, and there's a second
act and there's a twist.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.840
Third act, there's a confrontation, there's
a mop up.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:55.490
So there's this rough structure that like.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:59.460
If you, you hear people talk about screenplays,
they are much worse.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:03.619
Because in a mystery novel, I have 300 pages
to play with.

00:46:03.619 --> 00:46:07.560
A screenplay is like 100 and, it's not even
100 I think.

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:13.839
So it's, but it's a very demanding structure
which is partly why I like to write them.

00:46:13.839 --> 00:46:21.510
I always feel like, it's like I'm in a playground
and there's only certain equipment.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:25.400
So I can use all my imagination, but I've
still got just a slide and a jungle.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.450
And you know it's like certain things that
I can play with.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:31.910
And it's kind of reassuring.

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:39.320
&gt;&gt;Female #3: So along with the whole class
structure, there's also this introducing your

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.410
character, filling out the character.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:46.950
You know I've read some books where it's very
awkward and forced feeling.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:52.700
Like okay now we take a break to give you
a little monologue about this character.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:53.700
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Published books?

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:54.700
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Yeah.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.700
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Oh God.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.180
&gt;&gt;Female #3: You know and then there's some
books where you're reading them and really

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:04.990
the character naturally fills out and you
learn things that you know doesn't feel stilted

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.990
or.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:10.230
&gt;&gt;Hallie: One of the chapters in writing and
selling your mystery novel talks about avoiding

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:11.460
the back story dump.

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.540
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Yeah.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.440
&gt;&gt;Hallie: And that's exactly what you're talking
about.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:19.380
And I'm surprised we find it in out, actually
it's in the girl with the Dragon tattoo.

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:24.910
The whole first 50 pages for me could of gone
right in the you know.

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:31.500
Until Lizbeth Salander shows up on the, were
not really engaged with what's his name.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.810
And we have all, you see I don't remember
his is name.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:34.810
What is his name?

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:35.810
&gt;&gt;Audience: Mikael Blomkvist.

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:37.260
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Thank you, Blomkvist.

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.260
[laughter]

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.300
Her I remember, she's the reason people read
that book.

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:46.990
But that's a typical mistake that you see
in new writers is they feel like they have.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:50.579
Remember I said there's all this stuff that
you know about the character that the reader

00:47:50.579 --> 00:47:52.339
doesn't know.

00:47:52.339 --> 00:47:55.670
The challenge is to keep it yourself.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:48:03.540
And let the characters show by what they wear,
what they eat, what they do, what they say.

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:09.369
Let the reader put together the back story
through these details that you drop.

00:48:09.369 --> 00:48:13.109
And occasionally a bit of internal dialogue
and revelation through dialogue.

00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:17.510
But, you're right, that's deadly.

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:19.760
And as I say, it's one of the biggest problems
for a new writer.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.089
Is figuring out how to introduce the character
without weighing down the front of the story.

00:48:24.089 --> 00:48:26.930
The reason it doesn't work is because readers
don't care about the character yet.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:28.619
They don't care about the situation.

00:48:28.619 --> 00:48:32.390
And so you have to get the story moving.On
the other hand, the writers say "well but

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:34.369
they don't know this and they don't know that."

00:48:34.369 --> 00:48:35.790
Well yeah, you have been led to.

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:36.790
Yeah.

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:37.790
&gt;&gt;Male #7: So what's your discipline?

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:44.670
Do you start 9-to-5 on Monday , I mean do
you work 9-to-5 on Monday through Friday or

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:45.670
how does that.

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:48.060
&gt;&gt;Hallie: I write every day that I can.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:53.540
Unless I, I've got, I have grown daughters
and when they're home all bets are off.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:58.020
I want to be wherever they are when they are
within striking distance.

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.000
But I get up every morning.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.350
I start around seven at the computer.

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:07.140
And I work usually until about 10:30.

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.850
And then I'll take a walk or go to the fitness
center.

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:10.850
Have lunch.

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:11.850
Take a nap.

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:12.850
I need a nap.

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:16.810
And then I come back to the computer around
three till about six.

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:20.550
So I have a very set routine.

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:24.330
I like to write first draft in the morning.

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:27.079
I like to revise my brain isn't.

00:49:27.079 --> 00:49:29.670
You've gotta be really clearheaded in the
morning.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:35.230
And I have to say one of the most fruitful
times for me plotting, is lying in bed before

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:37.690
I get up.

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:44.490
You know that, they call it, it's that almost
dream state that you're in.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:48.339
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Hypnagogic is one word.

00:49:48.339 --> 00:49:50.020
&gt;&gt;Hallie: That it, hypnagogic, or have the
hypnopompic, they're the other ends of the

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.440
day.

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:58.140
And it's a very fruitful time for imagination.

00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:02.310
And so I will often walk through my plot wherever
I am at that point.

00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:06.260
And try to think about what could happen next
that I wasn't thinking was going to happen

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:07.650
next.

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:09.490
And so I, I like that.

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:12.020
And then I have to get down to the computer
or I will forget.

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.020
[laughs]

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:16.150
What I was thinking before I got there.

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:17.150
Other questions?

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:18.150
Yes.

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:24.930
&gt;&gt;Female #4: It seems to me that with this
latest book, you've taken people who like

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:28.560
to have colorful excitement in their inner
lives while they're reading and you've given

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.340
them a heroine who is living in this little
world.

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:37.610
Can you see that telescoping into a place
where it's really hard to get out without

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:40.590
someone coming to find you?

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:41.780
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah.

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.440
Well, I mean that was one of the challenges
of the book.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:48.250
I mean here's a character who lives in a little
house.

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:52.339
And she's closed herself off to the outside
world.

00:50:52.339 --> 00:50:53.890
I had to get her out.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:55.680
Because it's boring.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.280
You know, it's claustrophobic.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.770
I don't want to write a book that stays there.

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:03.520
Did anybody read "Room?"

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.640
Nobody read it?

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.360
Oh you people have to read more.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.310
"Room" is a fabulous book.

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:14.609
It was last year's, or maybe the year before.

00:51:14.609 --> 00:51:22.180
It's the story, it opens, its told from the,
sorry, from the point of view of a five-year-old.

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:25.430
Which is a tour de force in and of itself.

00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:33.470
And gradually we come to realize that he is
with his mother in what amounts to an oversized

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.790
packing crate.

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:36.910
They are imprisoned there.

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:38.210
There's a bed.

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:43.790
They have a, you know it's like what happened
to Elizabeth Smart you know who was.

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:45.540
Only it's from the point of view of the five-year-old.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:49.590
And when I started reading that book I thought
oh my God, she's gonna stay, how long are

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:51.580
we gonna be in this packing crate.

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:58.010
Because, you just can't sustain a story that
long in, yeah.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:00.630
So fortunately, they do get out.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:01.630
[laughs]

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:05.590
But she was in there longer than I would've,
longer than I would've imagined.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:08.780
So no I don't want to write.

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:13.339
I like to write characters that are resilient
because I think characters that are too whiny

00:52:13.339 --> 00:52:15.050
and stay where they are.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:16.650
They're not interesting.

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:18.760
You know I want a character who.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.450
And that's why I keep getting nominated for
the Mary Higgins Clark award.

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:24.650
I've never read a Mary Higgins Clark novel
I must tell you.

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:30.170
But I think what she writes about are women
who are kind of beset upon and then they save

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:31.170
themselves.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:35.339
I think, and so I, that's what I like to write
as somebody who is not gonna whine, but she's

00:52:35.339 --> 00:52:36.339
gonna sock somebody.

00:52:36.339 --> 00:52:37.339
Eventually.

00:52:37.339 --> 00:52:38.339
[Laughs]

00:52:38.339 --> 00:52:42.240
&gt;&gt;Female #4: It sounds like you had to, she
was in there so tightly that you had to pushing

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.380
her out of the house cause it was too scary
to stay.

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.579
And something pulling her out.

00:52:46.579 --> 00:52:48.140
&gt;&gt;Hallie: She had to be pushed and pulled.

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:52.190
That inside of the house had to be scarier
than the outside and she had to go out and

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.190
save her sister.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:55.359
So she, yeah that's right she had to be pushed
and pulled.

00:52:55.359 --> 00:53:00.460
Yeah, the pulling didn't just do it cause
she would've just called the police.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:05.770
One of the biggest problems in writing a mystery
novel, why doesn't she just call the police.

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:07.060
[laughter]

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:12.430
Well thank you very much, be sure to sign
up for a book, I hope you'll want one if you

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:13.430
didn't get one.

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:18.550
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: We're gonna go over to Chavin
for lunch, anybody that would like to join

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:20.300
us you're more than welcome.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.300
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yay.

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:22.300
Yeah.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.650
And I'm serious about if you have questions.

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:26.060
The follow-up, just e-mail me.

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.849
I'm happy to help.

00:53:27.849 --> 00:53:28.849
Happy to reply.

00:53:28.849 --> 00:53:29.849
Thank you.

00:53:29.849 --> 00:53:29.850
[applause]
