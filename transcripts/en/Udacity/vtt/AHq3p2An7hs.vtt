[Norvig] And here is the answer. Look. It's only 1 line of code. Isn't that great?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What we did is we took the combinations function from itertools,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and that takes the combinations of a list taken n at a time.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So we go through the hand--and here we didn't even use the fact that the hand is 7 cards,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so it could have been 8 or 9 cards or whatever--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we generated all the combinations up from them 5 at a time

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and then we just took the maximum of that according to the hand_rank.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And that function does exactly the right thing and passes all the tests.
