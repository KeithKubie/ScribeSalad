about the positions or the background

space-time that an observer say like you

should be invariant under one state of

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:45.430
should be invariant under one state of

starts out with them as an assumption

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:49.720
starts out with them as an assumption
 

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.930
starts out with them as an assumption
and then they can actually get gravity

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:51.940
and then they can actually get gravity
 

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.370
and then they can actually get gravity
back from that assumption so that's the

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:56.380
back from that assumption so that's the
 

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.550
back from that assumption so that's the
way one way in which there
