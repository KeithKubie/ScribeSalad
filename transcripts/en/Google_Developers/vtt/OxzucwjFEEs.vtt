&gt;&gt;&gt; Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and
welcome. At this time, please take your seats.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:39.740
We shall begin in two minutes. We shall begin
in two minutes. At this time, as a courtesy

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:50.106
to our presenters, please make sure your cell
phones and any and all mobile devices are

00:00:50.106 --> 00:00:51.106
turned off at this time.
Thank you, good morning, and welcome. Please

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:52.106
take your seats.
(Pause).

00:00:52.106 --> 00:00:53.106
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome senior

00:00:53.106 --> 00:00:56.390
vice president, engineering, Vic Gundotra.
[ Applause ]

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:04.150
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Well, good morning.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.380
Looks like you're all very excited to be here.
Welcome to Google I/O.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.329
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You know, this year marks

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.999
our fourth year of this conference. And we
thought we'd begin by just reminiscing for

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:22.319
a few moments about how much we have accomplished
together.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:27.920
You know, you go back to 2008. That was the
first year we held Google I/O. Maybe some

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.810
of you were there at our inaugural conference.
[ Applause ]

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.459
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: That year, our opening keynote
focused on client, connectivity, and the cloud.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.189
Why, we recognized that this industry was
going through dramatic change, that mobile

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.899
phones, smartphones, and faster Web browsers
were changing the face of clients, and that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.810
connectivity was about to explode, both in
its availability, as well as its bandwidth.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.369
And that would allow us to build cloud-based
services that we could hardly have dreamed

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:05.270
of a few years ago. All that happened.
In 2009, on this stage, we rallied the industry

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.920
with the Chrome team to move the Web forward
under the banner of HTML5. And today, modern

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.470
browsers are better and faster because of
the work of this group of people.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.140
So thank you.
And then who could forget last year, when

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.410
we focused --
[ Laughter ]

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:34.700
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: That was a lot of fun. And
we want to thank all of you for making Android

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.580
the global phenomenon that it has become.
Of course, like Android, this conference,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.180
too, has gone truly global. We're very excited
about the 5,000-plus people that are in this

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.940
room. But this year, for the first time, we
did something new. We created viewing parties.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.880
We allowed developers to set up their own
viewing parties and stream this event live.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.330
And we have over 110 cities that have these
viewing parties set up.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.140
On the screen behind me at any moment, we
should get a sampling of what's going on around

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.200
the world live right now.
We have viewing parties in these 122 cities,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.670
including places like Cairo, where we have
over 1,000 people. It's 2:00 a.m. in the morning

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.030
in Cairo.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.710
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And so to the more than 10,000
people at the viewing parties and the many,

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:39.290
many thousands who are watching, who are watching
on YouTube, welcome to our conference.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.680
We're truly humbled by this worldwide enthusiasm.
We do recognize that you are sharing with

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.460
us your most precious resource, your time.
And so we hope the next two days are incredibly

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.010
valuable, exciting, and a lot of fun for all
of you.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.790
So let's get this show started. And to do
that, I'd like to introduce Hugo Barra, director

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.730
of Android product management, to kick off
the opening keynote.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.720
Hugo.
[ Applause ]

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:20.600
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Well, good morning, everyone,
and welcome to the Android keynote at I/O

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.320
2011.
Today, we have three things to talk to you

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:33.320
about: Momentum, mobile, and more.
Let's start with momentum. And I'll ask you

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.690
to follow me back in time for just one minute.
Do you guys remember this device?

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.960
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Of course you do.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.760
Well, this is the T*Mobile G1, the very first
phone we shipped over two and a half years

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:57.430
ago. And it holds a special place in our hearts.
Back then, there were many skeptics. What

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.570
did Google know? We had never been in the
mobile space or the operating system business.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.150
Well, from those humble beginnings of one
device and one carrier and one country, how

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.350
much progress have we made?
We have so many exciting news to share with

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.960
you today. So we made a quick video for you.
Let's have a look.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:37.050
[ Video. ]
[ Applause ]

00:05:37.050 --> 00:06:00.449
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: That's right. We're incredibly
thrilled to share with you today that we have

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.320
activated over 100 million Android devices
worldwide.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.760
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Thank you.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.960
And do you know what the most exciting thing
about this stat is? It's the fact that we

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:31.980
all did it together. 36 OEMs, 215 carriers,
and 450,000 Android developers all over the

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.240
world. Thank you!
[ Applause ]

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:47.210
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: There are now more than 310
Android devices in 112 countries. Talk about

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.300
choice!
And the best way to actually measure this

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.990
momentum is velocity. At Google I/O on this
stage last year, Vic shared with you that

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.040
we were activating 100,000 Android devices
every day.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:12.210
By August, that number had doubled to 200,000.
Then 300,000 in December. And today, we are

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.090
activating over 400,000 Android devices every
single day.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:24.190
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Now, there's a reason why you're

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:30.930
all here today. It's because you write software.
And most of you write Android apps.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:37.199
Well, thanks to your extremely hard work,
I'm excited to announce today that we've exceeded

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:42.300
the mark of 200,000 applications available
in Android Market.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:49.229
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: And of course what really matters

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:52.830
is that the quality of these applications
is phenomenal.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:59.479
CNN, Flixter, Fruit Ninja, Tap Tap Revenge,
Major League Baseball, Gun Brothers, Pulse,

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:07.240
and so many more. The world's most engaging,
useful, and entertaining mobile applications

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:13.990
are running on Android.
And the most important thing for you, Android

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:22.451
developer, is the tremendous growth in application
downloads. Here's some data: It took the Android

00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:29.389
ecosystem almost two years to see the first
billion application installs.

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:33.889
It then took just five months to get to the
second billion.

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:40.490
Well, today, we're seeing one billion downloads
in less than 60 days, and a total of over

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:47.560
four and a half billion application installs
from Android Market up until today, four and

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:53.500
a half billion application installs.
Android Market is seeing stronger, faster

00:08:53.500 --> 00:09:01.649
growth than ever.
And that reminds me to pause and once again

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:06.900
thank you, Android developer, for your amazing
support and hard work over the last two and

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.589
a half years. You have been truly phenomenal,
and the entire ecosystem is now being rewarded.

00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:17.790
So thank you, and thank you very much.
[ Applause ]

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:27.490
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: So this wraps up the section
about momentum of this keynote.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.890
And now there are two other parts: Mobile
and more.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:38.060
In mobile, we're going to cover the Android
platform and talk about some of the features

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.540
on our road map.
We're also going to show you two exciting

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:47.490
new services that we're announcing today.
And then we'll talk about more and give you

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:54.500
a preview of the future, where Android is
headed as an open platform and an open ecosystem,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:01.779
going, let's say, well beyond the mobile phone.
I'd like to welcome two people on stage, Anand

00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:07.899
Agarwala, from the Android product team, will
drive our demos today. And to talk about Android

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:11.640
platform, please welcome Mike Cleron, from
the Android engineering team.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:18.810
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: Thanks, Hugo.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:24.480
Well, we've been busy. Over the last two and
a half years, the Android team has already

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.080
shipped eight releases of the Android platform.
Today, I'm going to tell you what's coming

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.810
next.
First, we're announcing an upgrade to Honeycomb,

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:40.980
Android 3.1. We're rolling it out today, starting
with Verizon XOOM 3G customers. It's not been

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.020
very long since we first launched Honeycomb,
but we've managed to get a lot of nice user

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:50.410
enhancements into the 3.1 upgrade. Let me
show you a couple of them. First, people really

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:55.520
like the new task switcher we introduced in
Honeycomb. You can see it here.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.260
We figured if switching between a few tasks
was good, then switching between more will

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:05.430
be even better. We made it so you can scroll
through to see all of your most recent tasks.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.850
Remember that Android has true multitasking.
So some of these apps may really be running

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.360
and some may not. But the user doesn't need
to care.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.380
This is possible only on Android, because
we're using some unique technology that automatically

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:24.220
shuts down and restores applications transparently.
The system manages resources for you so you'll

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.149
never run out of memory and you'll never be
asked to quit in order to launch something

00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:32.060
else.
Next, remember the improved widgets we introduced

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.490
in Honeycomb? Let's look at the scrolling
GMail widget.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.640
That's pretty nice. But what if you get a
lot of mail?

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.070
Well, for that, we're taking widgets to the
next level.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:52.320
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: So as you can see, you can

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.890
now stretch widgets horizontally or vertically.
And if you're a developer and you've already

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.170
created a scrolling widget for Honeycomb,
you can upgrade it to be resizable with just

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:06.300
a few lines of XML.
In 3.1, we also put a lot of effort into upgrading

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:11.620
Droid's USB support. Android devices can now
act as USB hosts, which means you can now

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.779
do things like --
[ Applause ]

00:12:13.779 --> 00:12:20.420
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: Yeah.
So that means you can now do things like importing

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.860
photos directly from your digital camera to
your tablet.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:29.190
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: And because Android is now

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:34.830
a USB host, the OS also supports a ridiculous
number of USB input devices as well, keyboards,

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.379
mice, trackpads, joysticks, game controllers,
and more.

00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:46.800
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: So here you're about to see

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.959
Anand play, or, rather, attempt to play, Cordy
using a game controller.

00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:56.680
Okay.
[ Laughter ]

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:02.480
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: Okay, well, that was a brave
attempt.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:08.110
There's a lot more in 3.1. But let me move
on to some other platform news.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.730
It turns out that Android 3.1 is not just
for tablets. It's also coming to Google TV

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.390
this summer. This is great news for Google
TV users.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:23.730
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: It's great news for Google

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:29.040
TV users. And it gets better. Google TV will
also be getting the Android Market. So all

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.010
of you developers --
[ Applause ]

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:36.760
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: So all of you developers will
now be able to create apps for Google TV using

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.720
exactly the same SDK that you're using for
Honeycomb. Consumers who already have a Google

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.760
TV device will automatically get the upgrade
over the air. And there are new Google TV

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.550
products based on 3.1 coming from Sony, Vizio,
Samsung, and Logitech.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:55.500
If you want to hear more about bringing your
apps to Google TV, please check out the Google

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.140
TV session tomorrow here at I/O.
Let's look a little farther down the road.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.950
I'm also happy to announce the next major
Android release, Ice Cream Sandwich. And,

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:12.759
of course, to also debut the most important
part of any release, the new logo.

00:14:12.759 --> 00:14:17.089
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]

00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:25.490
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: All right. We're targeting
a Q4 launch for Ice Cream Sandwich. And in

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.050
many ways, this will be our most ambitious
release to date.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.860
Let me tell you about some of the themes behind
this release.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:37.570
First, choice. If I had to pick one word to
explain Android's phenomenal growth over the

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:42.399
past year, that word would be "choice."
Consumers really like choices. And with Ice

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:45.269
Cream Sandwich, we're going to make them really,
really happy.

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:49.950
Here's just a small sample of the range of
devices that we've powered by Android.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:57.160
So we have phones in every size and shape;
phones with keyboards that slide; phones with

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.769
keyboards that flip; phones with built-in
game controllers; tablets in every size from

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:07.210
seven inches to ten inches; even tablets that
transform into laptops. And who knows what

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.930
else is coming.
But in the end, we know that high-quality

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:15.570
apps are the lifeblood of Android. So our
top priority for Ice Cream Sandwich will be

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:21.209
to give app developers the tools they need
to deliver great experiences on all of these

00:15:21.209 --> 00:15:27.100
devices. We want one OS that runs everywhere.
Let me tell you how we're going to make that

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.360
happen.
To start, we're taking all of the good stuff

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.399
that we added to Honeycomb for tablets and
we'll make it available everywhere, on phones,

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:40.380
on tablets, on everything in between.
This includes the new holographic UI, the

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:47.670
new launcher, the new multitasking UI, richer
widgets, advanced applications, everything.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:52.000
Next, we're investing heavily in the application
framework. We want to insulate developers

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.079
from the differences between all of those
devices as much as possible.

00:15:56.079 --> 00:16:00.639
So we're adding new APIs to the framework
to help scale your UI across all these different

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:05.089
form factors. And we're adding intelligence
to components like the action bar. They'll

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:09.190
be able to reconfigure themselves to optimize
for the available space.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.060
We're also putting a lot of energy into our
development tools.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.260
Be sure to check out the Android tools talk
tomorrow at 3:00 for some exciting developments

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.180
there.
And last, but certainly not least, it will

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:27.200
all be open source.
[ Applause ]

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:35.070
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: Now, Ice Cream Sandwich is
not just about breadth. It's about depth,

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.639
too.
On Android, we're always looking to bring

00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:43.490
the latest technology to mobile devices. And
we've got some really cutting-edge stuff in

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.490
the works.
Anand is going to help me demo some of the

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:49.149
latest developments from Google's Technology
Extraction Team based in Roswell, New Mexico.

00:16:49.149 --> 00:16:52.630
[ Laughter. ]
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: For real.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:57.200
Basically, this technology can look at the
input from the camera and figure out where

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.459
your head is and even where you're looking.
It runs on the GPU, so it can do all that

00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:04.799
insanely fast. It can process 500 frames a
second.

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:09.740
So let's have some fun with that.
First, watch what happens as Anand moves his

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.740
head from side to side.
Because the software knows where he's looking,

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.470
it can update the 3D scene in real time to
match his perspective.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:26.569
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: Okay.

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:33.030
How about this? We cannot only detect where
Anand's head is but we also know where his

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:37.480
eyes, nose, and mouth are.
Now, Anand is a handsome guy, but there's

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.200
always room for a little improvement. So let's
fix him up.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:50.640
Okay. That's not really a good look. Maybe
something in the nose area.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.340
Okay. That's pretty unfortunate.
Maybe eyes a little smaller?

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.230
Wow. Okay.
[ Laughter ]

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:02.660
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: I think the lesson here is
not to attempt to improve on nature.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:10.250
Let's move on to something more practical.
We call it virtual camera operator.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.510
Let's say Anand and Hugo are together on a
video chat. The software can actually figure

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:18.920
out by itself who is speaking and will automatically
focus on the right person.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:25.940
Let's give that a try.
&gt;&gt;Anand Agarwala: Anand Agarwala So you can

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.130
see here as I start talking, it zooms in smoothly
to my face.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.840
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Then when I start talking after
a few seconds, the camera realizes that I'm

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.421
here and it's going to zoom in on my face
automatically.

00:18:35.421 --> 00:18:37.540
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Anand Agarwala: When I start talking again,

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.573
it zooms fluidly back to me with a smooth,
fluid back and forth transition.

00:18:40.573 --> 00:18:50.710
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: That's pretty amazing.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:55.280
And note that this is not just for fun. All
of this and more will be available as developer

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.340
APIs in Ice Cream Sandwich so all of you can
create great new experiences.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:05.169
That's just a quick peak at what's coming
in 2011 for the Android platform. We're really

00:19:05.169 --> 00:19:08.900
excited about moving Android forward and can't
wait to see what all of you will build with

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.070
it.
Thanks very much.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.100
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Mike Cleron: Hugo, back to you.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.550
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Thank you, Mike. Thank you,
that was great.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:23.299
So we had a little bit of fun with Anand.
We showed you a new dessert. And we talked

00:19:23.299 --> 00:19:29.549
about the importance of one Android OS everywhere.
We're now going to shift topics and talk about

00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:33.400
media.
Today, we're announcing a couple of new services

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.230
that we think you'll really enjoy. And to
talk about the first one, here is Chris Yerga

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:47.570
from the Android cloud services team.
&gt;&gt;Chris Yerga: Thank you, Hugo. Today users

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:52.110
can go to Android Market to get applications
as well as books.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.861
We added the books tab to Android Market back
in February of this year, and the way it works

00:19:56.861 --> 00:20:03.640
with books on Android Market, whether it's
from the Android Market Web site or from your

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:09.850
Android device, that book is instantly available
to read across all your devices.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:14.820
Now, we're able to do this because your book
purchase is tied to your Google account, not

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.840
to any specific device.
I'm happy to announce that we are bringing

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.850
this same experience to Android Market for
movies as well.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:32.540
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Chris Yerga: Starting today, users can rent

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:39.890
movies from Android Market and instantly stream
them via the cloud to their computers or to

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.650
their Android devices.
We have a selection of thousands of titles

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:50.460
available to rent, competitively priced starting
at $1.99. It's seamless and I am going to

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:56.289
walk you through it right now.
We are going to start off with Android Market

00:20:56.289 --> 00:21:00.580
on the Web.
So here you see the Android Market Web site,

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.010
and you will notice that the home page of
Android Market now shows featured content

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:09.030
from applications, books, and movies.
If we click into the movies section we will

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:15.630
be taken to the movies home page on Android
Market. And the movies home page shows featured

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:19.840
content, new releases, there's categories
to browse and of course search, and here at

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.150
the top left we have a section of top rentals
that shows the most popular rentals. So why

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:29.160
don't we pick one of those, The King's Speech.
Good choice. Something highbrow for this time

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.190
of day.
And the rental process is very easy. Simple

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.400
click on the "rent" button, confirmation dialogue
to complete your rental.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:43.640
Now, the way this works is that movies on
Android Market have a 30-day rental period

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.720
during which you can begin watching your movie,
and then once you have started watching, you

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.110
have 24 hours to complete viewing of your
movie.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:55.730
Now, I could view the movie right here on
the Android Market Web site, streamed from

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:59.210
the cloud, but the movies look terrific on
the tablet. So I would like to switch over

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:07.420
to the Xoom right now. And on the Xoom tablet,
we have a new movies application. And so you

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:12.190
see it there on the home page, when we tap
on the videos app, we're going to go in here,

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.770
and you will notice that the movie that I
just rented from the Web is now showing up

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:26.330
here in the movies application, ready to stream
in high definition to my tablet from the cloud.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:32.570
Now, I can't always stream videos live from
the cloud. The cloud feature is terrific,

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:37.299
but if I'm on an airplane and I don't have
data connectivity, I still want to be able

00:22:37.299 --> 00:22:42.490
to watch the movie I rented. We are able to
do this with a feature we call pinning.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:48.140
So we go in here and select a couple of these
movies and pin them to the device.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:53.890
What pinning means is that these movies will
then be automatically in the background, downloaded

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:58.410
to the device, so that when I do get on the
airplane, I will have my movie available and

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.881
ready.
But while those are downloading, why don't

00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:05.550
we back out and show what playback looks like
on the tablet.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:13.160
Pick a movie. Despicable Me. Good choice.
And so playback is terrific. This is a high

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.960
def experience. We can play and pause, jump
around to more interesting bits of the movie,

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:25.150
and all of these movies are available to play
both here on your tablet as well as on the

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:31.139
Web site. But we don't want phones to be left
out of the mix, either. So we're going to

00:23:31.139 --> 00:23:35.450
show you phones in a second as well. But before
we do, I want to show you that in addition

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:40.669
to playing back movies, we can also rent the
movies directly here from the tablet.

00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:45.170
So the shop link at the top takes you directly
to Android Market. Android Market, you will

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:51.610
notice, has a new movies tab, very similar
to the apps in books tabs with featured content,

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:58.380
best sellers, category browsing, et cetera.
Why don't we go ahead and look at something

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:02.830
from the featured carousel and pick something
to rent.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:06.880
And the rental experience on the tablet is
very similar to the one that you saw on the

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:13.390
Web. A quick tap on the rent button, confirmation
dialogue. And then once the rental is complete,

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:20.010
you will be able to watch your movie here
on the tablet or on the Web or on the phone.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:27.430
And so now I would like to switch over to
the phone, and show you the new movies application

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:34.919
there.
And so the movies application on the phone

00:24:34.919 --> 00:24:38.810
will show the exact same movies that we have
just rented, both from the Web and from the

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:43.590
tablet, ready once again to stream live from
the cloud to my device.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:51.159
So that is movies on Android Market. We made
it really easy for you to rent anywhere and

00:24:51.159 --> 00:24:54.990
watch anywhere.
We have a selection of thousands of movies

00:24:54.990 --> 00:25:01.490
available. And so I'd like to invite everyone
to go to market.android.com and try out our

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:06.380
new movies rental experience.
The tablet application that we showed you

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.270
is rolling out as part of our Honeycomb 3.1
update, that Mike mentioned earlier. That

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:18.490
is going out to Verizon Xoom 3G users starting
today. And the movies application on the phone

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:23.330
is going to be available to Android 2.2 devices
starting in a couple of weeks.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:28.160
Thank you very much.
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Thank you, Chris.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.470
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Chris just showed you how seamless

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:37.799
it is to rent a movie and then play it on
the Web, on your phone or on your tablet,

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:41.740
seamlessly.
We want it make it just as easy for you to

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:47.020
enjoy the content that you already own, from
any device, seamlessly.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:53.700
We just talked about movies. What's the other
type of content that we all really enjoy?

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.880
Of course you know the answer. To talk to
us about a new service from Google, here is

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.549
Paul Joyce.
[ Applause ]

00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:12.790
&gt;&gt;Paul Joyce: Thank you, Hugo.
Today we're introducing music beta by Google.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:19.860
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Paul Joyce: When you add your music to the

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:25.600
new service, you can listen on the Web, or
any compatible device. No wires, no painful

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.741
syncing.
Your music collection is stored in the cloud,

00:26:28.741 --> 00:26:35.520
so you can stop worrying about where your
songs are and start enjoying your music.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:41.200
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Paul Joyce: Perhaps you heard a rumor or

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:47.600
two so let me show you how it works.
This is music manager, a program for Windows

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.150
and Mac that helps you add your songs to the
new music service. You can select specific

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:59.220
folders, but if you pick your iTunes or Windows
Media Player library, all of your play lists,

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.830
play counts, and ratings are added along with
your songs.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:08.010
So let's jump to the browser. In a second
you will see the album view of my music library,

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:14.039
but I can browse by songs, artists, and genres.
Music on the Web is a full featured music

00:27:14.039 --> 00:27:19.799
manager with everything you would expect:
Search, info editing, ratings, and play counts.

00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:27.850
Let's go to the home view. It displays recently
played and recently added music.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:32.690
Now let's drill into the album detail view.
Love that transition. Just double-click on

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:43.340
a song and it plays right away.
All of my existing play lists are there on

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:49.580
the left and I quickly create new ones. Select
a couple songs, drag them over, and name the

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:55.880
play list.
When I create the IO Jams play list, it's

00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:02.130
available right away on all my devices, my
tablet, my phone, or any other computer.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:08.610
But to make creating play lists even easier,
we have a new feature. We can build a play

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:13.430
list automatically for you based on any song
you like. We call this instant mix.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:20.250
Let's say I am in the mood for some Earth,
Wind and Fire. Notice the search suggestions

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:26.050
that appear right away as you type.
Select a song, and instant mix selects 25

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:31.520
tracks from your library that go great together.
To do this, we look at artist similarity,

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:38.100
and unlike some other smart play list creation
tools, our model literally listens to your

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:43.490
music. With machine learning, we find similar
tracks based on how they sound to build a

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:47.150
truly ingenious mix.
[ Applause ]

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:57.601
&gt;&gt;Paul Joyce: So that's music beta on the
Web. Let's shift over to my mobile devices.

00:28:57.601 --> 00:29:09.860
So here is the latest version of Android music
app running on my tablet. This is the same

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.700
UI we shipped with the first Honeycomb release
and it looks really sharp.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:17.740
This is the 3D carousel, and we can switch
over to the artist's wall to highlight a few

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:24.029
other effects.
It's so cool when he does that.

00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:32.120
And of course it will show all my local music.
But there's one very awesome difference. This

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:37.039
app connects to the music service to access
all of my music in the cloud. And that means

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:42.330
I'll never have to use a cable to add music
again.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:47.590
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Paul Joyce: So let's switch over to the

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:54.350
play list view. Here are all my play lists,
including -- there they are -- the IO Jams

00:29:54.350 --> 00:30:00.130
play list and the instant mix we just created
on the Web. No wires, no painful syncing.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:06.520
It's all just available instantly.
Let's switch over to the album view. Having

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:12.190
all of my music available to me wherever,
whenever is extremely powerful. But for times

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:16.100
when I don't have a data connection on my
tablet or phone, we wanted to create an easy

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:20.950
way to enjoy your music off-line, too. And
we came up with two things.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:26.220
First, we cache music I have recently played.
So without doing anything, I have access to

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:32.220
a selection of songs when I am off line.
And second, I can select albums, play lists

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:37.440
and artists using the same make available
off-line feature that Chris showed you for

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.669
movies.
So let's switch over to the phone.

00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:47.860
The phone has the same capabilities we just
demonstrated. Cloud music access, off-line

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:54.250
caching. There's the 3D UI. Because it's exactly
the same application download.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:59.510
But when it's running on Froyo or Gingerbread
instead of Honeycomb, the UI is optimized

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:06.601
for the smaller screen. For example, in portrait
mode, navigation is more list driven and you

00:31:06.601 --> 00:31:12.140
can swipe to change views.
Like on the Web and tablet, I can create and

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:18.070
edit play lists or make an instant mix, and
they become instantly available everywhere.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:24.299
The best part, if I get a brand-new phone,
all I have to do is sign in, and my music

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:30.640
is right there right away.
[ Applause ]

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:51.860
[ Music ]
&gt;&gt;Paul Joyce: Didn't we play Shining Star

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:57.990
last year?
I guess that's my reminder to talk about availability.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:04.909
So we're really excited about this service.
It's launching in beta today, and we're going

00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:10.600
to roll it out in stages. Initially by invitation
only to U.S. users.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:19.100
You can add up to 20,000 songs to your library.
And at least while it's in beta, the service

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.419
is free.
[ Applause ]

00:32:22.419 --> 00:32:31.510
&gt;&gt;Paul Joyce: So all of you attending Google
I/O who are based in the United States will

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:33.710
get an invitation.
[ Applause ]

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:45.140
&gt;&gt;Paul Joyce: We thought you'd like that part.
You will receive an e-mail today with instructions

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:52.350
to get started. And if you are on the Webcast,
we invite you to visit music.google.com to

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:58.529
learn more details and request your invitation.
Finally, we're releasing the updated music

00:32:58.529 --> 00:33:05.990
app on Android Market today. Any Android 2.2
or higher device, download the new app and

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:10.570
it will work with music stored in your phone
even while you are waiting for an invitation.

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:16.470
So thank you. Back to you, Hugo.
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:21.640
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Thank you, Paul.
Thank you. That was awesome!

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:27.270
So Honeycomb 3.1, Ice Cream Sandwich, movie
rentals, and movies. How do you guys think

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:36.620
we are doing so far?
The kind of innovation that you saw here today

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:40.740
has been the driving force behind Android's
success.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:47.429
But of course that innovation only matters
if it can actually reach consumers.

00:33:47.429 --> 00:33:53.159
So today, we're announcing a founding team
of industry leaders, including many partners

00:33:53.159 --> 00:33:58.200
from the open handset alliance that Google
is going to work with on this.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:03.530
Together we'll create new guidelines for how
quickly devices will get updated after new

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:11.679
Android platform releases.
[ Cheers and Applause ]

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:14.270
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Thank you.
And for how long they will continue to get

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:16.029
updated after that.
[ Applause ]

00:34:16.029 --> 00:34:28.369
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: The founding partners are: Verizon,
HTC, Samsung, Sprint, Sony Ericsson, LG, T*Mobile,

00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:32.960
Vodafone, Motorola, and AT&amp;T.
[ Applause ]

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:39.999
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: And we're welcoming others to
join us, of course.

00:34:39.999 --> 00:34:46.649
To start, we're jointly announcing today that
new devices from these partners will receive

00:34:46.649 --> 00:34:52.889
the latest Android platform updates for 18
months after their first launch if the hardware

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:58.869
allows. And that's just the beginning. Stay
tuned in for more on this soon.

00:34:58.869 --> 00:35:02.209
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: We think -- Thank you.

00:35:02.209 --> 00:35:07.900
We think this is really great news for users.
It's excellent for developers, and it's really

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.499
great for the entire industry.
So let's move on.

00:35:12.499 --> 00:35:16.940
Let's transition now to the section about
more.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:21.839
Today we'd like to unveil some of the Android
team's vision for the future of computing

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:28.979
and applications. Think of it as a beginning
of the next Wave of Android.

00:35:28.979 --> 00:35:34.910
As an open platform, Android was always meant
to go well beyond the mobile phone, and today

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:40.450
we wanted to give you a little taste of that.
We want to enable developers to do a lot more

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:46.519
with Android, to write apps for new classes
of hardware, and why not? Even create their

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:50.109
own hardware.
And we want to do that in a way that takes

00:35:50.109 --> 00:35:56.701
the concept of openness to a new level.
I'd like to you meet Matt Hershenson and Joe

00:35:56.701 --> 00:36:02.829
Britt from the Android hardware engineering
team. They have been working on a few exciting,

00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:05.299
really cool projects that they want to talk
to you about.

00:36:05.299 --> 00:36:07.609
So Matt is going to get started, and Joe will
come after.

00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:14.160
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Matt Hershenson: Thanks, Hugo.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:19.489
As you heard earlier, there are over 300 Android
devices in the market. We know hardware developers

00:36:19.489 --> 00:36:25.569
would love to have a way to build accessories
that can work with any device from any manufacturer.

00:36:25.569 --> 00:36:29.799
Until now, that's been hard, but that's about
to change.

00:36:29.799 --> 00:36:34.890
Today, we're announcing Android open accessory.
We are adding platform support for hardware

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:40.109
accessories and a new API to talk to them.
Using these, you can build a wide range of

00:36:40.109 --> 00:36:44.380
accessories and they will work with any Android
device going forward.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.519
Let me show you a demo.
Everyone uses their phone for music at the

00:36:48.519 --> 00:36:53.150
gym but what if your Android device could
integrate more fully with your workout.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:59.380
This is an exercise bike made with Life Fitness
and it's compatible with open accessory. Anand

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:07.549
is going to get ready for a workout on it.
First, put on his head band. Most importantly,

00:37:07.549 --> 00:37:11.249
he has his Android phone. Now he is going
to dress for his workout.

00:37:11.249 --> 00:37:20.630
[ Cheers ]
&gt;&gt;Matt Hershenson: People go crazy for his

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.489
legs.
Now, watch what happens when he plugs the

00:37:24.489 --> 00:37:33.089
phone into the bike.
It recognizes the accessory, and it shows

00:37:33.089 --> 00:37:38.160
an application that knows how to talk to it.
If the phone didn't already have a compatible

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.900
app, the bike would just send the user to
the app in Android Market to download it.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:49.410
This is really cool! If a user buys an accessory
that needs an app, when they connect the phone

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:53.499
to the accessory, it just takes them where
they need to go to get that app.

00:37:53.499 --> 00:38:01.539
Okay. So Anand is now going to launch CardioQuest,
and then the exercise bike actually recognizes

00:38:01.539 --> 00:38:07.390
that it's been connected to the Android phone.
He is going to select an easy workout, and

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:12.990
then the API is actually going to have the
bike control the game that he is going to

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.609
play.
Now, see, as he pedals faster, he moves the

00:38:16.609 --> 00:38:21.319
Android guy up. He pedals slower, he moves
the Android guy down.

00:38:21.319 --> 00:38:33.380
Ohhhh. Whoa! One calorie, one calorie.
You do that a thousand more times, and you

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.839
can have one of those ice cream sandwiches
at the after party.

00:38:36.839 --> 00:38:39.289
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]

00:38:39.289 --> 00:38:47.119
&gt;&gt;Matt Hershenson: How do you think he got
those legs?

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:52.450
So you can check out the exercise bike and
actually play the game later on in the interactive

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.910
zone.
Today we're making the Android open accessory

00:38:55.910 --> 00:39:01.719
API available for Honeycomb and Gingerbread.
It supports USB now and Bluetooth support

00:39:01.719 --> 00:39:04.440
will come in the future.
[ Applause ]

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:11.759
&gt;&gt;Matt Hershenson: So it's not just about
software. It's about hardware, too.

00:39:11.759 --> 00:39:17.709
And we want to provide a complete solution.
So today, we're releasing the hardware and

00:39:17.709 --> 00:39:27.560
software for an Android open accessory reference
design. We're calling it the ADK, for Android

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:35.519
Accessory Development Kit. Here it is.
The ADK is based on Arduino, and a USB host

00:39:35.519 --> 00:39:37.009
--
[ Applause ]

00:39:37.009 --> 00:39:46.160
&gt;&gt;Matt Hershenson: It also incorporates circuitry
from a USB host from Circuits@Home, and I

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:52.969
think by the applause, people already know
Arduino is an open platform with tons of third-party

00:39:52.969 --> 00:39:57.269
hardware and software add-ons that developers
can use to develop Android accessories.

00:39:57.269 --> 00:40:02.430
The ADK isn't the only way. Microchip and
RT Corporation are each launching their own

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:05.809
open accessory compatible development boards
today.

00:40:05.809 --> 00:40:09.509
Let's take a look at one of these ADK boards
in action.

00:40:09.509 --> 00:40:14.699
Here we have a labyrinth game and we have
added two off-the-shelf servo motors to it,

00:40:14.699 --> 00:40:19.209
and those are hooked up to this ADK board.
The ADK board then is communicating to the

00:40:19.209 --> 00:40:23.690
tablet.
The tablet is running a simple app which sends

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:29.990
the accelerometer data over USB to the ADK
which is then controlling the tilt of the

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:37.819
labyrinth to match the tablet. All I need
to do, I tilt it to get the ball out; okay?

00:40:37.819 --> 00:40:46.130
So the object of the game is to tilt the platform
to make the ball follow the line and go all

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:51.299
the way to the end without falling into any
of the -- oh -- holes. You got to three. A

00:40:51.299 --> 00:40:56.089
little better than the calorie count but it's
clear you need practice at both.

00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:58.610
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Matt Hershenson: So we thought this little

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.739
labyrinth game was cool, was cute, like the
legs.

00:41:01.739 --> 00:41:04.809
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Matt Hershenson: But we wanted something

00:41:04.809 --> 00:41:10.690
a little bigger to match the success of Android.
We couldn't even fit it on the stage, but

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:13.430
we have a video.
Let's roll the video.

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:18.519
Android's been a huge success and we think
the ADK and Android open accessory will be,

00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:22.359
too.
This labyrinth was inspired by that. It weighs

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:29.479
about 5,000 pounds and is powered by a pair
of 200 volt 50-amp motors.

00:41:29.479 --> 00:41:33.170
It's all controlled by the Android tablet
hooked up through an ADK, much like the one

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:39.440
on stage.
If you want to learn more about Android open

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.550
accessory and the ADK and to learn how to
get started working on your own accessories,

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:49.469
please visit the session this afternoon at
1:15 or visit accessories.Android.com.

00:41:49.469 --> 00:41:59.979
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: So now you know what that giant

00:41:59.979 --> 00:42:05.910
covered object in the glass fenced area by
the escalator is. That's the super labyrinth.

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:09.999
The demo will be available for to you play
with. It's a ton of fun, after the keynote

00:42:09.999 --> 00:42:13.650
and for the next two days. Definitely check
it out. I predict there will be a big line.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:21.369
With the ADK, we are welcoming hardware developers
into the Android community, and giving them

00:42:21.369 --> 00:42:26.369
a path to building great Android accessories
quickly and easily.

00:42:26.369 --> 00:42:33.369
One important note. This program is completely
open. There are no NDAs, there are no fees,

00:42:33.369 --> 00:42:39.150
there is no approval process to build a hardware
accessory or write the software that goes

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:42.569
with it. So get started.
[ Applause ]

00:42:42.569 --> 00:42:52.440
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Step one is go to the interactive
zone where you will see a bunch of open accessory

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.119
powered accessories from our partners and
there's some great stuff there so check it

00:42:57.119 --> 00:43:00.569
out.
Now, Joe Britt is here, I believe, to talk

00:43:00.569 --> 00:43:06.329
to you about an even larger type of accessory.
Joe.

00:43:06.329 --> 00:43:15.069
&gt;&gt;Joe Britt: We want to go one step further.
What exactly is an Android accessory?

00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:19.999
We'd like to think of your entire home as
an accessory, or better yet, as a network

00:43:19.999 --> 00:43:26.009
of accessories, and think of Android as the
operating system for your home.

00:43:26.009 --> 00:43:31.440
We call this vision Android@Home.
At the center of the Android@Home architecture

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:37.549
is your Android device. We're extending the
Android OS to include new services that allow

00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:44.369
Android apps to discover, connect, and communicate
with appliances and devices in the home. We

00:43:44.369 --> 00:43:51.150
call this the Android@Home Framework.
For appliances that cannot connect to Wi-Fi,

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:56.729
we've designed an open, wireless protocol
that allows Android devices to talk to them.

00:43:56.729 --> 00:44:02.069
This new protocol enables very low-cost connectivity
with anything that's electrical in your home,

00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:08.099
such as lights, alarm clocks, thermostats,
dishwashers, et cetera.

00:44:08.099 --> 00:44:12.710
We want to think of every appliance in your
home as a potential I/O device for Android

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:15.190
apps.
So let's take a look at a couple of demos

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:19.509
of this stuff. Let's bring the stage lights
down just a little.

00:44:19.509 --> 00:44:23.019
And now, Anand, would you like to show the
audience the trick you just learned?

00:44:23.019 --> 00:44:29.890
&gt;&gt;Anand Agarwala: Yes, I would.
MMMMM, MMMMM, (Making noises).

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:35.400
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Joe Britt: Okay, okay. Anand is taking a

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:42.369
little theatrical license. What we just demonstrated
was a simple hello world type app on his tablet

00:44:42.369 --> 00:44:49.829
that displays a series of digital light switches.
Using the Android@Home framework, this tablet

00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:55.420
can talk wirelessly to these two floor lamps
so Anand can turn them on and off. The other

00:44:55.420 --> 00:45:00.699
two switches are linked to these super-bright
audience lights left and right. And Anand

00:45:00.699 --> 00:45:05.819
can also control them wirelessly.
Okay. Now that you know how to control the

00:45:05.819 --> 00:45:10.969
lights, you can let your imagination as a
developer completely take over.

00:45:10.969 --> 00:45:15.089
Imagine the new ways you'll be able to deliver
notifications. You can build an alarm clock

00:45:15.089 --> 00:45:18.809
app that slowly ramps up the lights in the
room and starts playing your favorite music

00:45:18.809 --> 00:45:24.359
through the stereo as the alarm time approaches.
Or imagine how your applications could tie

00:45:24.359 --> 00:45:26.920
in the calendar to automatically control home
devices.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:31.109
If you're a game developer, think about how
this functionality could make game play more

00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:36.900
immersive. Imagine using the Android@Home
framework to control an irrigation system

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.420
and enable a real-world Farmville app.
[ Laughter ]

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:45.880
&gt;&gt;Joe Britt: If you don't win the game, if
you don't win the game, then your garden dies,

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:49.269
right? So there's significant incentive to
do a good job.

00:45:49.269 --> 00:45:56.460
As a quick example of this idea, we hooked
the stage lights up to Quake. And so as Anand

00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.130
plays the game -- we'll see it up here on
the screen -- and fires shots, you'll see

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:04.900
these lights Flash. These are actually connected
to the game. It's communicated through Android@Home

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:09.569
and controlling these lights.
Okay, okay, you get the idea with that.

00:46:09.569 --> 00:46:16.849
So to bring this vision to reality, we're
partnering with several industry players.

00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:21.680
One I'd really like to mention is Lighting
Science, one of the world's leading LED lighting

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.469
technology manufacturers.
They'll start selling the first LED lightbulbs

00:46:26.469 --> 00:46:31.450
and switches for the Android@Home environment
for the end of this year. Prototypes of their

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:36.880
Android@Home-compatible bulbs are being used
here in these on-stage lamps.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:41.130
We also have a number of Android@Home-enabled
devices available for you to play with in

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.809
the interactive zone. So please stop by and
check them out.

00:46:43.809 --> 00:46:47.690
All right. I'm going to walk over to the other
side of the stage. The next thing I'd like

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:54.529
to show you is a totally new kind of Android
device. It's an Android@Home hub. It's both

00:46:54.529 --> 00:47:01.009
a stand-alone music beta end point and a bring
to the Android@Home network. We call it Project

00:47:01.009 --> 00:47:05.740
Tungsten. Let's take a look at a couple of
actual devices. These are our reference designs.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:11.930
All right. What we have here are two tungsten
devices. A tungsten device runs the Android

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:17.569
OS and the Android@Home Framework. It's always
powered on and always connected to the cloud.

00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:24.299
It has audio out. And these examples can connect
to either speakers or my home stereo system.

00:47:24.299 --> 00:47:29.049
So let's bring the stage lights down again
just so I can show you something else cool.

00:47:29.049 --> 00:47:34.059
If you hadn't noticed, they have these crazy
lights on them. And look at the shape of this

00:47:34.059 --> 00:47:40.140
thing. I know that Mike Cleron earlier mentioned
our Roswell extraction team. Well, I mean,

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:44.349
how could this be anything but alien technology?
All right.

00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:47.180
So we can bring the lights up a little bit
now.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:53.009
So what exactly do these do?
Earlier today, Paul showed you our music beta

00:47:53.009 --> 00:47:59.009
service on a phone and on a tablet.
Here, we have the same music service, but

00:47:59.009 --> 00:48:05.959
working with these new devices. So Anand,
let's turn up the volume on one of them.

00:48:05.959 --> 00:48:09.769
[ Music ]
&gt;&gt;Joe Britt: You can imagine that this device

00:48:09.769 --> 00:48:14.779
is playing music in, say, your living room.
If we take a look at the tablet Anand is using,

00:48:14.779 --> 00:48:19.289
we can see he's in the music app. But there's
a new feature to select an output device.

00:48:19.289 --> 00:48:24.609
The tablet can direct music to one or more
Tungsten boxes like the one we have here.

00:48:24.609 --> 00:48:30.480
Anand, why don't you start music on both of
them.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:36.059
You can enjoy your music synchronized throughout
your house, all streaming through Music Beta.

00:48:36.059 --> 00:48:40.969
When Anand tapped on those buttons, the music
stream was sent transparently from one box

00:48:40.969 --> 00:48:45.660
to another. Since the boxes are running Android,
they just pull the music directly from the

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:50.589
music library in the cloud.
All right. All this functionality that you've

00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:56.709
seen here is part of the Android@Home Framework.
And it will be completely open for developers

00:48:56.709 --> 00:49:01.362
to explore and write their own applications.
To give you an example of the kinds of applications

00:49:01.362 --> 00:49:06.109
we have in mind, we've put together a very
simple demo. This is actually another Tungsten.

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:10.439
It looks very different from those, but it's
another example of the device.

00:49:10.439 --> 00:49:14.739
So when we show you this example, I want you
to keep in mind this is just a conceptual

00:49:14.739 --> 00:49:22.910
example. It's not an actual product.
Imagine these CDs shipped with a Near Field

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:28.059
Communications inside the jewel case which
activates when you take off the packaging.

00:49:28.059 --> 00:49:32.589
He is going to take one of the CDs, run DMC
and touch it to this device.

00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:36.619
(chime)
&gt;&gt;Joe Britt: That chime means it's been added

00:49:36.619 --> 00:49:41.160
to my library, the entire CD.
[ Applause ]

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:47.420
&gt;&gt;Joe Britt: Thank you. If he touches it again,
it starts playing.

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:56.769
So that's pretty cool; right?
We could add another CD, like Santana, and

00:49:56.769 --> 00:50:00.270
start playing it.
[ Music ]

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:07.489
&gt;&gt;Joe Britt: Okay. Well, that's it for this
Android@Home preview.

00:50:07.489 --> 00:50:12.779
We hope that you can see how this combination
of new cloud services, software, and devices

00:50:12.779 --> 00:50:17.459
enables a whole new universe of applications.
You will hear a lot more about Android@Home

00:50:17.459 --> 00:50:20.799
over the next few months.
Thank you, guys.

00:50:20.799 --> 00:50:28.949
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Thanks, Joe. That was really

00:50:28.949 --> 00:50:32.859
fun.
I'll remind you that there's a lot of applications

00:50:32.859 --> 00:50:39.309
today doing crazy things, using location,
gyroscope, insane GPU graphics that most of

00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:45.349
us wouldn't have thought possible, even two
years ago. So what we're doing here is creating

00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:51.680
new possibilities with open accessory and
Android@Home with the expectation that your

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.270
imagination as a developer is really going
to make it flourish. There's going to be a

00:50:56.270 --> 00:51:00.109
lot more details coming on these shortly.
But we wanted to show you a quick preview,

00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:04.910
just a little taste for where the Android
team is going.

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:08.449
Let's do a quick recap.
We covered quite a lot today.

00:51:08.449 --> 00:51:16.449
In momentum, we talked about 100 million devices
and four and a half billion application installs.

00:51:16.449 --> 00:51:23.509
Then in mobile, we covered Honeycomb 3.1 for
tablets and also Google TV. We talked about

00:51:23.509 --> 00:51:30.239
Ice Cream Sandwich, the new Android platform
release, one Android OS everywhere. We talked

00:51:30.239 --> 00:51:36.039
about media in the cloud with movie rentals
and music both launching today.

00:51:36.039 --> 00:51:41.660
We also talked about a new industry partnership
to bring the latest Android innovation to

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:47.209
users faster.
And then we talked about more. We talked about

00:51:47.209 --> 00:51:53.019
Android Open Accessory, which you just saw,
and our vision for Android@Home devices and

00:51:53.019 --> 00:51:57.239
applications.
Was that almost too much for 51 minutes?

00:51:57.239 --> 00:52:06.269
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Now, there are some unbelievably

00:52:06.269 --> 00:52:12.589
cool Android devices coming out now and over
the next few weeks and months, with really

00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:19.680
interesting new form factors and awesome new
features. In fact, an example is this device

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:30.009
right here. This is the new Samsung 10.1 tab.
It's a great new device with a dual-core processor.

00:52:30.009 --> 00:52:37.829
It's got a super-sharp screen that's 720p
video capable. It's got dual-band Wi-Fi support.

00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:44.400
It's really slick. It's thinner and lighter
than you'd ever imagine.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:49.260
This device is going to launch in about a
month or so. So it's not available to anyone

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:58.460
yet, with one exception.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:05.789
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Thanks -- thank you -- thanks
to Samsung, all 5,000 of you are getting one

00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:13.390
today.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:25.150
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: So you'll be able to get your
device over the next couple of days. There's

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:27.890
no need to rush, including at the party tonight.
[ Laughter ]

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:33.089
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: This device comes with Honeycomb
3.0. And it will get Honeycomb 3.1, which

00:53:33.089 --> 00:53:36.479
is rolling out today, over the next couple
of weeks.

00:53:36.479 --> 00:53:43.410
We hope you enjoy this.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:49.039
&gt;&gt;Hugo Barra: Now, just a couple of quick
announcements.

00:53:49.039 --> 00:53:55.549
We've designed 22 sessions at Google I/O this
year specifically focused on Android development

00:53:55.549 --> 00:54:02.119
topics with in-depth content prepared and
delivered by Android engineers. So check those

00:54:02.119 --> 00:54:05.720
out.
And to see what the latest schedule is -- there

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:10.420
have been a few minor changes -- download
the Google I/O app if you haven't already

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:15.670
for your tablet or phone.
I should also tell you tomorrow at 10:45,

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:21.209
we're going to be making some Android Market
announcements of some user and developer features

00:54:21.209 --> 00:54:26.759
which I think you'll enjoy. So check that
out as well. It will also be on livecast.

00:54:26.759 --> 00:54:33.789
And lastly, let me just once again thank you,
Android developers, for your phenomenal support.

00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:37.759
I look forward to talking to you, most of
you or many of you, at the conference today

00:54:37.759 --> 00:54:42.660
and of course at the party tonight.
So thank you, and have a great Google I/O.

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:47.460
[ Applause ]
