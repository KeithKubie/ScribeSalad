00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.920
Would you excuse me a moment I have a
phone call to make and I left my phone in here

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.220
It's a number that I've been
calling quite a bit recently so it's

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.700
programmed into the phone

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.480
[PHONE RINGS]

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.900
Find the phone under your seat there
that's ringing

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.440
Okay

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.340
Would you like to

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.438
press the orange button please

00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:40.360
If you take the call and then use it as an

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.180
ordinary phone

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.540
Hold it up to your ear

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.380
Hello? Can you hear me on the phone?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.540
Quite clearly

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.960
Good. Can you tell me your name please?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.960
Maxwell Charles Lovell Hoare

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.580
Hello Maxwell. Have you ever used a cell
phone before?

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.280
No

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.240
Well, they're really rather

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.000
fun things

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.660
What I'd like to do is to
read you a couple of lines of poetry

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.540
little bit at a time and ask you to read
it back to me

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.960
Okay? You understand?

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.460
Here we go then "The mountain and the squirrel"

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.080
The mountain and the squirrel

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.440
"had a quarrel"

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.740
had a quarrel

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.600
"and the former called the latter"

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.100
and the former called the latter

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.960
"little prig"

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.320
little prig

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.940
Thank you very much

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.740
I'll tell you why I asked you to do that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.960
because there was once a very historic
demonstration of one of the very

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.940
earliest telephones that was made from
this desk at the RI and the words used

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.240
by Professor Tyndall, who operated it
that day, included that poem.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.990
He had it read back from the other end of the
telephone and I thought it'd be rather

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.980
nice to reenact that over the phone

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.700
Now if you have another look at the control board

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.630
on the phone you'll see just below
the orange dial there's one marked "End"

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.160
Okay?

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.200
So say goodbye first

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.600
Bye-bye

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.220
Bye-bye then.
If you press the button now that'll

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.380
disconnect the call thank you for
helping!

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.300
