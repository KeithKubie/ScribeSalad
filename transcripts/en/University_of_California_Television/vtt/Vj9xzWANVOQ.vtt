00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.919
(piano music)

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.490
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.890
bipedal, naked,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:15.923
large-brained,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.913
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.883
yet filled with optimism,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.683
we grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.293
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.940
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.693
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.150
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.220
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.483
and how we got here.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.950
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.693
of humans like you.

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.675
(musical tones)

00:01:27.494 --> 00:01:30.077
(upbeat music)

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.790
- So the idea that women have evolved

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.000
to be plant gatherers and men hunters

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.550
has dominated evolutionary thinking

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.950
in the popular imagination for decades.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.940
It's been suggested that
men are better navigators

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.860
than women as a result of a long history

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.220
of natural selection on hunters

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.660
who can pursue mobile prey
across vast landscapes

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.320
without getting lost.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.080
Men are thought to be more
cooperative than women

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.620
because throughout our
evolutionary history

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.780
they've needed to work together

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.220
to bring down hunted prey
much larger than themselves.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.690
Men's hunting is argued to
have driven the evolution

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.010
of our two-legged gait,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.030
supplied the nutritional advantages

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.370
and protein and fat to support

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.030
our energetically-expensive brain

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.180
and given our juveniles the luxury

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.810
of a long pre-reproductive
life of relative leisure

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.260
in which they can take the time to learn

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.823
all the skills of adulthood.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.930
Although it's widely recognized
that women's gathering

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.780
is usually the more reliable contributor

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.400
to family subsistence,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.920
we also tend to think
that men's hunting must be

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.640
on the whole more productive

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.540
than women's foraging

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.713
because they often take
very large animals.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.640
Some have even argued that the
origins of the nuclear family

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.180
where men and women
cooperate in different tasks

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.240
lie in the evolutionary origins

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.470
of female specializing in childcare

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.100
and depending on a
man's hunting production

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.420
in order to feed her children.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.850
The generalization that men
tend to hunt and women gather

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.620
holds for some well-known
contemporary hunter-gatherers.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.650
So among the Hadza in
Tanzania for example,

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.480
women primarily gather plant foods,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.520
lower-quality small-packaged food items

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.700
high in carbohydrates.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.810
And men typically spend their time hunting

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.870
acquiring higher-quality large-packaged

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.510
food items high in protein and fat.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.430
Similarly among the Juǀʼhoansi
in Botswana and Namibia

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.920
and the Ache in Paraguay,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.700
women specialize almost entirely

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.813
on plant-based foods while men hunt.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.250
However this is not a universal pattern.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.010
There is a great deal of variation

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.170
among hunter-gatherers
in the extent to which

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.360
women do specialize on plant foods.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.240
And many hunter-gatherer
women do acquire animals.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.230
There's the Ata, the Ainu, and the Dene

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.120
where women hunt deer.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.720
The Cree where women
hunt caribou and geese.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.190
Central African Aka women

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.420
hunt for duikers and forest pigs.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.500
Mixed-gender communal hunts for rabbits

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.760
were common among the Shoshone,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.680
and Paiute women hunted and in many cases

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.253
still hunt ground
squirrels and prairie dogs.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.010
Australia is another place

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.660
that challenges our understanding

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.220
of who hunts and why.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.410
Across Australia pre-historically women

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.010
were active hunters.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.230
They had a primary focus
on the hand capture

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.140
of small to medium-sized animals.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.690
And in many locations,

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.280
women skillfully used
fire and hunted with dogs

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.180
to improve their efficiency.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.890
For example, Phyllis Kayberry

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.150
found Walmajarri women
in the Kimberly in 1935

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.980
were using dogs to hunt
kangaroo and monitor lizards.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.230
And she suggested that
the family was dependent

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.670
on the woman's efforts to a greater extent

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.120
than on those of her husband.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.620
In the 1950s, Jane Goodall also found

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.170
that Tiwi women were active
and productive hunters.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.230
And she too characterized women

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.160
as the most consistent providers

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.470
not only of plant foods,
but of meat as well,

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.553
especially meat from small animals.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.710
People I work with, Martu.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.750
Martu women of Australia's Western Desert

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.600
too are hunters more than anything else.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.670
On any given day between about 60 to 70%

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.580
of the bush food that's produced
is from women's hunting.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.490
Women take more than half of the perentie.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.440
This is one of the largest
species of monitor lizard,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.983
aside from the Komodo dragon.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.070
Women also take a little more
than half of the feral cats.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.370
Feral cats spread into the desert

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.590
starting about 100 years ago

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.090
and were readily adopted
as prey by Martu hunters.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.500
Women will take about 20% of the bustards

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.770
and 6% of the kangaroos.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.670
So bustards are the largest
flying bird in Australia

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.330
and males can weigh up to 20 kilograms.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.030
Kangaroo are the largest
endemic non-human in Australia

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.700
and weigh up to 80 kilograms.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.290
So these are large for Australia,

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.960
not for Africa, but for Australia.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.390
The staple prey of Martu women

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.980
are the smaller sand monitor lizards,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.797
sometimes called goanna.

00:05:40.797 --> 00:05:42.740
And they acquire more than 80% of them.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.210
They're easily the most abundant

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.480
large vertebrate in the desert.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.930
They weigh about half a kilo.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.210
Women hunt them in two
ways which vary seasonally.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.070
In the hot summer months
they track the monitors

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.340
on the surface hoping to chase them

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.430
to trees or corner them in the open

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.540
to avoid having to dig
them out of their dens.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.150
In the winter the monitors
are denned most of the time

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.170
and they have to be dug out.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.300
So to accomplish this and also to aid

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.670
in the search for fresh dens,

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.310
women burn the spinifex grass

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.303
that obscures the tracks and signs.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.210
Women often cooperate with each other

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.840
in sand monitor and perentie hunting.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.540
So they work together to
burn an area for hunting

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.130
to locate tracks and dens

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.863
and then to extract the animal.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.830
Now the most important thing nutritionally

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.160
about a monitor lizard is not the meat,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.380
it's the fat.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.470
So lizards become dormant
in the cool season.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.840
They lay down about 10 to
20% of their body weight

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.340
in the form of large fat
bodies in the abdomen and tail.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.940
And most people say a skinny lizard

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.950
isn't actually worth eating.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.510
So women really pride themselves

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.913
on being able to find
and capture fat ones.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.060
Now while Martu women do a lot of hunting,

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.830
they also do most of the collecting too.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.740
So they produce nearly
100% of things like roots,

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.280
98% of insect larva, 90% of the fruit,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.833
a lot of the nectar and
about 30% of the honey.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.500
Now in comparison,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.290
men are looking for small things.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.180
About 30% of the time
they're out foraging,

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.780
but most of the time they prefer to search

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.410
for the larger animals like
emu, kangaroo and bustard.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.680
And rather than hunting
cooperatively like women,

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.193
they primarily hunt alone.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.430
Now the social context of hunting

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.850
is similar to what you might see

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.450
in any hunter-gatherer society.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.230
So women leave the residential camp

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.440
in a group of other women,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.890
often with children along.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.040
They establish what
they call a dinner camp.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.080
They acquire food.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.410
They return to that
temporary dinner camp to cook

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.830
and consume food socially,

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.430
and then they return
to the residential camp

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.840
at the end of the day.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.590
So the question that I'm
gonna to start off with

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.583
is why are women hunting?

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.220
So traditionally, if we
think about men's hunting,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.940
the goals of men's hunting

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.960
are explained usually in one of two ways.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.930
So either men are hunting in order

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.680
to provision a nuclear family

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.260
or men are hunting to show off their skill

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.300
and attract alliances and
favorable attention from women.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.430
In many cases, the kinds
of hunting that men do

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.900
don't appear to be well-designed
to provision others.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.850
And when men focus almost
solely on large animals,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.250
they sometimes run the risk
of coming home empty-handed

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.400
especially in more arid
environments such as this one

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.610
where animals are patchy and
very infrequently encountered.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.070
So per hour spent hunting,

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.970
a kangaroo hunter does tend
to average a higher return

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.390
than a monitor lizard hunter

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.240
taking home over a kilo of meat,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.290
while a sand monitor hunter

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.983
gets only 1/3 of that.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.650
But the meat from larger animals,

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.190
kangaroo, bustard, and that sort of thing

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.050
comes in only very infrequently

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.020
about once and in every five hunts.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.340
And although the average is higher,

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.150
there are often many days when nothing

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.310
is acquired by any hunter.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:37.950
So in comparison, women's hunting

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.510
is much more reliable than men's.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.440
They don't have as many big bonanzas,

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.290
but they also don't have as many days

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.180
with less than they might need.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.090
Men only end up out-producing
women on 25% of days.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.640
And on 37% of days no men are successful

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.380
at hunting any type of game.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.180
Fully 1/3 of these meat droughts

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.900
are between about three
and six days in duration.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.280
And for women in comparison,
failure is less than 5%

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.360
and they don't have any meat droughts.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.810
So even though larger animals
have a higher mean return,

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.620
in reality, this obscures the fact

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.100
that men's production comes in the form

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.000
of these periodic huge bonanzas

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.310
and long meat droughts

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.373
rather than a steady daily stream.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.410
The meat from larger animals
is also distributed widely.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.890
The hunter keeps only
about 10% for himself

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.100
and his own family.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.420
After sharing, the returns
to a hunter's family

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.550
in terms of the grams of meat
per hour hunting is the same,

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.363
regardless of what kind of
animal has been acquired.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.070
Now if women's hunting is more reliable

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.520
and provides similar payoffs

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.330
to family consumption when successful

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.710
as does men's hunting,

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.440
then it might suggest maybe

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.070
that the goals of foraging for
men and women are different

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.060
that men might be hunting
to show off their skill

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.330
and attract alliances
and favorable attention,

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.780
while women are foraging simply

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.540
to feed themselves and their families.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.810
So women hunt more
reliable smaller animals

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.560
and they trade off this
reliability with larger harvests

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.270
because reliability is a better way

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.780
to reduce the risks of going hungry.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.250
So it might suggest something
like men hunt to share

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.583
and women hunt to eat.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.060
Men use the hunting and
sharing of highly-valued meat

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.830
to engage themselves in
these political arenas

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.450
of social competition and social support.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.100
And kangaroo hunting by men
is an overtly political game

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.460
where young men hunt
for public consumption.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.860
They donate their labor to gain the trust

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.410
that's required to gain access

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.320
to deeper levels of ritual secrets

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.240
which are very important for men.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.920
They work to provide meat for all,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.140
especially in-laws and potential in-laws

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.540
without any material reward

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.160
in order to gain the trust of older men

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.810
who guard the way that
secret ritual knowledge

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.520
is transferred and gained.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.630
So a man who demonstrates willingness

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.180
to work for the public good

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.950
is trusted with more ritual secrets

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.350
and he can rise in the ritual hierarchy.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.900
A man who demonstrates willingness

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.920
to work for his in-laws

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.560
was traditionally trusted
with the opportunity

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.823
to marry their daughter.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.020
Hunting for men is as
much about assuring trust

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.360
and cooperation in the
distribution of meat,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.350
as it is about showing off
skill and acquiring meat.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.250
When men talk about the
benefits of hunting,

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.740
they emphasize that they hunt to share,

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.600
they don't hunt eat or
favor their own children

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.013
and families over others.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.440
If men hunt to share,

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.310
do women then hunt only
to feed their families?

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.690
When you hunt with Martu women

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.730
what puzzles you the
most is not the hunting,

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.320
it's actually the sharing.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.180
So more than 70% of the time

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.680
women's harvests of small animals

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.620
are shared well beyond their own families.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.470
And on an astounding 23% of lizard hunts

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.660
a successful hunter will
take nothing for herself.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.120
she gives it all away either
to her own family members

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.630
or other people sitting
around the cooking fire.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.337
When women share, they often
exchange identical lizards

00:11:41.337 --> 00:11:42.860
and the hunter will always give away

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.780
the largest prey to someone else.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.410
Lizards are shared to others
who have already eaten.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.210
In this video, the hunter returned late

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.000
and she's the last to
cook and share her harvest

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.030
and she gives away
nearly the entire harvest

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.400
to other women and men in the group.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.570
She keeps only the bottom
half of one for herself.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.840
One of the women that
cooperated with her hunting,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.100
she receives three lizards
in the initial divisions.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.120
She passes two to those sitting behind her

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.600
and one to the woman on her left.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.180
And the hunter passes one to her husband.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.260
Things are transferring back and forth.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.600
And ultimately, out of a
harvest of six large lizards,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.269
each hunter received less than 8%.

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:18.160
And all of the non-hunters got portions

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.050
that were actually bigger than each

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.120
of the hunter's portion.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.990
And the goal in this distribution

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.640
was to make sure everyone present

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.790
around the fire had an equal-sized portion

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.083
and nobody went hungry.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.350
Not only do women share
extensively with each other,

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.350
they share in ways that don't
make sense economically.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.110
So women often exhibit a
producer's disadvantage in sharing.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.170
So when you have a
producer's disadvantage,

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.220
the size of the portion the hunter,

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.440
the producer keeps,

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.260
is smaller than the
average size of portions

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.730
given away to those that
didn't participate in the hunt.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.890
And the usual cross-cultural pattern

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.520
is for producers to take an advantage

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.330
to compensate themselves
for paying the cost of

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.920
going out and acquiring
the food item, right?

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.240
They usually keep a portion that's bigger

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.020
than any of the portions that
are given out to non-hunters.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.920
But when Martu women hunt small animals

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.040
like monitor lizards,

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.570
they often keep a smaller
individual portion

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.950
than the average portion size

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.750
given to a non-hunter or family member.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.620
And we don't see this pattern for men.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.170
When men share small animals,

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.810
they'll take the producer's advantage

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.670
and they'll keep a larger
portion for themselves.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.750
Women compared to men also
give away more portions.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.350
Given an average-sized harvest,

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:28.640
women will give out more than twice

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.660
as many portions as men.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.570
They usually give out around six

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.810
compared to men who give out two.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.610
Because they give out
more portions than men

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.770
their average portion size
is a little bit smaller,

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.030
but they prevent the portion size

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.000
of becoming too small
by stinting themselves

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.583
in favor of feeding others.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.680
Now the cost that the hunter pays

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.120
doesn't seem to be balanced
by shares coming in.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.660
So a successful hunter gets
significantly less from others

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.300
than an unsuccessful hunter

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.440
or someone who didn't hunt at all.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.660
So that the hunter who acquired the most

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.710
often takes home the
smallest share of meat

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.760
after all sharing has been accounted for.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.080
So women are way too
generous with small prey

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.650
than we might expect
if we're thinking about

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.650
sort of the simple economics of sharing.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.820
It's also the case that in the sharing

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.950
women are not just sending

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.140
those larger shares to family members,

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.510
stinting their own consumption in favor

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.880
of their children or their close kin.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.110
Women also share widely beyond
their own kinship network

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.770
and they also share mainly to other women.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.310
So this is a network of
sharing relationships

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:34.110
between people who made
dinner camps with each other.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.860
The circular nodes, the circles are women.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.350
The squares are men.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.810
And the color corresponds
to the kinship clusters

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.670
in the bottom diagram.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.990
Those are the four, five
major kinship clusters

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.130
in the community.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.550
The ties between each of the nodes

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:53.023
are those who had shares of
meat passing between them.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.990
Sharing cross cuts kinship ties

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.330
and it brings together women

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.543
from all kinship clusters
in the community.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.480
So our hypothesis that women are hunting

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.990
to provision their families
seems poorly supported.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.650
Why hunted at all if
it's only going to share,

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:08.860
if you're only going to share most of it

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.240
to unrelated dinner camp members.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.300
Martu themselves suggest
that one of the main reasons

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.650
that women hunt is to acquire meat

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.010
to share with other women.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.520
When Martu women talk about hunting

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.280
they describe their underlying motivation

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.640
as hunting to share.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.970
This is especially the case for women

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.180
who are known as murtilya, good hunters.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.280
Anyone can gain the
status of a good hunter,

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.750
but to be a murtilya, you
don't simply produce more,

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.400
you also share more of that
production with others.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.597
So as one hunter put it, "When
a murtilya goes out hunting,

00:15:33.597 --> 00:15:35.517
"she has a good feeling that
she's going to get so much

00:15:35.517 --> 00:15:37.097
"and be able to feed others.

00:15:37.097 --> 00:15:38.847
"Good hunters always think
that when they go out

00:15:38.847 --> 00:15:40.557
"and it helps them to hunt better.

00:15:40.557 --> 00:15:41.877
"When a really good hunter goes out,

00:15:41.877 --> 00:15:42.877
"she gives so much away

00:15:42.877 --> 00:15:45.267
"and takes home only a
small piece for herself,

00:15:45.267 --> 00:15:48.167
"but she will always walk
away feeling pukurrpa."

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.690
Pukurrpa is what women see
is the reward for murtilyas.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.020
So pukurrpa means generally
warmth and happiness.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.570
But it's a happiness that's the product

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.940
of generosity that binds people together.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.370
Without generosity, you
feel you're not in a family,

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.060
you're just for yourself
not for everybody,

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.590
you don't share things.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.160
According to Martu, good hunters share

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.700
in order to demonstrate their commitment

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.000
to building family and
contributing to the public good.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.020
and this is the kind of sharing

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.900
that we would experience
around the dinner table.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.190
It's the sharing that
cements social relationships

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.500
that feeds and nourishes,

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.253
but treats everyone like family.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.230
Theoretically, we know that the generation

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.470
of warmth and trust or
demonstrating generosity

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:24.870
tends to have substantial effects

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.150
on the likelihood of cooperation.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.820
And there's been quite a
bit of experimental work

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.820
suggesting that people
tend to cooperate with

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.240
and trust more of those
who demonstrate generosity.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.920
And this suggests that one
reason women share so widely

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.890
may have something to do with

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.630
their cooperative social networks.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.240
Martu women are more than twice as likely

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.730
as men to hunt cooperatively.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.040
And for some hunting activities

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.600
more than 40 times
likely to be cooperative.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.970
Women also cooperate in childcare, cooking

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.650
and other daily activities in ways

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:52.210
that cross cut their
residential group memberships.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:53.310
Older and younger women,

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.760
even those from different hearth groups,

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.550
will team up to cooperate in childcare

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.720
and different forms of foraging

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.110
and subsistence activities,

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.100
dividing their labor
so that some will hunt

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.293
while others collect.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.490
One of the most frequent
forms of cooperation today

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.760
is in small animal hunting.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.270
So this is a small animal
cooperative hunting network.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.690
Hunting partners help each other out

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.780
in tracking, digging
and searching for prey.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.110
They usually pool their catch.

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.350
Again the same sort of colors

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:16.710
are indicating the kin groups.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.240
And it turns out that women who are

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.600
more generous on average,

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.420
but not those who are the
necessarily the best hunters

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.390
are more central in this
cooperation network,

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.750
meaning they have more partners

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.710
and they have more partners
who are also more generous.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.250
So this supports the hypothesis

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.270
that one of the main
reasons that women share

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.630
is to foster more
cooperative relationships

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:35.623
with other women.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.460
So this story of women's
hunting in desert Australia

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.250
gives us a much different picture

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.910
of the goals of hunting and
its associations with gender

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.250
than we've generally gotten
from another hunter-gatherers.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.380
It breaks a lot of our assumptions

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.550
about who hunts and why.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.970
Foraging women can be
efficient hunters and trackers,

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.080
and small animal hunting can be

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.780
just as productive and more reliable

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.120
than large animal hunting.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.040
Women can even specialize on small animals

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.470
if it's reliable enough.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.110
Women can support a number of others

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.820
from their hunting
efforts, not just children,

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.760
and can engage with others as cooperative,

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.230
political and social agents
outside of the spousal union.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.660
Women could share meat outside
of their immediate families

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.980
and draw on those ties
created through meat sharing

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.140
to engage in other cooperative endeavors.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.390
Women can form divisions
of labor with other women

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.920
and in so doing, collaboratively (groans),

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.170
collaboratively both care

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.690
and provision dependence with meat

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.310
independently of men.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.880
So a model of the origins of
human hunting and sociality

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.320
based on women's acquisition
and sharing of small animals

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.670
I think is at least as plausible

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.770
if not more so than models based on

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:38.250
men's hunting of big game

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.880
and women's dependence on
men's hunting production.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.279
Thank you.
