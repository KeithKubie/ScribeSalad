&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.130
&gt;&gt; The "arraignment,
trial, and condemnation

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.490
of Captain William Kidd" is
from our trials collection,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.900
which is part of the Law
Library's rare book collection.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.450
We have digitized a subset
of the trials collection

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.270
that concern trials involving
piracy and that collection,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.890
including this trial,
is available on law.gov.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.910
Captain Kidd was found guilty
of murder and multiple counts

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.060
of piracy in trials held in
London, England, in 1701.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.990
This particular report
indicates that it is by J. Nutt.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.570
John Nutt was a printer
and bookseller who operated

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.680
out of the Savoy in London,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.120
which was a structure
situated along the Strand

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.150
until it was razed in
the early 19th Century.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.920
Little is known about John
other than that he passed away

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.510
in 1716, but his wife
successfully carried

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.100
on with the family's printing
business after his death.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.080
While the trial appears
cut and dried,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.900
the story behind
it is anything but.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.260
Captain Kidd has often
been referred to as

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.420
"The Unlucky Pirate," but
based on research done

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.970
since his death, he may not
have been a pirate at all.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.700
Kidd was born in Scotland,
but moved to New York

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.710
in the latter 1600s,
and was quickly accepted

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.600
by the society there, especially
so after marrying a rich widow.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.250
He even was friends with
the Earl of Bellomont,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.220
who would later become
the colonial governor

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.110
of New York and Massachusetts.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.170
Rather than depend on
his wife's fortune,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.700
Kidd became a privateer
on behalf of England.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.810
Privateers are private citizens
who are granted "Letters

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.280
of Marque and Reprisal," or
passes by a country's government

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.660
that allows them to attack

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.170
and capture any enemy
ships during wartime.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.940
As England was fighting
France at that time,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.230
Kidd was given a letter
of marque allowing him

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.980
to capture any French or
pirate vessel he found.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.250
Kidd was largely an unsuccessful
privateer, and by 1698,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.350
he was having difficulty with
both his crew (which wanted

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.520
to attack any ship,
no matter its origin)

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.240
and his ship (which was
practically falling apart).

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.690
In fact, Kidd's murder charge
stems from a fight he had

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.780
with William Moore,
a gunner on his ship,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.920
regarding Kidd not ransacking
a becalmed Dutch ship (as Dutch

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.550
ships were not covered
by his Letter of Marque).

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.280
These events were popularized
by a folk song published

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.930
in the early 1700s called
"The Ballad of Captain Kidd,"

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.100
which stated that Kidd,
quote "murdered William Moore

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.070
and laid him in his gore," end
quote, but the actual events,

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.600
as detailed in the trials,
appear to be much less bloody.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.660
Kidd argued (and his witnesses
supported his statements)

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.540
that Moore was actively
fomenting a mutiny,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.470
and was threateningly
sharpening a chisel when he

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.590
and Kidd began to fight.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.250
During the battle, Kidd hit
Moore in the head with a bucket,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.150
which ultimately led to
Moore's death a day later.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.200
Finally, in 1698, Kidd and his
crew captured a large ship named

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.070
the Quedagh (or Cara) Merchant,
which was flying a French flag

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.610
and transporting goods under
passes from the French,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.610
French East India Company.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.320
The captain of the ship,
however, was English,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.260
and argued with Kidd to
return the ship and its goods.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.250
Kidd and his crew believed that
any ship working with passes

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.100
from the French East India
Company was, by association,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.030
French, and so they did not.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.190
All the iterations of the
East India Company were quite

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.940
politically powerful,
so it is no surprise

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.400
that when word got
back to England,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.230
Kidd was branded a pirate,

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.170
and a warrant was
issued for his arrest.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.730
He sent word to his friend and
investor, the Earl of Bellomont,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.110
that he was falsely accused.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.040
Bellomont convinced Kidd
come to Boston with his proof

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.620
that he had a letter of marque

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.760
and that the Quedagh Merchant
was a French East India ship.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.870
Unfortunately for Kidd,
Bellomont had made a deal

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.880
with England to return Kidd, so
Kidd was imprisoned in Boston

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.990
for two years, and then was sent
back to England to stand trial.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.790
In the meantime, the proof Kidd
sent, had sent ahead was "lost."

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.150
In the trial documents we
have, you can see Kidd pleading

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.900
for assistance of counsel

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.610
and for the evidence he
had previously provided,

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.910
unfortunately to no avail.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.710
As such, he goes on
to defend himself.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.260
In the murder trial,
he argues that he acted

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.140
in self-defense when
he struck Moore.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.450
With regard to the charges
of piracy, Kidd again pleads

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.070
with the court to
provide the French passes,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.920
and when they cannot be found,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.170
he attempts to cross-examine the
witnesses regarding the passes,

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.070
and have evidence
submitted in that way.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.350
His attempts at defense are
not successful, however,

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.350
and he was ultimately
found guilty of murder

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.040
and piracy, and executed
in 1701.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.770
Interestingly enough, in
1910, a scholar claimed

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.050
to have found Kidd's
"lost" proof

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.630
in the British Public Records
archives, casting doubt

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.570
on his long-standing
characterization as a pirate.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.510
