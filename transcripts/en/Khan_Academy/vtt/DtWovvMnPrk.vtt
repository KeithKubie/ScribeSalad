00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.307
- [Voiceover] The plot
below shows the amount

00:00:02.307 --> 00:00:05.952
of trail mix in each
of four camper's bags.

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:06.812
So let's look at this.

00:00:06.812 --> 00:00:09.110
We see there's a dot
for each camper's bag,

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.688
and it tells us that there's one bag

00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:13.290
that has this much trail mix,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.252
one bag that has this much trail mix,

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:17.806
two bags that have this much trail mix.

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:19.175
If the total amount of trail mix

00:00:19.175 --> 00:00:21.415
in all of the bags were redistributed

00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:23.969
so that each bag contained an equal amount

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.408
of trail mix, how much trail mix

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:28.531
would be in each bag?

00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:29.926
All measurements are rounded

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:32.584
to the nearest eighth of an ounce.

00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:34.848
So right now the bags,
there's different amounts

00:00:34.848 --> 00:00:37.065
depending on which bag you look at.

00:00:37.065 --> 00:00:38.853
But they want us to redistribute it.

00:00:38.853 --> 00:00:40.165
So what we really wanna do is think

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.011
about let's take all of the trail mix

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:44.553
in the four bags together,
and then divide it

00:00:44.553 --> 00:00:47.211
by four so that they
all have an even amount.

00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:48.628
So let's just think
about how much trail mix

00:00:48.628 --> 00:00:51.366
we have in these four bags together.

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.329
So we have this bag right over here,

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.121
and it has this amount.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.860
And let's see, it says
rounded to the nearest

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.549
eighth of an ounce.

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:58.675
Are these eighths?

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:01.883
Let's see, this is one, two, three, four,

00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:03.324
five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:06.747
Yep, so between two and three is divided

00:01:06.747 --> 00:01:08.304
into eight sections.

00:01:08.304 --> 00:01:10.404
So each of these hash marks are an eighth.

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:13.145
So this is 2 1/8, 2 2/8.

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:15.664
So this is 2 2/8.

00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:19.681
Now 2/8 is the same thing as 1/4.

00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:22.339
You can divide two by
two and eight by two,

00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:23.499
and you would get 1/4.

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:27.853
So 2 2/8 is the same thing as 2 1/4.

00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:33.032
Now you have this bag right over here,

00:01:33.032 --> 00:01:34.529
and how much is in this bag?

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:38.431
Well let's see, that is 1/8, 2/8, 3/8,

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.810
4/8, 5/8, 6/8.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.184
So that's going to be 2 6/8.

00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:48.252
Now 6/8, six and eight are both divisible

00:01:48.252 --> 00:01:50.445
by two, so if you divide them both

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:52.523
by two, that's the same thing as 3/4.

00:01:52.523 --> 00:01:56.056
So that's the same thing as 2 3/4.

00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:58.461
2 3/4.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.727
And now you have two dots right over

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:01.667
at this point over here.

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:03.281
So there's two dots that have this many

00:02:03.281 --> 00:02:04.244
ounces of trail mix.

00:02:04.244 --> 00:02:05.823
Well how many ounces is this?

00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:10.656
3 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8.

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:13.176
So that's 3 4/8.

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:14.894
Well 4/8 is the same thing,

00:02:14.894 --> 00:02:16.601
they're both divisible by four.

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:18.214
Four divided by four is one,

00:02:18.214 --> 00:02:19.515
eight divided by four is two.

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:22.464
This is the same thing as 3 1/2.

00:02:22.464 --> 00:02:23.311
3 1/2.

00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:25.003
And you see that this dot right over here,

00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:28.577
it is halfway between three and four.

00:02:28.577 --> 00:02:30.122
And so let's think about,

00:02:30.122 --> 00:02:32.176
let's list the amount of ounces

00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:33.952
in each of the bags.

00:02:33.952 --> 00:02:37.837
So you have 2 1/4 ounces.

00:02:37.837 --> 00:02:39.171
That's one of the bags.

00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:44.171
You have another bag that's 2 3/4 ounces.

00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:45.649
Then you have two bags,

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:46.798
remember there's two bags here,

00:02:46.798 --> 00:02:48.959
that's what the dot plot does for us.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.557
We have two bags here
that are 3 1/2 ounces.

00:02:52.557 --> 00:02:56.689
So 3 1/2 and 3 1/2.

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.117
Now let me make sure that doesn't look

00:02:58.117 --> 00:02:59.452
like an exponent to you.

00:02:59.452 --> 00:03:01.797
3 1/2.

00:03:01.797 --> 00:03:03.353
Now what was our strategy?

00:03:03.353 --> 00:03:05.396
What we wanted to do is redistribute all

00:03:05.396 --> 00:03:06.709
of the trail mix so that we have

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.589
the same amount in each bag.

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:10.238
So one way that you could imagine this

00:03:10.238 --> 00:03:12.037
is imagine everyone
pouring their trail mix

00:03:12.037 --> 00:03:13.581
into a big pile and then dividing

00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:16.576
that pile into four,
and then putting exactly

00:03:16.576 --> 00:03:18.294
1/4 of the total into each bag.

00:03:18.294 --> 00:03:20.083
Then you would redistribute
it so that you have

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:22.821
the same amount in each bag.

00:03:22.821 --> 00:03:24.261
So let's add it all together.

00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:25.758
Let's create our pile.

00:03:25.758 --> 00:03:30.737
Let's add 2 1/4 plus 2
3/4 plus 3 1/2 plus 3 1/2.

00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:32.899
Well what is,

00:03:34.545 --> 00:03:38.533
let's see, two plus two is four.

00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:43.013
1/4 plus 3/4 is going to be 4/4.

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:47.791
So this right over here
is going to equal to five.

00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:49.243
Another way to think about it,

00:03:49.243 --> 00:03:51.042
you could rewrite these.

00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:53.166
You could say 2 1/4, two is the same thing

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:58.032
as 8/4, so this would be 9/4

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.593
plus, let's see, four times two is eight

00:04:04.593 --> 00:04:06.416
plus three is 11.

00:04:06.416 --> 00:04:08.958
Plus 11/4.

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:13.958
Then you would have 3 1/2 plus 3 1/2,

00:04:14.097 --> 00:04:15.686
you might be able to say
three plus three is six,

00:04:15.686 --> 00:04:18.241
1/2 plus 1/2 is one, so
it's going to be seven.

00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:19.656
But if you wanted to write it like this,

00:04:19.656 --> 00:04:23.737
you could write 3 1/2, that's
two times three is six,

00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:25.699
plus one is seven.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.660
Plus 7/2 plus 7/2.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.877
So these are sometimes
called improper fractions,

00:04:30.877 --> 00:04:31.956
although some people disagree with calling

00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:33.304
them improper fractions.

00:04:33.304 --> 00:04:35.102
These are just fractions
where the numerator

00:04:35.102 --> 00:04:37.552
is greater than the denominator.

00:04:37.552 --> 00:04:40.442
But anyway, let's add all of this up.

00:04:40.442 --> 00:04:45.061
So 9/11, let me see what
color I haven't used yet.

00:04:46.165 --> 00:04:49.574
Sorry, not 9/11, 9/4 plus 11/4

00:04:49.574 --> 00:04:51.268
is going to be equal to what?

00:04:51.268 --> 00:04:53.950
This part is going to be equal to 20/4,

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.353
which is the same thing as five.

00:04:56.353 --> 00:04:58.525
20 divided by four is five,

00:04:58.525 --> 00:05:01.485
or you could say 20/4 is
going to be five wholes.

00:05:01.485 --> 00:05:05.809
Then 7/2 plus 7/2,
that's going to be 14/2,

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:08.503
plus 14/2, that's this
part right over here.

00:05:08.503 --> 00:05:10.883
14/2 is the same thing as seven.

00:05:10.883 --> 00:05:12.844
Five plus seven.

00:05:12.844 --> 00:05:14.889
So in total, you have 12 ounces.

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.140
Once again, I just did this
as another way to do it,

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.127
but you could have just said, look,

00:05:18.127 --> 00:05:20.119
two plus two is four,

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:22.754
1/4 plus 3/4 is another whole.

00:05:22.754 --> 00:05:24.775
So four plus one is five.

00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:27.061
Then 3 1/2 plus 3 1/2,
three plus three is six,

00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:30.277
1/2 plus 1/2 is one,
six plus one is seven.

00:05:30.277 --> 00:05:32.414
So in total, you have 12 ounces.

00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:34.457
Now that's if you combine
everything together,

00:05:34.457 --> 00:05:36.025
but now we wanna redistribute it

00:05:36.025 --> 00:05:37.823
into the four bags.

00:05:37.823 --> 00:05:40.593
We wanna divide it equally into four bags.

00:05:40.593 --> 00:05:42.636
So you just take your 12 ounces,

00:05:42.636 --> 00:05:44.459
let me do this in a new color,

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:47.155
you just wanna take your 12 ounces

00:05:48.917 --> 00:05:50.407
and divide it by four.

00:05:50.407 --> 00:05:52.502
Divide it into four equal groups.

00:05:52.502 --> 00:05:56.368
Then you're gonna get
three ounces per bag.

00:05:56.368 --> 00:05:57.535
So that's our answer.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.042
How much trail mix would be in each bag?

00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:03.641
Three ounces.

00:06:03.641 --> 00:06:06.181
And we are done.
