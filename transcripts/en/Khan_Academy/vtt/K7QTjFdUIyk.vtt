00:00:00.736 --> 00:00:02.207
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.207 --> 00:00:05.586
is get some practice identifying
some transformations.

00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:07.097
And the transformations
we're gonna look at

00:00:07.097 --> 00:00:10.535
are things like rotations
where you are spinning

00:00:10.535 --> 00:00:12.812
something around a point.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.057
We're gonna look at translations,

00:00:14.057 --> 00:00:17.298
where you're shifting all
the points of a figure.

00:00:17.298 --> 00:00:18.340
We're gonna look at reflection,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.423
where you flip a figure
over some type of a line.

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:24.992
And we'll look at dilations,

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:27.516
where you're essentially
going to either shrink

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:30.183
or expand some type of a figure.

00:00:31.183 --> 00:00:32.228
So with that out of the way,

00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:33.503
let's think about this question.

00:00:33.503 --> 00:00:35.726
What single transformation was applied

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:38.393
to triangle A to get triangle B?

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.332
So it looks like triangle
A and triangle B,

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:43.571
they're the same size,

00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:45.319
and what's really
happened is that every one

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:47.912
of these points has been shifted.

00:00:47.912 --> 00:00:48.888
Or another way I could say it,

00:00:48.888 --> 00:00:51.060
they have all been translated

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.148
a little bit to the right and up.

00:00:53.148 --> 00:00:55.482
And so, right like this,

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:57.767
they have all been translated.

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:01.850
So this right over here
is clearly a translation.

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:05.768
Let's do another example.

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:13.001
What single transformation was applied

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.452
to triangle A to get to triangle B?

00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:18.965
So if I look at these diagrams,

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:21.728
this point seems to
correspond with that one.

00:01:21.728 --> 00:01:24.156
This one corresponds with that one.

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:26.767
So it doesn't look like
a straight translation

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:29.427
because they would have been
translated in different ways,

00:01:29.427 --> 00:01:32.385
so it's definitely not
a straight translation.

00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:33.218
Let's think about it.

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:34.865
Looks like there might be a rotation here.

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:36.984
So maybe it looks like
that point went over there.

00:01:36.984 --> 00:01:39.304
That point went over there.

00:01:39.304 --> 00:01:41.425
This point went over here,

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:43.288
and so we could be rotating around

00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:45.930
some point right about here.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.510
And if you rotate around that point,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.237
you could get to a situation
that looks like a triangle B.

00:01:51.237 --> 00:01:52.280
And I don't know the exact point

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.584
that we're rotating around,
but this looks pretty clear,

00:01:54.584 --> 00:01:55.917
like a rotation.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.843
Let's do another example.

00:02:04.842 --> 00:02:06.972
What single transformation was applied

00:02:06.972 --> 00:02:11.399
to quadrilateral A to
get to quadrilateral B?

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:12.640
So let's see, it looks like

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.723
this point corresponds to that point.

00:02:16.564 --> 00:02:19.068
And then this point
corresponds to that point,

00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:21.094
and that point corresponds to that point,

00:02:21.094 --> 00:02:23.127
so they actually look like
reflections of each other.

00:02:23.127 --> 00:02:26.839
If you were to imagine
some type of a mirror

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.452
right over here, they're
actually mirror images.

00:02:29.452 --> 00:02:30.877
This got flipped over the line,

00:02:30.877 --> 00:02:33.141
that got flipped over the line,

00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:35.447
and that got flipped over the line.

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:36.729
So it's pretty clear that this right

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:38.896
over here is a reflection.

00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:43.862
All right, let's do one more of these.

00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:46.818
What single transformation was applied

00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:51.068
to quadrilateral A to
get to quadrilateral B?

00:02:51.068 --> 00:02:53.568
All right, so this looks like,

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:57.667
so quadrilateral B is clearly bigger.

00:02:57.667 --> 00:02:59.498
So this is a non-rigid transformation.

00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:02.340
The distance between corresponding points

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.462
looks like it has increased.

00:03:04.462 --> 00:03:05.295
Now you might be saying, well,

00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:06.779
wouldn't that be, it looks like

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.375
if you're making something
bigger or smaller,

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:10.656
that looks like a dilation.

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:13.646
But it looks like this
has been moved as well.

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:15.073
Has it been translated?

00:03:15.073 --> 00:03:17.561
And the key here to realize is around,

00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:19.425
what is your center of dilation?

00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:24.064
So for example, if your
center of dilation is,

00:03:24.064 --> 00:03:25.427
let's say, right over here,

00:03:25.427 --> 00:03:28.192
then all of these things are
gonna be stretched that way.

00:03:28.192 --> 00:03:30.359
And so this point might go to there,

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.423
that point might go over there,

00:03:33.423 --> 00:03:34.810
this point might go over here,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.420
and then that point might go over here.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.548
So this is definitely a dilation,

00:03:38.548 --> 00:03:40.161
where you are, your center where

00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:41.697
everything is expanding from,

00:03:41.697 --> 00:03:44.614
is just outside of our trapezoid A.
