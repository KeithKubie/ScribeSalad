00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.320
The signature gives the name of the program, the names and

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.570
types of the input arguments, and the name and type of the results. For SORT,

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.460
the signature looks like the following. Vector of type integer Y equals the SORT

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.290
of the Vector of type integer X. That is, SORT takes a single argument named X,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.990
that has a datatype, which is a Vector of integers.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.870
And produces, produces, as a result, Vector Y, which also holds ints.
