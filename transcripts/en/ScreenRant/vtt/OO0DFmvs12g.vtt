Hey film buffs!

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.090
Do you regularly astound your friends with
your unrivalled movie knowledge?

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.629
You might be able to recite the script of
The Godfather word-for-word, perhaps you know

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.180
which year every movie in the Harry Potter
franchise was released, and you might even

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.220
know how many times Wayne and Garth say "schwing"
in the Wayne's World movies, but what about

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.750
all that lesser known movie trivia from behind
the scenes?There are a lot of facts about

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.230
movies that might just take you by surprise
- and that's what this video is all about.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.000
Here's our latest edition of twenty rapid
fire behind the scenes movie facts...

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.979
Jurassic Park
Steven Spielberg directed Jurassic Park in

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:44.460
a very hands-on manner, but he oversaw the
post-production of the movie via video link

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.600
while in Poland filming Schindler's List.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.960
Maleficent
With Robert Stromberg at the movie's helm,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.040
Maleficent had the largest ever budget for
a first-time director of $263 million, surpassing

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.619
another Disney film, TRON: Legacy, which had
a budget of $170 million.

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:01.640
The Wrestler
In order to add realism to his portrayal of

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.390
the title character in The Wrestler, Mickey
Rourke "bladed" his own head.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.650
Blading is the process of cutting yourself
to provoke bleeding and occurs in real-life

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.130
in the professional wrestling industry.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.610
Hancock
The eagle on the back of Hancock's uniform

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.970
is a replica of the Philadeplphia Eagles logo
from 1948 to 1995.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.610
Philadelphia is, of course, the home city
of Hancock's star, Will Smith.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.600
Titanic
The scene in Titanic in which water crashes

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.900
into the Grand Staircase room only allowed
the film makers one opportunity to get it

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.820
right, because the entire set and furnishings
were going to be destroyed in the shot.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.440
Avatar
In Avatar, the whooping and cackling sounds

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.950
made by the wolf-like predators on the fictional
moon of Pandora are actually real spotted

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.640
hyena calls.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.100
Forrest Gump
During the ping-pong matches in Forrest Gump,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.770
there was no actual ball used.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.170
The ball you see was entirely CGI, animated
to meet the actors' paddles as required.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.049
Godzilla
To get a good idea of the vocal power behind

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.120
the titular monster's roar in the recent Godzilla
reboot, the movie's sound designers used a

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.119
12-foot high, 18-foot wide speaker array to
blast it out at 100,000 watts.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.810
The Mist
To help save time on the tight schedule of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.060
The Mist, the producers and director Frank
Darabont hired the camera crew from The Shield

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.939
television series to shoot the film.

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.700
This camera crew was able to move fast, due
to the hectic TV production schedule.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.290
Men in Black 3
The weird looking white "alien" fish that

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.599
says "hey" in the Chinese restaurant kitchen
scene in Men in Black 3 is in fact an actual

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.849
real life fish.

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.370
Technically known as Psychrolutes marcidus,
it is more commonly known as a blobfish.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.379
American Ultra
As a promotional stunt for American Ultra,

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.060
Lionsgate gave away free marijuana at the
San Diego Comic Con to anyone in possession

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.540
of a medical marijuana card.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.920
Finding Dory
In Finding Dory, Alexander Gould is replaced

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.230
by Hayden Rolence as the voice of Nemo, due
to having outgrown his original role since

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.030
Finding Nemo in 2003.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.549
However, Gould does have a Cameo as Passenger
Carl in the movie.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.439
Ice Age: Collision Course
Ice Age: Collision Course was originally scheduled

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.010
for release on July 15th, 2016.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.099
However the release was delayed until July
22nd in order for it to avoid having to compete

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.099
with the all-female Ghostbusters reboot.

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.559
Assassin's Creed
During the building of the Assassin's Creed

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:11.799
courtyard set in malta, a hurricane swept
inland and damaged the set.

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.999
The set in question was built on the same
site as the amphitheatre in Gladiator.

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:18.140
I Am Legend
Will Smith became so fond of his co-star,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.459
Abbey, the German Shepherd who played Sam
in I Am Legend, that he tried to adopt her

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.659
when filming was finished.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.689
However, the dog's trainer could not be persuaded
to give her up.

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.400
Creed
Michael B. Jordan plays Adonis Creed - son

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.590
of Apollo Creed - in 2015's Creed.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.090
However, in reality, Jordan was born in 1987,
two years after the fictional death of Apollo.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.389
Whiplash
There's a scene in Whiplash in which J.K.

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.590
Simmons' character, Fletcher, calls Miles
Teller's Andrew a "self righteous little prick".

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.330
This was the only line Simmons improvised
in the whole movie.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.510
The Wolf of Wall Street
For the scenes in The Wolf of Wall Street

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.059
in which some of the movie's characters snorted
"cocaine", the actors actually snorted crushed

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:56.059
B vitamins.

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.040
Despicable Me 2
The villainous Eduardo "El Macho" PÃ©rez in

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.099
Despicable Me 2 was actually meant to be played
by Al Pacino.

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.459
Pacino had even recorded his lines for the
role, but he dropped out of the project due

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.370
to creative differences and was replaced by
Benjamin Bratt.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.839
Monsters University
In spite of the fact that she was outright

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:15.620
offered the role of Dean Abigail Hardscrabble
in Monsters University, Helen Mirren requested

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.030
that she audition for it anyway to ensure
that the people behind the movie were satisfied

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.240
