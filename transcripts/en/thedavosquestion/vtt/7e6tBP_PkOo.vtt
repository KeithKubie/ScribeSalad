00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.450
&gt;&gt; Hello YouTube. This deep financial crisis
and also economic loss hopefully will run

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:29.449
with new rules which would prevent it. And
this new rules, first of all, should be against

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:41.370
greed which seems to be one of the major factors
of this crisis. I think it can mean that new

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.840
rules are crucial because the existing ones
showed to be dead or inefficient.
