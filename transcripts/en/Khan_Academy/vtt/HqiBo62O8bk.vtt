00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
We're on problem 36.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.450
They've drawn a little
graph here.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.170
So let's draw it up
for ourselves.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.560
So that's the y-axis.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.720
That is the x-axis.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.070
And then they have this point.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.090
Let's see, minus 1.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.160
They say, 1, 2, 3.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.910
Let's see.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.000
1, 2.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.360
And then they have this line
segment PQ that goes

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.330
from 0, minus 1.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.290
Let me draw that in
a different color.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.270
It goes from 0, minus
1 to 3 comma 2.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:43.380
So it goes from there, so
3, so roughly there.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.030
I think that's about as
good as I can do.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.780
And the way they drew it,
it intersects 1 here.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.530
And so this would be 3.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.890
This is the point 3 comma 2.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.410
And they say in the figure
above, the point on segment

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.290
PQ, so they say this is point
P, this is point Q.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.390
The point on PQ that is twice
as far from P as from Q.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.500
So the point is on this segment,
so this point is

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.420
someplace around here.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.550
We could find points that are
away from the segment that are

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.160
twice as far from P as
from Q, but they say

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.170
it's on this segment.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.190
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.380
If we just look at how do we
get from P to Q, we go 3 to

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.280
the right, right? x increases
by 3 and y

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.210
increases by 3, right?

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.240
So if we wanted to go 2/3 along
the way, what if we just

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.520
increased x by 2 to get to x is
equal to 2 and increased y

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.310
by 2, right?

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.650
So the x's and y's only
increase by 2/3

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.240
of the way to Q.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.490
So then that would
be the point.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.230
x is 2 and then y is 1.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.000
That would be the point
2 comma 1, which is B.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.590
Next question.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.200
37.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.560
If a positive integer n is
divisible by both 5 and 7,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.050
than n must be divisible by
which of the following?

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.270
Let's see, they give
us a couple of

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.595
choices: I, II and III.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.800
So they say it has to
be divisible by 12.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.370
No, that's not the case.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.350
35 is divisible by 5 and 7.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.960
It's not divisible by 12.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.290
35.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.090
Well, sure.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.460
If you're divisible by 5 and
7, that means it's equal to

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.290
some constant times
5 times 7, right?

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.110
And this could be a bunch of
numbers multiplied together.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.780
But that means it's equal to 35
times some other integer,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.010
and that integer could have
a bunch of other factors.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.510
So, right.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.700
It has to be divisible by 35.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.110
And statement III is 70.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.220
Well, no, 35 is divisible
by 5 and 7, but it's not

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.680
divisible by 70.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.920
So statement III is not right.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.360
So it's II only.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.430
So that's C.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.780
Question 38.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.340
If 4 is one solution to the
equation x squared plus 3x

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.575
plus k is equal to 10,
so 4 is one solution.

00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:38.980
So that means if I were to
factor this, it'll be x minus

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.530
4 times x plus or minus
something else, because we

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.060
know that x minus 4 equals 0,
which tells us that x is equal

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.080
to 4 is one of the solutions.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.800
So what are they going
to ask us?

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.830
They're going to say, where k
is a constant, what is the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.080
other solution?

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.070
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.650
Well, actually, let me rewrite
it a little different.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.840
I didn't realize that they
said this is equal to 10.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.740
So let's subtract 10
from both sides.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.600
We get x squared plus 3x-- you
essentially want to find the

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.829
roots of this quadratic-- plus
k minus 10 is equal to 0.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.280
And you want to factor
it, right?

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.450
You could factor
any quadratic.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.180
It's going to be x plus
a times x plus b.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.760
And they're telling us
that 4 is one of

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.170
the solutions, right?

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.210
4 is one of the solutions,
so minus 4 could be a.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.620
So this would be x minus 4 times
some other number, x

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.200
plus b, is equal to 0.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.590
And I said positive
4 in the solution.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.360
Why did I put a minus 4 here?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.740
Because think about it.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.270
If we factor this quadratic and
we get this, that's tells

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.540
us either x minus 4 is
0 or x plus b is 0.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:03.390
If x minus 4 is 0, then the
solution is x is equal to 4,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.770
so that's why I wrote
x minus 4 there.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.440
But anyway, let's figure
out what b could be.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.780
So if we multiply this out to
try to pattern match it with

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:22.540
this, we get x times x is x
squared minus 4x plus b times

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:29.310
x, and then you have minus
4 times b, so minus 4b.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.840
So then this is equal to x
squared, and then we could

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.620
write it plus b minus
4 times x.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.760
I just factored an x out of
these two terms, right?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.500
And so you get b minus 4
minus 4b is equal to 0.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.730
So now you just pattern
match it.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.190
You say b minus 4-- x squared
equals x squared.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.890
b minus 4x has to be
equal to 3x, right?

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.830
We're just pattern matching.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.200
That's the only first-degree
x term there.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.750
So b minus 4 has to be equal--
x has to be equal to 3x.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.700
We don't even care about k.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.490
So b minus 4 has to be equal
to 3, or b is equal to 7.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.560
Oh, right, right.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.870
So they want to know what
the other solution is.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.770
They don't want to
know what b is.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.650
And I was looking and
was like, oh, wow,

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.810
there isn't a 7 there.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:23.960
There's a negative 7.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.130
So that tells us that the
factorization of this

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.490
problem-- I would have gotten
that wrong if they put a 7

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.240
there, because I wasn't
careful-- is x minus 4 times x

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.800
plus 7 is equal to 0, right?

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.770
So we already said we could say
x minus 4 is equal to 0.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.150
And that's where we get
the 4 solution.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.180
Or we could say x plus
7 is equal to 0.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.590
Subtract 7 from both sides.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.280
The other solution is x
is equal to minus 7.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.920
That was a careless mistake I
almost made, but I got saved

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.942
by the choices.

00:06:50.942 --> 00:06:53.950
So that's choice A.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.890
Next problem.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.370
39.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.720
If x is equal to negative
3, what is the

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.020
value of minus 3x squared?

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.120
So I don't know, maybe they're
trying to test your ability to

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.280
do order of operations
or something.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.920
So this is equal to minus 3
times minus three squared,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.810
right? x squared.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.260
So this is equal to minus
3 times positive 9.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.240
Minus 3 squared is positive 9,
which equals minus 27, which

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.490
is choice A.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.040
Next question.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.920
40.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:51.560
29 squared plus 29, over
29 is equal to?

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.180
Well, let's just divide
the numerator and the

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.160
denominator by 29.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.160
What's 29 squared?

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.790
This is the same thing as 29
squared over 29 plus-- I'm

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:06.130
just going to separate these
two terms out-- plus 29/29.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.530
29 squared divided by 29.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.360
x squared divided by x is x.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.490
29 squared divided
by 29 is 29.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.640
29 divided by 29 is 1,
so it equals 30.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.300
So that is choice E.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:25.210
Problem 41.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:36.030
If x is equal to 1 minus 3t and
y is equal to 2t minus 1.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.980
So I'm going to write
it like this.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.490
minus 1 plus 2t.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.610
I just want to put the t's
under each other, right?

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.860
2t minus 1.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.940
For what value of t
does x equal y?

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.340
OK, so let's just set x equal
y and solve for t.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.950
So we could just say if x is
equal to y, we get 1 minus 3t

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.250
has to equal this, which
is 2t minus 1.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.790
Let's add 3t to both sides.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.110
So you get 1-- 3t goes
away from there--

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.550
equals 5t, minus 1.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.680
Add 1 to both sides.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.130
You get 2 is equal to 5t.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.220
Divide both sides by 5.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.570
You get t is equal to 5/2,
which is choice A.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.100
And I'm almost out of time.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.900
The next one has a diagram,
which always takes me some

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.850
time to draw, so I'll see
you in the next video.
