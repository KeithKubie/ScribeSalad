COLT MCANLIS: Hey, everybody.

00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:02.190
Colt McAnlis here.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.730
I want to take some time from
the San Francisco airport

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.170
to thank everyone on Reddit
for the amazing support

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.730
for the Alton Brown
comments and posts

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.920
for the Android Performance
Patterns show and Compressor

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.820
Head, as well.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.570
Funny note-- we were
actually finishing up

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.930
filming some of the last
episodes of Android Performance

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.680
Patterns season two this week
when one of the engineers

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.050
burst in yesterday and let
us know that we'd actually

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.240
reached the top of the
programming board on Reddit.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.080
So after reading
all of the thoughts

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.050
and all the comments and all
the positive feedback there,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.550
I really just wanted
to make a video

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.420
and thank everyone so much
for the support and, really,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.430
the positive feedback.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.230
That's amazing to get
for this type of content.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.675
So if you're
interested, season two

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.300
is actually going to
be coming out soon

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.280
in the next couple of weeks.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.863
If you want to follow
along with that,

00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:48.720
make sure you follow the
Google Developers and Android

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.730
Developers account on YouTube.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.950
And season three of Android
Performance Patterns

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.969
is currently in
scripting, so if there's

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.010
anything you want to hear
talked about, any ideas

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.210
that you want us
to cover, make sure

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.602
you leave comments
on this video,

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.310
and I'll do everything
I can to make sure

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.460
that we cover that for you.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.210
So I got to get going, but thank
you, again, everyone, so much

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.520
on the Reddit community for the
support and the great feedback.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.060
Keep calm.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.000
Profile your code.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.620
And always remember,
perf matters.
