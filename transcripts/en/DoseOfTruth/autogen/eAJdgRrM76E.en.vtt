grew phobia and would love to hear about
anxiety well that's a that's a rough

anxiety well that's a that's a rough
thing to have Agra phobia so Agra

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
thing to have Agra phobia so Agra
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.390
thing to have Agra phobia so Agra
phobics get increasingly isolated and

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
phobics get increasingly isolated and
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.720
phobics get increasingly isolated and
afraid of things outside of their domain

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
afraid of things outside of their domain
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.970
afraid of things outside of their domain
of familiarity and often what happens

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980
of familiarity and often what happens
 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.160
of familiarity and often what happens
with Agra phobia is that people who

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170
with Agra phobia is that people who
 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.779
with Agra phobia is that people who
develop it or afraid of two things

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
develop it or afraid of two things
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.060
develop it or afraid of two things
they're afraid that something is going

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
they're afraid that something is going
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.650
they're afraid that something is going
to go dreadfully wrong with their health

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
to go dreadfully wrong with their health
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.540
to go dreadfully wrong with their health
especially with regards to their heart

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550
especially with regards to their heart
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.890
especially with regards to their heart
so they start to become afraid that

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900
so they start to become afraid that
 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.359
so they start to become afraid that
maybe they'll have a heart attack and

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369
maybe they'll have a heart attack and
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.670
maybe they'll have a heart attack and
that they'll die in public far from a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
that they'll die in public far from a
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.650
that they'll die in public far from a
hospital and that they'll make a fool of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660
hospital and that they'll make a fool of
 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.270
hospital and that they'll make a fool of
themselves while they're doing it or

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
themselves while they're doing it or
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.160
themselves while they're doing it or
well they well they think they're dying

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
well they well they think they're dying
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.440
well they well they think they're dying
and so it's a combination of two fears

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
and so it's a combination of two fears
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930
and so it's a combination of two fears
and one is fear of mortality and the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940
and one is fear of mortality and the
 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.970
and one is fear of mortality and the
other is fear of social judgment and you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
other is fear of social judgment and you
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.529
other is fear of social judgment and you
might think about those as the two main

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
might think about those as the two main
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.479
might think about those as the two main
categories of fear that possess people

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
categories of fear that possess people
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.790
categories of fear that possess people
because one is associated well obviously

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
because one is associated well obviously
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740
because one is associated well obviously
with mortality and death and the other

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
with mortality and death and the other
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.900
with mortality and death and the other
is associated with exclusion from the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
is associated with exclusion from the
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.450
is associated with exclusion from the
group which course can lead to mortality

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
group which course can lead to mortality
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.220
group which course can lead to mortality
and death and so the Agra phobics get

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
and death and so the Agra phobics get
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.070
and death and so the Agra phobics get
the worst of both worlds it's often a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
the worst of both worlds it's often a
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.170
the worst of both worlds it's often a
disease of middle aged women but not

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
disease of middle aged women but not
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240
disease of middle aged women but not
always and they're often people who've

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
always and they're often people who've
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.859
always and they're often people who've
been somewhat dependent in their

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869
been somewhat dependent in their
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.990
been somewhat dependent in their
previous lives and then undergo some

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
previous lives and then undergo some
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.149
previous lives and then undergo some
traumatic event like a divorce or the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
traumatic event like a divorce or the
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.670
traumatic event like a divorce or the
death of someone close and and at the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
death of someone close and and at the
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.890
death of someone close and and at the
same time are perhaps experiencing heart

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
same time are perhaps experiencing heart
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.539
same time are perhaps experiencing heart
palpitations that are associated with

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
palpitations that are associated with
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.140
palpitations that are associated with
menopause that brings ideas of mortality

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
menopause that brings ideas of mortality
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.929
menopause that brings ideas of mortality
to mind and that can trigger a panic

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
to mind and that can trigger a panic
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.420
to mind and that can trigger a panic
attack which is very what would you call

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
attack which is very what would you call
 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.090
attack which is very what would you call
it unpleasant experience to say the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
it unpleasant experience to say the
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.020
it unpleasant experience to say the
least and then that fear of panic

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
least and then that fear of panic
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.090
least and then that fear of panic
attacks starts making people avoid and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
attacks starts making people avoid and
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.920
attacks starts making people avoid and
that's when Agra phobia develops out of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
that's when Agra phobia develops out of
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.530
that's when Agra phobia develops out of
anxiety disorders with panic attacks so

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
anxiety disorders with panic attacks so
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.109
anxiety disorders with panic attacks so
you go out and maybe you go to a mall

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
you go out and maybe you go to a mall
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.850
you go out and maybe you go to a mall
and maybe you're in a crowd and maybe

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
and maybe you're in a crowd and maybe
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.980
and maybe you're in a crowd and maybe
you start thinking about well your heart

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
you start thinking about well your heart
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.480
you start thinking about well your heart
beat and about the fact that someone

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
beat and about the fact that someone
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.639
beat and about the fact that someone
close to you has died and maybe then you

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649
close to you has died and maybe then you
 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.440
close to you has died and maybe then you
become aware of your heartbeat and you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
become aware of your heartbeat and you
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.090
become aware of your heartbeat and you
start to panic because you feel that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100
start to panic because you feel that
 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.609
start to panic because you feel that
maybe it's the beat is irregular or or

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
maybe it's the beat is irregular or or
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.459
maybe it's the beat is irregular or or
that or that you can't detect it as well

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
that or that you can't detect it as well
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.830
that or that you can't detect it as well
as you usually can and then that makes

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
as you usually can and then that makes
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.389
as you usually can and then that makes
your heart accelerate because it makes

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399
your heart accelerate because it makes
 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.670
your heart accelerate because it makes
you afraid and then you get

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680
you afraid and then you get
 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.060
you afraid and then you get
or more what would you call sensitive to

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070
or more what would you call sensitive to
 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.860
or more what would you call sensitive to
that and that makes your heart rate beat

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870
that and that makes your heart rate beat
 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.380
that and that makes your heart rate beat
even faster and then you panic you want

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390
even faster and then you panic you want
 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.580
even faster and then you panic you want
to get to the hospital to get checked

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590
to get to the hospital to get checked
 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.560
to get to the hospital to get checked
out to make sure that you're alright and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570
out to make sure that you're alright and
 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.140
out to make sure that you're alright and
then you make your fatal mistake which

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150
then you make your fatal mistake which
 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.240
then you make your fatal mistake which
is that you avoid going back to the mall

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250
is that you avoid going back to the mall
 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.820
is that you avoid going back to the mall
and then you go to the grocery store and

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830
and then you go to the grocery store and
 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.110
and then you go to the grocery store and
the same thing happens and then you

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120
the same thing happens and then you
 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.430
the same thing happens and then you
start to avoid going to the grocery

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440
start to avoid going to the grocery
 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.580
start to avoid going to the grocery
store then you start to avoid avoiding

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590
store then you start to avoid avoiding
 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.620
store then you start to avoid avoiding
the subway or taxis or crowds or

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630
the subway or taxis or crowds or
 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.030
the subway or taxis or crowds or
anywhere you might get trapped and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040
anywhere you might get trapped and
 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.280
anywhere you might get trapped and
wouldn't be able to get to a hospital

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290
wouldn't be able to get to a hospital
 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.990
wouldn't be able to get to a hospital
soon you end up avoiding everything and

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000
soon you end up avoiding everything and
 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.600
soon you end up avoiding everything and
that's when your life really starts to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610
that's when your life really starts to
 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.840
that's when your life really starts to
become a living hell so the basic way to

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850
become a living hell so the basic way to
 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.210
become a living hell so the basic way to
treat a agoraphobia there's two ways and

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220
treat a agoraphobia there's two ways and
 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.400
treat a agoraphobia there's two ways and
one is to develop some control over

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410
one is to develop some control over
 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.410
one is to develop some control over
breathing to do progressive relaxation

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420
breathing to do progressive relaxation
 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.479
breathing to do progressive relaxation
and the way you do that is that you

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489
and the way you do that is that you
 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.130
and the way you do that is that you
start with your you start by

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140
start with your you start by
 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.080
start with your you start by
concentrating on your toes and your feet

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090
concentrating on your toes and your feet
 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.780
concentrating on your toes and your feet
and then your ankles and then your shins

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790
and then your ankles and then your shins
 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.430
and then your ankles and then your shins
and your knees you move all the way up

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440
and your knees you move all the way up
 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.250
and your knees you move all the way up
your body and let the tension flow out

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260
your body and let the tension flow out
 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.320
your body and let the tension flow out
of your muscles and regulate your

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330
of your muscles and regulate your
 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.990
of your muscles and regulate your
breathing calmly and carefully so that

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000
breathing calmly and carefully so that
 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.600
breathing calmly and carefully so that
you can learn to relax and then you go

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610
you can learn to relax and then you go
 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.920
you can learn to relax and then you go
out you go out voluntarily and start to

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930
out you go out voluntarily and start to
 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.690
out you go out voluntarily and start to
confront the things you're afraid of so

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700
confront the things you're afraid of so
 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.340
confront the things you're afraid of so
for example if you're afraid of the mall

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350
for example if you're afraid of the mall
 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.650
for example if you're afraid of the mall
maybe you go to the parking lot and you

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660
maybe you go to the parking lot and you
 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.449
maybe you go to the parking lot and you
look at the mall and then you walk close

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459
look at the mall and then you walk close
 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.789
look at the mall and then you walk close
to the door and you look inside you know

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799
to the door and you look inside you know
 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.050
to the door and you look inside you know
and then you go home because that's

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060
and then you go home because that's
 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.759
and then you go home because that's
enough for one day but you do

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769
enough for one day but you do
 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.699
enough for one day but you do
progressive exposure and that's the base

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709
progressive exposure and that's the base
 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.620
progressive exposure and that's the base
one of the basic rules of psychotherapy

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630
one of the basic rules of psychotherapy
 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.940
one of the basic rules of psychotherapy
is that if you're afraid of something

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950
is that if you're afraid of something
 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.340
is that if you're afraid of something
you progressively and voluntarily expose

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350
you progressively and voluntarily expose
 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.009
you progressively and voluntarily expose
yourself to it and that generally it's

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019
yourself to it and that generally it's
 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.050
yourself to it and that generally it's
the voluntary exposure that's curative

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060
the voluntary exposure that's curative
 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.150
the voluntary exposure that's curative
right accidental exposure can make you

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160
right accidental exposure can make you
 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.280
right accidental exposure can make you
worse but voluntary exposure it can be

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290
worse but voluntary exposure it can be
 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.410
worse but voluntary exposure it can be
curative and that's sort of associated

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420
curative and that's sort of associated
 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.750
curative and that's sort of associated
with the myth of the hero and the dragon

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760
with the myth of the hero and the dragon
 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.970
with the myth of the hero and the dragon
you know the hero is the person who goes

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980
you know the hero is the person who goes
 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.920
you know the hero is the person who goes
out voluntarily to confront the dragon

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930
out voluntarily to confront the dragon
 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.680

if you voluntarily expose yourself to

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700
if you voluntarily expose yourself to

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.440

that you get braver and you learn that

that you get braver and you learn that
 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.090
that you get braver and you learn that
you can tolerate the fear and that can

you can tolerate the fear and that can
 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.160
you can tolerate the fear and that can

to work very well I was going to launch
 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.499
to work very well I was going to launch
it at the end of August so that this

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509

year's University students could benefit

year's University students could benefit
 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.800
year's University students could benefit
from it but there was the

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810
from it but there was the
 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.200
from it but there was the
Charlottesville event and then I got

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210
Charlottesville event and then I got
 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.360
Charlottesville event and then I got
busy and I also wasn't feeling great and

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370
busy and I also wasn't feeling great and
 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.610
busy and I also wasn't feeling great and
so I just didn't hit the window of time

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620
so I just didn't hit the window of time
 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.879
so I just didn't hit the window of time
properly but I hope to be able to launch

to launch the website at the same time I
 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.390
to launch the website at the same time I
also had people suggest to me that maybe

also had people suggest to me that maybe

it wasn't a good idea that it would

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930
it wasn't a good idea that it would
 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.680
it wasn't a good idea that it would
increase polarization but I've thought

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690
increase polarization but I've thought
 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.480
increase polarization but I've thought
about that for about a month and a half

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490
about that for about a month and a half
 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.399
about that for about a month and a half
and I think that the benefit to the

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409
and I think that the benefit to the
 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.290
and I think that the benefit to the
consumer so that would be the informed

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300
consumer so that would be the informed
 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.240

universities is really ridiculous so
 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.529
universities is really ridiculous so
alright so let's see what else we've got

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539
alright so let's see what else we've got

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.080
here in the chat room DVS sk8er 3 that's
quite a mouthful says I'm studying to be

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090
quite a mouthful says I'm studying to be
 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.610
quite a mouthful says I'm studying to be
a teacher but I'm also an introvert

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620
a teacher but I'm also an introvert
 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.409
a teacher but I'm also an introvert
could this be a big problem

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419
could this be a big problem
 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.060
could this be a big problem
can I still be a successful teacher

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070
can I still be a successful teacher
 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.089
can I still be a successful teacher
actually what seems to predict success

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099
actually what seems to predict success
 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.270
actually what seems to predict success
of teaching best is intelligence and

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280
of teaching best is intelligence and
 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.850
of teaching best is intelligence and
conscientiousness that's the data so far

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860
conscientiousness that's the data so far
 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.490
conscientiousness that's the data so far
so if you're conscientious then you'll

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500
so if you're conscientious then you'll
 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.360
so if you're conscientious then you'll
probably be fine

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370
probably be fine
 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.999
probably be fine
I mean extra introverts have a harder

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:12.009
I mean extra introverts have a harder
 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:14.129
I mean extra introverts have a harder
time speaking in front of groups but you

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139
time speaking in front of groups but you
 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:15.570
time speaking in front of groups but you
can learn to do that you know an

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580
can learn to do that you know an
 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.219
can learn to do that you know an
introvert can become a very successful

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229
introvert can become a very successful
 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.100
introvert can become a very successful
public speaker may not enjoy it the same

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110
public speaker may not enjoy it the same
 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.959
public speaker may not enjoy it the same
way that an extrovert might but that

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969
way that an extrovert might but that
 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.430
way that an extrovert might but that
doesn't mean that you can't learn those

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440
doesn't mean that you can't learn those
 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.219
doesn't mean that you can't learn those
skills and what I would recommend for an

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229
skills and what I would recommend for an
 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:27.600
skills and what I would recommend for an
introvert is the same thing that I do

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610
introvert is the same thing that I do
 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.550
introvert is the same thing that I do
when I'm lecturing is I never talk to

crowd is I'm always picking out

individuals in the group and talking

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590
individuals in the group and talking
 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.290
individuals in the group and talking
specifically to them so I'll make a

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300
specifically to them so I'll make a
 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.180
specifically to them so I'll make a
point to an individual and I watch their

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190
point to an individual and I watch their
 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.100
point to an individual and I watch their
face and see if they're nodding and

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110
face and see if they're nodding and
 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.810
face and see if they're nodding and
understanding right because that way you

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820
understanding right because that way you
 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.820
understanding right because that way you
make contact with the entire audience

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830
make contact with the entire audience
 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.920
make contact with the entire audience
and then you know I'll talk to someone

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930
and then you know I'll talk to someone
 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.960
and then you know I'll talk to someone
for about 15 seconds or so I don't want

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970
for about 15 seconds or so I don't want
 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.730
for about 15 seconds or so I don't want
to put them on the spot too much and

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740
to put them on the spot too much and
 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.350
to put them on the spot too much and
then I shift my attention to someone

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360
then I shift my attention to someone
 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.660
then I shift my attention to someone
else and I sort of pinpoint around the

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:54.670
else and I sort of pinpoint around the
 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.790
else and I sort of pinpoint around the
room that keeps everybody in the room

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800
room that keeps everybody in the room
 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.590
room that keeps everybody in the room
focused on what I'm saying because each

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600
focused on what I'm saying because each
 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.440
focused on what I'm saying because each
person reflects the entire crowd back to

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450
person reflects the entire crowd back to
 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.880
person reflects the entire crowd back to
you and so I would say if you're an

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890
you and so I would say if you're an
 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.770
you and so I would say if you're an
introvert or if you want to speak in

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780
introvert or if you want to speak in
 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.660
introvert or if you want to speak in
public in general forget about the damn

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:06.670
public in general forget about the damn
 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.760
public in general forget about the damn
crowd it doesn't exist

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770
crowd it doesn't exist
 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.430
crowd it doesn't exist
speak to people one at one at a time and

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440
speak to people one at one at a time and
 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.320
speak to people one at one at a time and
an introvert can do that just fine

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330
an introvert can do that just fine
 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.440
an introvert can do that just fine
so you know that's where your strength

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.450
so you know that's where your strength
 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.690
so you know that's where your strength
would be and I would say you're much

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:18.700
would be and I would say you're much
 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.720
would be and I would say you're much
more likely to be unsuccessful as a

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:21.730
more likely to be unsuccessful as a
 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.550
more likely to be unsuccessful as a
teacher if you don't work hard at it and

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560
teacher if you don't work hard at it and
 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.350
teacher if you don't work hard at it and
if you're not interested in and so if

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360
if you're not interested in and so if
 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.580
if you're not interested in and so if
you're an introvert I wouldn't worry

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590
you're an introvert I wouldn't worry
 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.100
you're an introvert I wouldn't worry
about that I don't think that that'll be

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110
about that I don't think that that'll be
 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:34.140
about that I don't think that that'll be
the biggest problem that you'll face so
