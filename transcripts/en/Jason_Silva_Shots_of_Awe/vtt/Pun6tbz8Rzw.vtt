00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:23.105
SUBJECT: Kevin Kelly has
a great line about humans

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:25.730
and our symbiotic
relationship with technology.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.909
He says, "We are the creators,
and we are the created."

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.450
Now, of course, this echoes this
notion of ontological design

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.210
in that everything that we
design is designing us back,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.580
that we have been in
a cybernetic feedback

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.340
loop with our technologies since
the beginning of early hominids

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.760
playing with stone tools and
inscribing their interior world

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.920
onto clay tablets with
little glyphs of meaning.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.800
The minute that we started
to extend our mindware out

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.270
into the world, we've been
turning the mind inside out.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.940
Technology is our second
skin, our exoskeleton.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.360
Literally, we are exteriorizing
our nervous system,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.629
our "mindware," as
McKenna likes to say.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.980
And we've been doing it forever.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.820
This is the most natural
thing in the world.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.270
it is what it means to be human.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.770
Right?

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.020
Kevin Kelly's beautiful
example is-- the moment

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.640
we discovered fire--
and thus, cooking-- we

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.134
all of a sudden created
an external stomach that

00:01:17.134 --> 00:01:19.936
could pre-digest our food
so that we could absorb

00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:22.100
that many more nutrients
from every meal

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.810
and not waste all this time
eating raw food all day long

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.540
just to basically
stay nourished.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.350
Instead, we're freeing
up cognitive real estate,

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.210
freeing the mind
for other endeavors.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.240
So essentially, externalizing
our stomach through fire

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.480
turned this technology
into a part of us

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.798
beyond our skin tissue,
in whose feedback

00:01:40.798 --> 00:01:42.900
loop and engagement
with that technology

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.470
opened up a new space for a
Cambrian explosion of mind.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.010
Fire and cooking
essentially made us human.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.700
But again, the larger metaphor
here, the larger message

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.790
here is that our symbiotic
relationships with these tools

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.580
actually is who we are.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.760
Our mind is distributed between
brains, tools, technologies,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.846
and environments.

00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:03.407
This is who we are.

00:02:03.407 --> 00:02:07.238
We are, as Andy Clark, says,
the "natural-born cyborg."

00:02:07.238 --> 00:02:10.106
We are the creators,
but we are the created.

00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:12.018
What we create is
creating us back.

00:02:12.018 --> 00:02:14.886
The "foodback loop" is
the symbol of life--

00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:16.590
not the DNA molecule.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.390
The feedback loop-- the loop.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.890
That's us.
