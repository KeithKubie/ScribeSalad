00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.590
- [Instructor] So what
we have depicted here.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:03.010
We have a block and let's say

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.260
that this block is completely stationary

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.720
and it's being pushed up against this

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.480
non-frictionless wall.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.330
So this wall does have
friction with the block.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.130
It's being pushed by this force

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.010
of magnitude F and its direction

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.520
makes an angle of theta
with the horizontal.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.250
What I want you to do is pause this video

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.700
and construct a free body diagram

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.430
for this block and include the

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.850
vertical and horizontal components

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.460
of this force right over here,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.600
but also include other things.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.450
Include the force, include the force

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.910
of gravity acting on this block.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.730
Include the force of friction

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.560
acting on this block and include

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.880
the normal force of the wall

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.610
acting on the block as well.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.103
Pause the video and
try to have a go at it.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.540
So before I even start to draw

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.130
the free body diagram, let's break down

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.990
this force into its vertical
and horizontal components.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.550
So the first thing,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.230
let me do its vertical component.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.310
So it would look like that,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.810
and it's horizontal component

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.023
would look like this.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.120
And so what's the magnitude
of the vertical component?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.130
Well it is opposite
this angle that we know.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.930
This is the angle that is theta

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.410
and so this is going to be,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.030
the vertical component is going to be

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.600
F sine of theta.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.990
We've seen that in previous videos

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.990
and it comes straight out

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.820
of right triangle trigonometry.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.530
Encourage you to review that
if this looks unfamiliar.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.990
And the magnitude of the
horizontal component,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.770
that is going to be F cosine theta.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.990
This side right over here is adjacent

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.860
to the angle, SOH CAH TOA.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.110
And now with that out of the way

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.380
we can draw our free body diagram.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.990
So let me draw that free body,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.090
let me draw that block and I'm really

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.480
just gonna focus on the block only.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.720
And we know a couple of
things that are going on.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.940
We know that we have
this horizontal force,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.293
F cosine theta, so let me draw that.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.670
So the magnitude there is F cosine theta.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.330
We know we have this vertical force,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.573
F sine theta, so let me draw that.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.310
So this would be F and that one

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.220
is actually a little bit shorter,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.480
it's obviously not drawn perfectly

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.480
to scale, but this would be F sine theta.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.690
Now let's think about these characters

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.770
right over here.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.780
We have the force of gravity

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.900
and so that's going to be acting downward.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.993
So it would look something like this.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.670
So we have, and it would
have magnitude F sub g.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.080
I'm not drawing the arrow now because

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.110
I'm just talking about
the magnitude of this vector.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.340
Here I'm referring to the entire vector,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.010
I'm referring to its
magnitude and direction.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.080
Now what about the force of friction?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.920
Let's assume that we're in a situation

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.970
where the magnitude of
the vertical component

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.075
of this applied force, F sine theta

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:15.080
is less than the magnitude

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.110
of the force of gravity.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.320
Well in that situation
if there was no friction,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.330
the block would start
accelerating downward,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.060
because you would have
a net force downward.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.360
We haven't talked about the forces

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.760
to the left and right yet.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.720
But as we mentioned,
this thing is stationary

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.500
and the force of friction is going

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.470
to act against the direction of motion.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.410
And so in this situation,
the force of friction

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.930
will act upwards, so we would have a force

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.760
of friction just like that and its

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.520
magnitude would be F sub lowercase f.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.460
And then last but not least what about

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.000
the normal force?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.990
Well if this block is not accelerating

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.540
in any direction that means

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.440
that the normal force must perfectly

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.960
counteract this force to the right

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.100
which is the horizontal component

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.630
of this applied force.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.420
And so our normal force is going

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.640
to go to the left and
it would look like this.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.890
So it's magnitude is F sub capital N.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.740
So there you have it,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.640
we have drawn a free body diagram

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.660
for this scenario right over here.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.210
If these two were equal, then you would

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.470
have no force of friction

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.470
or the force of friction would be zero.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.260
There would be nothing for
it to be counteracting.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.290
These two would perfectly cancel out.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.510
And if the magnitude of
the vertical component

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.980
of the applied force were greater

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.040
than the force of
gravity without friction,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.990
it would start to accelerate upwards

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.370
and so the force of friction would

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.510
act against that motion,

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.250
but let's just go with this
scenario right over here

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.191
and start to appreciate why

00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:45.880
free body diagrams are so useful.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.670
Because we can start to set up equations

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.530
that relate these magnitudes.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.500
We can say look if this
box is not accelerating

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.960
in any way, there's zero net forces

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.180
in the horizontal and
the vertical directions,

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.270
well then we could say that F sub N

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.320
completely counteracts
F times cosine of theta.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.050
So we could say F sub N is equal to,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.090
is equal to F cosine theta,

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.620
and we could also say that F sine theta,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.350
F sine theta plus the magnitude

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.910
of the force of friction.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.880
Plus the magnitude of
the force of friction

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.900
that these would completely counteract

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.960
the magnitude of the force of gravity,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.270
because it's going in
the opposite direction.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.340
So these would be equal to F sub g.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.840
So once you set up equations like this,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.860
if you know all but
one of these variables,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.660
you can figure out the other ones

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.713
which is very useful in physics.
