00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
For this project I’m going to show you how
to make a water balloon slingshot that’ll

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.850
give you power and prestige while defending
and dominating your next water fight. This

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.070
sling-bow will lob water bombs over 150 feet
away and wreak havoc on friends and family.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.590
Not to mention, it’ll shoot up to 3 balloons
at a time.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.800
Let’s start this project with a trip to
the hardware store for 1/2” PVC tubing

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.919
and handful of sprinkler fittings. These adaptors
are all pretty standard, and you should be

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.599
able to find them at a home improvement, or
sprinkler supply outlet, near you.

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.910
I went ahead and cut the tubing into 1-3/4”,
2”, 5”, and 10” pieces so we can jump

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.110
right in and get busy connecting them all
together.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.730
Now just like any PVC project it’s a really good
idea to dry-fit everything together just to

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.660
make sure all the pieces are going to fit,
before you glue them together.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.870
And it’s a good idea to practice putting
an angle on the bow forks first, by propping

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.670
the handle on a small box, then simply pushing
the prongs down on either side until they

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.530
touch the table. This will angle both sides
symmetrically, without the need for any precision instruments.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.290
The basic frame for your sling-bow should
look something like this, and if it does,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.350
then the next step, is to cement it together,
so it can take some abuse.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.830
To make my connections, I’m using a fast
set cement because it’s lightening fast

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.000
when it sets, and doesn’t require a primer
to clean the connections first.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.490
However, it’s really important to follow
the directions on the back to make sure your

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.080
connections are as strong as possible, because
you don’t want your bow breaking under pressure.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.700
Cement it together one connection at a time
and be prepared to work quickly, because once

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.330
two pieces touch, you’ll only have about
5 seconds to get them into place before they

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.840
lock up, and won’t move anymore.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.320
That’s why using a box to help set
the angle, can make all the difference in

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.979
whether you get them into position with enough
time to spare.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.539
Now you can see I glued all the pieces together
except for the two inside tubes, and that’s important.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.600
We’ll glue these together in a minute, but
for now, make sure to keep them separate.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.640
In the mean-time, let’s take our bow frame
to the next level with a couple cans of spray paint.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.909
Of course I colored mine black and yellow,
but you can paint yours any color you want.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.500
Or even use Duck Tape to make a quick and
easy custom wrap, like we did for the Laser

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.000
Blowgun. You’ll see how to make this in
another project video.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.270
Ok, now that we’ve got our custom colors,
we’re ready to add the sling.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.170
I found a 50” workout band in the sporting
goods section of a local super center, and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.569
coincidentally, it’s black and yellow as
well, which matches my color scheme perfectly.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.739
These bands have a handle at either end, which
we won’t actually need. So go ahead and

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.069
chop them off with a pair of scissors, but
don’t throw them away just yet. Let’s

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.959
salvage the padded foam handles, and repurpose
them for our sling bow instead.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.719
Cut the strap off the handles and carefully
pull the padding off so you’re left with

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.669
just the foam exteriors.

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.709
Twist them onto the outside of the 1/2”
PVC pipe, and you should find they make a

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.319
perfect fit, and stretch the entire length
of the tubes.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.349
Now before we glue the handles back onto the
frame we actually need to roll the ends of

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.109
the foam down a little so they’re out of
the way. Both sides should be folded back

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.859
so there’s enough space to glue the ends,
without any glue touching the foam.

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.479
If there is, then go ahead and apply the cement
to the connections, and twist them together like you did the others.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.079
Do the same thing with all four connections,
and give it about 2 minutes for the cement

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.029
to begin curing, then unroll the ends of the
foam so they overlap part of the PVC Tee,

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.049
which you can see, gives us a nice handle
grip.

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.499
With the padded foam handles in place, the
frame is finished and looking good, so let’s

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.620
move on to making the sling next.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.219
We need a way to join the two ends of the
rubber tubing together, and I found a really

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.040
effective way to do that is with a disposable
pen.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.150
Take the pen apart and cut two to three inches
off the tube, then carefully use one of the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.639
blades on your scissors to score angled markings
down the sides. Do this as many times as you

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.159
can on both ends, making sure the plastic
is scored at about a 45º angle away from the tips.

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.859
Now it’s going to take a bit of effort,
but you need to push half of the pen inside

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.659
the tubing, so apply some pressure and wiggle
it around, and eventually it’ll slide into place.

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.859
Push the other end of the tubing on the same
way until both pieces butt up next to each

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.689
other and become one. It should be hard to
tell where they join, and if you pull them

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.349
apart as hard as you can, the grooves in the
pen should lock onto the rubber, and prevent

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.389
the joint from coming apart.

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.249
Alright now that we’ve got an enormous homemade
rubber band, it’s time to make the launching

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.639
pouch, and all we’ll need for that, is a
roll of Duck Tape.

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.109
Most Duck Tape is 2” wide, and we need 4
strips cut around 18” long. While you’re

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.649
here, cut 4 more strips about 14” as well.

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:05.600
Carefully overlap the longer strips just a
bit, and press them together so you can effectively

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.769
double the width of the tape. If you do that
with all 4 pieces, you should end up with

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.549
a nice large piece of Duck Tape fabric, with
the sticky side facing up.

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.250
Now just for convenience, I marked the tape
so you can see where everything will get attached,

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.870
and if you center two of the 14” strips
facing down, and press them into place, you

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.370
should be left with 4” exposed in the center,
and 5” on the sides.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.650
Carefully wrap the tape around to the backside
and press it smooth, but keep the two black

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.920
strips facing upward, because we’ll need
them for attaching this to the tubing next.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.810
Now bring back the big rubber band and stretch
it sideways, so the bands lay exactly on top

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.220
of the black strips, and double check that
the pen tube connection is in the center.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.780
Fold one side of the material over the tube,
and press the sticky side down so it adheres

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.030
to the inner pad, then smooth the tape until
it’s flat. The other side gets folded over

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.420
next, and smoothed down as well the same way.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.430
Alright, the pouch is nearly done, and you
can see how this design let’s it slide freely

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.560
up and down the band, making it easily adjustable.
The only thing our launcher needs now, is a handle.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.140
Grab the last two strips of Duck Tape and
fold one of the strips lengthwise into thirds,

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.660
then wrap the other piece of tape around it
to make it even stronger.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.410
Now cut 2 slits in the center of the pouch
about 2” from either end, so you can weave

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.290
the strap through both of the holes. And when
you pull it flat, it should look like this.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.340
Trim the ends of the strap, so that when you
fold them in toward the middle, they meet

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.040
the edge of the handle in the center.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.470
Surprisingly, all it takes to hold them securely
in place, is a 5” strip of tape. So just

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.180
lay one overtop, and press it down smooth.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.720
Our launcher is finished and looking good,
so let’s go ahead and attach it to the bow.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.840
Start by lining the ends of the tubing up
with the grooves in the tips of the bow, then

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.950
double check that the tubing is symetrical
with the pouch exactly in the center.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.640
Grab one side and stretch the rubber down
as hard as you can, rocking it back and forth

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.520
so it slips inside the groove. Then use something
like a 4” cable strap to pinch the tubes

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.060
tightly together at the bottom.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.000
Now simply cut the ends off the zip-ties,
making sure they’re smooth, and double check

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.520
the rubber is held firmly in the grooves at
the tip. If they are, then you’re done, and ready for action.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.880
I thought it would be fun, to test my Skyblaster
Slingshot, on a recent camping trip with some friends and family.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.240
If you look closely at the pouch when it gets
pulled back, you’ll see it automatically

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.520
cups itself, which means it’ll grip onto
balls or water balloons securely, until they’re released.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.650
Just for fun I just loaded up a bucket with
over 100 water balloons ready for blasting,

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.470
so we could have some fun and test it out.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.560
The slingshot gets loaded by placing a water
balloon in the pouch while it’s facing upward.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.430
Pull back to lock onto it, then fire when
ready. With only a bit of effort, you’ll

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.340
be able to send balloons soaring high into
the sky, and up to 150 feet away.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.750
To get the best leverage, try shooting it
like a bow, and as you practice, your shots

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.070
can get incredibly powerful, and impressively
accurate as well.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.340
I tried going for distance, and you can see
this one landed 168 feet away. And I’m confident

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.840
that some of you, will get them even farther
than that.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.370
If you want even more power, try laying on
your back and resting your feet on the prongs,

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.270
to send your payload even further.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.270
Now depending on which kind of resistance
bands you get, you’ll be able to make sling-bows

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.740
any custom color scheme you want. And what’s
really cool is you can make as many as you

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.300
want for around $10 bucks each. But check
this out.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.860
I found a box of two, slightly shorter resistance
tubes for the same price as one long one,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.580
which means you can effectively cut the cost
of the rubber in half, and make two slingshots for the price of one.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.120
And just for fun I rigged up a Duck Tape arm
band, that slides down over the frame and

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.639
holds the contraption tightly to my arm, which
prevents the end from kicking out on release.

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:22.139
The sling-bow will launch up to 3 balloons
simultaneously. But if you’re thinking of

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:26.000
shooting them at friends or family, there’s
something you need to know first. The balloons

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.920
hit hard enough to leave welts. So make sure
anyone being used for target practice is ok

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.030
with with it, before you open fire.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.090
And if you’re not in the mood to get anyone
wet, try using your sling-bow to launch one

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.940
of the Sky Balls,f we made in another project
video. You’ll see they open up around 40

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.730
or 50 feet high in the air, and are guaranteed
outdoor fun for everyone. So keep an eye out

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.990
for how to make these Sky Balls, in another
video.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.320
Well now you know how to convert Duck Tape
and resistance rubber, into a powerful water

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.570
balloon slingshot. And if you don’t want
to spend money on workout bands, you can always

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.900
try modifying a bag of rubber bands instead.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.010
I quickly braided 100 of them into a rubber
rope that makes an impressively effective

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.210
and low budget alternative.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.570
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
project perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
