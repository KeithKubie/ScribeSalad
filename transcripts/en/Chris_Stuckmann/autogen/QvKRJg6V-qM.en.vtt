which is the best way to do CGI is when
you<00:09:17.680><c> blend</c><00:09:17.920><c> it</c><00:09:18.130><c> with</c><00:09:18.250><c> something</c><00:09:18.610><c> that's</c>

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:18.730 align:start position:0%
you blend it with something that's

you blend it with something that's
actually<00:09:18.880><c> there</c><00:09:19.269><c> it</c><00:09:19.839><c> makes</c><00:09:20.019><c> it</c><00:09:20.199><c> easier</c><00:09:20.740><c> to</c>

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
