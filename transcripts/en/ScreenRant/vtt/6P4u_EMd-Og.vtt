00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.370
The audition process for an actor can be time
consuming, and soul crushing, but casting

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.420
is ultimately dependent on a filmmaker’s
vision.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.911
Even after an actor is selected for a prime
role in a major motion picture, there are

00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:19.630
still no guarantees when it comes to the final
product.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.810
Here are 10 Famous Actors who were fired from
their Movie production.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.590
Anne Hathaway, Knocked Up
Anne Hathaway has pushed herself in many ways

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.429
to achieve the success she has had as an actress.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.050
She has filmed nude scenes in Havoc and Love
and Other Drugs.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.020
She committed to shaving her head and singing
live for Les Miserable, which contributed

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.490
to her Academy Award win.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.140
However, filming a graphic birthing scene
in Knocked Up was the line she did not want

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.220
to cross.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.930
Originally cast as Alison Scott opposite Seth
Rogen in the 2007 comedy, Hathaway was on

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.340
board completely until director Judd Apatow
explained his plans for a realistic birthing

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.290
scene.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.699
Hathaway refused which led to Apatow replacing
her with Katherine Heigl.

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.940
Ryan Gosling, The Lovely Bones
Ryan Gosling is known for being a serious

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.970
actor who is dedicated to his craft.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.290
Perhaps, his earlier roles as Young Hercules
or his work on The New Mickey Mouse Club inspired

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.040
him to grow as a true thespian.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.110
Gosling was originally cast as the grieving
father in the film adaptation of Alice Sebold’s

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.979
best seller, The Lovely Bones.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.670
After Peter Jackson fired him, rumors surfaced
that he was let go simply because he was much

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.930
too young to realistically play a father of
two teenagers.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.720
However, it was later revealed that Jackson
fired him because he arrived on the set 60

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.380
pounds heavier and sported a full bushy beard.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.570
Gosling had his own idea concerning his character’s
appearance and that idea did not jive with

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.570
Jackson’s vision.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.110
Jackson replaced Gosling with the more easy-going
and susceptible to advice, Mark Wahlberg.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.760
Anthony Michael Hall, Full Metal Jacket
After years of playing the nerd in films like

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.799
Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, Anthony
Michael Hall was set to branch out by playing

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.810
Private Joker in Full Metal Jacket.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.750
The war film was a departure from his typical
teen fair and it was his chance to expand

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.860
as an actor with a more dramatic performance.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.469
He was also going to be working with legendary
filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who was not known

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.990
to be as soft and fuzzy as John Hughes.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.530
After being cast, Hall took his sweet time
finalizing his contract.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.660
After eight months of negotiations, Kubrick
decided that he was tired of waiting for Hall

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.980
and fired him instead.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.860
The role went to Matthew Modine.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.819
Apparently, Kubrick wasn’t willing to play
childish games.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.810
Richard Gere, Lords of Flatbush
Lords of Flatbush is one of Sylvester Stallone’s

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.610
first films and features an ensemble of young
actors playing street hoods.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.590
Richard Gere was given one of his first roles
for the film as well.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.130
It should have been an ideal opportunity for
two actors on the brink of fame to complement

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.280
each other with their performances.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.950
When the cameras weren’t rolling, the two
actors were constantly at odds.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.300
Stallone found Gere to be more of a detriment
than a necessity for the film.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.630
The future Rocky Balboa let the director know
that he was going to have to quit or they

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.260
were going to have to fire Gere.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.849
Gere was let go from the production and there
is no evidence that the two actors ever reconciled

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.269
their differences.

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.970
Megan Fox, Transformers: Dark of the Moon
Megan Fox began her career playing the mean

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.769
girl to the likes of Lindsay Lohan and the
Olsen Twins.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.099
She also played a typical teenager on the
sitcom Hope and Faith.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.230
Though she was building a hefty resume’,
it was not until she was cast as Shia LaBeouf’s

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.700
love interest in Transformers that her name
was tossed around the media Hollywood’s

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.730
next “It girl”.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.490
Most would assume that Fox would be grateful
to Michael Bay for casting her as the sexy

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.280
female lead in a big budget spectacle.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.870
If she was grateful, she had a strange way
of showing it when she compared Bay to Adolph

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.290
Hitler during a press tour.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.010
While Bay was willing to overlook the name-calling
and accept it as a poorly worded joke on Fox’s

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.230
part, producer Steven Spielberg found the
comments unforgivable.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.781
He made the suggestion to fire Fox and replace
her with another beautiful actress for the

00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:45.500
third installment, Dark of the Moon, which
is exactly what Bay did.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.000
Sylvester Stallone, Beverly Hills Cop
Beverly Hills Cop is a classic 80s comedy

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.040
that showcased Eddie Murphy’s hilarious
comedic chops and gave a generation a new

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.489
prank involving a banana and a tailpipe.

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.380
Now imagine Sylvester Stallone as Axel Foley.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.180
It seems hard to believe but Stallone was
originally cast as the quick-talking cop.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.840
Stallone apparently had a problem with the
film, as he thought there was too much humor.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.980
He took it upon himself to rewrite the script.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.540
Director, Martin Brest accepted that Stallone
had a completely different direction he wanted

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.340
to go with the film but once he suggested
his own script, Brest decided to just get

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.720
rid of Stallone altogether.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.160
Luckily for audiences, the jokes stayed intact
and Beverly Hills Cop became what is arguably

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.350
Eddie Murphy’s best film.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.010
Edward Norton, The Avengers
Edward Norton may be a talented actor but

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.050
he certainly has a reputation for being difficult
on set.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.760
After Eric Bana was given tepid reviews for
the depressing 2003 The Hulk, Bruce Banner

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.930
was recast for an entire revamp.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.100
Norton’s The Incredible Hulk was well-received
by critics and audiences but that was still

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.470
not enough for Joss Whedon to welcome Norton
to play the role for The Avengers.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.890
Writer and Director Whedon wanted a much more
laid back atmosphere amongst the actors for

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.090
the film and knew that allowing Norton to
continue the role would just be far too difficult.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.410
Whedon went with the much more amiable Mark
Ruffalo to play the scientist with the bad

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.160
temper.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.820
Stuart Townsend, The Lord of the Rings
Stuart Townsend may not be as famous as the

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.480
other actors on our list, but the Irish actor
has been around the block for some time.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.250
When he was cast in Peter Jackson’s epic
trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, audiences

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.980
would certainly know his name.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.750
Unfortunately, the actor was fired before
that possibility was ever realized.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.390
After two months of horse training and rehearsals
with the other actors, Jackson decided that

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.160
Townsend was just too young to play the character
of Aragorn.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.390
Rather than aging Townsend, he decided to
hand him his walking papers.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.630
Viggo Mortensen, who is fourteen years older
than Townsend took on the role instead.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.600
While it may be hard to picture anyone else
playing Aragorn, it is too bad Jackson did

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:49.880
not realize this before casting someone else
first.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.430
Eric Stoltz, Back to the Future
Eric Stoltz is a prolific actor who has worked

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.940
in film, television, on stage, and behind
the camera for over three decades.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.620
He is known as a professional and agreeable
person.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.880
Even when an actor is incredibly talented
and plays well with others, there is still

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.600
the possibility that a role is just not a
good fit.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.380
As was the case with Back to the Future.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.220
Stoltz was cast as Marty McFly but was replaced
by Michael J. Fox who was more adept at comedy

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.740
thanks to his role on the sitcom Family Ties.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.680
Back to the Future producers, including Steven
Spielberg, decided that Stoltz was just not

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.220
funny enough to play Marty.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.680
Stoltz had already filmed half of the movie
but he was still replaced.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.990
Stoltz has no hard feelings about being let
go.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.960
In the end there was no one better who could
play Marty Mcfly than Michael J. Fox.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.020
Christian Bale, American Psycho
American Psycho, the film based on Bret Easton

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.840
Ellis’s novel, would not be the same without
the icy emotionless performance of Christian

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.840
Bale.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.340
The homicidal Patrick Bateman was almost going
to be played by Leonardo DiCaprio but that

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.970
was only after Bale was fired.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.780
In 1998, the director and producers decided
to cast Christian Bale.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.310
Once they heard that Leonardo DiCaprio was
interested in the role, Lionsgate announced

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.000
at the Cannes Film Festival that he would
be playing the role of Bateman.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.750
It was an unfortunate way for Bale to find
out that he had been fired from production

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.620
in pursuance of a more popular actor.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.430
As pre-production continued, DiCaprio decided
that he didn’t like the script, or the plot,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.870
or anything about American Psycho and walked
away from the film in favor of a different

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.870
project.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:33.690
Fortunately, the script fell back into the
hands of the future Dark Knight.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.190
What do you think of our list?

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.370
