00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.620
The answer is Yes for both languages.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.620
We just count up the number of states in
the machine, and compare this to 100.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.770
And that gives us a decision both ways.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.370
Note that this doesn't involve
actually running M at all.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.400
And because both L and

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.490
its complement are recognizable,
this language is decidable.
