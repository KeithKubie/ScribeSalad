00:00:06.612 --> 00:00:08.770
Sal: Well I just wanted
to introduce everyone

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.651
to Angela Ahrendts.

00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:12.658
Just as a little bit of background

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:14.241
on how all of this happened.

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:18.477
You all know I was just
in England two weeks ago

00:00:18.477 --> 00:00:22.815
and as part of that you came to the talk

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:24.534
at the London School of Economics

00:00:24.534 --> 00:00:27.826
and then the next day we
met at Heathrow Airport.

00:00:27.826 --> 00:00:28.848
Angela: Yup.

00:00:28.848 --> 00:00:31.956
Sal: I had my $6 Old Navy
shirt feeling very insecure

00:00:31.956 --> 00:00:33.872
the entire time.
(Angela laughs)

00:00:33.872 --> 00:00:37.400
Both Esther and I were
there and you inspired us.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.955
When you said you're
going to be in this area

00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:43.855
we're like well we would love you to do

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:45.299
the same thing with the team

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.759
just talk about what you're
doing etcetera, etcetera.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:49.547
If you could talk a little
bit about just how you ...

00:00:49.547 --> 00:00:51.390
I mean fashion, the world
of fashion is this world,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.685
I mean it's not obvious to most people

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:55.646
how does someone get in to it

00:00:55.646 --> 00:00:58.085
and especially get to the
level that you've gotten.

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:01.755
How did you start and what kind of,

00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:03.960
at least at the early stages
allowed you to get here?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.064
Angela: I mean honestly
it's not a dissimilar story

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:07.116
to yours, right?

00:01:07.116 --> 00:01:09.242
My thing is you ...

00:01:09.242 --> 00:01:11.796
I think the greatest
thing that anybody can do

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:14.557
when they're young is
discover their passion

00:01:14.557 --> 00:01:15.581
and what they love.

00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:17.478
I know it sounds really, really terrible

00:01:17.478 --> 00:01:19.100
but I love stuff and I love to shop

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.565
and I love fashion magazines
and I love to sow and create.

00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:25.128
It was the only industry
I had to get in to

00:01:25.128 --> 00:01:26.460
but I went to university

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.069
and signed up for all these design classes

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.833
and realized I really
wasn't that creative.

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:33.279
I had a really strong opinion

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:34.738
on what everybody else was doing.

00:01:34.738 --> 00:01:38.453
I had a professor say that
we call you a merchant.

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:44.061
I'm like "Okay" and so then I signed up

00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:46.571
for a lot of merchandising
and marketing courses.

00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:49.863
My university degree is in
merchandising and marketing.

00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:52.663
In the world of what we do I always say

00:01:52.663 --> 00:01:53.996
I'm the monkey in the middle.

00:01:53.996 --> 00:01:56.091
We have Christopher Bailey
who's the Chief Creative Officer

00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:57.990
and he is so creative and so brilliant

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.301
and his whole creative
team does all those videos

00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:02.672
but then, so that's on my right

00:02:02.672 --> 00:02:05.613
and on my left we have the
chief financial officer,

00:02:05.613 --> 00:02:07.107
we have our chief operating officer,

00:02:07.107 --> 00:02:09.375
we have a number of our teams

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:10.988
that have just arrived as well.

00:02:10.988 --> 00:02:14.015
You have this balance so
I will say I'm a 50, 50.

00:02:14.015 --> 00:02:16.826
I am half left brain analytical,

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:18.307
I am half right brain creative

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:19.856
and that was actually one of the reasons

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:21.783
that I wanted to chat with Sal.

00:02:21.783 --> 00:02:24.160
Because I said someday as you guys

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.396
start to take over the world,

00:02:25.396 --> 00:02:26.634
you're going to have to also

00:02:26.634 --> 00:02:29.026
start to introduce some
right brain curriculum

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:31.699
and the Burberry
Foundation would be honored

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.881
to help you start creating
some of those things

00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:36.021
when you're already down
the road [unintelligible].

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:37.268
Sal: Yeah, and no we're
already starting a little bit

00:02:37.268 --> 00:02:38.348
and we could talk more about that.

00:02:38.348 --> 00:02:40.452
No, absolutely and I think ...

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:41.885
I mean say you're not creative,

00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:44.265
I mean that I think you're
really underselling your …

00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:47.248
Angela: Yeah, the design creative.

00:02:47.248 --> 00:02:50.453
Sal: You obviously had
a very strong aesthetic,

00:02:50.453 --> 00:02:54.994
you had a sense for what connective …

00:02:54.994 --> 00:02:58.298
Angela: Yeah, again I'm
absolutely a merchant

00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:00.330
and I will tell you the
reason Christopher and I

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.572
created the foundation is this,

00:03:01.572 --> 00:03:03.433
because we are both creative thinkers.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.018
Sal: Right.

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:07.206
Angela: We feel very
strongly that the curriculum

00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:10.462
specifically in America
has become so left brain,

00:03:10.462 --> 00:03:12.307
so much of the arts and
things have been cut out.

00:03:12.307 --> 00:03:14.891
It is I think for where the world's going

00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:16.473
we need creative thinkers.

00:03:16.473 --> 00:03:18.499
We need and so many times
they're getting lost

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.071
out of the system, so we
created the Burberry Foundation.

00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:23.771
We give 1% of our profits
into the Burberry Foundation

00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:27.002
and what we do is, we
try and pick up the youth

00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:29.053
that is starting to fall out of the system

00:03:29.053 --> 00:03:31.970
because they think they're
dumb because they don't.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.092
Hopefully we can help
turn them on to you guys

00:03:34.092 --> 00:03:35.090
to help them.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.233
If they're still just not left brain

00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:38.762
but they're incredibly creative thinking.

00:03:38.762 --> 00:03:40.624
We bring as many of them as we can.

00:03:40.624 --> 00:03:43.231
We show them a whole another world

00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:45.472
that companies like us need

00:03:45.472 --> 00:03:47.370
and that's been our calling.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.997
Sal: Yeah, I know it's incredible.

00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:51.023
I mean you yourself you said,

00:03:51.023 --> 00:03:52.237
“Okay I'll be a merchant”.

00:03:52.237 --> 00:03:53.497
A professor tells you this

00:03:53.497 --> 00:03:55.916
and you just go to New York

00:03:55.916 --> 00:03:59.212
and then you're not even 30

00:03:59.212 --> 00:04:00.885
and you're the president of Donna Karan?

00:04:00.885 --> 00:04:02.630
(Angela laughs)
Is that right?

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.900
Angela: Yeah.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.917
Sal: How does that happen?

00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:11.215
Is that normal?

00:04:11.215 --> 00:04:13.609
Are there a lot of 20 something's

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.545
running a major fashion
houses in the world?

00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:20.586
Angela: Probably not and I
will tell you I'm really guilty

00:04:20.586 --> 00:04:22.467
because I'm not great
talking about myself,

00:04:22.467 --> 00:04:25.272
I'm just not because
I'm only as good always

00:04:25.272 --> 00:04:26.936
as the great teams that are around me

00:04:26.936 --> 00:04:28.307
and no different than you guys.

00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:31.771
Yes, I think what happens always

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.416
is when you discover who you are

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:35.387
and you discover your passion

00:04:35.387 --> 00:04:37.834
and then it's not work at your life

00:04:37.834 --> 00:04:41.352
and so you just get in to that zone.

00:04:41.352 --> 00:04:44.934
I was so fortunate that
met the right people,

00:04:44.934 --> 00:04:46.238
things fell into place,

00:04:46.238 --> 00:04:48.876
absolutely worked my butt
off because I was single,

00:04:48.876 --> 00:04:50.621
alone in New York and why not.

00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:55.723
It's all I did was, but I
found my zone, I found …

00:04:55.723 --> 00:04:57.559
Sal: Was there a moment where …

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:01.070
I just find if a member
of my family says "Hey,"

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.130
"I'm going to go to New York"

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.549
"and I'm going to go work in fashion,"

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:06.018
like "Okay, I'll see if
I can help support you"

00:05:06.018 --> 00:05:07.654
"at some point or …"

00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:10.770
Just the left brain, the
left brain side of me.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.226
I mean how did you break in

00:05:14.226 --> 00:05:16.610
and then obviously left
such a big mark with people

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.537
that by the time you weren't even 30

00:05:18.537 --> 00:05:23.100
you're a president of a
major fashion organization?

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.386
Angela: It's funny, I don't
think of any different

00:05:25.386 --> 00:05:27.897
than a great athlete or a musician or a …

00:05:27.897 --> 00:05:29.255
I think that what happens

00:05:29.255 --> 00:05:30.911
is this is all what I've ever done.

00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:33.066
I've always just stayed in my lane

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.845
and then you become ...

00:05:35.845 --> 00:05:38.122
Whether you're a footballer
or whether you're ...

00:05:38.122 --> 00:05:40.526
I didn't jump around,
this is all that I've done

00:05:40.526 --> 00:05:43.802
and I have always been
so passionate about it.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.555
I think when you direct your energy

00:05:45.555 --> 00:05:46.779
and you become so passionate

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.921
and you unite people, right?

00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:51.276
You lead people all around
believing in something

00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:53.644
and then things just fall into place.

00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:56.173
I know that, and when I say things,

00:05:56.173 --> 00:05:58.783
the revenue, the profit, right?

00:05:58.783 --> 00:06:01.231
I never went in saying,
"I'm going to do this".

00:06:01.231 --> 00:06:04.999
I went in saying, "What if we did this?"

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:09.581
I've always been a dreamer.

00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:11.245
My father used to always say,

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:13.099
"Take off your rose-colored glasses"

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:14.436
and I would always say "No".

00:06:15.205 --> 00:06:17.253
Now I don't have to, I can keep dreaming

00:06:17.253 --> 00:06:19.691
but the important thing
I've learned is though

00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:21.986
I have to get enough people, right?

00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:24.146
I have to surround
myself with enough people

00:06:24.146 --> 00:06:26.223
that can help execute that dream now

00:06:26.223 --> 00:06:29.498
and that's all that I've ever done.

00:06:29.498 --> 00:06:30.846
I don't want to over simplify it

00:06:30.846 --> 00:06:33.116
but I found my zone,

00:06:33.116 --> 00:06:35.474
I absolutely love what I do,

00:06:35.474 --> 00:06:36.849
it is not work at all.

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:39.124
I have never once woke
up in the morning said,

00:06:39.124 --> 00:06:40.549
"Oh God, I got to go to work".

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:42.663
It's not work, this is my life.

00:06:42.663 --> 00:06:44.911
Everywhere that I've been

00:06:44.911 --> 00:06:47.461
because it's not work

00:06:47.461 --> 00:06:51.483
and the Monterey at Burberry

00:06:51.483 --> 00:06:53.292
or anywhere that I've been

00:06:53.292 --> 00:06:56.358
because the stronger companies get

00:06:56.358 --> 00:06:58.780
then the more they can do

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.732
and the bigger influence they have.

00:07:00.732 --> 00:07:02.756
At Burberry we've always said

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:06.789
that we have the power to
touch and transform lives

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:08.302
through the power of our performance.

00:07:08.302 --> 00:07:10.460
The bigger and the stronger we get,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.440
the more we can do

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.914
and that's just always been ...

00:07:12.914 --> 00:07:14.761
I'm from the heart of Midwest,

00:07:14.761 --> 00:07:18.835
real strong family faith up bringing

00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:22.192
and I have been raised to give.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.550
That's how I was raised

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.987
and so why wouldn't you
apply that back in business

00:07:26.987 --> 00:07:28.715
and so it just ...

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:31.437
Sal: I think you are underselling
yourself a little bit

00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:34.010
Angela: Thank you.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.603
I do want because the
interesting about this

00:07:37.603 --> 00:07:39.003
and why we video them is I think

00:07:39.003 --> 00:07:40.631
just the Khan Academy user base,

00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:42.128
there's a lot of young people out there

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.585
who would say "How do I do that?"

00:07:44.585 --> 00:07:47.946
If you had advice for
someone who's 16 years old

00:07:47.946 --> 00:07:51.266
or 20 years old and they
find this world intriguing,

00:07:51.266 --> 00:07:54.408
what should they develop in themselves?

00:07:54.408 --> 00:07:56.496
How should they think about the world

00:07:56.496 --> 00:07:58.060
and what should they do?

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.178
Angela: Well, and I always say

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.755
to the fashion industry is deceiving

00:08:00.755 --> 00:08:02.993
because everybody just thinks
it's only this creative part

00:08:02.993 --> 00:08:04.586
where in a company like Burberry

00:08:04.586 --> 00:08:06.602
there are 18 different departments

00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:08.042
that comprise the company.

00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:11.227
We need, we hire a lot of
people from Silicon Valley.

00:08:11.227 --> 00:08:13.226
We need great, we have 130 people

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:15.205
just in the IT department in the company.

00:08:15.205 --> 00:08:18.354
People don't realize that
so we need extreme right

00:08:18.354 --> 00:08:19.658
and we need extreme left.

00:08:19.658 --> 00:08:22.034
I think sometimes the fashion
industry gets a short,

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:24.284
it's the short stick
sometimes when they think

00:08:24.284 --> 00:08:26.749
"It's just fashion, it's just ..."

00:08:28.056 --> 00:08:30.086
In order to create and here's my thing

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:32.425
I always say that what we're doing

00:08:32.425 --> 00:08:36.142
is we're creating a great
brand and a great company

00:08:36.142 --> 00:08:39.013
and we happen to the
in business of fashion.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.638
We didn't set out to create
a really great fashion,

00:08:42.638 --> 00:08:45.931
we set out to create a great brand.

00:08:47.115 --> 00:08:50.508
I say that because there's
a part of me that says

00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:52.139
that is your mission as well.

00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:54.424
Sal: I mean following on that

00:08:54.424 --> 00:08:55.532
but I do want to think about,

00:08:55.532 --> 00:08:58.587
well what in your mind is,
what does a brand mean?

00:08:58.587 --> 00:09:00.155
I've heard multiple definitions of a brand

00:09:00.155 --> 00:09:02.026
and how would you view Burberry's brand

00:09:02.026 --> 00:09:05.320
and how would you view
our brand in the same,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.633
they're very similar.

00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:09.031
(Angela laughing)

00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.298
Exploring a line of overcoats.

00:09:12.328 --> 00:09:15.378
Angela: To me a great
brand and here's my thing,

00:09:15.378 --> 00:09:17.925
think of yourself and when
you interact with products.

00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:20.139
What coffee do you drink every morning

00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:22.497
or you might walk into Starbucks

00:09:22.497 --> 00:09:24.037
or you might walk in the ...

00:09:24.037 --> 00:09:27.706
You might have Apple
products, you might ...

00:09:27.706 --> 00:09:30.659
How do you feel about

00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:33.296
and so you want to be a part of that brand

00:09:33.296 --> 00:09:36.004
because you're proud to
be a part of that brand

00:09:36.004 --> 00:09:38.388
because that brand makes
you feel a certain way.

00:09:38.388 --> 00:09:41.258
You trust that brand and it's authentic

00:09:41.258 --> 00:09:43.148
and it doesn't ever let you down.

00:09:43.148 --> 00:09:44.867
It exceeds your expectations

00:09:44.867 --> 00:09:47.337
so you want to engage with it, right?

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:50.901
Those are all of the
attributes of a great brand,

00:09:50.901 --> 00:09:55.075
honesty, integrity, authenticity, quality

00:09:55.075 --> 00:09:58.208
but always doing what you …

00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:04.092
To have a great engagement
or what's the word ...

00:10:04.092 --> 00:10:06.961
Great brand presence,

00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:10.662
there has to be a very
trusting relationship

00:10:10.662 --> 00:10:12.766
with your constituency.

00:10:12.766 --> 00:10:14.947
In that way we are absolutely

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:18.346
because your users

00:10:18.346 --> 00:10:20.548
they have to trust what
you're telling them.

00:10:20.548 --> 00:10:24.178
I mean and if you're wrong … (laughs)

00:10:24.178 --> 00:10:25.917
Sal: Yes, happens every now and then.

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:28.081
(Angela laughing)

00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:31.851
Angela: To me it's a part
of what a great brand is

00:10:31.851 --> 00:10:34.659
and in Burberry's case and
that's how we measure it.

00:10:34.659 --> 00:10:36.298
Sal: How do you think about these things?

00:10:36.298 --> 00:10:39.042
You joined Burberry in 2006.

00:10:39.042 --> 00:10:42.362
I guess in the previous five or 10 years

00:10:42.362 --> 00:10:44.621
Burberry had been rejuvenated.

00:10:44.621 --> 00:10:46.944
If you could talk a little bit about that

00:10:46.944 --> 00:10:48.741
rejuvenation before you got there

00:10:48.741 --> 00:10:51.118
and then when you took over the job

00:10:51.118 --> 00:10:52.782
and what do you tell yourself?

00:10:52.782 --> 00:10:54.450
How are you going to steer the ship?

00:10:55.773 --> 00:10:57.245
Angela: What I think happens

00:10:57.245 --> 00:10:59.737
and again we're 158 years
old and you guys are ...

00:10:59.737 --> 00:11:02.319
What you're building right now ...

00:11:02.319 --> 00:11:05.064
No but so we had gone through a lot

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:07.722
and so we got the whole
management team together.

00:11:07.722 --> 00:11:10.084
You're starting out that way
but we got the team together

00:11:10.084 --> 00:11:11.566
and said, "What is our core?"

00:11:11.566 --> 00:11:14.691
"What is our core product proposition"

00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:17.246
"and what's our core purpose?"

00:11:17.246 --> 00:11:22.950
We realized that 158, it's 150 years then

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.290
but 158 years ago now,
we were born from a coat.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.437
We had our own weaving facility
in the North of England,

00:11:29.437 --> 00:11:32.080
we had our own factory to
produce all of those coats.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.472
It's interesting we were driving
innovation everywhere else

00:11:35.472 --> 00:11:37.021
but in our core product.

00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:39.592
Whenever we talked about global warming

00:11:39.592 --> 00:11:40.972
and they gave me all the reasons

00:11:40.972 --> 00:11:42.286
why we couldn't do that.

00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:46.765
It was like “No, no, no”,
every great brand ...

00:11:46.765 --> 00:11:48.535
What would Starbucks be without coffee?

00:11:48.535 --> 00:11:51.676
I mean every great
brand has to have a core

00:11:51.676 --> 00:11:53.565
and I think people get bored with that.

00:11:53.565 --> 00:11:56.932
As you grow bigger and
bigger what is your core

00:11:56.932 --> 00:11:59.747
products proposition
and don't ever lose it.

00:11:59.747 --> 00:12:01.610
Keep innovating that core

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.280
because people get bored really easy.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.810
Then also what is your core purpose

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.011
and because I don't believe
people just want to work,

00:12:10.011 --> 00:12:12.666
I think people all want
deeper meaning in their lives.

00:12:12.666 --> 00:12:18.423
It was hard for us, people
don't just want to make stuff.

00:12:18.423 --> 00:12:21.358
People want to make stuff that has meaning

00:12:21.358 --> 00:12:24.687
and has a purpose and so
we created our core values

00:12:24.687 --> 00:12:28.798
which are to protect,
explore, and inspire.

00:12:28.798 --> 00:12:30.795
We didn't come up with those,

00:12:30.795 --> 00:12:33.811
we took those out of a book
that Thomas Burberry wrote

00:12:33.811 --> 00:12:36.394
158 years ago when he was 21 years old

00:12:36.394 --> 00:12:37.707
and he founded the company.

00:12:37.707 --> 00:12:41.166
We always say his spirit
lives on and it should

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:43.262
because it was his
company, it was his vision

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:46.320
and he created that
waterproof gabardine fabric

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.869
to protect the military in the trenches

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:51.038
that's why he created the
trench coat, etcetera.

00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:53.612
We said that is our core,

00:12:53.612 --> 00:12:55.538
that's what he founded the company on.

00:12:55.538 --> 00:12:57.175
How do we make the trench coat

00:12:57.175 --> 00:12:59.777
the most cool, relevant,
hip thing in the world?

00:12:59.777 --> 00:13:01.388
That's what we are born from.

00:13:01.388 --> 00:13:03.419
Nobody else can say that but us.

00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:06.346
To revitalize and transform the company

00:13:06.346 --> 00:13:08.235
we simply went back to the basics.

00:13:08.235 --> 00:13:10.097
We went back and revitalized our core

00:13:10.097 --> 00:13:11.743
and we took that category

00:13:11.743 --> 00:13:13.669
which was about 22% of the business,

00:13:13.669 --> 00:13:15.468
seven and a half, eight years ago

00:13:15.468 --> 00:13:17.367
today it's half of the business.

00:13:17.367 --> 00:13:19.347
When you watch a runway show,

00:13:19.347 --> 00:13:21.868
nearly every item that goes down

00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:25.275
has some type of a trench
coat or some type of.

00:13:25.275 --> 00:13:27.760
The innovation that
we've driven in that core

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.281
and that has single-handedly ...

00:13:29.281 --> 00:13:31.649
Harvard Business reviewed
the great article on

00:13:31.649 --> 00:13:34.715
just that topic revitalizing the core.

00:13:34.715 --> 00:13:36.414
Sal: I mean how do you decide on that?

00:13:36.414 --> 00:13:38.661
Is that just a gut instinct,
I mean or do you ...

00:13:38.661 --> 00:13:40.011
Is there some data that you look ...

00:13:40.011 --> 00:13:41.843
We look at all the brands that have a core

00:13:41.843 --> 00:13:43.076
versus don't have a core.

00:13:43.076 --> 00:13:45.802
On that and then as you move

00:13:45.802 --> 00:13:47.960
and continue to innovate
and get new products,

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.708
I'm sure everyday someone comes to you

00:13:49.708 --> 00:13:52.020
"Hey, we should have a line
of whatever it might be",

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.602
how do you decide?

00:13:54.602 --> 00:13:56.871
How much of it is analytically driven

00:13:56.871 --> 00:14:00.479
and how much of it is gut
or whatever else driven?

00:14:00.479 --> 00:14:02.466
Angela: It's a great question.

00:14:04.604 --> 00:14:06.002
I'm going to answer it three ways.

00:14:06.002 --> 00:14:09.017
One is we always say that we
are a creative thinking company

00:14:09.017 --> 00:14:11.753
and everything we do
is driven by intuition.

00:14:11.753 --> 00:14:15.263
Then we can fuse ourselves with facts

00:14:15.263 --> 00:14:18.214
but we always lead with intuition.

00:14:18.214 --> 00:14:21.268
Because we always say that we do value

00:14:21.268 --> 00:14:23.975
feeling over knowing

00:14:23.975 --> 00:14:26.016
because if we only focused on knowing,

00:14:26.016 --> 00:14:27.475
we'd never move forward

00:14:27.475 --> 00:14:28.849
because you can't prove something

00:14:28.849 --> 00:14:30.028
that hasn't been done before.

00:14:30.028 --> 00:14:32.866
We are and that is a part

00:14:32.866 --> 00:14:34.675
of being a creative thinking culture.

00:14:37.613 --> 00:14:40.290
I forgot my other two

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.054
because I told you
there were three and I …

00:14:42.054 --> 00:14:43.737
Sal: Well you say you
confuse yourself with facts,

00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:44.729
I mean what does that mean?

00:14:44.729 --> 00:14:49.001
Does that mean that you feel
or collectively not just you,

00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:50.011
the whole organization

00:14:50.011 --> 00:14:51.071
feels like something
is the right direction

00:14:51.071 --> 00:14:52.744
but what if someone says, "Hey, but look"

00:14:52.744 --> 00:14:54.564
"everyone who's gone in
to this phase before"

00:14:54.564 --> 00:14:58.980
"has failed or there's 800
players already in that market"

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.732
"that they got zero margin
on what they're doing."

00:15:01.732 --> 00:15:05.504
It's a commodity, do you ignore that?

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:06.709
Do you sometimes ignore that?

00:15:06.709 --> 00:15:08.518
Do you say, “No, we
still feel good about it"

00:15:08.518 --> 00:15:09.803
and you move ahead?

00:15:12.587 --> 00:15:14.148
Angela: Seven years ago,

00:15:14.148 --> 00:15:16.479
came up with all the hard,
we call them hard strategies.

00:15:16.479 --> 00:15:18.763
Those are all the ones
that are very fact based.

00:15:18.763 --> 00:15:20.454
When we talked about retail led growth

00:15:20.454 --> 00:15:22.021
brought in the consultant company

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:25.136
told that, I said, "Tell me
every key market in the world"

00:15:25.136 --> 00:15:28.467
"that has, where are peers
have at least two stores"

00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:29.735
"and we have none."

00:15:29.735 --> 00:15:32.140
Then tell me their
productivity per square foot

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.860
so we had a strategy, put all
the hard metrics behind it

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.942
and but the gut …

00:15:37.942 --> 00:15:41.099
Our instincts were, and
we were 75% wholesale

00:15:41.099 --> 00:15:44.784
when I started, today we are 75% retail,

00:15:44.784 --> 00:15:46.797
our own stores direct to consumer.

00:15:46.797 --> 00:15:49.976
Our instincts said, we had
to go direct to consumer,

00:15:49.976 --> 00:15:52.838
we had to control the brand,
the environment, everything.

00:15:54.191 --> 00:15:56.224
Again brought in the firm

00:15:56.224 --> 00:15:57.735
but we did that on every strategy

00:15:57.735 --> 00:16:00.497
and they would reaffirm etcetera.

00:16:00.497 --> 00:16:02.431
Then I put them in front of the board.

00:16:02.431 --> 00:16:03.961
Very first been in the company

00:16:03.961 --> 00:16:05.247
six months strategies are done,

00:16:05.247 --> 00:16:07.717
everything's outlined, we know
exactly where we're going.

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:10.099
At the very end they told the board

00:16:10.099 --> 00:16:11.677
and we said that that point in time

00:16:11.677 --> 00:16:14.219
we would double the revenue
and the profits in five years.

00:16:14.219 --> 00:16:18.298
They, the guy, that I won't
mention the company on video

00:16:18.298 --> 00:16:20.378
but the guy sense up at
the end of the meeting

00:16:20.378 --> 00:16:22.135
and the board says, "Well how do you feel"

00:16:22.135 --> 00:16:23.493
"about this going through it?"

00:16:23.493 --> 00:16:27.011
He says, "There's about a 5% probability"

00:16:27.011 --> 00:16:28.406
"that they will do this".

00:16:28.406 --> 00:16:29.459
Sal: Who's this guy?

00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:31.737
Angela: Well he works for
a huge consulting firm

00:16:31.737 --> 00:16:32.968
and I'm not going to mention the firm.

00:16:32.968 --> 00:16:33.848
Sal: Okay, all right.

00:16:33.848 --> 00:16:35.288
Angela: We had them come
in and for six months

00:16:35.288 --> 00:16:38.306
we had them work with us on
validating these strategies.

00:16:38.306 --> 00:16:41.056
Sal: Right, and so the
strategy was based through

00:16:41.056 --> 00:16:42.119
as a number strategy

00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:43.694
where you're looking at the retail density

00:16:43.694 --> 00:16:44.908
in different geographies

00:16:44.908 --> 00:16:46.440
and how productive those stores are.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.221
That is what you used to decide
where you're going to go?

00:16:50.221 --> 00:16:53.234
Angela: Yeah, again there's always both.

00:16:53.234 --> 00:16:54.692
There's always the …

00:16:54.692 --> 00:16:56.518
Well and that was the other
part of the thing I just forgot

00:16:56.518 --> 00:16:58.392
so one was intuition but
the other is balance.

00:16:58.392 --> 00:16:58.874
Sal: Right.

00:16:58.874 --> 00:16:59.386
Angela: Right?

00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:02.535
We talk a lot about the
right and the left, a lot.

00:17:02.535 --> 00:17:06.282
When we had five hard strategies

00:17:06.282 --> 00:17:07.795
and we had five soft strategies.

00:17:07.795 --> 00:17:09.369
The foundation was a soft strategy,

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:11.232
the culture was the soft,

00:17:11.232 --> 00:17:14.245
all of the [company] had been, free lunch,

00:17:14.245 --> 00:17:15.774
the benefits for all of these stuff,

00:17:15.774 --> 00:17:17.037
or all the soft strategies

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.607
and we said that these will enable those.

00:17:19.607 --> 00:17:23.444
Just focusing on these, we
may not get the job done.

00:17:23.444 --> 00:17:27.220
The consulting firm didn't work
with us on the soft things,

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.851
they only worked with us on the hard.

00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:31.415
When they told the board
there's only 5% probability,

00:17:31.415 --> 00:17:34.601
the board kind of like we're nuts

00:17:34.601 --> 00:17:38.137
but we actually achieved
the plan a year early.

00:17:38.137 --> 00:17:40.184
Sal: They thought it was a 5% probability

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:42.637
because they've advised
on lot of the fact part

00:17:42.637 --> 00:17:43.867
Angela: They thought

00:17:43.867 --> 00:17:44.828
we were being far too aggressive.

00:17:44.828 --> 00:17:45.786
Sal: On the aggressive, when you said

00:17:45.786 --> 00:17:47.613
you're going to double
your revenues, you said?

00:17:47.613 --> 00:17:49.007
Angela: And profit in five years.
Sal: And profit

00:17:49.007 --> 00:17:51.221
in five years, that was the
part that they were giving you

00:17:51.221 --> 00:17:52.448
Angela: Absolutely.

00:17:52.448 --> 00:17:54.689
Sal: They said, "I'm sure
you'll grow etcetera, etcetera."

00:17:54.689 --> 00:17:57.217
But to really …

00:17:57.217 --> 00:17:59.833
The soft things are just
stuff that felt right?

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:05.095
Angela: The soft things were that we knew,

00:18:08.079 --> 00:18:11.312
I knew that we would be
as good as our people.

00:18:11.312 --> 00:18:15.353
That we had to build a team,

00:18:15.353 --> 00:18:17.642
we had to unite and connect this culture

00:18:17.642 --> 00:18:20.914
and they had to believe
in the dream, right?

00:18:20.914 --> 00:18:22.768
This is leadership

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.664
and they had to lead everybody.

00:18:25.664 --> 00:18:27.592
We were 3,200 people then

00:18:27.592 --> 00:18:29.705
and some of them, we had people then

00:18:29.705 --> 00:18:31.201
with the 30 years, 40 years right?

00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:34.210
How do you get everybody
united around a new vision,

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.181
a new dream?

00:18:35.181 --> 00:18:37.666
The thing is this they have to believe,

00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:41.202
every single person has to
believe you can do this.

00:18:41.202 --> 00:18:43.171
That's the positive energy

00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:44.748
that comes around something

00:18:44.748 --> 00:18:46.566
when you are breaking new ground

00:18:46.566 --> 00:18:49.715
or trying to do something
transformative like you are.

00:18:49.715 --> 00:18:53.701
If they don't believe,
and I told them upfront

00:18:53.701 --> 00:18:56.395
after that six months I
said, "If you do not believe"

00:18:56.395 --> 00:18:57.721
"that we're going to do this,"

00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.157
"then maybe you should go now."

00:18:59.157 --> 00:19:03.594
Because we knew we wanted to do something

00:19:03.594 --> 00:19:05.176
really big and transformative.

00:19:05.176 --> 00:19:09.036
We used our instincts, we
confused our self to the facts

00:19:09.036 --> 00:19:11.778
and then we build a
very balanced strategy,

00:19:11.778 --> 00:19:14.437
hard and soft, very balance teams.

00:19:14.437 --> 00:19:19.349
We need creative's but we
need operational excellence

00:19:19.349 --> 00:19:21.392
and the strategies were built that way.

00:19:22.253 --> 00:19:24.973
I always say in every
single store we have,

00:19:24.973 --> 00:19:27.709
we need left brain and we need right.

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:29.490
in every country, in every region

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.470
because I don't think
you'll build a great brand

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:36.170
that resonates and touches
people without both.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.857
You need the engagement
but you need the reach

00:19:38.857 --> 00:19:40.631
and they're very different.

00:19:40.631 --> 00:19:42.207
Sal: The projection of doubling

00:19:42.207 --> 00:19:43.780
and there's no precedent for this?

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.493
I mean that's why it was,
that's probably why …

00:19:45.493 --> 00:19:47.165
Angela: Well the precedent
was, they had done it before.

00:19:47.165 --> 00:19:48.054
Sal: I see.

00:19:48.054 --> 00:19:49.953
Angela: The probability of
a company doing it twice

00:19:49.953 --> 00:19:52.034
was what really took the odds down.

00:19:52.034 --> 00:19:54.102
Sal: Right, I mean through that process

00:19:54.102 --> 00:19:56.846
were there moments where
you yourself were like

00:19:56.846 --> 00:19:58.751
"Gee, I don't know if
this is going to happen."

00:19:58.751 --> 00:20:00.126
I've got …

00:20:00.126 --> 00:20:01.597
Angela: Never.

00:20:02.273 --> 00:20:03.335
Never.

00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:04.954
Sal: That's why I am too, I never doubt.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:06.249
Angela: Never.

00:20:06.249 --> 00:20:07.081
Sal: I'm always doubting.

00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:07.908
Angela: You are not.

00:20:07.908 --> 00:20:08.701
Sal: Not really.

00:20:08.701 --> 00:20:09.630
Angela: No, you're not.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.251
No, I think he's a
bigger dreamer than I am.

00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:13.052
Sal: Maybe, we can compete.

00:20:13.052 --> 00:20:16.126
Angela: Yeah but you have
to because you are on,

00:20:16.126 --> 00:20:20.507
you are disrupting a
sector that is so overdue

00:20:20.507 --> 00:20:23.001
to be disrupted, it is so overdue.

00:20:23.001 --> 00:20:25.728
The next generation is in your hands

00:20:25.728 --> 00:20:27.203
and they need you to do this,

00:20:27.203 --> 00:20:29.218
the country needs you
to do what you're doing.

00:20:29.218 --> 00:20:32.324
You got to do it and you got to keep going

00:20:32.324 --> 00:20:34.304
and you got to get your reach out there,

00:20:34.304 --> 00:20:35.609
you are engaging.

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.624
I mean the fact that 30,000 teachers

00:20:37.624 --> 00:20:39.487
are using your content in schools.

00:20:39.487 --> 00:20:42.339
I son't know, it's unbelievable.

00:20:42.339 --> 00:20:45.917
Get it to 100, get it to
200, I mean just don't stop.

00:20:45.917 --> 00:20:48.187
Sal: Can you Skype in
to our company updates,

00:20:48.187 --> 00:20:50.596
it would be very … 
(people laughing)

00:20:50.596 --> 00:20:52.721
Let's do this.

00:20:54.105 --> 00:20:56.526
Angela: That's how I feel.

00:20:56.526 --> 00:20:57.338
Sal: Yeah.

00:20:57.338 --> 00:20:58.505
Angela: I mean that is how I feel

00:20:58.505 --> 00:21:02.259
and if you, and it's not going
to be easy but don't stop.

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:03.050
Sal: Yeah.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:07.532
Well that by itself is really
powerful advice if you'd ...

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:10.411
I mean what would you tell us as we go,

00:21:10.411 --> 00:21:13.976
I mean you're 158 years
old, we're 158 weeks old.

00:21:13.976 --> 00:21:16.483
(people laughing)
How do we …

00:21:16.483 --> 00:21:18.038
Any advice for …

00:21:18.038 --> 00:21:21.262
I mean beyond that just
kind of alter focus,

00:21:21.262 --> 00:21:23.235
believe, power through.

00:21:23.235 --> 00:21:25.019
Angela: Definitely focus

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:27.313
and we still do the same thing today.

00:21:27.313 --> 00:21:29.130
We always say that every year

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.906
we only do three new things.

00:21:31.906 --> 00:21:32.864
That's it,

00:21:32.864 --> 00:21:35.572
because they take ...

00:21:35.572 --> 00:21:38.076
We call them big brand moments

00:21:38.076 --> 00:21:40.405
whether it was launching burberry.com.

00:21:40.405 --> 00:21:44.032
I mean it took us a year to
unite thousands of people

00:21:44.032 --> 00:21:45.082
around the world.

00:21:45.082 --> 00:21:47.585
We said that we had to do this

00:21:47.585 --> 00:21:50.744
and we had one chance to
change 150 years of perception.

00:21:50.744 --> 00:21:57.384
We knew that and this year
they'll be pretty close

00:21:57.384 --> 00:21:59.840
to 100 million people
that go into burberry.com

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.972
and you guys we're up to, a lot

00:22:01.972 --> 00:22:03.380
but for a luxury brand that's a lot.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.388
Sal: Well that's pretty good.

00:22:04.388 --> 00:22:06.917
Angela: It's a lot and not all buying

00:22:06.917 --> 00:22:09.005
but engaging and spreading

00:22:09.005 --> 00:22:10.642
what the brand's about, etcetera.

00:22:10.642 --> 00:22:12.936
Three things a year

00:22:12.936 --> 00:22:15.759
and we still hold on to that

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:17.136
no matter how big we are.

00:22:17.136 --> 00:22:18.443
Sal: That's not individual products,

00:22:18.443 --> 00:22:20.945
that is new initiatives like burberry.com.

00:22:20.945 --> 00:22:23.832
Angela: Exactly three big brand things

00:22:23.832 --> 00:22:27.217
that we unite 10,000 people
around the world to do.

00:22:27.217 --> 00:22:30.068
Sal: Right, and what's next in the queue?

00:22:30.068 --> 00:22:32.248
What are the three
things you are doing now?

00:22:33.509 --> 00:22:35.662
Angela: It's probably no surprise

00:22:35.662 --> 00:22:37.801
that we are aggressively
working on our ...

00:22:37.801 --> 00:22:39.682
Continuing to work on our digital platform

00:22:39.682 --> 00:22:41.311
and specifically when it comes to mobile.

00:22:41.311 --> 00:22:43.193
I mean the whole world is becoming mobile

00:22:43.193 --> 00:22:47.087
and it's crazy all the
metrics of the consumers

00:22:47.087 --> 00:22:48.176
that are engaging

00:22:48.176 --> 00:22:50.617
and that's probably a
challenge to you guys too.

00:22:50.617 --> 00:22:52.675
Because that is where you'll get your kid,

00:22:52.675 --> 00:22:55.466
that is where, on the mobile device.

00:22:55.466 --> 00:22:57.327
Not just a phone but any mobile device,

00:22:57.327 --> 00:22:58.722
I mean the whole world ...

00:22:58.722 --> 00:23:01.036
It's just so heavy investment,

00:23:01.036 --> 00:23:03.881
lot of focus going there,
so digital mobile etcetera.

00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:10.421
We always have operational or
internal initiatives as well.

00:23:10.421 --> 00:23:14.163
We do as we get big, areas get sloppy

00:23:14.163 --> 00:23:16.227
so we still have to drive
a lot of efficiencies

00:23:16.227 --> 00:23:17.214
out of the business.

00:23:17.214 --> 00:23:19.762
We call it commercial
procurement we're building,

00:23:19.762 --> 00:23:21.462
we build tons of stores a year

00:23:21.462 --> 00:23:23.128
so we've hired some additional expertise

00:23:23.128 --> 00:23:25.504
to make sure we're doing that
in the most efficient way in.

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:28.343
I mean right now if you
ask any of our executives

00:23:28.343 --> 00:23:28.965
around the world,

00:23:28.965 --> 00:23:30.424
they know those are the three things

00:23:30.424 --> 00:23:31.614
that we're focused on this year.

00:23:31.614 --> 00:23:35.313
If we do those right, we
will put up the results

00:23:35.313 --> 00:23:37.791
that we budgeted, etcetera.

00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:39.187
Sal: Wow and you're all growing fast.

00:23:39.187 --> 00:23:40.168
I mean for a large company,

00:23:40.168 --> 00:23:42.388
you all grew 24, 25% last year?

00:23:42.388 --> 00:23:43.893
Angela: Yeah.
Sal: That's fairly dramatic.

00:23:43.893 --> 00:23:45.614
Angela: We just put up
this year's results.

00:23:45.614 --> 00:23:47.452
We just did our trading
update a couple weeks ago

00:23:47.452 --> 00:23:49.804
and our retail business was up 13%

00:23:49.804 --> 00:23:53.138
on a really, really big base and …

00:23:53.138 --> 00:23:54.717
Sal: That's not what global
retail is doing today?

00:23:54.717 --> 00:23:56.536
Angela: No, no, our largest competitor

00:23:56.536 --> 00:23:58.849
put up a 3% retail business

00:23:58.849 --> 00:24:00.430
and they're the biggest in the sector.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.912
Now we're absolutely
continuing to out perform

00:24:03.912 --> 00:24:06.434
but I will tell you
because it's the people.

00:24:06.434 --> 00:24:09.428
Because there are 10,000
people around the world

00:24:09.428 --> 00:24:12.051
that are so passionate about this company

00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:15.045
and so passionate about our performance

00:24:15.045 --> 00:24:16.881
and creating again a great brand,

00:24:16.881 --> 00:24:17.970
a really great company

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:21.407
but they also know that every time

00:24:21.407 --> 00:24:23.169
we open a flagship store ...

00:24:23.169 --> 00:24:26.831
Because again it's shallow
luxury retail, right?

00:24:26.831 --> 00:24:29.369
That always bothered Christopher and I

00:24:29.369 --> 00:24:31.529
because it's not where
we came from, right?

00:24:31.529 --> 00:24:32.710
We love what we're doing

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.282
and that's what we've been focus on,

00:24:34.282 --> 00:24:34.976
a great company.

00:24:34.976 --> 00:24:36.749
Every time we open a flagship store,

00:24:36.749 --> 00:24:39.707
we partner with a local institution.

00:24:39.707 --> 00:24:42.553
In Chicago we partnered with [Hype]

00:24:42.553 --> 00:24:44.648
and we gifted them a million dollars.

00:24:44.648 --> 00:24:47.681
We created a program to help the youth

00:24:47.681 --> 00:24:49.032
in the Chicago area

00:24:49.032 --> 00:24:51.071
with our programs
Burberry Beyond, etcetera.

00:24:51.071 --> 00:24:53.520
We've done it in New York,
we've done it in Beijing,

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.132
we're getting ready to do it in Shanghai.

00:24:55.132 --> 00:24:58.064
Anytime we open up this huge luxury store

00:24:58.064 --> 00:25:01.780
which could come across a
little, elitist if you will,

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.912
we always make sure that the company also,

00:25:04.912 --> 00:25:07.171
like in New York we said

00:25:07.171 --> 00:25:08.601
we're lighting up Manhattan with a store.

00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:10.546
Well we're also going to
light up people's lives

00:25:10.546 --> 00:25:11.752
when we gave the million dollars

00:25:11.752 --> 00:25:13.154
to the Robin Hood Foundation

00:25:13.154 --> 00:25:14.369
and put our program in place

00:25:14.369 --> 00:25:15.755
for the chartered schools, etcetera.

00:25:15.755 --> 00:25:17.844
That's a big part of the balance

00:25:17.844 --> 00:25:19.443
and that's a part of
being a great company.

00:25:19.443 --> 00:25:20.980
Sal: When you look at the organization,

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.258
you must be looking at people

00:25:22.258 --> 00:25:23.890
"Oh, look at him, look at her."

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.271
"She's got some potential,
he's got some potential."

00:25:27.271 --> 00:25:30.772
"Hey, that could be the next CEO."

00:25:30.772 --> 00:25:32.473
What are you looking at?

00:25:32.473 --> 00:25:34.306
What are the traits that
you're seeing in those people

00:25:34.306 --> 00:25:36.222
that are really striking you

00:25:36.222 --> 00:25:38.325
as someone who might be able to one day

00:25:38.325 --> 00:25:39.433
step into your shoes?

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:41.924
Angela: It's a great question.

00:25:41.924 --> 00:25:44.743
We look at it honestly in
all levels of the company

00:25:48.973 --> 00:25:52.494
and I would even say probably
less my shoes, right?

00:25:52.494 --> 00:25:54.980
Because that would mostly be

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.258
a lot of my [direct report], etcetera

00:25:56.258 --> 00:25:58.261
so I would tell you at
every level of the company

00:25:58.261 --> 00:26:01.018
and we hire for it as well.

00:26:03.156 --> 00:26:05.914
It sounds terrible but
we culturally compatible.

00:26:05.914 --> 00:26:08.269
We always say we don't
want tissue rejection

00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:10.924
because it's tough to bring
people into your culture.

00:26:10.924 --> 00:26:13.714
Sal: Tissue rejection
like skin grafting or ...

00:26:13.714 --> 00:26:14.660
Angela: Yeah.
Sal: Yes, yes

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.146
Angela: We just don't want that.

00:26:17.146 --> 00:26:18.700
People go to such rigor

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.033
before we bring them into the company.

00:26:20.033 --> 00:26:21.819
We always said, "Are they
culturally compatible?"

00:26:21.819 --> 00:26:23.209
"Do we trust them?"

00:26:23.209 --> 00:26:26.740
Do we like them obviously
but do we trust them?

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.990
Do we believe them?

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.572
Do they believe in our mission,

00:26:30.572 --> 00:26:31.923
in what we're doing?

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:34.358
Because we can't afford to make a mistake.

00:26:34.358 --> 00:26:38.805
I would tell you with anybody
going to the next level,

00:26:38.805 --> 00:26:43.791
there is transparency,
trust, our core values,

00:26:43.791 --> 00:26:45.771
all those soft things we talked about.

00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:48.822
When they reach a certain
level it's a given their smart.

00:26:48.822 --> 00:26:51.457
It's a given they have high IQ

00:26:51.457 --> 00:26:53.538
but we need high EQ.

00:26:53.538 --> 00:26:56.743
I always say that everybody in the company

00:26:56.743 --> 00:27:00.357
needs a little right
and left brain, right?

00:27:00.357 --> 00:27:03.508
Two extremes because then they don't feel.

00:27:03.508 --> 00:27:07.620
We always say that we
can teach people anything

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.246
but we can't teach them to care,

00:27:10.246 --> 00:27:11.751
we can't teach them to feel

00:27:11.751 --> 00:27:13.323
and when you're in a human business

00:27:13.323 --> 00:27:15.304
and you're communicating
like we're communicating,

00:27:15.304 --> 00:27:17.552
they have to be authentic.

00:27:18.921 --> 00:27:20.696
We have a leadership council

00:27:20.696 --> 00:27:22.326
which is the next generation talent.

00:27:22.326 --> 00:27:25.704
We spend hours just
helping them understand

00:27:25.704 --> 00:27:26.499
who they are.

00:27:26.499 --> 00:27:28.488
Who are they, right?

00:27:28.488 --> 00:27:31.160
Because then only if they
really know who they are,

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.069
can they build very
balance teams around them

00:27:34.069 --> 00:27:36.794
and it's a real self-reflective phase

00:27:36.794 --> 00:27:38.028
that they go through

00:27:38.028 --> 00:27:40.349
but they will become better leaders

00:27:40.349 --> 00:27:42.969
having peace and confidence
with who they are

00:27:42.969 --> 00:27:45.432
and to thy self be true.

00:27:45.432 --> 00:27:48.566
That is a part of our talent plan.

00:27:48.566 --> 00:27:52.137
I always say no different than me.

00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:54.846
I tell investors you would be so surprised

00:27:54.846 --> 00:27:56.845
at every decision I don't make everyday.

00:27:56.845 --> 00:27:58.330
(Sal laughs)

00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:59.316
But you can't.

00:27:59.316 --> 00:28:02.351
I have to try trust the
people we brought in

00:28:02.351 --> 00:28:05.819
and I have to give them
very simple clear messages.

00:28:05.819 --> 00:28:08.777
The three things we're
going to do this year

00:28:08.777 --> 00:28:10.784
and all the metrics behind it

00:28:10.784 --> 00:28:12.917
and uniting everyone

00:28:12.917 --> 00:28:19.693
but it is trust, intuition,
great communication,

00:28:19.693 --> 00:28:22.472
authenticity, people have to feel them

00:28:22.472 --> 00:28:25.542
or they will never rise as
a leader in the company.

00:28:25.542 --> 00:28:26.585
Sal: Right.

00:28:26.585 --> 00:28:28.528
I mean is it something
that you think you can ...

00:28:28.528 --> 00:28:31.027
I mean you talk about
personality fit and cultural fit,

00:28:31.027 --> 00:28:31.882
do you trust them,

00:28:31.882 --> 00:28:34.509
but is there some way that
you can screen for that?

00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:37.384
For that balance of the whole brain.

00:28:37.384 --> 00:28:38.572
I read the whole book now.

00:28:38.572 --> 00:28:40.496
Angela: Fascinating.
Sal: Very good book.

00:28:41.634 --> 00:28:43.505
Angela: Did you really read it?

00:28:43.505 --> 00:28:45.169
Sal: I did, I read it on
plane, it's a long flight.

00:28:46.276 --> 00:28:48.441
Angela: I gave him a copy
of Daniel Pink's book.

00:28:48.441 --> 00:28:50.072
It's called the Whole Mind,

00:28:50.072 --> 00:28:52.768
Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the World?

00:28:53.844 --> 00:28:56.529
Sal: One thing that I pointed out to you

00:28:56.529 --> 00:28:58.697
because one thing that I
did react to that book.

00:28:58.697 --> 00:29:00.622
It's funny because in that book it says,

00:29:00.622 --> 00:29:02.153
"Oh, we don't need programmers anymore,"

00:29:02.153 --> 00:29:03.420
"we need inventors."

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.503
I said, "What's a programmer?
It's an inventor."

00:29:05.503 --> 00:29:07.272
It is a fundamentally a
right-brained activity.

00:29:07.272 --> 00:29:09.809
I actually most strong ...

00:29:09.809 --> 00:29:11.617
When people say, "Khan Academy stem ..."

00:29:11.617 --> 00:29:15.022
I was like stem is, it should
be a right-brained activity.

00:29:15.022 --> 00:29:20.312
I mean in my mind the learning
to factor a polynomial

00:29:20.312 --> 00:29:23.790
or to do the basics of algorithm,

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.879
that's like a painter
learning how to paint.

00:29:25.879 --> 00:29:28.921
The real expression is when
you actually create something

00:29:28.921 --> 00:29:31.077
so I actually think we're more similar

00:29:31.077 --> 00:29:32.910
Angela: I think so too

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.630
but I think that's what you've unlocked.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:36.834
I think that's your
unique brand positioning.

00:29:36.834 --> 00:29:39.293
Sal: Right, the creative …

00:29:39.293 --> 00:29:42.108
Angela: You're taking what
most people would take

00:29:42.108 --> 00:29:43.429
as a traditional left-brain

00:29:43.429 --> 00:29:45.876
and you're adding fun to it,

00:29:45.876 --> 00:29:47.290
you're adding energy to it.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.312
You're making it, you're combining,

00:29:50.312 --> 00:29:53.294
you're making it more of a
right, left brain exercise

00:29:53.294 --> 00:29:55.847
not just an analytical exercise.

00:29:55.847 --> 00:29:59.832
Sal: Yeah, no and how
are we doing on time now?

00:29:59.832 --> 00:30:02.427
Voiceover: I think we only
have, like three more minutes.

00:30:02.427 --> 00:30:03.684
Sal: Okay, three more minutes.

00:30:03.684 --> 00:30:05.562
I will ask you again
because it was so inspiring

00:30:05.562 --> 00:30:06.786
in the Dopamine, just start,

00:30:06.786 --> 00:30:07.846
we're talking about Dopamine earlier

00:30:07.846 --> 00:30:09.150
and you got us all very excited.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:11.318
Angela: (laughs) I won't ask.

00:30:11.318 --> 00:30:14.396
Sal: Yeah, we were talking
about, well and other things.

00:30:15.857 --> 00:30:18.894
I mean, just parting words,
advice for the team here

00:30:18.894 --> 00:30:21.870
and people look good greater
Khan Academy community.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.148
Thoughts on just what we should be doing

00:30:25.148 --> 00:30:27.193
and how we should approach life.

00:30:27.193 --> 00:30:29.898
Angela: Yeah, you are …

00:30:29.898 --> 00:30:31.428
It's funny because I had the honor

00:30:31.428 --> 00:30:32.941
right before the Olympics.

00:30:32.941 --> 00:30:35.264
Mr. Bill Gates was in London

00:30:35.264 --> 00:30:36.666
and had a wonderful luncheon.

00:30:36.666 --> 00:30:38.476
We'd met a couple of different times

00:30:38.476 --> 00:30:39.914
and I had the honor of sitting next to him

00:30:39.914 --> 00:30:40.882
at the luncheon table.

00:30:40.882 --> 00:30:42.716
He was talking about all of his

00:30:42.716 --> 00:30:44.098
different philanthropic efforts etcetera

00:30:44.098 --> 00:30:47.705
and to the who's who
of the UK if you will.

00:30:47.705 --> 00:30:50.002
He had mentioned the Khan Academy

00:30:50.002 --> 00:30:52.970
and I was so excited, why ...

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.918
At the very end he simply
said, "Is there anything else?"

00:30:55.918 --> 00:30:58.120
I said, "Well what are you
plans for the Khan Academy?”

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.538
He looked at me like how
did I know about this

00:31:01.538 --> 00:31:03.843
and nobody in the room knew about it

00:31:03.843 --> 00:31:06.749
and these are huge big
executives running Glaxo

00:31:06.749 --> 00:31:08.361
and every big company in the UK.

00:31:09.637 --> 00:31:11.682
He then went on to share with them

00:31:11.682 --> 00:31:12.750
what you were doing

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.930
and why that he felt strongly

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.790
and his foundation was
investing, etcetera.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:21.838
Then the luncheon broke
and then he looked at me

00:31:21.838 --> 00:31:23.295
and he goes, "What would you do?"

00:31:23.295 --> 00:31:27.318
I said, "You created"

00:31:27.318 --> 00:31:30.396
"the greatest brand in
the world, Microsoft."

00:31:30.396 --> 00:31:35.198
"You were so laser and
you had such a vision.”

00:31:35.198 --> 00:31:36.638
I said, "It is absolutely"

00:31:36.638 --> 00:31:38.375
"no different with the Khan Academy."

00:31:38.375 --> 00:31:41.085
"I believe you have the ability to create"

00:31:41.085 --> 00:31:42.678
"one of the greatest brands"

00:31:42.678 --> 00:31:45.237
"and one of the greatest
companies in the world."

00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:48.885
I told him, I said, "When
you did it, there was a need"

00:31:48.885 --> 00:31:50.631
"and you filled that need."

00:31:50.631 --> 00:31:54.442
There is a tremendous need
and you are filling that need

00:31:54.442 --> 00:31:56.044
and it's in a different way

00:31:56.044 --> 00:31:58.337
but you're using and you're
leveraging the technology

00:31:58.337 --> 00:32:00.553
that exist today, as he did.

00:32:00.553 --> 00:32:05.098
He then sent a follow up
note afterwards saying,

00:32:05.098 --> 00:32:06.591
"Could we continue the conversation,"

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:09.222
"I found it fascinating, etcetera."

00:32:09.222 --> 00:32:11.152
I shared this with you

00:32:11.152 --> 00:32:15.297
because at this young age that you are,

00:32:15.297 --> 00:32:17.957
to have someone of his
vision and his caliber

00:32:17.957 --> 00:32:22.585
believe in you, you know
you're on the right track.

00:32:22.585 --> 00:32:26.941
I just think that I am absolutely nothing

00:32:26.941 --> 00:32:29.227
in comparison to the people
that are watching you,

00:32:29.227 --> 00:32:30.852
the people that are following you,

00:32:30.852 --> 00:32:34.417
the lives that you're impacting.

00:32:34.417 --> 00:32:36.433
You're impacting teachers lives,

00:32:36.433 --> 00:32:38.459
you're impacting the next generation.

00:32:38.459 --> 00:32:40.429
You are actually impacting people

00:32:40.429 --> 00:32:41.839
who didn't finish their education.

00:32:41.839 --> 00:32:44.901
Who are going on and learning now.

00:32:45.401 --> 00:32:48.787
You will create a phenomenal brand,

00:32:48.787 --> 00:32:51.038
you will create an amazing company

00:32:51.038 --> 00:32:54.942
and you are in the mist
of disrupting a sector

00:32:54.942 --> 00:32:58.703
that is so desperately
in need of being fixed.

00:32:58.703 --> 00:33:01.205
You're doing it in such a modern way,

00:33:01.205 --> 00:33:03.440
leveraging everything that exist today

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.525
and my counsel to you is just don't stop

00:33:06.525 --> 00:33:08.120
and don't slow down.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.612
Stay focused, keep the right pace

00:33:11.612 --> 00:33:15.434
but do truly understand
that what you're doing

00:33:15.434 --> 00:33:16.955
has far greater meaning

00:33:16.955 --> 00:33:19.031
than anything you've ever
done in your lives before.

00:33:19.031 --> 00:33:21.922
Not just that America need you to do this,

00:33:21.922 --> 00:33:23.337
the world needs you to do this.

00:33:23.337 --> 00:33:26.063
Education is the biggest issue

00:33:26.063 --> 00:33:31.235
that inhibiting future
economies all over the world.

00:33:32.265 --> 00:33:35.690
I am so honored to be
here to chat with you

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:39.786
and just I am so thankful
for what you're doing,

00:33:39.786 --> 00:33:41.332
I really am.

00:33:41.332 --> 00:33:43.968
Sal: Well I feel like
going back to work now.

00:33:43.968 --> 00:33:47.019
(people laughing)

00:33:47.019 --> 00:33:48.494
No, thank you so much.

00:33:48.494 --> 00:33:51.032
I mean this was, I mean for me personally

00:33:51.032 --> 00:33:53.426
when we met in Heathrow
with my $6 shirt on,

00:33:53.426 --> 00:33:56.098
that by itself was a really powerful.

00:33:56.098 --> 00:33:57.798
I mean Esther was there
too and we were like

00:33:57.798 --> 00:33:58.652
“She’s amazing!”

00:33:58.652 --> 00:34:00.650
Esther is the number search resultant

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:02.209
Olympic attitude on Google.

00:34:02.209 --> 00:34:03.514
(people laughing)

00:34:03.514 --> 00:34:06.303
She has authority here
but we were transfixed

00:34:06.303 --> 00:34:07.977
and blown away by meeting you then

00:34:07.977 --> 00:34:09.901
and this I think I
could speak for everyone

00:34:09.901 --> 00:34:12.063
where this was incredibly
inspiring and motivating

00:34:12.063 --> 00:34:13.730
for all of us so thank you so much.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.022
Angela: No, you are more than welcome.

00:34:15.022 --> 00:34:16.049
Keep up the great work.

00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:20.049
(clapping)
