00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.860
Let's do some example
problems using

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.850
our newly acquired knowledge
of isosceles and equilateral

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.029
triangles.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.510
So over here, I have kind of
a triangle within a triangle.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.960
And we need to figure out this
orange angle right over here

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.360
and this blue angle
right over here.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.550
And we know that
side AB or segment

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.090
AB is equal to segment BC,
which is equal to segment CD.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.130
Or we could also call that DC.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.250
So first of all, we see that
triangle ABC is isosceles.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.637
And because it's isosceles,
the two base angles

00:00:35.637 --> 00:00:36.720
are going to be congruent.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.690
This is one leg.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.360
This is the other
leg right over there.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.350
So the two base angles
are going to be congruent.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.150
So we know that this angle right
over here is also 31 degrees.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.550
Well, if we know two of
the angles in a triangle,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.290
we can always figure
out the third angle.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.250
They have to add
up to 180 degrees.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.320
So we could say 31 degrees plus
31 degrees plus the measure

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.920
of angle ABC is
equal to 180 degrees.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.690
You can subtract 62.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.870
This right here is 62 degrees.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.000
You subtract 62 from both sides.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.350
You get the measure of angle
ABC is equal to-- let's see.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.980
180 minus 60 would be 120.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.330
You subtract another 2.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.860
You get 118 degrees.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.990
So this angle right over
here is 118 degrees.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.580
Let me just write it like this.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.090
This is 118 degrees.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.540
Well, this angle
right over here is

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.420
supplementary to
that 118 degrees.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.060
So that angle plus 118 is
going to be equal to 180.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.820
We already know that
that's 62 degrees.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.060
62 plus 118 is 180.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.070
So this right over
here is 62 degrees.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.140
Now, this angle is one of the
base angles for triangle BCD.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.960
I didn't draw it that way,
but this side and this side

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.760
are congruent.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.740
BC has the same length as CD.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.860
Those are the two legs
of an isosceles triangle.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.310
You can kind of imagine
it was turned upside down.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.419
This is the vertex.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.940
This is one base angle.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.600
This is the other base angle.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.680
Well, the base angles are
going to be congruent.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.140
So this is going to be
62 degrees, as well.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.690
And then finally, if you want
to figure out this blue angle,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.470
the blue angle plus these
two 62-degree angles

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.610
are going to have to
add up to 180 degrees.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.560
So you get 62 plus 62
plus the blue angle, which

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.640
is the measure of
angle BCD, is going

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.006
to have to be equal
to 180 degrees.

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:42.380
These two characters--
let's see.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.280
62 plus 62 is 124.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.710
You subtract 124
from both sides.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.910
You get the measure of angle
BCD is equal to-- let's see.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.300
If you subtract 120,
you get 60, and then you

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.460
have to subtract another 4.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.750
So you get 56 degrees.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.490
So this is equal to 56 degrees.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.860
And we're done.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.060
Now, we could do
either of these.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.660
Let's do this one
right over here.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.630
So what is the
measure of angle ABE?

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.620
So they haven't even
drawn segment BE here.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.090
So let me draw that for us.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.550
And so we have to figure out
the measure of angle ABE.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.150
So we have a bunch of
congruent segments here.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.180
And in particular, we see that
triangle ABD, all of its sides

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.070
are equal.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.970
So it's an equilateral triangle,
which means all of the angles

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.880
are equal.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.294
And if all of the angles
are equal in a triangle,

00:03:34.294 --> 00:03:35.585
they all have to be 60 degrees.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.490
So all of these characters
are going to be 60 degrees.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.610
Well, that's part
of angle ABE, but we

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.784
have to figure out this
other part right over here.

00:03:46.784 --> 00:03:48.700
And to do that, we can
see that we're actually

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.530
dealing with an
isosceles triangle

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.930
kind of tipped over to the left.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.130
This is the vertex angle.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.700
This is one base angle.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.550
This is the other base angle.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.550
And the vertex angle
right here is 90 degrees.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.133
And once again, we
know it's isosceles

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:07.210
because this side, segment
BD, is equal to segment DE.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.760
And once again, these two angles
plus this angle right over here

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.335
are going to have to
add up to 180 degrees.

00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:15.590
So you call that an x.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.000
You call that an x.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.709
You've got x plus x plus 90
is going to be 180 degrees.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.560
So you get 2x plus-- let
me just write it out.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.250
Don't want to skip steps here.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.720
We have x plus x
plus 90 is going

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.570
to be equal to 180 degrees.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.850
x plus x is the same thing as
2x, plus 90 is equal to 180.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.000
And then we can subtract
90 from both sides.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.980
You get 2x is equal to 90.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.640
Or divide both sides by 2.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.610
You get x is equal
to 45 degrees.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.570
And then we're done
because angle ABE

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.729
is going to be equal to the 60
degrees plus the 45 degrees.

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.520
So it's going to be
this whole angle, which

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.820
is what we care about.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.097
Angle ABE is going to be 60
plus 45, which is 105 degrees.

00:05:04.097 --> 00:05:05.930
And now we have this
last problem over here.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.750
This one looks a
little bit simpler.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.190
I have an isosceles triangle.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.949
This leg is equal to that leg.

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:11.990
This is the vertex angle.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.112
I have to figure out B.

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.320
And the trick here is like,
wait, how do I figure out

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.730
one side of a triangle if
I only know one other side?

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.724
Don't I need to know
two other sides?

00:05:19.724 --> 00:05:21.140
And we'll do it
the exact same way

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.630
we just did that second
part of that problem.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.470
If this is an isosceles
triangle, which we know it is,

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.790
then this angle is going to
be equal to that angle there.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.270
And so if we call this x,
then this is x as well.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:41.190
And we get x plus x plus
36 degrees is equal to 180.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.550
The two x's, when you
add them up, you get 2x.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.210
And then-- I won't
skip steps here.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.310
2x plus 36 is equal to 180.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.180
Subtract 36 from both
sides, we get 2x--

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.040
that 2 looks a little bit funny.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.630
We get 2x is equal to--
180 minus 30 is 150.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.870
And then you want to
subtract another 6 from 150,

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.480
gets us to 144.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.570
Did I do that right?

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.360
180 minus 30 is 150, yep, 144.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.700
Divide both sides by 2.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.350
You get x is equal
to 72 degrees.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.880
So this is equal to 72 degrees.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.250
And we are done.
