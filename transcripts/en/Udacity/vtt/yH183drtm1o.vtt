00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.080
If you completed all those exercises
then you're well on your way to

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.490
understanding how Turing machines
compute and hopefully also are ready to

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.290
be convinced that they can compute as
well as any other possible machine.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.986
Before we move onto that argument
however there's some terminology

00:00:15.986 --> 00:00:18.893
about Turing machines and
the languages that they accept and

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:22.200
reject and those that they might
loop on that we should set straight.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.250
Some of the terms may seem similar, but
the distinctions are important ones, and

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.650
we'll use them freely throughout
the rest of the course so

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.010
pay close attention.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.670
&gt;&gt; First, we define what it means for
a machine to decide a language.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.290
We say a Turing machine decides
a language L if it accepts every string

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.420
in the language and it rejects
every string not in the language.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.950
For example, the Turing machine we
just described decided the language L

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.449
consisting of strings of the form
w#w where w was a binary string.

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.579
We also might say that the Turing
machine computed the function

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.289
that is 1 is X is in the language and
0 otherwise.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.578
Or even just that the Turing machine
computed the language at all.
