[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:07.470
SPEAKER: So it's my
absolute pleasure

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.612
to introduce my friend and
author and speaker Nilofer.

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:18.720
Nilofer and I met about seven
years ago at TED in Europe.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.517
And when I moved to the Bay
Area she said, "Oh, look me up."

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:23.100
And I thought that's
the kind of thing

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.250
that Americans say when
you move to the Bay Area.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.800
But when I called
her up she said,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.200
"Absolutely I'm going to
throw a dinner party for you."

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.880
And she threw a
dinner party for me

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.120
with 10 women who then
became friends and was

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.370
sort of like the
beginning of my friends

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.900
and my network in the Bay Area.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.720
So I've been eternally
grateful for that.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.520
She also introduced
me to the concept

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.670
of walking meetings instead
of sitting meetings, which

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.990
absolutely transformed my life.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.350
So I've been pacing around
Mountain View ever since.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.020
And that's actually
like her super top rated

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.680
TED talk is a very short
talk about how walking

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.690
is important because
otherwise sitting

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.390
is the smoking of
our generation.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.330
So she's written on a
whole number of topics.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.610
And it's great to have her here
to talk to us about her latest

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.834
book, which is called
"The Power of Onlyness".

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:17.250
And she'll obviously tell you
much more about this concept

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.660
and why she came up with it.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.460
But it's basically
about how each of us

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.220
is unique in their own right.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.110
She's drawn from a whole load
of different examples of people

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.110
she's interviewed for the
book, but also from he

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.570
sort of own
experience at working

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.820
at companies like
Adobe and Apple

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.400
as well as startups
in the early days.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.430
So she's got this sort of
really kind of very wide career.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.960
And she is now a
recognized thinker.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.860
And she just told me that she's
now like ranked as number 22

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.660
on the top management
thinker list.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.550
So it's a pleasure
to have you here.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.610
And I'm going to
hand it over to you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.430
to try and make
these slides work

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.730
or just tell us
about your ideas.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.240
NILOFER MERCHANT: Or
sing and dance, yeah.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.560
SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.230
NILOFER MERCHANT:
Thanks [? Obie. ?]

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.012
So thank you for coming and
actually for all your patience

00:02:04.012 --> 00:02:05.220
through the last few minutes.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.880
And what I want to just
do is share with you

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.869
a thesis about how the
world can and should be.

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:13.660
And it starts with
something really simple.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.830
I don't know if you
guys have caught this,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.246
but in the economists'
world right

00:02:16.246 --> 00:02:19.140
now, there's a conversation
going on about ideas.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.850
We've run out of ideas.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.890
And therefore productivity
and prosperity

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.910
is doomed because, specifically,
America has run out of ideas.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.110
And I don't know about you, but
I find that idea ridiculous.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.760
Because actually my experience
is just the opposite.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.740
I bet yours is too.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.040
Most ideas are dismissed,
not because they're

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.290
considered and
evaluated and deemed

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.430
unworthy, but because of the
packaging that the idea comes

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.490
in.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.270
So if that's person super
young or maybe a woman

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.300
in a male-dominated culture or
a person of color in a mostly

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.780
white culture--

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.470
and fill out the list
however you choose to--

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.350
most ideas are dismissed
because the person who brings

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.870
it lacks power and status.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.240
This problem that we
have of ideas being gone

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.300
is so fundamental
to our economy,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.580
it's so fundamental
to our future.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.870
It's because ideas,
when we give them reign,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.330
pull us into the future.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.040
And so if we don't have
ideas, we have nothing.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.054
And so here at Google we know
how ludicrous that idea is.

00:03:21.054 --> 00:03:22.470
But we actually
have to figure out

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.522
how to change the very framework
by which we evaluate ideas

00:03:25.522 --> 00:03:26.980
in order for us to
change the world

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.000
and ultimately change our
ability to create the future.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.342
Now one of the
people-- so [? Obie ?]

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:34.050
mentioned that I did
a bunch of research.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.240
I actually studied
300 examples in order

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.130
to actually write this book.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.430
I didn't mean to have
to study 300 examples.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.500
But every single
person I was studying

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.780
to understand, how did they
get their idea through,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.990
had a different idea of what
made them successful than what

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.824
was actually true.

00:03:49.824 --> 00:03:51.240
So there was no
repeatable pattern

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.420
until I studied 300, until
I found the through line.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.910
And one of those stories
is Franklin Leonard.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.820
Franklin started an organization
called The Black List which

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.170
reinvented Hollywood.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.110
But when he actually showed
up, he was this young

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.060
20-something-years-old guy.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.890
He had worked for a congressman.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.834
He had worked at McKinsey
and gotten fired.

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:11.250
And then he showed
up in Hollywood

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.340
after-- get this-- he had done
a weekend of Netflix binge

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.579
watching and realized the only
thing he had ever really loved

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.870
was storytelling in movies.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.911
And so he thought, I'll
just show up in Hollywood

00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:22.440
and figure out how to break in.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.970
So he schlepped coffee.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.580
And one of the jobs
that junior people do

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.110
is to actually read scripts.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.610
And he found most
of the scripts had

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.300
these really trite storylines
that just kind of repeated

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.160
the same heroic
architecture and didn't

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.316
reflect the stories that he
wanted to see in the world.

00:04:38.316 --> 00:04:39.690
And one point he
thought, there's

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.360
got to be a different way.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.440
So he went through his
entire Rolodex of people

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.750
he had met in the last
year, and literally

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.250
like went through and said, oh,
I saw this person for lunch,

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.880
I saw this person for dinner,
and organized an 89% email

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.980
list under an alias--

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.580
Google-- and actually
sent out a note saying,

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.317
if you share with me the movies
you've seen in the last year

00:04:59.317 --> 00:05:01.650
that you've loved but haven't
been put into production--

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.180
excuse me, scripts, not movies--

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.700
I will collate it that up,
using his McKinsey skills,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.229
and I will send it back to you.

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:10.520
So that's the give and the get.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.724
Do that and let's
see where it goes.

00:05:12.724 --> 00:05:13.640
And people cooperated.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.290
In fact they shared
it with friends.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.480
And he ended up doing
this tabulation process,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.250
only because he wanted to find
the scripts his boss would

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.104
need.

00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:22.520
And the reason he
used an alias is

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.311
because he didn't want
his boss to think he

00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:26.180
wasn't good at his job.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.976
So he does this.

00:05:26.976 --> 00:05:29.600
This is back in the days when we
actually all went on vacation,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.560
actually logged off.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.050
So he printed off the top five
that he got from the master

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.060
list, took off.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.910
He comes back two weeks
later and his inbox

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.740
full of this roll up
list, this blacklist, all

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.780
sent back to him saying,
this is the most amazing list

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.280
of scripts.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.320
We should all be
taking a look at it.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.050
And so literally hundreds
of emails are in his inbox

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.620
because no one knows it's him
that has started this process.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.934
Now if it was a
build, you could see

00:05:57.934 --> 00:06:00.350
that some of the movies that
have been put into production

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.920
because of The Black List are
"Juno" and "The King's Speech".

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.060
Who would imagine, right?

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.560
And so these were
these scripts that

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.087
were destined for the dustbin
and pulled out and put back

00:06:10.087 --> 00:06:12.170
on the master list, that
we should really consider

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.800
these odd ducky stories--

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.590
"Moonlight".

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.870
One of the things
that Franklin did

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.340
is he asked a
brand-new question.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.460
And I said it in such a quick
way when I first rolled out,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.490
what did he ask his people, that
it's worth kind of pausing on.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.139
He asked, what movies
do you love that haven't

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.180
been put into production?

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.262
What scripts do you love?

00:06:33.262 --> 00:06:35.470
And the reality is, that's
not how Hollywood has been

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.980
formatted up to this point.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.420
What's Hollywood sort on--

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.002
what will make us money.

00:06:42.002 --> 00:06:43.460
And by doing it
through an alias he

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.960
actually found a
community of people

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.630
who cared about
the same question

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.920
as that, a different
kind of purpose

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.970
pulling people together.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.553
And it provided enough anonymity
that people could essentially

00:06:52.553 --> 00:06:54.170
vote the way their
heart felt, not

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.900
vote the way their boss
might want them to vote.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.322
And so it changed an
access of orientation.

00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:02.780
And one of the
things that shows us

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.190
is really the power of
community in that process.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.280
So often we think about
power, the ability

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.630
to get things done, as personal.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.463
And so we'll often
describe-- like Franklin,

00:07:13.463 --> 00:07:16.940
in fact, gets featured in "Fast
Company" and stuff as the guy,

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.720
as he changed Hollywood because
he produced The Black List.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.420
And it's a singular
hero that is carved out

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.300
as if it's not in context
to all the other people who

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.500
participated.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.134
And so surely he had
grit and surely he

00:07:29.134 --> 00:07:30.800
asked a brand-new
question and surely he

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.356
did absolutely an
amazing set of things.

00:07:33.356 --> 00:07:35.105
But the thing that
actually made The Black

00:07:35.105 --> 00:07:38.510
List powerful to
get that effort done

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.377
is a social act, a communal act.

00:07:42.377 --> 00:07:44.710
And that's community in a
different way than, let's say,

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.360
how Facebook used it.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.210
Facebook uses the term
community as a group of people

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.980
that we can then monetize.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.984
That's not an actual
community, right?

00:07:52.984 --> 00:07:54.400
Community is a
group of people who

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.080
are held together by
shared beliefs, a shared

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.300
set of purposes.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:03.367
And then together they can do
things in a meaningful way.

00:08:03.367 --> 00:08:04.950
This is important
also because I think

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.575
it changes how we
might think about how

00:08:06.575 --> 00:08:08.220
we conceive of our work.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.050
Instead of thinking,
what can I do,

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.190
you start to think, who can I
organize around a new question?

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.080
And if you walk away
with nothing else

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.200
other than that
vignette and that story,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.940
it might change how we
think and conceive of how

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.190
we gather power in our lives.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.290
Because if the story's
always a singular

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.620
hero on top of a magazine
cover, we miss the real point.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.250
That's individuating something
that is deeply connected.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.950
Now most of us lack that
connection, that ability

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.950
to kind of think about, what
is it that gives me meaning?

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.610
In fact 61% of us, the data
says, cover or hide ourselves

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:44.450
at work--

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.610
covering being defined
as, we actually

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.180
don't show up as
our true selves.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.270
Some of the vignettes
in the research--

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.080
a guy wearing glasses
because he didn't

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.247
want to look young, a young
man who didn't talk about how

00:08:57.247 --> 00:08:59.330
he wanted to be a co-parent
because he didn't want

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.740
his colleagues to
think he wasn't

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.100
interested in his career,
and so on and so on.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.310
What was most surprising about
that detail, that 61% of us

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.430
cover or hide ourselves at
work, is that it didn't just

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.820
affect traditional groups
of underserved and underseen

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.870
people.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.820
45%, nearly half of
straight white men,

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.036
also say they cover,
which makes sense

00:09:19.036 --> 00:09:21.410
if you think about all the
different ways in which people

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.860
believe they have to fit to
an archetype or some mirage

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.700
of normal in order to
actually fit in at work.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.560
And as long as we're
fitting in that way,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.720
we're not actually
being our true selves.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.197
And from that place
of true self is

00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:36.530
where we understand what gives
us meaning, what gives us

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.260
purpose, and what things we
actually care about, therefore

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.620
the genesis of our ideas.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.740
Now this lack of social
standing-- we show up at work.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.980
Fitting in is the greatest
barrier to belonging.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.500
When we lack that ability to
belong as our true selves,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.750
we also lack the ability
to generate ideas

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.680
that we care about.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.720
I was talking with a banking
executive not so long ago.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.570
And this woman was saying she
had a really innovative idea

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.860
for how to change the
low end of the market,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.612
how to serve the deep poor,
the people who use those cash

00:10:09.612 --> 00:10:12.070
and carry kind of places where
the check-cashing places are

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:12.670
used.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.425
They typically take between
5% and 10% of that check.

00:10:15.425 --> 00:10:17.050
And she said she had
a way for her bank

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.780
to serve that marketplace
with less than half a percent.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.217
And I was like, oh my God.

00:10:21.217 --> 00:10:23.050
You could get a whole
bunch of new customers

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.482
and it would change an entire
group of people's lives, right?

00:10:26.482 --> 00:10:27.940
And she says, "Yeah,
but I'll never

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.080
tell the people
sitting at this table."

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.000
And I looked at her with
that sort of tilt in my head.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.800
I thought, why would
you not say it?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.420
Why would you not own it?

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.940
And it wasn't hard to
think about for a second.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.470
She sat there and
she said, "Yeah,

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.420
that person has an Hermes bag.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.940
That person has a
such and such tie."

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.290
And she said all these people
have wealthy backgrounds.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.600
And she didn't ever
want to show that she

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.760
didn't have that same
background, because what

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.020
was she doing?

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.260
She was fitting in
in order to belong.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.010
And as long as she was
fitting in in order

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.469
to belong in that
half soul kind of way,

00:11:02.469 --> 00:11:04.510
she was never also going
to claim that thing that

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.840
was true for her, her history
and experience, her own visions

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.540
and hopes based on that
history and experience.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.930
Without social standing, we lack
the ability to actually create

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.730
change, real change,
the change we actually

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.930
want to see in the world.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.106
Now I've written--
[? Obie ?] alluded to it.

00:11:22.106 --> 00:11:24.230
I've written two books
before on collaborative work

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.670
and how power should
be distributed

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.020
within organizations,
so basically talking

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.120
about flat organizations
and breaking down

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.039
the perimeter of organizations
to open up innovation.

00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:33.830
And a lot of times
people say, well, you've

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.390
studied these business
models for years.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.765
You've done
innovation for years.

00:11:36.765 --> 00:11:38.450
This must be why you care.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.640
And actually the
real reason of why

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.430
I noticed this grouping problem
is because of my own heritage.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.100
You see when I was
18 years old, I

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.700
was actually supposed to
get an arranged marriage.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.909
And I had returned home in fact.

00:11:51.909 --> 00:11:54.200
When I was 18 I'd gone to
community college for the day

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.105
and returned home.

00:11:55.105 --> 00:11:57.730
And there my aunties and uncles
and stuff had filled the house.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.050
And if you know Indian
families, they're

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.400
just all like over the place.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.980
And they had been
there to tell me

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.380
that my arranged marriage
was, well, arranged,

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.950
and the sort of terms
of the deal were set.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.677
And I had turned to my uncle
who was sort of representing--

00:12:11.677 --> 00:12:14.260
because my father wasn't in the
picture-- who was representing

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.760
me, or representing our
family, and said, "So did you

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.790
ask the guy if I could
get an education?",

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.790
because that was the only
thing I had ever said.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.781
If you could please make
sure that was taken care of,

00:12:24.781 --> 00:12:25.780
I would be OK with that.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.280
Because ever since I was 4 and
1/2 and moved to this country

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.810
I understood my job to be that
of taking care of my mother

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.270
and getting this arranged
marriage as a way of serving

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.497
the family.

00:12:35.497 --> 00:12:37.080
And my uncle had
turned to me and said

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.710
no, "She won't let me ask
because she's negotiating

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.350
for a house and some other
things so her future is taken

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:44.470
care of.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.530
She doesn't want to also ask
for your needs and interests."

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:52.000
So I was polite enough
to wait until my aunties

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.560
and uncles left, and then
I turned to her, my mother,

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.720
and I had done this sort
of theatrical thing, which

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.390
is not my style normally.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.169
And I had gone to Future
Business Leaders of America,

00:13:04.169 --> 00:13:05.710
so this sentence is
entirely informed

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.650
by a Future Business Leaders
of America club in high school.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.170
And I said, "I am the product.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.350
You cannot do the
deal without me.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.220
So ask the guy if I can
get an education and this

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.300
will be done."

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.030
And I had turned the closest
thing next to me, a cardboard

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.550
box without a lid or
anything, like grocery box,

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.420
and I grabbed it and I had
put in five books and one

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:33.857
outfit, no toothbrush, no money,
because I didn't have any.

00:13:33.857 --> 00:13:36.190
And you can tell my priorities,
right books, one outfit.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.550
And I was just doing
this theatrical thing of,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.020
and I'm leaving unless
you change your mind.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.860
And I actually thought this
would end in about an hour.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.640
And so I walked down the
street to the local donut shop,

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.690
as one does--

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.770
carbohydrates, everything.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.000
And I thought I was just going
to wait it out and then call

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.890
home and be like, it's done.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.730
When I called home, the
situation only escalated, like,

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.190
we're never going
to change our mind.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.230
But you come home right now.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.960
And one day turn into two.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.170
Two days turned into three.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.510
And well, it's been 30 years.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.060
And I got exited from
my family homeless,

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:20.120
uneducated, no cash in
the pocket kind of thing,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:26.910
to go off and figure out this
new direction in my life.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:31.260
In that moment, my
identity was being defined.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.120
My value of the
world, my ability

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.190
to create my own
space in the world

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.230
was being defined by what--

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:42.300
a group I belonged to, in this
case being an Indian or Muslim

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.570
or woman, some
combination thereof, that

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.800
said the only value you
have to us in the world

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.520
is to serve in this
way, in this box.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.560
That was the first
time I saw groupings.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.240
And I thought, well, it's
probably true to my family.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.193
But then I would go on and do--

00:15:01.193 --> 00:15:04.660
one of my first jobs was
as an admin at Apple.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.290
And I showed up in one
of those early meetings .

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.827
I was such an eager kid to
want to prove myself and stuff.

00:15:12.827 --> 00:15:14.410
And at one time they
said, "Hey, we're

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.230
going to brainstorm about
X. Come to the meeting.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.310
We're going to do this."

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.800
And I remember doing all
the research I could find

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.900
and formulating
questions and showing up

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.474
and being so excited.

00:15:24.474 --> 00:15:25.890
You can totally
picture it, right,

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.056
like this sort of like, yay.

00:15:27.056 --> 00:15:29.620
And it only took a minute
or two, maybe even three,

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.400
to realize no one was
making eye contact with me.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.450
Because it turns
out in that room

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.320
it was the MBAs
who had the ability

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.640
to qualify for having ideas,
seeing through that category,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.710
not for everyone.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.110
In later jobs it
would be engineers

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.630
were the people we
expected to have ideas, not

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.830
marketing people.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.760
[? Obie, ?] you might
recognize that one.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.420
Or in other jobs it's only
the top executive management

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.290
team is allowed to have
ideas, not this other group.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.940
And so this thing
about groupings

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.947
ended up showing up
throughout my career in tech,

00:16:04.947 --> 00:16:07.280
throughout all the different
ways in which I was driving

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.821
strategy and innovation
and realizing

00:16:08.821 --> 00:16:11.540
that's actually the biggest
limiting factor is that we're

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.420
not noticing the one thing
that actually counts,

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.420
the individual that's
standing right in front of us,

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:22.550
invisible to some, but purely
able to offer that perspective,

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.560
that idea that they have.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.310
Sometimes they're
invisible to themselves.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.610
I'm not suggesting
it's just external.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:36.540
But it is denying the power
of the singular voice,

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.530
and making invisible
that which has value

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:44.410
simply because of the packaging,
not because of the idea.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.480
So I'll fast forward
and just point out

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.820
that this is actually
a trend that allows

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.020
us to do innovation, right?

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.100
So Apple and Google helped
change the mobile marketplace.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.120
I was around back when
companies like Apple or Samsung

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.160
used to actually choose--

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.359
the term was choosing on deck
which apps they would provide,

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:07.236
one or two or three apps costing
about $1 million to $2 million

00:17:07.236 --> 00:17:09.819
in development, probably about
the same in sales and marketing

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:10.750
expense.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.910
And those companies
would then decide,

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.910
choose for the consumer-- here's
the thing they would offer.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.550
And Apple came along and
changed that developer platform

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.130
so it only cost $10,000
to be able to participate

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.770
in that ecosystem, allowing
a marketplace of ideas

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.230
to happen in the form of apps.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.290
And then Google came along
and did it one better, always,

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:33.220
and dropped it down to $500
and changed this opportunity

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.800
for people to come
from everywhere

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.270
and be able to participate.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.160
And when I started
spotting that I was like,

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.820
is that a pattern that would
allow a whole bunch of people

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.180
to suddenly become available
in the marketplace of ideas?

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.960
Could that idea transpose the
immediate of a smartphone app

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.720
or a platform-based model?

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:59.584
And that's when I had actually
coined this term onlyness.

00:17:59.584 --> 00:18:01.375
Essentially it's an
economic thesis, right?

00:18:01.375 --> 00:18:04.060
It's basically arguing that
value can come from anywhere.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.030
Ideas come from that spot in
the world that each of us stand.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.850
They can scale in connectedness.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.770
So you can see the two
parts, "only-ness".

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.485
I should not go into marketing.

00:18:14.485 --> 00:18:16.150
But I was basically
arguing, this

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.090
is the way in which we will
create value in the future.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:24.100
Now I still believe this.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.132
Oh, the build's
not going to work?

00:18:27.132 --> 00:18:30.120
But it's a really pretty build.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:36.680
The opportunity for each of
us to finally get a chance

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.100
to actually stand more
deeply in our own truth,

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.600
and like Franklin,
be able to ask

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.820
new questions of our workforce,
of our work environment,

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.940
and even outside that.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.730
It could change not only
what we individually do

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.770
but what we're able
to create together.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:19:00.167
I think to those economists
who say we've run out of ideas,

00:19:00.167 --> 00:19:02.250
I think they've only counted
about 30 some percent

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.520
of the ideas, the ideas that
come from traditional power

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.660
base, which in America is
mostly white and mostly male,

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.360
and mostly from places
that sound like "Hah-vuhd",

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.150
when they could actually come
from each and every single one

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.830
of us.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.100
In fact if I could ask you to
do one little exercise with me,

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:26.960
close your eyes for a second
and think back to that time

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.150
when you first were
valued just as yourself.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.380
Somebody saw you and
said, this is who you are,

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.410
and it's special, or
this is what you can do,

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.350
and that's good.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:47.320
They saw some light in
you, some shining capacity,

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.850
and wanted that to come forward.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:57.000
Imagine now if everyone
was given that same idea.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.950
I think that's the power of what
we can do next, that each of us

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.160
as we stand in that spot in
the world only we stand in,

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.770
we can be deeply
rooted in our purpose.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.810
And as we do that,
it will help us

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.370
find the people who care about
the same things as we do.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.620
And as we do that, we end
up being able to actually

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.830
shape the world around
us, to not just include

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.270
those opinions
that are currently

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.900
heard but the set of
opinions that are everywhere.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.320
That can reshape the world
to include all of our voices

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.910
in a much more equal and
fair way, and also of course

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.070
allows the power to innovate.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.820
So that's what I came
to say and share.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.430
And the rest of the time is
really just about a chance

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.800
to do Q&amp;A. And
[? Obie ?] can come

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.180
and-- she probably even
has a question knowing her.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.600
But we'll pass
along the mic too.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.400
You can ask anything from
what's it like to write a book--

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.500
some people like to
ask that question--

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.499
to-- go.

00:21:02.499 --> 00:21:03.290
SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.210
So just put your hand up
and I'll pass you the mic so

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.200
that people can hear it.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.040
So I'm going to kick
off with a question.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.340
So one of the things
that intrigued me

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:17.120
about onlyness and this
sort of relationship

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.100
between the individual
and the groups

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.460
is that when we talk about
diversity and inclusion,

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.970
we often talk about
specific groups, like women

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.590
or gay people, et cetera.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.040
And as we kind of experience
at Google, that some of that

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.065
can be very exclusionist
and people sort

00:21:33.065 --> 00:21:35.690
of saying, well, why are you
giving privilege to this group

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.210
or why did that group have
privilege in the first place,

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.960
and so on.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.370
And so one of the things
I think is interesting

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.920
about this is that you bring it
back to the individual rather

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.430
than the group.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.096
So can you talk a
little bit about that,

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:47.120
what the implications
would be if we

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.360
thought about diversity and
inclusion in a different way?

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.710
NILOFER MERCHANT: Sure.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.800
So in fact I felt so
bad for the situation

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.140
that happened this summer
because it was completely

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:00.350
predictable, that if you
start doing, oh, we're

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:01.970
going to try to
include this group,

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.970
it feels to the group on the
other side of the teeter-tot,

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.630
that power is being displaced,
that they're being replaced.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:13.144
And if we're actually talking
about a limited sum of the pie,

00:22:13.144 --> 00:22:15.560
then you understand why people
are fighting over that pie.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.726
This model actually says
something different, right,

00:22:17.726 --> 00:22:19.880
which is that as you
open up the opportunity,

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.010
more opportunity exists,
just like that Apple example.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.220
So let's just use a specific.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.060
In fact you helped
me find this story.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.570
So one of the stories in the
book is the story of Foldit.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:33.130
Does anybody know this
story by any chance?

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.920
Cheater, she's read the book.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.000
So Foldit is an
online platform that

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.970
was started based out of
University of Washington.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.150
And they were trying to solve
a problem in the bio sciences

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:49.650
space where if proteins
fold incorrectly,

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.820
they basically cause
disease, bottom line.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.580
And so things like
Alzheimer's and stuff

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.400
are all diseases caused
by misfolded proteins.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.560
And they were
realizing, this UW team,

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.330
that every research
team around the world

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.580
was recreating the
problem of how proteins

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.340
were misfolding in order
to do the actual research

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.480
they wanted to do.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.590
And they thought,
this is kind of silly.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.870
There ought to be like a
repository you can draw on

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.090
so that the foundational
work is there

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.040
and people can build
on it, therefore

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.270
accelerating the research.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.810
And they started an online
app to basically crowd science

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:19.620
this process.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.411
And at first they
thought, their first step

00:23:21.411 --> 00:23:23.920
was, we're going to get
PhDs from around the world.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.040
So think globalization
of talent, right?

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.560
And that didn't turn out to
have any breakthroughs at all.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.440
They let it run
for almost a year.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.300
And so then they thought,
maybe there's another way.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.449
What if we actually
allow anyone?

00:23:35.449 --> 00:23:37.740
Could we actually allow
anyone, quite possibly everyone

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.374
to participate?

00:23:38.374 --> 00:23:40.290
Why don't we build a
game that would teach you

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.450
the fundamentals, like
basically teaching

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.850
how proteins fold, and then
you can take it from there.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.190
And that created more resolve.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.580
But then they
realized actually--

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.470
they were sitting
there watching the game

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.380
and noticing that people were
crowding around the people who

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.430
had degrees from certain
schools or that were men

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.010
and not actually
noticing who actually

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.734
was good at the
protein-folding problem.

00:24:01.734 --> 00:24:03.150
And they could
spot the difference

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.560
because they themselves
had actually-- you

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.760
know, they were studying it.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.780
And they just thought,
well what if we actually

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.270
hide those social
signals and just tune

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.180
them down so that if you really
want to know, you could know,

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.060
but the focus is entirely on,
oh, that's working better,

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.939
and people can notice that.

00:24:16.939 --> 00:24:17.730
That was one thing.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:20.520
And then the other thing they
started to do was they actually

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.130
just realized they were
rewarding individuals instead

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.440
of rewarding group work.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.932
So most work today is
complex problem solving.

00:24:27.932 --> 00:24:29.640
Complex problem solving
is not [? Obie ?]

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.681
sitting by herself or
Nilofer sitting by herself.

00:24:31.681 --> 00:24:33.812
It's how we start to
play off each other.

00:24:33.812 --> 00:24:36.270
And so then as soon as they
changed the reward system to be

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.811
we all win together if we all
help each other go through this

00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:40.562
thing-- they'd share
in the credit--

00:24:40.562 --> 00:24:43.020
it changed how people actually
responded in what they work.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.870
And then they created
these breakthroughs.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.270
So I think the
problem is most of us

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.940
have too many social
signals in the way,

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.130
and we're focusing on
that instead of the work.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:58.960
And so I don't think about
diversity and inclusion as,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.770
I want to go recruit
X number of people.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:05.250
It's, what problems
do we have, and what

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:06.930
is the mechanism
in place that would

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.880
allow a whole bunch of
people to come and play

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.150
with that problem?

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.417
So if I'm really practical, when
I was doing consulting work,

00:25:13.417 --> 00:25:15.000
one of the things
we would do is go in

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.070
and we'd signed a
contract with the company

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.070
and say we're going to
help you solve X problem.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.800
And this is typically after
they had failed at it themselves

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.900
and hired a BCG or
McKinsey or whatever

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.070
and failed at it with them.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.080
And then we were in the
room and we would say,

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.090
we're going to be in
charge of the process.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:31.923
They would of course
nod their head because,

00:25:31.923 --> 00:25:34.320
by the way, who wants to be
in charge of the process,

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.597
and completely signed off
to that, without a thought.

00:25:36.597 --> 00:25:38.430
And then the first day
we'd say, well, we're

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.250
going to send out an email
to anyone at the company,

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.250
as broad a group as
possible, sometimes

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.800
the entire company
roster, and say,

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.885
anybody who wants to come
help us with this can come.

00:25:47.885 --> 00:25:50.010
And they would always have
this total look of panic

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.870
go across their
face, like I don't

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:54.600
want the ad man or the
salesperson who's not happy

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.886
or the--

00:25:56.886 --> 00:25:58.260
it's almost like
the thought that

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.770
would go through their head
is, I don't want the crazy.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.130
And I'm putting that in air
quotes for a reason, right?

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.620
I don't want the crazy or
the wild one in the room

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.690
because we have
a process to run.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.310
And I'm like, trust us,
we'll actually get there.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:13.544
And as soon as you can have all
that difference around the room

00:26:13.544 --> 00:26:15.960
and allow each difference to
actually have their own voice

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.000
or create the space for that--

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.680
so it could be sometimes
we had Post-its

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.680
and let people have their
ideas and it turns out

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.300
the Post-its came from a person
who had relatively low power.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.510
But as soon as you disassociated
the power status to the idea,

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.509
you could see the
idea for what it was.

00:26:30.509 --> 00:26:32.550
Then all of a sudden two,
three, four weeks later

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.650
we'd have this
breakthrough in the room.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:34.590
And it always--

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.960
I mean always, I say
this universally--

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:41.700
came from that crazy and
wild person in the room.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.330
And so how do we do that then
for all of our organizations?

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.790
How do we actually start to
go take down the signals,

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:49.380
tune it down?

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.519
So how do we recruit
engineering people

00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:53.310
without knowing that
they're a women first?

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.620
The data says that if
we don't know that,

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.610
we're more likely to
use that person's code.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.750
So how do we just engineer
more in the system a way

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.070
to tune down social signals?

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.670
And so that easy,
practical thing

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.872
of using Post-its in a
room to generate ideas

00:27:08.872 --> 00:27:10.830
instead of going around
the room, because we're

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.140
more likely to dismiss an
idea based on power status,

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.372
would be an easy one.

00:27:14.372 --> 00:27:16.830
There's probably a hundred of
those methods that could just

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.850
be streamlined into the business
that would allow us to actually

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.590
see and contribute those ideas.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.770
Soon as you focus on the
ideas and not on the person,

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.710
I think we start
to change things.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:28.780
SPEAKER: They do.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.410
And by the way, the best
protein folder in their set

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.906
was an admin assistant
from Manchester, England.

00:27:34.906 --> 00:27:36.280
NILOFER MERCHANT:
Who by the way,

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.130
it's not irrelevant
to this, given

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:39.760
the climate of
sexual harassment,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.410
she had left the industry
because, as a nurse,

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.720
she had experienced so much
sexism that she actually

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.610
left the medical field.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.694
This is a pattern that we've
seen over and over again

00:27:50.694 --> 00:27:51.360
in recent weeks.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.060
If you read all the vignettes
of the stories of people leaving

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.890
Hollywood or people
leaving tech,

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.680
it's so much sexism, just
at some point you're like,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.680
OK, OK, I give up.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.180
I'll leave.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.520
I'll tone down my ambitions.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.440
I'll go to more
female-oriented careers.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.731
And of course that's why
women don't have as much power

00:28:06.731 --> 00:28:08.912
and status in industries.

00:28:08.912 --> 00:28:09.874
Questions?

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:19.135
Really, we answered everything,
or you guys just really shy?

00:28:19.135 --> 00:28:20.010
We have one here too.

00:28:22.782 --> 00:28:25.610
AUDIENCE: I guess I have
a question about unlocking

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:26.690
the onlyness early on.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:27.600
NILOFER MERCHANT: By the
way, what's your name?

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.016
AUDIENCE: Ooh,
sorry, I'm Bridget.

00:28:29.016 --> 00:28:31.210
NILOFER MERCHANT: Bridget.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:32.810
AUDIENCE: If most
of the conversation

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.957
has been centered around
your professional life,

00:28:34.957 --> 00:28:36.290
how can you catch this early on?

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.940
So I'm thinking about my
little sister who's in college.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.480
When I went to visit her,
I was disturbed again

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.767
by the amount of
Greek life and kind

00:28:43.767 --> 00:28:46.100
of like the groupthink that
centers around that and kind

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.980
of like, how can I help her
unlock her onlyness early on?

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.370
That's my question,
stay away from it?

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.144
Have fun, but not too much?

00:28:54.144 --> 00:28:56.060
NILOFER MERCHANT: So I
think one of the things

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.560
is it early on in life
we're often trying

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.880
to figure out how to fit in.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.890
So we're actually giving up
ourselves along that process

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:02.973
and we're just doing it
for basic survival, right?

00:29:02.973 --> 00:29:04.940
So in Maslow's
hierarchy of needs,

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.340
the bottom two levels are
the food, shelter things.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.450
The top two levels are
about self-expression

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.020
and self-actualization, which
is where ideas come from.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.260
In the middle is this big block,
the biggest block of the thing,

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.761
and it's belonging.

00:29:16.761 --> 00:29:18.260
So the question is,
do we understand

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.654
how to find people who care
about the same things as us?

00:29:20.654 --> 00:29:22.070
Most of us are
actually socialized

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:25.419
to look and say, OK, where
are people already gathered?

00:29:25.419 --> 00:29:27.710
And then do we join in without
much intentional thought

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:31.220
about, that's not
really my people, right?

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.400
And so this question about
who are we to one another

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.180
is a question we
need to learn to ask,

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.971
like who am I in this mix, and
then who are we to one another?

00:29:38.971 --> 00:29:40.470
And if you're asking
yourself, gosh,

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.136
I really don't feel
like I belong here--

00:29:42.136 --> 00:29:44.030
maybe your sister
really loves it, right--

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:46.900
but to ask that and learn
that skill about who am I

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.900
in relationship to this.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.725
And I had a young
entrepreneur who

00:29:50.725 --> 00:29:52.100
I think she was
like 20 something

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.433
when she asked me this question.

00:29:53.433 --> 00:29:56.690
And she said she
had gotten her PhD.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.180
She taught-- this was a
very accomplished young

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.880
entrepreneur--

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.670
was a yoga fanatic, and
had a boyfriend that she

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:06.050
was thinking about marrying.

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:08.330
And she said, "In order for
me to decide what's next,

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:10.163
which of these four
things do I have to cut?

00:30:10.163 --> 00:30:11.840
Should I quit teaching?

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.880
Do I quit doing my
entrepreneurial stuff

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.265
that my PhD is based on?

00:30:15.265 --> 00:30:16.640
Do I stop all of
my relationships

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.200
because that's
such a distraction?

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.350
And should I quit yogi
stuff because that's also

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.170
a distraction?"

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:25.190
And I was like, "Why
don't you do all four

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:29.150
and live in the Venn diagram
of everything that is you?"

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.310
And maybe because she
was actually doing really

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:34.070
cutting-edge science
stuff which allows a cell

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:37.220
to act like a heart,
and so on-- so it

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.980
has really strong ethical
implications for if you

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.150
can grow things from nothing.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:46.940
And I said, "Maybe it's your
yogi sense that will actually

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.957
help guide your ethical
usage of this stuff

00:30:49.957 --> 00:30:52.040
because it will remind you
of how connected we are

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.630
and what those decisions are.

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.934
Maybe your relationship
to your students

00:30:55.934 --> 00:30:57.350
will remind you
that you're trying

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.630
to teach the next generation
about those same set

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.691
of ethical implications, not
just the pure science of it,"

00:31:02.691 --> 00:31:03.190
and so on.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.820
So maybe all of
those things actually

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.035
can belong together,
because she was really

00:31:07.035 --> 00:31:08.660
trying to figure out
how to fit herself

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.304
into a pigeon-hole thing.

00:31:10.304 --> 00:31:11.720
So the greatest
thing we can do is

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:17.450
to actually notice all
of the person and to say,

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:20.240
you know what you really seem
to care about is X, Y, and Z

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.510
and be that.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:24.370
I like to say that
most of us can't

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:28.220
understand our own onlyness
because we're living it.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.056
It's so obvious to everyone
else what we care about,

00:31:31.056 --> 00:31:32.930
but it's actually kind
of hard because you're

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:33.680
in the fuzz of it.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.440
You're literally like mashed
up against the glass of it.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:41.299
And so friends can say, this is
something that you care about.

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:42.590
[? Obie ?] totally gets me too.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.700
So I'm waiting for her to tell
me my onlyness for a second.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.670
But it's like a light
bulb above your head.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:49.350
When you walk into a room,
the whole room changes.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:52.430
So if that light
bulb is tamarind

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.390
orange versus neon orange, it's
a different thing in that room,

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.370
or mallard blue, right?

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.350
And so if your friends
can say to you,

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.570
this seems to be this thing
you really care about,

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.376
it helps reflect it back.

00:32:04.376 --> 00:32:05.750
And so maybe that's
the one thing

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:09.050
you can do for her is
to help notice, what

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:11.550
is it that's so true to
her history and experience

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.670
as well as her visions
and hopes, even

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.370
something that's just a
thread she's ultimately

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.290
going to pull on.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:20.151
Does that help?

00:32:20.151 --> 00:32:20.650
Yeah?

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.430
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Jason.

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:23.500
NILOFER MERCHANT: Jason.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:29.040
AUDIENCE: I noticed that one
barrier for participation

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.260
is the ability to
speak the language.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.980
For example, if you are in
a room with a bunch of MBAs

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.070
and if you don't
have the background,

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:45.130
you can hardly really talk
with them in all those jargon

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.060
that they use.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.830
Same for engineers-- if you
don't have a computer science

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.767
background, oftentimes
you don't really

00:32:53.767 --> 00:32:55.100
know what they're talking about.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.720
And when you talk in
your own language,

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.660
they can easily
dismiss your ideas.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.165
Do you have any comment on that?

00:33:03.165 --> 00:33:04.540
NILOFER MERCHANT:
No, language is

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.821
one of those invisible ways
in which we group people,

00:33:07.821 --> 00:33:08.320
absolutely.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.220
We use jargon to say we're
in this industry in this way.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:16.740
And in fact the UW team, that
was one of their big insights.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.820
It was Adrian-- and I
interviewed him here.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.510
He actually worked at
Google X for a while.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.140
And he said to me--
we were sitting

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.890
in a room with one of the
top physicists in the world,

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:29.380
and he used
absolutely no jargon.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.250
And that's what gave him the
clue to go from PhDs to go

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:36.430
solve this problem to citizen
science-- that was the shift--

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.650
is jargon was
becoming the barrier

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.660
to actually allowing
people to innovate.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.076
It's one of the reasons why,
in the last five or so years,

00:33:43.076 --> 00:33:45.250
I actually use very
little innovation jargon.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:48.760
I'm simplifying my own choices.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.784
And I'm doing that because
I'm trying to make--

00:33:51.784 --> 00:33:53.700
I'm trying to get past
my own bullshit, right?

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.408
And I mean that in
the greatest-- like we

00:33:55.408 --> 00:33:57.380
go through all this
training to learn stuff,

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.420
but sometimes you have to
go, OK, I actually know that.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.794
So now how do I communicate
it in a much simpler and more

00:34:01.794 --> 00:34:02.755
elegant way?

00:34:02.755 --> 00:34:04.880
So you've actually reached
a really profound truth,

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.640
which is most of the time most
of us are using jargon to say,

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.760
I'm in this club,
and that can mean

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.040
I'm educated and credentialed.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.699
It can mean I'm an engineer and
not one of you marketing people

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:17.000
that doesn't talk this way.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.779
My husband is a chip
designer, and I'm

00:34:18.779 --> 00:34:20.570
fascinated when I read
his resume because I

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.310
don't understand most of it.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.601
And he asked me for some help
recently in looking at it

00:34:24.601 --> 00:34:26.360
and I was like,
"Well I can give you

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.210
the gist of it, like if the
sentence structure is right

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:30.920
or if the main idea
is popping out,

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.420
but I can't really talk to
you about anything else.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.010
You might want to have
somebody else do that part."

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:36.350
But I was really saying,
we do this thing where

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.780
we create separations,
partially to say,

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.087
this is the club I'm in.

00:34:40.087 --> 00:34:42.170
And the question is when
we're talking in meetings

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.810
then maybe we can actually
kind of find a way to tone

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:45.586
down the jargon.

00:34:45.586 --> 00:34:47.210
And you can even say
that right, right?

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:48.440
Hey, jargon might be
getting in the way

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.898
for us finding a
breakthrough idea,

00:34:49.898 --> 00:34:52.310
so why don't we just figure
out how to dial it down?

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:54.080
Which is why that Post-it
example-- and I could probably

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.955
give you another hundred
examples like that--

00:34:55.955 --> 00:34:58.300
can be the way to get
past language choices.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.330
It's intentionality.

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:01.350
It's intentionality.

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:02.266
It's a great question.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.690
- Hi, my name is Ada.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:07.560
I can only imagine--

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.160
NILOFER MERCHANT:
Like Ada Lovelace?

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah, people say that.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:14.540
I'm not named after that.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.880
I'm more about the palindrome
because my mom's name is Anna,

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.260
which is also a palindrome.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.790
I don't know where she
got that idea from.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:22.785
Anyway--

00:35:22.785 --> 00:35:25.076
NILOFER MERCHANT: Well there's
an onlyness story there.

00:35:25.076 --> 00:35:26.190
AUDIENCE: It totally is.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.690
NILOFER MERCHANT: Yeah, totally.

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:29.490
AUDIENCE: I can only
imagine the courage

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:33.090
you had to have
in order to speak

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.830
in that room of people who
won't even give you eye contact.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:41.280
As Asian women like
myself, like at first

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.830
my English wasn't
even smooth enough.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.900
And going into the
room with people taller

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.770
and bigger male guy, I have
often had that experience.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:54.300
And sometimes I
really try to fit in

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.980
in order to make someone
notice like I'm actually here.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.900
I'm curious, from
your experience,

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.930
how do you give
courage in that moment?

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:08.930
And how do you even make your
voice heard, because I actually

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:12.090
believe that you need
to make yourself belong.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:16.680
Then you take a step back
and show that, by the way,

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.320
I also have this uniqueness.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.769
But I don't know, maybe there
is another way to do it.

00:36:21.769 --> 00:36:23.310
NILOFER MERCHANT:
This is the tension

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.190
of how do we belong to a group
that we have to influence

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:29.080
and also assert our own ideas?

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.070
So one way is to actually have
an invisible network always

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.220
there with you.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.397
So there's a group
of people that you

00:36:35.397 --> 00:36:37.230
have to get along with,
but you can actually

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.880
build an invisible network of
people in the room with you.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:44.355
So for example, I belong
to-- it's in the book,

00:36:44.355 --> 00:36:48.450
if you get to chapter 4,
this group called the list.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.210
And it was a group
of women started

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:54.870
trying to figure how to
change the ratio on stages,

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.090
in boardrooms, et cetera--

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.620
entrepreneurial settings.

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.140
And so it was a private list.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.790
And so you'd ask
questions like-- one

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:06.720
of my favorite ones was, so this
one VC always smells my hair.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.530
Should I worry about the
smelling of the hair?

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:12.840
And other people shared,
actually that guy

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.960
smells everyone's hair.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.880
It's genderless.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.480
That guy has a hair fetish.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.960
And so it's the weirdest
thing to discover,

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.210
but it became the whisper
network made visible, right?

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:24.210
So then all of us were
starting to share stories

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:26.160
about what was working
in venture funding, who

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.330
was doing what.

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.040
It became the back channel.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.890
So at any given point I
could be in a meeting saying,

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:32.940
I'm experiencing this.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:33.810
Anyone have ideas?

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:35.100
And honest to God within
a couple of seconds

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.016
someone would be like,
why don't you try this?

00:37:37.016 --> 00:37:39.345
And it would become this--

00:37:39.345 --> 00:37:42.720
there's this invisible
group of 409 other people

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.570
who are available on
call through texting

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:47.637
to be able to help me
get through my situation.

00:37:47.637 --> 00:37:50.220
And it could be here you might
end up choosing five people who

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.470
are often in that room or
in that setting on your team

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.240
and say, hey, could
we actually figure out

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.830
how to help each
other more, be more

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:59.050
intentional about helping each
other's ideas get promoted?

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:01.524
So maybe if somebody else
is in the room with you,

00:38:01.524 --> 00:38:03.190
they could say, "You
know, what Ada just

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.070
said is really
worth expanding on,"

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:09.060
so that people then draw more
attention back to your idea

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:13.320
if she felt it was getting
skipped over because of that.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.842
You could find ways of building
a network despite the room

00:38:16.842 --> 00:38:17.800
that you have to be in.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.990
Does that make sense?

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.240
So it's an intentionality
of design of who else

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.690
could join you, whether
they're in the room or not,

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:27.030
and figuring out how to
have that set of resources

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.752
available to you.

00:38:27.752 --> 00:38:30.210
That ends up improving your
social standing because now you

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.202
don't get to feel like
the weirdo in the room,

00:38:32.202 --> 00:38:33.660
because at any
given point you have

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.365
a posse invisible to the room
that has always got your back.

00:38:37.365 --> 00:38:39.240
And as long as you have
that social standing,

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.000
you have more
confidence going in.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.360
And I ended up
leaving home that day,

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.980
but I showed up on community
college campus the next day.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.442
And literally I walked down
to the financial aid office.

00:38:49.442 --> 00:38:51.900
I knew the guy who happened to
run the financial aid office

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.660
and said, so this just happened.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.860
And he said, oh, and he
literally took my hand

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.910
and walked me around the campus.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:01.530
And he convinced three
people to give me jobs.

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:02.880
One was a coding job.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.260
One was an usher job.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.120
One was an accounting job.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.430
The usher job I could
do Saturday nights,

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.630
so I could still study.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.700
The accounting job was
a Friday afternoon job

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.950
where once a week I would
sit there and do the history

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:15.750
museum on campus accounting.

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.870
And the other job I
could do basic coding

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.180
to ultimately build the
matriculation program.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.920
I could do it flexible hours.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.620
So between classes I could show
up and do an hour worth of work

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.730
here and there.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:31.130
I literally pieced together, in
that one afternoon, viability.

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:34.050
But this person wanted
me to have an education.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.710
So my family did not, because
they saw me through one lens.

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:40.010
But this person belonged
to a different group.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.410
He believed in the
same thing I believed,

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.540
which is that a
woman, despite her--

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:48.470
I mean a person despite her
gender can have an education.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:51.950
And here is something he
could do to come lend support.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.260
And as soon as you
end up walking away

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.330
from the people who don't
believe in you that you

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:58.970
actually don't belong to
in any kind of real way,

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:01.880
you will ultimately
find the people to whom

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.620
and with whom you do belong.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.800
That walkway, that gang
plank is treacherous.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.960
You feel like you're
going to end up nowhere.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.125
But you ultimately do get there.

00:40:11.125 --> 00:40:12.750
So that's what I
think gives me courage

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:14.208
too is studying
all that and seeing

00:40:14.208 --> 00:40:16.470
that every single one
of the 300 stories

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:19.820
had to walk the gang plank,
and then they ended up

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.010
with a group of people who
actually believed in them

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.670
and could stand with them.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.910
AUDIENCE: Hi, I had a
question, but it turned out

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:28.996
to be a comment now.

00:40:28.996 --> 00:40:30.120
So thank you for the topic.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.490
I'm new to Google and I
think I sometimes experience

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:38.500
some of the things
that you talked about.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.916
But I think the heart of it I
think what these people have

00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:42.710
been asking is,
how do you create

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.617
your credibility in
front of those people

00:40:44.617 --> 00:40:45.450
you are looking for?

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:50.430
It is not necessarily about how
much language barriers you have

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:51.066
and what not.

00:40:51.066 --> 00:40:52.440
I think what you're
trying to say

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:58.800
is, how can I be more
credible to this audience who

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.750
are establishing their own
credibility with their MB

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.790
degrees and whatnot.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.480
And the second
point I want to make

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.140
is I think what
you just explained

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.444
in the previous question
was about the heart of it,

00:41:09.444 --> 00:41:11.610
you are trying to look for
mentors who can guide you

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.270
through this process.

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.830
And it's still the
end of the day,

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:17.960
you still have to walk that
path to make yourself--

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.880
establish your credibility
for those people,

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.990
the group you are
trying to work with.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.490
NILOFER MERCHANT: Yeah, it's a
beautiful set of reflections.

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:26.280
What was your name by the way?

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:26.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:27.690
NILOFER MERCHANT: "A-bee-chee?"

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:28.648
AUDIENCE: "A-bee-chit."

00:41:28.648 --> 00:41:32.330
NILOFER MERCHANT: "A-bee-chit."

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:37.020
So one little-- sorry, your
first one, go back to it

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:37.887
for a second.

00:41:37.887 --> 00:41:38.970
It was credibility, right?

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:41.390
We're trying to
establish credibility.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.880
Most of us have been
conditioned to believe

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.050
that the outside world gets to
identify for us whether or not

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.240
we have value to add.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.790
This is a different
thing to do, which

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:56.860
is to believe that you
already have something to add.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.240
You already have
some value to give.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.482
And so that first step is, how
do we conceive of ourselves

00:42:02.482 --> 00:42:04.940
in such a way that we understand
even if we're not educated

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:11.490
or we're poor or whatever, that
we have value to offer and tilt

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:14.520
the system, and then
say as I value myself,

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.290
I will get valued?

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:19.715
So just standing in that truth
is probably the biggest step.

00:42:19.715 --> 00:42:21.340
Because I mean, I do
this all the time.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.820
I was just emailing
with a girlfriend

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.920
and saying I'm having a
really hard time with some

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.539
of the speaking work I'm doing.

00:42:27.539 --> 00:42:29.580
Because she said, "Well
what you're trying to say

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.910
is this is the biggest
management idea ever, which

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:37.520
is if we're going to be able
to create ideas out of people,

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.690
and that's the entire economy.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.180
What you're saying is onlyness
is the biggest management

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:44.670
idea ever because as you
lead people and recognize

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:46.620
their individuality,
you will actually

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.800
create the kinds of teams,
organizations, blah, blah, blah

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.360
that will actually
create outcomes."

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.422
That is a huge idea.

00:42:52.422 --> 00:42:54.130
And I wrote back to
him and I said, yeah,

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:55.650
that's really easy
if you say it.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:58.350
But by the way, the whole
world hasn't said it yet.

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:02.010
So for me to assert that
as a truth feels crazy.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:04.780
For you to assert that
as a truth does not.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.750
And then I shut the
computer and I went, yeah,

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:10.224
so I'm having a hard time owning
my onlyness, right, totally?

00:43:10.224 --> 00:43:11.640
It's this weird
thing because what

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:18.120
I'm waiting for is some
credentialed moment to say,

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.540
you're allowed to claim
something as an idea.

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:26.160
And so it's just it's just
a flip to actually say,

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.500
I can actually claim that.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.941
And there's enough
data in the system,

00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:31.440
there's enough
signals in the system

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.810
to say it's based on evidence.

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:35.190
The research has been done.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:37.369
The social science
behind it backs it.

00:43:37.369 --> 00:43:38.910
But I still can't
make myself say it.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:40.030
Does that make sense?

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.196
So I understand what you're
talking about influence.

00:43:42.196 --> 00:43:44.910
But the first step is about how
do you conceive of yourself,

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:48.117
because it changes
the value equation.

00:43:48.117 --> 00:43:49.950
SPEAKER: So I think
actually for those of us

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:52.199
who have children, that's
probably the biggest gift we

00:43:52.199 --> 00:43:55.620
can give our kids is to not have
expectations of what they're

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.080
going to do but just
give them the confidence

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.012
that whatever they choose
to do, they can do.

00:44:01.012 --> 00:44:01.970
NILOFER MERCHANT: Yeah.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:03.660
SPEAKER: All right, we have
time for one more question.

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.174
NILOFER MERCHANT: Who
wants to bring it home?

00:44:05.174 --> 00:44:05.940
SPEAKER: No more?

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.590
OK.

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:09.630
Otherwise we're going
to end it on that.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:11.970
And thank you so much
for coming in Nilofer.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:14.430
Thank you for those of you who
joined us on the livestream.

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:14.910
Thanks.

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:15.540
NILOFER MERCHANT: Thanks.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.081
Thanks for just a
great conversation.

00:44:17.081 --> 00:44:20.480
[APPLAUSE]
