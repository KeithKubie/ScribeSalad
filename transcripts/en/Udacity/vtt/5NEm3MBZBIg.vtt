If germ cells underwent mitosis for cell division, when they produce the sperm

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.290
and egg as daughter cells, they would each have 46 chromosomes. And then

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.290
when the sperm and egg fuse together at fertilization, you would end up

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.240
with 92 chromosomes, which is twice as many as humans are supposed to have.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's a lot.
