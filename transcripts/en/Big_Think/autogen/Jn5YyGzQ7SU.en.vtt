policy will most reduce the harm related

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600
policy will most reduce the harm related
 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.469
policy will most reduce the harm related
to drugs and once you start to focus on

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479

associated with drug policy and this is
 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.190
associated with drug policy and this is
why so many harm reduction people

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200
why so many harm reduction people
