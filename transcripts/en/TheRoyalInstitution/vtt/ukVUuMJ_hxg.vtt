00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.630
When is the next mission to Saturn going to be and what would you want to find

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.340
out based on this mission that you don't
already know?

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.080
Don't know when the next mission is going to be

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.500
there are some studies being done in
the States at the moment and depending

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.760
on which scientist you talk to some
would like to focus on Titan and Enceledus

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.560
I'd like to focus on Saturn
but I'm still not quite sure what we

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.940
would want to do we need to get the best
out of our data you know one of the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.489
things about about datasets is they're a treasure trove of information and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.110
I think we're pushing the data as hard
as we can at the moment but there will

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.559
be scientists that come and look at it
in the future and find new and

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.960
interesting things so I'm partial to
Saturn at the moment but that's just

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.320
because the end of mission has been so
spectacular

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.960
Well I presume that it's only

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.680
every so often that the other
planets are aligned who can do this

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.600
slingshot out to Saturn

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.400
Yes you can you can do
really quick slingshots

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.320
The Voyager spacecraft, NASA was really fortunate because

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.400
all the planets were lined up
beautifully so it took it took Voyager

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.990
spacecraft rather a short amount of time
but you can always, you can

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.760
always get out there it's just whether
you want to take five years or ten years

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.360
Okay, questions, comments please wave wildly because I have

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.160
bright lights shining in my eyes

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.120
I was wondering, the visible surface

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.140
features of Saturn um I think that there
is a different rotation at the equator

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.149
than at the pole because it's a gas and I
would assume that in the metallic

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.070
hydrogen interior which is liquid
right because that that's how the dynamo

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.670
works that would also be rotating
differently and that's what's producing

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.880
the magnetic fields and all of these
things are moving at different speeds so

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.579
I guess to what extent can we say that
Saturn has one single day when the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.440
period of the equator of the pole the
interior and the rock are all different?

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.040
Usually when you talk
about the rotation rate of a planet

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.270
you're talking about the interior
rotation rate but yes there are there

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.560
are lots of different rotation rates in
the atmosphere and Jupiter's the same

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.040
you've got different rotation rates in
different parts of the atmosphere

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.560
Can we infer the rocky rotation which isn't
part of the dynamo from

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.810
Can we infer the rotation of the rocky bit which is
not part of the dynamo from the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.520
liquid part which is?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.040
I think you're pushing it a little

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.600
I mean you can use models and

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.200
simulations to try and do that but you
can never be sure

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.560
Hello yes thank you for a wonderful talk that was splendid

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.400
Can I ask you a sort of romantic

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.920
question about Enceledus? You showed us a slide that said simple organics

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:08.680
and complex organics what does that mean
is that is that life or is that amino acids or what?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.959
It's before amino acids so you would
need something else to happen to start

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.160
the the life process and that's where
the length of period of time comes in

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.780
having having ingredients is not enough
you need you need the process to be

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.740
stable enough over time that something
can happen.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.200
Thanks for a great talk

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.280
you know that other open question as well as the rotation rate was the age of

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.080
the rings and can you say something as
to what you currently know about being able

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.910
to age the rings and knowing whether
they're something very recent or

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.079
something that's formed over a great deal of time and what physical

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.160
principles do you use to determine that

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.380
Oh now you're really pushing my knowledge

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.980
I think the only thing I
remember about well part of the the

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.510
F ring part of the ring grating orbit
that the science driving that was to try

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.150
and get an understanding of the
composition of the rings using gravity

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.319
to also try and get an understanding of
the age and my recollection is they're

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.390
younger than people think
what that means I don't know but if you

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.169
go to the Cassini JPL website
sure that there's a there's a write-up

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.949
about that it's it's not my field at all
so I don't know the details of it I'm afraid

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.129
but my understanding is they're
younger than ring scientists thought

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.080
they were going to be

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.240
But not recent

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.240
Okay someone in the gallery, is there a

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.740
microphone up there

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.360
Alright if I shout out?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.060
Could you tell me please what would you say are the possibilities of life on Enceledus?

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.360
Do you think that is the mostly likely one, however you would rate that compared to Titan, to Mars?

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.100
What are your views on that? What sort of percentages can you think?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.660
I knew I was going to get one of those

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.140
It's very difficult to tell

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.719
I would be very surprised if there
wasn't bacterial life of some kind

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:32.270
somewhere I think the outer moons in the solar system are a good possibility

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.710
because we know for example in in some
of the deep regions and our Earth's

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.840
oceans you can have you can have
bacteria forming and conditions where

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.000
you really think it's simply not
possible. I think for me the real step

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.580
change that's happened in the last 50
years or so which has really been

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.440
underpinned by the Cassini observations
of Enceladus and the desire and the new

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.620
missions that are going to Jupiter's
moons is the fact that you can have

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.949
liquid water at quite big distances from
the parent star. People have always

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.330
thought that you can only get liquid
water on the surfaces of bodies and so

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.169
that you know if you're looking at
exoplanets you need to look at planets

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.819
that are close to the parent star but
we've seen with the Jupiter moon

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:25.430
so Ganymede, Europa and Callisto, we think
they all have liquid water under the

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.000
surface and we seen with Enceladus as
well that you've got liquid water you

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.300
don't have to be close to the parent
star so I think for me that's been the

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.389
real change and I didn't answer your
question but

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:37.900
that's as far as I'm gonna go

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.320
Okay somebody else in the gallery could you shout please

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:53.440
Enceledus is tidally locked. Can you say whether the tiger stripes point towards Saturn or at an angle to it

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.960
They're at an angle to the north pole of Enceledus so I think

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.800
they're at an angle to Saturn but but
that's just based on looking at the

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.360
images but yes they sorry you mean the
side that's facing Saturn or the side

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.820
that's facing away from Saturn is that
what you meant?

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.280
- Apologies if my question wasn't very good but basically

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.720
if you're Saturn and I'm Enceledus and this is the south pole

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.640
are the tiger stripes pointing towards you or at a transverse angle to you?

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.820
It's at a transverse angle, yep

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:36.400
Over there please, just wait for the microphone

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.600
Thank you for a great talk,
also I was wondering for the tiger

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.349
stripes do you have any idea where they
came from like where they asteroids

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:50.060
colliding in or something like that

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.440
Don't think so, I think there was

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.219
something happening in the in the
interior so there was a huge amount of

00:07:55.219 --> 00:08:00.949
pressure building and they had and the
liquid water and the the water vapor

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:05.810
that was being generated needed to
escape, yeah, we think something

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:11.330
similar happens at Europa one of
Jupiter's moons but there it's almost

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.080
you know when you see images of you Europa it's almost like you know when you

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.810
fly over Greenland I don't know if
you've ever flown to the States and you

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.259
fly over Greenland and you you look out of
the plane you see the bits of ice

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.360
breaking off from the edge of the ice
shelf that's what it looks like on Europa

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.880
It's different in Enceladus
but but we think we think it was driven

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.760
from internal processes

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.540
You know how you
showed the image of Enceladus the

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:44.060
expected heat map the actual
yeah what's it gets all the extra heat from?

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.360
That's the million-dollar question

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:56.400
It depends which scientist you talk to
everyone has their different ideas with

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:07.390
the easiest solution is that if if a
moon orbits around a planet if the orbit

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:12.250
is completely circular then the moon
will feel the same gravitational pull

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.770
all the way around but if the orbit is
not quite circular so in some parts of

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.910
the orbit it's closer to the planet than
in other parts the gravitational force

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.990
is strongest
and so that pulls the interior out of

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:33.160
shape and so it keeps it warm it stops
it from cooling down and so the easiest

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.589
solution is to have the heat source
being the orbit around Saturn

00:09:38.589 --> 00:09:45.600
That's the easiest way. There are lots of other ways as well but

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:55.920
You mentioned how fantastic it was to work with such an international team, could you tell us

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.400
more about the design process how did
you coordinate the design of the

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.480
spacecraft in the very beginning?

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.620
I wasn't involved right in the beginning

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:13.580
I became involved after the instrument was
designed and it had just been delivered

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.120
but the way it's working on the Jupiter
mission where I am involved in the

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:23.860
design and it will be very similar is
that you write a proposal to build an

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.660
engine well first of all a space agency
decides to select a mission to go

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.400
somewhere and they then put out a call
for instrument ideas and you write a

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.060
proposal and you describe the instrument
that you would build and the signs that

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:42.070
you would do and you try and get the
best team around you so they've got no

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:47.500
choice but to choose you and you then
submit the proposal and you go through a

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.839
selection process and a selection team
will choose the different

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:55.420
instruments
and then you get together and you talk

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.959
to the space agencies and you say this
is what I want to do and they say okay

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:03.190
we've got 12 instruments where are we
going to put them we can't get

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.160
instruments getting in each other's way

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.520
How heavy can they be? How much data

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.660
do they need? And that's the processor
we're in at the moment for the Jupiter mission

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.560
And for me it's really
interesting because it's completely

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.320
different to planning the science which
we will do once the instrument's been built

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.580
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.680
What we did is we knew on
Cassini that the 11 meter boom that we

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:36.380
had was perfect because we didn't see
changes taking place on the spacecraft I

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:41.560
hope no one from the European Space
Agency's here but when we first started

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.940
designing the Jupiter instrument we said
to the to the space agency that we

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:51.550
really wanted a long boom and they said
no you only need a 5 metre boom and so

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:56.019
what we did is we said to them that the
size of the field due to the spacecraft

00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:59.410
that we can allow they can we can be
allowed to see at the end of the boom

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:04.449
was so small that the only way they
could do that was give us a 10 point 6

00:12:04.449 --> 00:12:10.180
meter boom but don't tell them I said
that

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:18.440
Clearly Enceladus is losing a reasonable amount of mass so the whole phenomenon must be transient

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:27.300
Do you have any idea about what sort of magnitude of time it could last for?

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:32.440
No, we're almost certain it was
taking place in the early

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:39.760
Oh I should know this - in maybe the mid-1800s
because they were observations made from

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.640
the earth of something strange when you
looked at Saturn and they didn't know

00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:47.620
what it wasn't it took a very long time
to work out that there was an E ring in

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:53.800
the first place so it's been happening
for a long time not not long in that in

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:59.920
the lifetime of the solar system but
yeah it can't go on forever but I'm not

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.580
going to put an answer to that I'm not
going to give you a number from that I

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.620
because I don't know it

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.340
Okay one last question over there

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:16.140
You mentioned that the initial plan once you arrived at Saturn was to hang around for four years

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.720
but clearly you managed a lot longer

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.420
so it would seem that somebody put more
fuel in this spaceship than was initially required

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.940
- You always do -

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.320
So to what extend do you build
flexibility into the design in the

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:35.760
mission and how politically difficult is it to get an in flight change?

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:43.660
You always put lots of flexibility
in, you always over design because it's

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:50.079
not as if if something goes wrong you
can't go and tweak something so you need

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:53.500
really robust instruments for example
and one of the things that surprises

00:13:53.500 --> 00:14:00.339
people is that the type of instruments
we fly the they almost look quite old

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:03.699
compared to some of the new gadgets that
we have but the reason that you do that

00:14:03.699 --> 00:14:07.420
is to be able to fly an instrument on a
spacecraft mission you need to show

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.560
there at a technology readiness level of
nine, so they need to have flown before

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:17.829
so you can't fly a mobile phone to take
pictures because it hasn't shown that it

00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:21.500
can work before. So you always over
design you always have always have redundancy

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.680
For us we had two instruments
and on each of those instruments you had

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.140
extra power supplies and extra bits so
that if something went wrong you could

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:37.660
move to another bit but there's always
extra fuel but you also learn how to use

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:43.050
that fuel as well you get to know how
the instruments on the spacecraft work

00:14:43.529 --> 00:14:48.370
But it went on a lot longer than than
anyone thought certainly and then the

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:55.990
political question I've forgotten what
it was? Oh you've got to persuade the

00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:01.000
funding agencies to fund you because you
know to be able to operate the

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.980
spacecraft and the instruments and do
something useful with the data you need

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:11.500
to pay people to do that and so the way
that we did it on Cassini is a year

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.600
and a half before the nominal end of
mission we put a proposal into NASA

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.980
to say we wanted more funding and so you
need to almost make a new science case every time

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.600
Okay so with that I think I
will draw things to a conclusion and

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.020
just remains for me to thank Michelle
for sending is a super postcard from

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:38.350
Saturn so thank you so much
