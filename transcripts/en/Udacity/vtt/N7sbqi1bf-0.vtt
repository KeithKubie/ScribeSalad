00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer here is that this one makes sense, at least in principle,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
this one here, this one here, this one here, and this one here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The reason why the other three don't make sense is that you have uncovered edges.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So here you have an uncovered edge which is not good,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
here you have an uncovered edge which is not good,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and here you have even two uncovered edges.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So there are only five cases that, in principle, seem to make sense.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So this would suggest that, in a search tree,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we would have five possible assignments,

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but, actually, we can even do a little bit better.
