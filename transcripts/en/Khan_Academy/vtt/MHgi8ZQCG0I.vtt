00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:03.984
- [Voiceover] Fabiano wants
to score at least 6.5 points

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:06.887
in a major chess tournament.

00:00:06.887 --> 00:00:10.440
He scores one point for
each game that he wins,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.440
and he scores 0.5 points for
each game that ends in a draw.

00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:18.345
Write an inequality that
represents the number of games

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:23.338
Fabiano should win and draw,
D, to achieve his goal.

00:00:23.338 --> 00:00:25.219
So I encourage you to
pause the video and see if

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:25.904
you can do that.

00:00:25.904 --> 00:00:27.899
Write an inequality in
terms of the number of

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.986
games won, so capital "W",
and the number of draws,

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:35.527
capital "D", that represents
what he needs to do to actually

00:00:35.527 --> 00:00:37.977
achieve his goal.

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:39.276
All right, let's work through it together.

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:41.959
So how many points he is
going to get from winning?

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:44.240
So if he wins "W",

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.700
he's gonna win W games,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.935
and he gets one point for
each of them, so it's gonna be

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:52.036
one point per game, times
the number of games.

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:54.497
So one W I could just write as W.

00:00:54.497 --> 00:00:57.034
So this is the points from winning.

00:01:02.182 --> 00:01:03.436
From wins, I could say.

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:06.175
And what are his points
gonna be from the draws?

00:01:06.175 --> 00:01:09.577
Well, from the draws, he's gonna have

00:01:09.577 --> 00:01:14.577
D draws, and he gets 0.5
points for each of them.

00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:17.849
zero point five times D, this
is going to be the points

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:19.621
from the draws.

00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:29.582
Now, this right over here
is going to be his total

00:01:29.582 --> 00:01:31.996
points, points from
wins, points from draws.

00:01:31.996 --> 00:01:34.441
I'm assuming he gets no points for losses.

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:36.264
And we want this number, the total number

00:01:36.264 --> 00:01:40.536
of points, his score, to be at least 6.5.

00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:44.780
So we want this to be
greater than or equal to 6.5.

00:01:49.058 --> 00:01:52.587
If it says Fabiano wants
to score more than 6.5,

00:01:52.587 --> 00:01:53.817
then it would have been greater than.

00:01:53.817 --> 00:01:57.997
But it says Fabiano wants
to score at least 6.5,

00:01:57.997 --> 00:02:00.458
so that's greater than or equal to 6.5.

00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:02.663
He's ok if he scores 6.5.

00:02:02.663 --> 00:02:05.264
And there you have it,
we have our inequality

00:02:05.264 --> 00:02:08.898
in terms of the number of games he needs

00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:12.984
to win and draw and
this inequality needs to

00:02:12.984 --> 00:02:16.757
be true in order for him to score at least

00:02:16.757 --> 00:02:19.990
six and a half points in
this major chess tournament.
