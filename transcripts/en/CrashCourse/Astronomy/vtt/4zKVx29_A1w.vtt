00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:08.650
The sky, we now know, is full of stars AND
planets. Stars are massive enough to fuse

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.700
hydrogen into helium in their cores, generating
energy. The heat created by that process tries

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.540
to expand them, but their gravity balances
that outward force, creating an equilibrium.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.099
Planets, even gas giants like Jupiter, are
far too small to generate fusion. The stuff

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.630
inside them resists being squeezed, so their
gravity is balanced by simple gas pressure.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.570
Jupiter is only about 1% the mass needed to
have fusion going on in its core. That’s

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.910
a pretty big gap between a big planet and
a small star. It’s natural to ask what would

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.030
happen if we dumped more mass onto Jupiter.
Eventually it would become a star -- the pressure

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.150
in its core would get high enough to initiate
hydrogen fusion.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.600
But what if we stopped just short of that?
What if we have an object far more massive

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.740
than a planet, but not quite massive enough
to become a true star?

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.560
What sort of thing would we have then?

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.620
What indeed.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.300
By the late 1950s, astronomers were starting
to get a pretty good handle on how stars worked.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.400
The mathematical equations that governed the
physical processes of fusing hydrogen into

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.090
helium were being worked out, and applied
to what we knew from observing the stars themselves.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.740
In the 1960s the idea that you could have
a star with a minimum mass was becoming clear;

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.869
if it had less than about 0.075 times the
Sun’s mass, roughly 75 times the mass of

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.520
Jupiter, it simply lacked the oomph needed to squeeze
hydrogen together hard enough to generate fusion.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.320
What would such an object look like?

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.980
Well, it might form like a star, collapsing
from a gas cloud just like the Sun did 4.6

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:49.689
billion years ago, but instead of turning
on and becoming a star, it would simply sit

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.669
there, cooling. It might start off pretty
hot, due to the physical forces that made

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:58.140
it, but it couldn’t sustain that heat. Like
a charcoal ember, it would radiate its heat

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.720
away. After a few billion years it would be cold,
black, and for all intents and purposes dead.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.920
As people started working out what such an
object would be like, they tried to come up

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.450
with a name for them. These things were black,
and small, but the name “black dwarf”

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.100
was already being used for another type of
object. Some people called them sub-stellar

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.560
objects, but that wasn’t terribly catchy.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.140
Really low mass stars are red, and these new
objects would be so cool that they’d emit

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.070
light in the infrared, and almost nothing
at all in the visible. So they’re somewhere

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.250
between red and black. Jill Tarter, then a
young astronomer working in the field but

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.190
who later made a name for herself looking
for aliens — and oh boy, we’ll get to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.110
that later — dubbed them “brown dwarfs.”
She didn't mean it literally; stars can’t

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.190
be brown. But the name stuck.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.120
Work proceeded in figuring out what brown
dwarfs were like, and a lot of progress was

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.640
made despite there not being any actual examples
of them found.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.240
But the hunt was on. Now as I talked about
in Episode 26, astronomers classify stars

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.320
by their temperature. The hottest are O stars,
then B stars which are slightly cooler, down

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.990
through A, F, G, K, and with the coolest stars
being M.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.720
But then, in 1988 astronomers found a star
that was so cool it was distinct from even

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.110
the M class stars. It was the first of a new,
cooler class of stars, so it was given the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.220
letter L. Why L? Because there wasn’t any other
astronomical object that used that letter, so why not?

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.700
Many more such L stars were found, but still
these weren’t true brown dwarfs; these stars

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.310
were massive enough to initiate fusion in
their cores.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.760
Worse yet, when brown dwarfs are first born
they’re very hot. They can mimic higher-mass

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.340
L stars for a while, looking just like them,
making it hard to distinguish between the two.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.920
But then a way out was found. A low-mass brown
dwarf, it was determined, would have lithium

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.850
in it, whereas normal stars wouldn’t. Lithium
is an element, the next one in the Periodic

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.520
Table after hydrogen and helium. It can be
fused much like hydrogen can, and regular

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.430
stars would quickly use up their supply of
lithium when they were still young. Brown

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.870
dwarfs lighter than about 65 times the mass
of Jupiter wouldn’t fuse lithium at all.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.340
Very careful observations of an object would
be able to detect lithium if it were there.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.020
That would provide a test to distinguish brown
dwarfs from regular stars!

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.380
The lithium test isn’t perfect, but it does
work under a lot of circumstances. Astronomers

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.840
began using it to look for actual, real brown
dwarfs.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.300
And so they found one.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.190
In 1995, a group of astronomers was observing
the Pleiades, a nearby cluster of stars that’s

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.700
visible to the naked eye. They were trying
to find the faintest stars they could in the

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.750
cluster to get a complete sample of its membership.
The advantage of this is that the distance

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.180
to the cluster was pretty well known, so a
faint star in it must be very low mass.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.660
They found an oddball object, which they named
Teide 1. It was very red and cool, and best

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.300
of all, lithium was found in its spectrum.
The best models of stellar mass showed that

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.140
it had about 50 times the mass of Jupiter, or 0.05
times the mass of the Sun. It was clearly sub-stellar.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.840
Huzzah! The very first true brown dwarf had
been found.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.160
At just about the same time, astronomers found
that another nearby star, called Gliese 229,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.040
had an extremely faint companion. Spectra
showed that it was even weirder than Teide 1. It

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.690
also had lithium, and so was clearly a brown
dwarf. But its spectrum showed it had METHANE

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.150
in its atmosphere. Methane is a delicate molecule,
and would break down even in the mild heat

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.600
of Teide 1’s atmosphere. This new object,
called Gliese 229b, was even cooler than Teide 1.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.160
It was looking like we needed yet another letter to
classify stars. And so T dwarfs became a thing.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.990
On a personal note, when I worked on Hubble
Space Telescope, Gliese 229b was one of our

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.690
camera’s first targets after it was installed
on Hubble in 1997. I was lucky enough to work

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.710
on the spectrum we took of it, and it was
freaky. It emitted almost no light in the

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.070
visible part of the spectrum, and rocketed
up in the infrared. I had seen a lot of stellar

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.870
spectra before, but nothing like this. Remember,
Gliese 229b had only been discovered two years

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.440
before! I became so intrigued by it I wound
up studying low mass stars and brown dwarfs

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.889
for several years after.

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.010
Well, it didn’t take long before more brown
dwarfs were found.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:02.139
In 2009, NASA launched the Wide-field Infrared
Survey Explorer, or WISE, an orbiting observatory

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.699
designed to scan the entire sky looking at
infrared light. It found hundreds of brown

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:12.729
dwarfs, and now at least 2000 are known, with
more found all the time. Some are so cool

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.449
that they form yet another classification:
Y Dwarfs.

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:23.560
So now we have O B A F G K M L T and Y. You’re
on your own for an acronym here.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.320
So if brown dwarfs aren’t brown, what color
are they?

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.229
Some are so cool they don’t emit visible
light at all, so they’d be black. You could

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.639
be right over one and you wouldn’t see it.

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:38.459
But some are still warm, and so give off some visible
light, feeble as it might be. What color would they look?

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.700
Funny thing. They might be magenta.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.780
You’d think they’d be really red, because
of their temperature. But it’s a bit more

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.699
complicated than that. Remember, they have
molecules in their atmospheres that absorb

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:53.419
specific colors of light. In some brown dwarfs,
there are molecules like methane and even

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.440
water—well, steam at those temperatures—that
are pretty picky about what colors they absorb.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.120
Some of these molecules block more red light
than blue, so that messes with their colors,

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.780
making them look magenta.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.050
WISE takes pictures in the infrared, which
our eyes can’t see. To make pictures, astronomers

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.620
map each infrared color to one our eyes can
see. So an image using the shortest wavelength

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.199
infrared detector is displayed as blue, the
medium wavelength one green, and the longest

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:23.009
one red. Brown dwarfs put out a lot of light
in the intermediate wavelength WISE sees,

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:27.850
so weirdly, they appear green in WISE pictures.
That does make them easy to spot in those

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.680
images, even when thousands of other stars
are visible, too.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.690
The physical nature of brown dwarfs is just
as weird as you’d expect. For one thing,

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.660
they have a very unusual characteristic: As
they get more massive, they don’t get any bigger.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.419
Usually, if you dump mass onto an object it
gets bigger; take two lumps of clay and smush

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:49.739
‘em together and you get one more massive,
slightly larger lump. Same with planets and stars.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.360
But brown dwarfs are different. At their cores
the density is very high, and the physics

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.479
is a bit different than what you’d expect.
The details are complex but the end result

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:03.240
is that when you add more mass to them they
actually get DENSER, not bigger. This effect

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.470
becomes important right around the mass of
Jupiter, which means that a brown dwarf twice

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.620
as massive as our biggest planet won’t actually
be a whole lot bigger.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.550
So what’s the difference between a small
brown dwarf and a really big planet? Well,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.440
not much. Nature isn’t as picky as we are
about having narrowly-defined borders between

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.080
classes of objects. Some people say a planet
forms from a disk of material around a star,

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.380
growing larger as it accretes stuff, while
a brown dwarf collapses directly from a cloud

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:35.019
of gas and dust. But then you could have two
objects the same mass, and which look exactly

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:40.219
the same, yet one would be a planet and one
a brown dwarf, depending on how they formed.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.820
That strikes me as… inconvenient.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.140
Astronomers are still debating this. And it
gets worse.

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:51.480
For example, as I said before, brown dwarfs
over 65 times Jupiter’s mass fuse lithium.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.840
It turns out that ones more massive than about
13 times Jupiter can also fuse deuterium,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.240
an atom that’s very similar to hydrogen,
except it has a proton and a neutron in its

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.040
nucleus. But neither of these fuses actual
hydrogen, so they’re not considered true

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.180
stars. That’s still a little arbitrary, so again
I don’t make too much of a fuss about it.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.860
I think it’s best not to think of them as
planets or stars, but something with characteristics

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.649
of both. For example, the way their atmospheres
behave depends a lot on how hot they are.

00:09:19.649 --> 00:09:24.990
In some, iron is vaporized, a gas. In others,
they’re just cool enough that iron condenses

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:29.310
out of the atmosphere… which means it literally
rains molten iron!

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.540
One more thing. The nearest star to the Sun
is a red dwarf called Proxima Centauri, which

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:39.040
orbits the binary star Alpha Centauri. It’s
about 4.2 light years away. In 2013, astronomers

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.980
announced the discovery of a binary pair of
brown dwarfs, called Luhman 16. They’re

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.980
only 6.5 light years away, and became the
3rd closest known star system to Earth.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:54.759
You gotta wonder: Could there be an even fainter,
cooler brown dwarf closer to us? We know there’s

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:58.389
none in our solar system, even out in the
Oort cloud; it would’ve been seen by now

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:04.179
by one of several different sky surveys. But
a light year or two out? Maybe. Is Proxima

00:10:04.179 --> 00:10:09.679
Centauri REALLY the closest star, or will
we find one even closer? It seems unlikely,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.880
but no more unlikely than the existence of
brown dwarfs themselves. Maybe sometime soon

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.280
we’ll have to rewrite astronomy textbooks.
Again.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.520
Today you learned that brown dwarfs are objects
intermediate in mass between giant planets

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:26.970
and small stars. They were only recently discovered, but
thousands are now known. More massive ones can

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:33.779
fuse deuterium, and even lithium, but not hydrogen,
distinguishing them from “normal” stars. Sort of.
