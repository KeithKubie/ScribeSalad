00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.740
So far, whenever we make a search, we'll
retrieve all the objects of that type.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.610
For example, when we search for
notebooks we'll want all of them.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.560
However, if we want to display
the notes within a notebook,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.520
we must filter out all the notes
that belong to other notebooks.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.640
How can we do this filter trick?

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.190
With one of the crown jewels of cocoa,
NSPredicate.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.450
NSPredicate is a class from back in
the old Objective-C days when blocks,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.785
which are Objective-C's version
of closures, were not available.

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:35.790
NSPredicate's still have their place,
notably in core data.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.260
Predicates allows us to define filters
to select specific elements of an array

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.450
using a very simple language
called predicate language.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.320
Let's see an example.
