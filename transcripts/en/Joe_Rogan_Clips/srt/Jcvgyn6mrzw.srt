1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,290
I feel like we're at this cusp of
something very strange happening.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,060
Like we're in the middle of it right now,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,950
but we're at the cusp of something very
strange where all would take is one

4
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:12,300
massive world event,

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,750
one Matt to to completely remap how we
view each other and how we view things.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,430
It's very disconcerting to me.

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,610
This feels like without
that one big world event,

8
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:25,470
we're not that far away
from them right now.

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,430
There are parallel universes right now
the exist on things that you were thought

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,300
everyone can accept as a basic
facts. Like what you know, um,

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,910
uh, I mean Syria. Yeah, the
white helmets that there,

12
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:41,490
there are some fairly serious people
saying the white helmets are, you know,

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,490
some kind of media front
for alk hydro on those.

14
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:47,550
Would you explain the White Helmets
for people? So when there's a,

15
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:49,260
when there's a bombing
and a building collapses,

16
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:52,650
they go in and drag people out and
get them medical attention as quick as

17
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:53,484
possible.

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,530
And people think that there somehow or
another involved in it through our front,

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,110
yeah. To to, and the,

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,470
the footage is faked in order to drum
up sympathy for the rebel held areas.

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,690
I mean, that's, I've, I've
heard, you know, serious people
say that. Serious people.

22
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:14,400
Yeah. Not, not, not loons on
Facebook. I've heard, you know,
journalists. Yeah, yeah. Um,

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,850
yeah. I mean, I mean, Seymour
Hersh I think has walked
it back a little bit since,

24
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:20,310
but he said that in the early days.
Why do you think he believed it?

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,240
I read a really interesting article about
him just a few days ago. Where was it?

26
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,280
Um, I forget what it
was. It was, you know,

27
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,170
the expose any but a really good
look at, look at, look at him.

28
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:35,160
And I think he's just spent his career
believing rightly that the government

29
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,450
lies about all kinds of things.

30
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,600
And that's got me to a
point where he thinks will,

31
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:42,270
they always lie no matter what. Um, so,

32
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,520
and it's happened to a lot of journalists
that Robert Fisk, a Cmo Hush, um,

33
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,340
Martha Gellhorn during one of my
favorite war correspondents of all time.

34
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,110
I reread some of her stuff recently and
the first batch of war reporting she did,

35
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:59,970
I think is the best war reporting I've
ever read. Spanish civil war Vietnam.

36
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,050
Um, and then she spent 25 years writing
novels and then later on wrote about,

37
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,370
I believe it as the Yom Kippur war and
was denying that massacres that happened

38
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:10,500
and saying, you know,
Arabs lie, they always lie.

39
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,990
There was no massacre and we now know
there was a massacre or there were

40
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:18,330
massacres, um, in the aftermath
of these, of these wars. Um,

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,030
so I don't know what happened to me.
Maybe if you just do this for too long,

42
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:25,860
you just become so cynical that, that
you're open to these things, but it's,

43
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,800
yeah, I'm amazed at Seymour
Hersh is, is open to that idea

44
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,910
when the very people that are calling it,

45
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:36,590
the very people that have boots on the
ground that are in these war zones are

46
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,310
and calling these things, when they
become cynical and they become jaded,

47
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,470
that's when it gets really,
really sketchy.

48
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,940
And we rely so heavily on people like you.

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,290
Like there's, I'm not going
over there. You know what,

50
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,810
Jeremy's not going over there. We're
gonna. You know what I'm saying?

51
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:59,200
I mean in in and you wouldn't be able to
really get like I know people that gone

52
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:00,700
to Venezuela and they
come back and they go,

53
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:03,070
I don't know what the fuck is going on
over there. I don't know who to believe.

54
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,963
I don't understand it.

55
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,290
Venezuela is a very strange one and I
get messages all the time and you know

56
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,620
I've had Abby Martin who goes over there
and she has one take on it and I have

57
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,560
other people that I've talked to that
have a different take on it and I do not

58
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,250
know.

59
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,360
I don't know who to believe and I think
you'd have to go over there and do you

60
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,360
have to spend a lot of time to try to
figure this out and it would have to be

61
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:25,480
the entire focus of your life
to really try to Parse it out.

62
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,190
I think that's true of a lot of
conflicts. I mean, one of the, one of the,

63
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,670
one of the drawbacks of doing what I do
is I'm covering seven or eight things at

64
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,280
once.
So I feel like I'm not expert enough.

65
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,800
And even Afghanistan where I've covered,
I've covered that more than any other.

66
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,330
And, but the Venezuela is an
interesting one cause it's, there's,

67
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,410
there's such a left right divide on that.
And if you support the opposition,

68
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,380
then you find yourself alongside
John Bolton and Donald Trump,

69
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,610
which means that a lot of people are
gonna automatically attack you right

70
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,950
automatically. Even if it's
correct. And I think it's, you know,

71
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,590
we can say without a doubt the Maduro
has destroyed the economy there.

72
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,890
Maduro has imprisoned, beaten,
killed journalists. Um,

73
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,750
there is a movement there that
do want genuine elections. Um,

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,610
but some people will say,
well,

75
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:12,750
just because George Bush and another area
or John Beltland this era support the

76
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:13,560
opposition,

77
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,710
therefore the opposition
must be illegitimate and
the information coming out

78
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:18,090
must be,
must be false.

79
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,350
And I wish people did rely on,
on people who actually went there,

80
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:27,140
but it doesn't feel like that. It
feels like they rely on the, you know,

81
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,610
the guy behind the glass desk on the,

82
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,670
on the news when they were allowed
opinion rather where people are actually

83
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,280
there. While we still have
this idea, DNR had that. The,

84
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:38,790
the person who's reading the news is
the authority and the Don Lemon has the

85
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,690
inside scoop or whoever it is.
You know,

86
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,560
and I think it used to be that those
guys would spend 20 or 30 years traveling

87
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,740
and then that get the cushy job
behind the glass desk in the studio.

88
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,460
Now it seems like you can go straight
to the cushy job behind the glass desk.

89
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,120
Well,
did we just need someone who's relatable,

90
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,490
who can read a teleprompter,
you know,

91
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:02,420
who fits the profile that they're looking
for, whether it's Fox News or CNN,

92
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,940
you know, I know say the
information is there. You know,

93
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:07,130
there are fantastic documentaries,

94
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,720
articles being written about
all of these conflicts, right?

95
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,633
People aren't reading them

96
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,160
well with something like Venezuela that
the real problem is you have two sides.

97
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,570
You have two different versions of
what's happening, and it's, if you're,

98
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:26,650
if you're not educated in that country
and you don't understand their politics,

99
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,370
it's very difficult to figure out
who's telling the truth. Truth. Yep.

100
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,490
Same with Syria. Yeah. Yeah.
