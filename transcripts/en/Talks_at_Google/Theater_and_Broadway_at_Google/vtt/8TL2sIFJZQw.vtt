00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.975
Thank you for those
incredible performances

00:07:16.975 --> 00:07:18.350
and for being with
us here today.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.475
We're so, so excited to

NICK CARTELL: We're
excited to be here.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.151
So thank you so
much for having us.

00:07:24.151 --> 00:07:25.650
SPEAKER 1: So to
get things started,

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.930
I thought we could just do
a few rapid fire questions

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.930
if you can just answer
with the first thing that

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.840
comes to your mind.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.510
So, Kate, if you want to
go first and then Nick.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.810
NICK CARTELL: Great.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.750
MARY KATE MOORE: OK.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.333
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:07:34.333 --> 00:07:36.277
First one, favorite
song in "Les Mis."

00:07:36.277 --> 00:07:37.610
MARY KATE MOORE: "One Day More."

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.901
NICK CARTELL: "Bring Him Home."

SPEAKER 1: Favorite
song you don't sing.

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:44.270
NICK CARTELL: Oh.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.905
MARY KATE MOORE: Uh-oh.

00:07:45.905 --> 00:07:47.590
He doesn't like any
of the other ones.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.540
NICK CARTELL: "The People's
Song," "The People's Song."

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:49.915
SPEAKER 1: OK, perfect.

00:07:49.915 --> 00:07:51.084
MARY KATE MOORE: OK.

00:07:51.084 --> 00:07:52.000
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.160
Last thing you googled?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.010
MARY KATE MOORE: The
full moon lunar eclipse

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.137
that's happening today.

00:07:58.137 --> 00:07:58.720
SPEAKER 1: Oh.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.879
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:01.920
NICK CARTELL: How to
properly tie a Windsor knot.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.359
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:03.359 --> 00:08:04.650
MARY KATE MOORE: It looks good.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.340
NICK CARTELL: I
think I did it right.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:05.600
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.380
MARY KATE MOORE:
Yeah, you did it.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:06.520
SPEAKER 1: Looks great.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.990
MARY KATE MOORE:
You totally did it.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.781
SPEAKER 1: Favorite
city you have performed

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:11.720
in not including Denver?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.790
MARY KATE MOORE: Seattle.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.762
NICK CARTELL: Nashville.

00:08:14.762 --> 00:08:15.345
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:08:15.345 --> 00:08:17.620
And last one-- dream
role in any musical?

00:08:20.514 --> 00:08:22.180
MARY KATE MOORE: I'm
going to say Mother

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.216
in "Ragtime" in 20 years.

00:08:25.216 --> 00:08:27.382
NICK CARTELL: Phantom in
"The Phantom of the Opera."

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:28.346
SPEAKER 1: Oh.

00:08:28.346 --> 00:08:29.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.810
MARY KATE MOORE:
They know that one.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.684
NICK CARTELL: Why, thank you.

00:08:32.684 --> 00:08:33.650
SPEAKER 1: Perfect.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:34.149
OK.

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:36.610
So now we'll get into some
more in-depth questions.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.770
So if you can both tell
us a little bit more

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.510
about how you got
involved with "Les Mis"

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.100
and what the audition
process was like?

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.380
MARY KATE MOORE: Sure.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.050
Well, I first auditioned
for this show in, I think,

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.790
April of 2016 and did
not originally get cast

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.042
and waited for maybe
three or four months.

00:08:55.042 --> 00:08:56.500
And it was kind of
down to the wire

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.708
for the casting team I think.

00:08:57.708 --> 00:09:00.020
They were about to start
rehearsals in a couple weeks.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.920
So I went back in
for another audition

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.980
that I didn't realize was
kind of a final callback.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.115
And I started my
journey with "Les Mis"

00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:11.680
as a member of the female
ensemble understudying Fantine.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.560
And in March of this year,
I bumped up and started

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.379
playing the role full-time.

00:09:16.379 --> 00:09:17.170
SPEAKER 1: Amazing.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.086
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:09:18.086 --> 00:09:20.210
NICK CARTELL: And I started--

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.080
my initial audition
was in April.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.450
And I actually, I think,
was one of the last people

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.680
that was cast and over the
course of five callbacks,

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.045
and then finally
booked the role.

00:09:32.045 --> 00:09:33.170
MARY KATE MOORE: Booked it.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.955
NICK CARTELL: So here we are.

00:09:33.955 --> 00:09:34.390
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.410
Well, congrats to you both.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:35.720
NICK CARTELL: Yeah, thanks.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.490
SPEAKER 1: I saw
it on Wednesday.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.823
You're both amazing in the show.

00:09:37.823 --> 00:09:39.160
MARY KATE MOORE: Thank you.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.780
SPEAKER 1: Nick, can you tell
us a little bit more what

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.470
it's like to play such an
iconic role of Jean Valjean?

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.030
And are there any
actors who have

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.490
played the role in the past
that inspired your performance?

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.450
NICK CARTELL: Sure.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.530
It's very easy.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:51.110
No.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.495
It is very demanding.

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:58.780
But it also-- because there's
a lot of responsibility

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.570
that comes with
playing this character.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.880
So many people have--

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.984
you know, amazing men
who have come before me

00:10:03.984 --> 00:10:05.150
that have played this role--

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.620
Colm Wilkinson, you know,
Hugh Jackman in the movie.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.410
You've got, you know, all
of these amazing artists.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.720
And you also have
a responsibility

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.690
to the fans of "Les Miserables"
that have seen the show that

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:17.920
know what this character is.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.674
And so it also is fun to
kind of make it your own.

00:10:20.674 --> 00:10:21.340
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.298
NICK CARTELL: And you
have to make it your own.

00:10:23.298 --> 00:10:26.486
And I feel like I have
made it my own, you know?

00:10:26.486 --> 00:10:28.000
But I would say
some of the people

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.130
that I look up to,
obviously, is Colm.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.839
I mean, he started
the whole thing.

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:34.130
You have to look up to the
man who originated the role.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.360
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.150
NICK CARTELL: But then, also, I
did a regional production of it

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.370
about nine years ago.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.770
And so the two gentlemen that
played Valjean when I actually

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.944
played Marius really
I looked up to,

00:10:43.944 --> 00:10:45.610
because I saw how
they made it their own

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.110
and how they sing differently
and stuff like that.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.514
So it was a good
prep, yeah, for this.

00:10:51.514 --> 00:10:52.180
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.310
That's great.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.590
Kate, Fantine
makes a huge impact

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.257
in the beginning of the show.

00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:00.840
How do you prepare each night
to start off the show so strong?

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.710
Do you have any special
rituals or things

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.035
you do before each night?

00:11:04.035 --> 00:11:05.410
MARY KATE MOORE:
I think its kind

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.900
of absorbing the energy
of the rest of the cast.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.820
Because it is true that I am
introduced and then, like,

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.180
about 30 minutes later, I'm
dying in a hospital bed.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:15.450
So--

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:15.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:16.810
--that's over very quickly.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.614
NICK CARTELL: Spoiler alert.

00:11:17.614 --> 00:11:18.016
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:11:18.016 --> 00:11:20.099
MARY KATE MOORE: Oh, sorry
if you haven't seen it.

00:11:20.099 --> 00:11:21.310
Spoiler alert, I die.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.559
But I wouldn't say that
I'm the only person making

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:30.100
a high impact at
the top of the show.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.170
There's really no such
thing as easing gently

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.654
into a performance of "Les Mis."

00:11:33.654 --> 00:11:34.570
SPEAKER 1: Yes, right.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.830
MARY KATE MOORE: So I think
it's just meeting my fellow cast

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.150
mates where they are
when they start the show.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.030
Because we all kind of
have to give 100%, so.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.262
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, cool.

00:11:45.262 --> 00:11:46.720
And this is can be
for both of you,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.010
if you both want
to answer just one.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.340
So the show has so,
so much history.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.410
It not only takes place
in 19th century France,

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.570
but it's also based on Victor
Hugo's 1,500 page novel

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.650
from 1862.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.309
And that is a lot of content.

00:12:01.309 --> 00:12:03.350
How have you gone about
preparing for your roles?

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.690
And is there any extra research
you did before you started?

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.239
NICK CARTELL: I
did read the book.

00:12:09.239 --> 00:12:10.030
SPEAKER 1: Oh, wow.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.060
NICK CARTELL: It took me
months, but I did read the book.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.000
Because, I mean, that's
a natural resource.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.550
You have the original words
that Victor Hugo wrote

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.040
that are right there that can
tell you everything you need

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.476
to know about the characters.

00:12:22.476 --> 00:12:24.100
And, you know, yes,
you can take stuff.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:29.020
But there's one line in the
book that Javert actually

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.130
says to Valjean.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.460
The way that he recognized
Jean Valjean at one point

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.440
is because he walks with a limp.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.650
And it was literally just
one line that is written.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.290
And so I adapted that
into my character.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.320
So as I age through
the show, when

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.590
we get into it, when
I'm in older age,

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.330
I start walking with a limp.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.950
And it was literally
stuff like that

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.575
that I was able to
take out of the book

00:12:52.575 --> 00:12:54.050
and put into my character.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.980
And also, just to see
the way that, you know,

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.020
Valjean is so broken
at the beginning

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.210
and how everybody
treats him really

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.120
helps to inform my character
and journey every night.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.190
So, for me, that was
truly what I did.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.440
MARY KATE MOORE: What he said.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.910
I don't have a limp, though.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.170
SPEAKER 1: Did you
also read the book?

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.770
MARY KATE MOORE: Yes, I did.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:13.065
SPEAKER 1: Oh, wow.

00:13:13.065 --> 00:13:13.730
That's amazing.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.896
MARY KATE MOORE: I was first
introduced to it when I

00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:17.630
was a sophomore in high school.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.970
And I didn't know the
musical at that point.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.960
And we watched the very famous
10th anniversary production

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.860
concert version of it in
bits and pieces in class.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.119
So, yeah, that was when
the love affair started.

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:31.910
NICK CARTELL: And when
we started rehearsal

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.210
the first day, we all walked
in with the novel sitting

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.835
at our binders.

00:13:35.835 --> 00:13:36.626
SPEAKER 1: Oh, wow.

00:13:36.626 --> 00:13:38.300
NICK CARTELL: So they
gave us the novel.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.860
And they were like, get ready.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.540
Here you go.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.230
SPEAKER 1: Some light reading.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.146
NICK CARTELL: Welcome.

00:13:43.146 --> 00:13:44.192
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:13:44.192 --> 00:13:45.650
SPEAKER 1: So then
do either of you

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.379
remember the first
time you saw the show?

00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:49.420
NICK CARTELL: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.930
MARY KATE MOORE: I saw it--

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.990
I think it was 2014 in London.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.050
I saw it on the West End.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:55.980
SPEAKER 1: Oh, wow.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.920
MARY KATE MOORE: That's the only
other professional production

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.360
that I've seen or been involved
with at all before this one,

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:00.840
so.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.320
SPEAKER 1: Oh, wow.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.236
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:14:02.236 --> 00:14:07.580
NICK CARTELL: And I saw it
in the tour version in 1996--

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.760
5-- when it played my
hometown in Tempe, Arizona.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.750
So that was really, really
great that I got to see it there

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.917
and sat in the top balcony
and was just amazed.

00:14:17.917 --> 00:14:18.500
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.540
So "Les Mis" first
premiered in Paris

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.820
in 1980 almost 40 years ago.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.370
And it's still a
worldwide success.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.420
Why do you think the show has
really stood the test of time?

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.270
MARY KATE MOORE: I think
that, even though it

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.830
takes such a long
time ago, there

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.680
are a lot of very important
and pertinent issues

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.020
that the show deals
with that's happening

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.760
for us societally right now.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.330
There's a lot of members
of the cast a lot

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.830
of characters that are
ostracize persons and oppressed.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.070
And there's a lot of that
going on in the world

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.340
that we experience every day.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.030
So I think audience
members either find

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.230
it really relatable, or they
experience a really important

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.090
lesson over and
over and over again

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.150
of looking out for people who
are more vulnerable than you.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.950
And so it's important
for both of us,

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.570
I think, to be able to tell
the stories of these characters

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.130
that do experience
that oppression,

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.319
because it is so important now.

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:17.360
I don't know if you have
anything to add to that.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.020
NICK CARTELL: Yeah,
no, I would say that,

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.600
and then the music is
what brings people back.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.700
I mean, these are
songs that you know.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.170
They've been on the radio.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.980
I mean, it's pop
culture at this point.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.250
So I think that people
come back to see the show,

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.910
because they have
love for the show

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.287
along with connecting with
these characters that are just

00:15:33.287 --> 00:15:35.120
a fight for the human
spirit, trying to make

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.164
the world a better place.

00:15:36.164 --> 00:15:37.580
SPEAKER 1: So when
did both of you

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.350
get first involved with theater?

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.040
And was there anyone that
inspired you to start acting?

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.070
MARY KATE MOORE: You.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.153
You took the breath first.

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.450
NICK CARTELL: I first
got involved with theater

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:52.370
when I was in fifth grade.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.980
I had always grown up
singing in choirs and things

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.420
like that-- seventh
grade, sorry.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.240
And I ended up
doing a production

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.340
of an opera called "Amahl
and the Night Visitors"

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.300
around Christmas.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.160
And that was kind
of what sparked it.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.040
And then I went and saw a
field trip of a production

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:07.760
of "Cinderella."

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.270
And I was like, that's
what I want to do.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.170
They're doing what I love.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.430
And then it just kind
of took off from there.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.060
And ever since then, that's
what I've been doing.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.680
MARY KATE MOORE: I
was a late bloomer.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.271
I didn't really do musical
theater until high school,

00:16:21.271 --> 00:16:21.770
actually.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:23.630
My first show was
when I was a freshman.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.875
I did "Hello, Dolly!"

00:16:24.875 --> 00:16:25.910
I was in the ensemble.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.350
I had a lot of straw hats.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.342
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:29.342 --> 00:16:30.050
But it was great.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.330
Yeah.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.080
And I remember, like,
waiting in the wings

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.910
before the show started one
night with our, like, now I

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.960
know very sub-par high school
orchestra playing the overture.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.114
And just experiencing the
feeling of anticipation

00:16:43.114 --> 00:16:44.530
before going on
stage, I was like,

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.850
oh my god, people
do this as a career.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:47.600
I want to do this.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.260
So, yeah, that's it.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.480
SPEAKER 1: Very cool.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.790
And both of you have been
in lots of other shows.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.670
What's it like to be in "Les
Mis" versus, like, past shows

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:56.960
that you've been in?

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.130
NICK CARTELL: It's huge.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.000
This show is huge.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.350
And because you are meeting
fans at the stage door

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.990
that have either seen
it before or it's

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.180
their first time
seeing it, and so

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.829
you have a
responsibility to them.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.929
But then you also have
responsibility to the work.

00:17:12.929 --> 00:17:14.720
But then you also just
get to do "Les Mis."

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.386
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:17:15.386 --> 00:17:18.544
NICK CARTELL: I mean, it's been
running for almost 40 years.

00:17:18.544 --> 00:17:19.210
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.910
NICK CARTELL: I
mean, and so to say,

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.464
I'm in "Les Miserables"
is pretty cool, you know?

00:17:24.464 --> 00:17:25.130
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.800
NICK CARTELL: We all have-- some
of us in the company have swag,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.300
you know.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.130
So we'll have a
jacket or a hat on.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.820
And we'll walk in, and they'll
be, like, are you in the show?

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.080
We're, like, yeah,
just a little bit.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.460
You know, so I mean, it's fun.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.380
MARY KATE MOORE:
Just a little bit.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:38.860
NICK CARTELL: It's
exciting for us.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.040
MARY KATE MOORE: Just
most of the show.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:40.860
NICK CARTELL: I'm
like five minutes.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.360
That's it.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.530
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.120
Switching gears a
little bit, what

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.640
is the best advice either
of you have been given?

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.240
MARY KATE MOORE: So I would say
probably just to release any

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.380
expectations you have
about where you need to be

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.370
and to just do
your job, you know,

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.320
with integrity whether that's--

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.240
for us performers,
you know, it's

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.110
sometimes difficult
to find work.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.780
And, obviously, we're
very lucky to be

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.905
involved in the production
that we're in right now.

00:18:07.905 --> 00:18:11.810
But whether the work that you're
doing is preparing for a role

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.210
or it's being perseverant
and getting yourself

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:19.010
up for auditions and, you know,
taking the time when you're not

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.680
in a show to work on yourself,
it's all about the process

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.020
and not necessarily
the destination.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.200
NICK CARTELL: I
would second that.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.010
Perfect.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.080
SPEAKER 1: Plus one.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.580
OK.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.370
What is your favorite part of
telling this profound story

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:35.600
every night?

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.940
NICK CARTELL: For
me, it's getting

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:43.460
to show the journey of Valjean,
to show how broken a man can be

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.700
at the beginning of the show.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.580
All he holds on to is his name
and a single piece of his soul

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.450
that's left.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.320
And it's not until the
Bishop forgives him

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.390
that that all breaks apart.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.760
And, completely, his entire
world is flipped upside down.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.410
Everything is decimated.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.820
And he has to rebuild
himself from the ground up.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.070
And that by the end of the show,
he's finally found forgiveness

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:10.430
not only for everybody that
he's come in contact with,

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.510
but also for himself.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.740
And I think that
telling that story,

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.804
there are people that
can connect with that

00:19:17.804 --> 00:19:19.220
and that need that
in their lives.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:25.472
And I think that that for me
is what is the joy for me.

00:19:25.472 --> 00:19:26.930
MARY KATE MOORE:
I think the reason

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.971
that I said "One Day More"
is my favorite song is

00:19:28.971 --> 00:19:32.540
because of how iconic it is.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.366
And so we do it a lot.

00:19:34.366 --> 00:19:35.240
We do the show a lot.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.770
We've done it
hundreds of times now.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:38.270
But--

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.254
NICK CARTELL: 331--

00:19:39.254 --> 00:19:40.295
SPEAKER 1: Oh, wow. -last

00:19:40.295 --> 00:19:40.520
NICK CARTELL: --last night.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:40.856
MARY KATE MOORE: Oh,
that's the count?

00:19:40.856 --> 00:19:40.970
NICK CARTELL: Yeah.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.803
MARY KATE MOORE: OK.

00:19:41.803 --> 00:19:43.919
331.

00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:44.960
NICK CARTELL: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.085
MARY KATE MOORE: So that's
a lot of "One Day More."

00:19:47.085 --> 00:19:49.370
But if you can really,
like, make yourself

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:53.030
present in that
musical moment, it's

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.490
very overwhelming
to be a part of it,

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.040
to be marching in
that V formation

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.160
and, in the periphery, to
see the red flag waving.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:05.450
And we're really lucky to be
part of a very talented group

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:05.960
of people.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.300
So there's never a
night when that moment

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.430
isn't like breathtaking
even being a part of it.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:15.040
So that's probably my favorite
theatrical moment of the show.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.790
NICK CARTELL: And I
think that that's also

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.880
so cool about this production
of "Les Mis" is that we

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.120
have such an amazing cast.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.080
It's a young cast.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.980
We have an energy that we bring
onstage every single night.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.110
But the other thing
that's so amazing

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.960
about it is that you can
look at any single person

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.825
at any point in the
show and somebody

00:20:35.825 --> 00:20:37.140
has something going on.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.270
They're invested.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.164
They are creating
their own stories.

00:20:41.164 --> 00:20:42.830
That's what I love
about this company is

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.210
that we all support each other.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:49.596
But, also, we all have
our own ideas and things

00:20:49.596 --> 00:20:50.470
happening each night.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.682
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:20:50.682 --> 00:20:53.170
Everyone's taken a lot of
responsibility for their roles.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:55.730
And I mean, it's really great
to be a principal performer,

00:20:55.730 --> 00:21:00.306
but this show, like the engine
of the show, is the ensemble.

00:21:00.306 --> 00:21:01.430
And they're always onstage.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.140
And they are always
committed, and they're really

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:03.930
fun to watch.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.880
So if you go to the
show, make a point

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.260
to check out what's happening
behind the immediate action,

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.742
because there's always a lot.

00:21:10.742 --> 00:21:12.055
NICK CARTELL: Yeah.

00:21:12.055 --> 00:21:13.430
SPEAKER 1: And
then so what would

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.620
you say is the most
challenging part of the show?

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.470
MARY KATE MOORE: I have to
experience a lot of emotion

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.360
in a very short amount of time.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.200
And it's definitely the kind of
thing that I've gotten used to.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.630
But there are some nights when
just it's not really there.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:33.350
And so I would say
that's probably

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.420
most challenging for me
is finding consistency

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:40.350
with that, because it is such a
tragic story, Fantine's story.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.500
And I am not a very tragic
person in life in general.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.140
So that is difficult,
but very fulfilling.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:49.812
Yeah.

00:21:49.812 --> 00:21:51.770
NICK CARTELL: For me,
I'd say just the stamina.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:56.970
To do a three hour musical
every single night is a lot.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:57.470
It's hard.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.259
And it's making sure
you get enough rest

00:21:59.259 --> 00:22:00.800
and making sure that
you're warmed up

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.710
and, You know, on those days
where you're not feeling great,

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.360
figuring out how to
still push through

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.610
it and give the audience 100%.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:08.110
SPEAKER 1: And you
guys are covering

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.380
a lot of cities in your tour.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.880
Do you find that
different audiences

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.507
have different responses
or anything different

00:22:13.507 --> 00:22:14.590
when you go to a new city?

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.850
NICK CARTELL: Yeah.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.130
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.170
We just spent some time
in Canada, actually.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.210
And their theater etiquette
is just different than ours.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.710
So we had a lot of quiet,
but still very appreciative

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.262
audiences, which is not
something that we're used to.

00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:28.970
You know, we feel kind
of like rock stars

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.930
at certain moments of the show,
because the audience is just,

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:31.545
like, going crazy.

00:22:31.545 --> 00:22:32.340
NICK CARTELL: Usually,
the overture starts.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:32.945
And all of a sudden--

00:22:32.945 --> 00:22:33.120
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.640
NICK CARTELL: --there's
this yell from the crowd

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.440
and everybody on stage
is like, all right let's

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:36.960
go, let's do it.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.876
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:22:37.876 --> 00:22:38.520
Yeah.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.790
So you just have to kind of
get used to different energies

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:41.581
from the audiences.

00:22:41.581 --> 00:22:43.850
But we've never been
to a city where they

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.620
haven't loved what we're doing.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.450
NICK CARTELL: And
leapt to their feet

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.240
right at the end of the show.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:47.900
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.700
[INAUDIBLE] standing up.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.610
MARY KATE MOORE: Oh, yeah.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.500
SPEAKER 1: Switching
gears a little bit more,

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.120
have you had any onstage
or backstage mishaps?

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.730
And if so, how did you adapt?

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.180
NICK CARTELL: I have.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.130
So there's a moment
on the barricade

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.870
where I have to let Javert go.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.950
But I still have to
pretend to shoot him.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.360
So I have a rifle, because we
do use live ammunition that's

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.520
blanks.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.170
And so I let him go.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.370
I hold the gun for a moment.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.770
I point it up to
the air, and I fire.

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.990
And the minute that I
pulled it up into the air,

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.730
somehow the strap
that was on the gun

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.350
got between the
firing mechanism.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.290
So when I went to
fire, nothing happened.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.880
Because it got stuck.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.969
And there's a prop-- our prop
master, Kurt, is standing off

00:23:30.969 --> 00:23:31.510
in the wings.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.790
And he has another gun ready
to go in case that happens.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.210
And I was up in this position.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:37.810
He heard it.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.460
He went to get his gun.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.590
And right at that moment,
I lowered my gun back

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.978
into the wing, and he shot.

00:23:43.978 --> 00:23:46.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:50.020
So Valjean is a horrible sight.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:55.520
Because I didn't actually
kill Javert that night.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.980
That was probably--
yeah, for me,

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.400
that was the worst stage mishap
that has happened so far.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.640
Knock on wood.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.670
MARY KATE MOORE:
Yeah, we'll see.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:08.750
Before I took over the role,
when I was still understudying,

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.140
it was the first time
that I ever went on.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.060
So I was feeling very anxious
and excited in Nashville,

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.710
actually, Nick's favorite city.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.440
And something happened.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.250
Oh, it was a Life Alert
went off in the house.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.140
I think somebody
with a Life Alert

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.090
had come to the show
the night before,

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.790
but left the alarm on accident.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.560
So they were like at
their house trying

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.870
to find their Life Alarm.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.250
And they, like, kept pressing,
like, find my Life Alert.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.980
And it was just like
going off in the audience.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:41.120
So I made the entrance
into the factory.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.940
I was so, like,
overstimulated by what

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.270
was happening to me
as my principal debut

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.760
that I didn't notice
it was happening.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.250
But everybody in the ensemble
was making real weird faces

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.330
at me, like, what is going on.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:58.820
And so at the end of the factory
scene, when Fantine gets thrown

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.190
out of the factory,
she ends up upstage

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.687
sitting on the ground ready
to go for "I Dreamed a Dream."

00:25:03.687 --> 00:25:06.020
So this entire time, I've
been, like, psyching myself up

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.400
for the big song.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.460
And I get to my spot, and
the spotlight hits me.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.300
And I hear our stage manager's
voice over the loudspeaker

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.656
to the whole
audience, like, we're

00:25:16.656 --> 00:25:18.530
going to hold the show,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.607
like, as I'm going--

00:25:19.607 --> 00:25:20.381
I--

00:25:20.381 --> 00:25:21.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:28.400
And so I had to get up and
walk off stage and stand there.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.480
It was just the weirdest
break in like momentum.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.977
So they brought
the curtains down.

00:25:33.977 --> 00:25:35.810
And I just kind of stood
there for 2 minutes

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.360
like trying to figure
out how to keep it going.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.140
I didn't you know.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.680
I mean-- so then I had what we
call my Tony performance now

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.149
where I like went back
out and sat myself down

00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:46.190
once they figured it out.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.160
And like, the curtain
rose and the song started.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.450
And then I got to do it.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:54.080
But that was probably the
biggest one and very memorable.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.450
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.036
I would say so.

00:25:57.036 --> 00:26:00.080
NICK CARTELL: There was
also one on the first--

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.700
one of our-- on like
our opening night

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.867
in Providence, Rhode Island.

00:26:02.867 --> 00:26:03.949
MARY KATE MOORE: Oh, yeah.

00:26:03.949 --> 00:26:06.050
NICK CARTELL: We got to
the very end of the show.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.990
I mean, literally,
we're in the last song.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:13.010
And we here, help,
stop, doctor, please!

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.320
Somebody had been
crying so hard,

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.400
but still decided it was a
good idea to eat peanut M&amp;Ms.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.970
And they literally put one
in their mouth were sobbing,

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.710
sucked in, and started choking.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:28.400
So we had to stop the show.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.590
We're within the moments
of end of the show.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.270
We had to stop the show.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.925
And then we all had to
file back on, but yeah.

00:26:34.925 --> 00:26:36.200
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.820
NICK CARTELL: There aren't that
many-- we have a great crew.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.861
We have a great group of
people that there aren't

00:26:39.861 --> 00:26:41.570
that many mishaps that happen.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.165
MARY KATE MOORE: No, and those
weren't our fault either.

00:26:43.165 --> 00:26:44.213
NICK CARTELL: Yeah, those
weren't our fault. Yeah.

00:26:44.213 --> 00:26:45.796
SPEAKER 1: You guys
[INAUDIBLE] great.

00:26:45.796 --> 00:26:47.071
NICK CARTELL: Yeah.

00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:49.570
SPEAKER 1: And then along those
lines, too, so for the songs

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.986
you're not in, like when you're
backstage, like how do you

00:26:51.986 --> 00:26:53.500
stay in character?

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.490
Are you just hanging out here?

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.800
MARY KATE MOORE: As
soon as I pass away,

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.350
I can kind of let go of
Fantine for a little while.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.100
She does come back at
the end of the show.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.470
So I don't really have to
worry about that so much.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:07.136
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:27:07.136 --> 00:27:08.390
I don't know about you.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.260
NICK CARTELL: Most
of the time I'm not

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.075
on stage I'm changing
costume or doing makeup--

00:27:11.075 --> 00:27:11.330
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.204
NICK CARTELL: --or doing
something like that.

00:27:13.204 --> 00:27:19.190
So there's always an element
of keeping that there.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.010
But, also, we've done
331 performances of it.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.440
So I figured out how
to get back into it,

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.260
take that moment before,
so I can walk back on stage

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.694
and sing "Bring Him Home."

00:27:28.694 --> 00:27:30.860
SPEAKER 1: So we do have
some questions on the Dory.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.720
I do want to open it
up to the audience.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.178
If anyone has an
audience question,

00:27:34.178 --> 00:27:37.320
if you want to come out to this
mic, we can form a little line.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.010
AUDIENCE: So I'm
curious what songs

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.031
you chose to sing for your
auditions for these roles

00:27:43.031 --> 00:27:45.320
and why you chose them.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.040
NICK CARTELL: Oh.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.840
MARY KATE MOORE: Wow.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.960
You know, for the
first initial audition,

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.930
I sang "Memory" from "Cats."

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:55.130
So there's that.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:58.070
And then from that
point on, they give you

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.600
material from the show to sing.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.230
NICK CARTELL: And when I
went in for my audition,

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.960
I was just given
material from the show.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.540
So I had to sing "The
Soliloquy," "Bring Him

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.357
Home," and "Who Am I?"

00:28:07.357 --> 00:28:09.440
And then I also had to
prepare "The Confrontation"

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.900
for my final callback.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.069
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned the cast

00:28:14.069 --> 00:28:15.360
doing things in the background.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.520
And we actually got
to see you last night.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.469
And it was excellent.

00:28:17.469 --> 00:28:18.385
NICK CARTELL: Amazing.

00:28:18.385 --> 00:28:20.630
AUDIENCE: And there were
a lot of really fun bits.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:24.735
What is your favorite, like,
just a little one second bit

00:28:24.735 --> 00:28:27.210
that people do in the show?

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.740
MARY KATE MOORE:
Well, I mean, I'm

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.440
kind of in a special
position with that,

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.140
because I got to be in
the ensemble for a while.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.270
And I think my favorite
scene was always

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:40.110
the Paris scene when you're
first introduced to Eponine.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.880
And you see the
Thenardier's again

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.460
after they've sung "Master
of the House" at the end.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.470
There's just so much
going on in that scene.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.350
And what's cool about it is
that every ensemble member

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.240
has kind of been given
a different costume

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.400
and a different character.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.070
And people get real
serious about it.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.040
So, like, there is true
commitment happening back there

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.540
from a lot of them.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.712
So that one's really fun.

00:29:01.712 --> 00:29:04.170
NICK CARTELL: I like coming
into the factory, because there

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.470
is that level of power that
you walk into as the mayor.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:11.340
And so to come into the factory
and, you know, say my piece,

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.950
and then as I walk up, I
always have the men's ensemble

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.010
that come rushing up to
me asking me questions.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:20.565
And yesterday, was my birthday.

00:29:20.565 --> 00:29:21.065
And so--

00:29:21.065 --> 00:29:21.370
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:22.950
Happy Belated Birthday to Nick.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:23.490
It was his birthday yesterday.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:23.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.760
NICK CARTELL: Thank you.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.500
Thank you.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.530
But I went walking up the stairs
of the factory at the matinee,

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.180
and they all came
rushing up to me.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.260
And I was like, what?

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.426
And they all started singing
"Happy Birthday" to me.

00:29:33.426 --> 00:29:33.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:35.910
And I was, like, thank you.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.320
You get back to work, you know?

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.675
So that was great.

00:29:38.675 --> 00:29:39.300
That was great.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.620
SPEAKER 1: That's awesome.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.277
Introduce yourself.

00:29:42.277 --> 00:29:43.360
AUDIENCE: My name is Josh.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.140
Thank you for coming.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:44.560
NICK CARTELL: And Josh--

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.270
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming here today.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.950
NICK CARTELL: Josh is actually--

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.097
AUDIENCE: My question was--

00:29:48.097 --> 00:29:48.602
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:48.602 --> 00:29:49.560
NICK CARTELL: Yes, sir.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.010
AUDIENCE: --specifically
for Mr. Cartell.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.718
NICK CARTELL: Oh.

00:29:51.718 --> 00:29:55.130
AUDIENCE: Because it's
such a very serious role.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:56.091
NICK CARTELL: Yes.

00:29:56.091 --> 00:29:58.090
AUDIENCE: And you have
to do it for a long time.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:01.890
Is there any time that you've
ever broken, like, on stage,

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.180
like laughed or anything?

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:03.590
NICK CARTELL: Yeah.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:04.423
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:04.423 --> 00:30:05.372
I'm going to sit down.

00:30:05.372 --> 00:30:07.080
SPEAKER 1: Should we
explain who Josh is?

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.970
NICK CARTELL: So
that's Josh Davis.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.265
Josh is our Javert in the show.

00:30:10.265 --> 00:30:10.890
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.750
NICK CARTELL: And
the answer is never.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.574
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:19.574 --> 00:30:21.632
Never.

00:30:21.632 --> 00:30:22.840
MARY KATE MOORE: Can I talk--

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.680
I'm going to talk about that.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.150
NICK CARTELL: Yeah, you can
talk about that, because there

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.610
are moments where--

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:32.429
MARY KATE MOORE: So Nick
is such a happy guy.

00:30:32.429 --> 00:30:33.220
NICK CARTELL: I am.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.178
MARY KATE MOORE: He is.

00:30:34.178 --> 00:30:37.070
And as soon as he starts
smiling, he can't stop.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:43.840
So I-- I mean, the
most tragic and emotion

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.630
filled moment of the show for
me is at the end of the docks

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:48.940
when, like, they're
about to take me to jail.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.070
I don't know what Josh does
when he comes on stage,

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:55.280
but he did something one day
to make Nick start laughing.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:55.810
And--

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:57.370
NICK CARTELL: Sometimes we'll
just look at each other and--

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.078
MARY KATE MOORE: And
that's all it takes.

00:30:59.078 --> 00:31:01.550
NICK CARTELL: --if we're in
a mood, then it just happens.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.480
But the thing that
I will say is that

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.310
what always pulls me back, like,
if ever I get to that point,

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.060
especially when we're
in that dock scene--

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:09.730
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.560
NICK CARTELL: --she
actually spits on me.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.610
And she will--

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:12.940
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.320
NICK CARTELL: She
will spit in my face.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.190
And it immediately pulls me in.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.060
MARY KATE MOORE: It's
like training a dog.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.060
NICK CARTELL: It's, like,
all right, here we go.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.104
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:19.104 --> 00:31:20.020
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.040
But it's really
difficult, you know,

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.480
when you're trying to cry.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.680
NICK CARTELL: I know.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.180
MARY KATE MOORE:
And he turns around

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.057
with a full grin on his face
and sings the line to you.

00:31:28.057 --> 00:31:29.140
NICK CARTELL: Never again.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.140
MARY KATE MOORE: Oh, OK.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.180
SPEAKER 1: Go ahead.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.685
AUDIENCE: Do you ever experience
bleed with your character's

00:31:37.685 --> 00:31:40.310
emotions coming through and sort
of you feeling the character's

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.910
emotions?

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:42.590
Or is it just all
simulated, and you've

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:46.110
done it enough that
that doesn't happen?

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:48.710
MARY KATE MOORE:
Well, the last--

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:52.970
like the last month,
my grandma passed away.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.890
And I thought it was fine.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:57.200
I thought I was totally fine.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.120
And I didn't really
cry about it,

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.980
but I always cry in the show.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.720
And the night right
after it happened,

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.830
I wasn't sure after I
got out there and started

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:09.440
crying if I was going to
be able to make it through.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.090
So there are definitely
moments where,

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:14.480
if something's happening for
you in your personal life that

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.850
has affected you
emotionally in any way,

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.560
this show can be
very therapeutic

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.070
for that sort of thing.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:22.190
But I mean, there's
a very fine line

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.740
that you can't
really cross over.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.440
So, yeah, I mean, sometimes
it's really difficult

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.775
to meet that line
and not exceed it.

00:32:31.775 --> 00:32:32.650
And I'm not sure if--

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:33.608
NICK CARTELL: Yeah, no.

00:32:33.608 --> 00:32:36.590
I will totally second that.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.744
Especially if you're
angry about something,

00:32:38.744 --> 00:32:40.160
you know, there
are those moments.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.540
For me, my mom passed away the
day before my final callback

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.906
for this show.

00:32:45.906 --> 00:32:48.280
And so to sing "Bring Him
Home" every night is emotional.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:52.030
To sing the end of
the show is emotional.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.030
And it is.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.704
It's incredibly therapeutic
to do this show.

00:32:55.704 --> 00:32:57.620
And I think it's been
some of the best therapy

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.460
in order to do the show.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.293
Because there are moments
where you can cry,

00:33:00.293 --> 00:33:03.620
and you can let that
emotion out that sometimes

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.900
you might not be able to
do outside of the theater.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.400
MARY KATE MOORE:
It also teaches you

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.260
how to access those
emotions though, too.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.990
So, you know, there are
those few performances

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.007
where it's dangerous.

00:33:14.007 --> 00:33:15.590
But then once you
get past that point,

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:19.700
you can remember what it
feels like to have your chest

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.850
constrict like that.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:24.980
And, you know, the more often
it happens, the more easy

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.057
it is to find it, so.

00:33:27.057 --> 00:33:28.640
SPEAKER 1: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:28.846
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:33:28.846 --> 00:33:29.876
NICK CARTELL: Yeah.

00:33:29.876 --> 00:33:32.105
AUDIENCE: If you could play
another character in "Les

00:33:32.105 --> 00:33:33.450
Mis" for one night, would you?

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:34.550
And who would it be?

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.477
NICK CARTELL: Oh.

00:33:36.477 --> 00:33:38.060
MARY KATE MOORE: Am
I going for first?

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:38.810
NICK CARTELL: Yes.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.180
MARY KATE MOORE: Well, I've
always wanted to be a bass,

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:49.310
so probably Javert.

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.850
NICK CARTELL: And I would say I
would like to play Javert, too.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:53.750
MARY KATE MOORE: Oh.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.520
Watch out, Josh.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.890
NICK CARTELL: I'd like to
play the other side of it.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.594
SPEAKER 1: Coming for you.

00:33:58.594 --> 00:34:01.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.190
AUDIENCE: So I am someone who
inspires to be in the arts.

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:07.040
And I'm curious, because
there's a lot of trial and error

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.420
in starting a career.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.251
Is there something
you're really glad you

00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:12.500
did when you first started
really putting yourself out

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.070
there?

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.486
And is there
something you kind of

00:34:14.486 --> 00:34:17.070
wish you'd done differently,
maybe not as much energy into

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.884
or, oh, you know don't worry
about that, just do this?

00:34:19.884 --> 00:34:21.050
What is your advice in that?

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.159
Like, something
you're super glad you

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:24.034
did at the start of your
career and something

00:34:24.034 --> 00:34:26.130
you wish you'd maybe
done differently?

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.505
NICK CARTELL: I
wish that I would

00:34:27.505 --> 00:34:30.080
have gotten into
more dance for me,

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.909
especially in musical theater.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:34.580
I can move, but
I'm not a dancer.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.020
And I wish that I could do it.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.340
I wish I could tap dance more.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.079
I wish I could, you know,
do all those things.

00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:42.620
I don't think that
there was anything

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:47.948
that I would say I'm sorry
that I put my energy into.

00:34:47.948 --> 00:34:49.489
Because I feel like
everything that I

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:53.760
did in some way, shape, or
form was a learning experience.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.340
It was a way to figure
out, all right, this

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.390
is the right thing to do or
this is the wrong thing to do.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.234
So that's me.

00:35:04.234 --> 00:35:05.150
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.527
I think it's--

00:35:06.527 --> 00:35:08.110
I mean, that's a
really good question,

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:12.680
but there's no formula
for success in my opinion.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.410
So anything that
you might experience

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:20.820
as an aspiring performer was
meant for you to experience.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.820
So I would just say that
it's important for you

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.552
to have patience and
to be kind to yourself,

00:35:25.552 --> 00:35:28.010
because there are probably a
lot of people in the world who

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.170
won't be that nice to you.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.300
But there are a lot
of people who will be

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.010
incredible and super helpful.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.830
And, yeah, just look for
the lesson in everything,

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.510
because it's always there.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:40.070
AUDIENCE: I'm curious.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:43.010
As you're seeing, like, in
a forum like this or even

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:46.400
on stage, like, are you looking
at the audience in their eyes,

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.560
like directly
making eye contact?

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.320
Or, especially as you're in
this big emotional journey

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.700
where the audience
may or may not

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.670
be, like, feeling
it quite the same,

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.127
is it awkward to be looking
at someone who is just sort

00:35:58.127 --> 00:35:59.210
of like looking up at you?

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:03.166
Or do you kind of focus more
generally in the theater?

00:36:03.166 --> 00:36:04.790
MARY KATE MOORE: In
some houses, that's

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:07.377
impossible to be able to
make eye contact with people

00:36:07.377 --> 00:36:09.710
just because of how dark it
is or how far away they are.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:14.180
But, like, here in Denver,
we're close to the first, like,

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.360
maybe 15 rows.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.180
So I can see facial features.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:23.850
And I find it helpful,
because so much of this show

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.579
is a lesson, you know?

00:36:25.579 --> 00:36:27.620
So many of the songs that
you're singing, so many

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.560
of the arguments or
conversations that you have

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.676
with people through song
are about this struggle

00:36:33.676 --> 00:36:35.550
of the human spirit and
things that we've all

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.700
experienced before.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.784
So I'm not afraid to make
eye contact with people.

00:36:38.784 --> 00:36:39.574
NICK CARTELL: Yeah.

00:36:39.574 --> 00:36:41.670
And at the beginning of
the show especially, you

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:44.710
know, I kind of break
the fourth wall a bit.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:46.670
And I am singing
to the audience.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:48.120
And I'm yelling at the audience.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.240
And to be able to have
those people that you can--

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.324
and they're, like, oh, OK.

00:36:52.324 --> 00:36:53.716
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:53.716 --> 00:36:54.840
He's looking at me now?

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.990
Why?

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.817
And it is.

00:36:57.817 --> 00:36:59.400
It's because we have
a lesson to tell,

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.570
and we have a story that
we're trying to get across.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:03.350
And if we can connect
with people on that level,

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:04.950
then it just makes
it better for us.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:06.450
And I feel like it makes it--

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:06.870
MARY KATE MOORE: Oh, yeah.

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:09.000
NICK CARTELL: -- a more riching
experience for the audience.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.249
MARY KATE MOORE: It's always--

00:37:10.249 --> 00:37:11.790
it's a goal of a
performer, I think,

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.160
to make the audience
feel like they

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.610
are part of what's happening,
because that's really

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.550
kind of how the
lessons stick I think.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.719
So, yeah.

00:37:20.719 --> 00:37:21.510
NICK CARTELL: Yeah.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.600
SPEAKER 1: You said
you've done 331 shows.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.700
What has been, like, the
most memorable moment?

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.741
NICK CARTELL: For me, the
most memorable moment--

00:37:28.741 --> 00:37:29.910
and it wasn't in a show.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.980
It was actually when we
were still in rehearsal.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:36.690
And it was we were going
into our day of sitzprobe.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:39.240
And the sitzprobe is it's the
first time that the actors are

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.050
singing with an orchestra.

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.230
So we are all on stage.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.990
And we are walking up to
just stand microphones,

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.080
and we're singing with
this beautiful orchestra.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.690
And sitting in front of us
is Claude-Michel Schonberg

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:53.490
and Alain Boublil,
who wrote the show.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:54.300
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.040
NICK CARTELL: And to
have that experience

00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:01.800
of singing their music
for them, it is a moment

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.664
that I will never forget.

00:38:04.664 --> 00:38:06.330
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah,
that's a big one.

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:09.240
I would say mine's probably
in that same time period

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.460
when we were in
previews in Providence.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.960
And the entire creative
team of Les Miserables

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.830
came to see us do that.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:23.310
And we had all, you know,
heard the reputation

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.800
that Cameron Mackintosh has.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.890
He's a very particular man and
knows exactly what he likes.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.770
And when he came into
our note session,

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.710
the day after he
saw our show, he

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:39.810
didn't have anything negative
to say about us as an ensemble.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:41.495
And so that was very cool.

00:38:41.495 --> 00:38:43.120
I mean, we were all
excited about that.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.940
But then soon as he left,
our Associate Director

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.830
was, like, I just want you
guys to know that I've never

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:47.970
heard him say that before.

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:48.595
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:38:48.595 --> 00:38:51.900
MARY KATE MOORE: So
knowing that and knowing

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:55.572
how strong of a group of
performers we are, you know,

00:38:55.572 --> 00:38:57.780
it gives you a lot of pride
for the work that you do.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.120
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, that's
a huge compliment.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.320
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.500
SPEAKER 1: --from
Cameron Mackintosh.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.840
And then so I'm assuming
you're not always

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.600
listening to "Les Mis"
when you're not in a show.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.189
Is there any other, you
know, current musical cast

00:39:09.189 --> 00:39:10.980
recordings you're
listening to or any songs

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.410
you listen to to, like, get
pumped up before the show?

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.493
MARY KATE MOORE: I'm a bad
musical theater person.

00:39:15.493 --> 00:39:17.790
I don't, like, really
listen to cast recordings

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:20.940
unless I need to for a show.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.800
So I guess, I mean,
I've been listening

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.375
to a lot of Fleetwood Mac in
the dressing rooms lately.

00:39:25.375 --> 00:39:25.830
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.570
MARY KATE MOORE: So
[INAUDIBLE] that.

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:28.565
NICK CARTELL: I just
kind of put on Spotify.

00:39:28.565 --> 00:39:28.930
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:30.240
NICK CARTELL: And just
how the mood hits me,

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.230
sometimes it's jazz.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.370
Sometimes it's big band.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.220
Sometimes it's, you know.

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.740
Whatever I need to pump me
up in order to do the show

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.330
or whatever mood
I'm in, that's kind

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.630
of what pushes me in
the right direction.

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:46.290
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you happened to find yourself,

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:49.340
you know, in the midst
of a group of people who

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.320
are involved in technology--

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.080
--what sort of
technology improvements

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.937
would help people
in musical theater?

00:39:57.937 --> 00:39:58.645
NICK CARTELL: Oh.

00:39:58.645 --> 00:39:58.990
MARY KATE MOORE: Oh.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.720
SPEAKER 1: Very good question.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.886
MARY KATE MOORE: Oh my gosh.

00:40:00.886 --> 00:40:06.525
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:06.525 --> 00:40:07.460
We're kind of set.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.585
I mean, I feel good about--

00:40:08.585 --> 00:40:10.876
NICK CARTELL: I think something
that would be amazing--

00:40:10.876 --> 00:40:12.680
and I know the technology
is sort of there,

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.872
but I don't think it's been,
you know, immediately or--

00:40:16.872 --> 00:40:18.080
I don't know how to say that.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:22.520
But when we get
into every city, we

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.710
have a local crew that
we pick up in every city.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:28.310
So we travel with a crew
of about 20 to 25 people.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:31.250
And then we pick up maybe
about another 50 to 75 people

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.090
to help us do the
show every night.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:35.600
And sometimes-- well,
a lot of the time

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.510
it's the spotlights
that are on somebody.

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.070
Like, it's a local
person and they're

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.930
having to say, all right,
you need to be on Valjean.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:43.429
You need to be on
Valjean right now.

00:40:43.429 --> 00:40:46.490
And the spotlight will come
up over there, and I'm here.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.742
So if there was technology
that you could wear something

00:40:49.742 --> 00:40:51.950
on your costume that they
could just put up the light

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.930
and it would be on
you as a spotlight,

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:55.380
I think that would be amazing.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.260
MARY KATE MOORE: Yeah.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.000
That would be super cool.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.010
I'm technologically
challenged, so maybe just

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.917
like somebody helping me.

00:41:02.917 --> 00:41:04.627
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:04.627 --> 00:41:06.460
SPEAKER 1: I think we
can find someone here.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:06.770
MARY KATE MOORE: OK, great.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:07.670
Awesome.
