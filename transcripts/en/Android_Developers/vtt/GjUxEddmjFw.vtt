ROMAN NURIK: Hello, and welcome
to Android Design in Action.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.042
My name's Roman Nurik.

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:13.500
NICK BUTCHER: Hi,
I'm Nick Butcher.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.140
ROMAN NURIK: And to
your right is Mike.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.765
MIKE DENNY: Hi.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:16.980
Yeah, my name's Mike Denny.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.969
This is my first Android
Design in Action.

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:20.260
I'm excited to be a part of it.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.340
I just joined Google a couple
weeks ago as a design advocate

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.429
for developer relations.

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.220
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, so
pretty soon hopefully

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.428
you guys are going to see
a bunch of material, Design

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.510
Bytes and things like
that, coming from Mike.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.720
He's a very talented
speaker and awesome guy.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.566
Yeah, so look forward to
hearing from Mike very soon.

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.690
NICK BUTCHER: Welcome Mike.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.322
Great to see you on the
show more in the future.

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:41.530
MIKE DENNY: Great to be here.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.855
ROMAN NURIK: So
in today's episode

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:44.310
of Android Design
in Action, we're

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.620
going to be looking at a
couple of our favorite apps.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.380
And actually, not just us, but
members from the larger Android

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.020
team, specifically some of
the designers on the team,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.040
are going to be looking at
some of their favorite design

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.457
aspects of their favorite apps.

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.040
NICK BUTCHER: So
hopefully we're going

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.389
to give you some little
sprinkles of inspiration

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:03.930
of things that we
love to see in apps

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.580
and hopefully give you some
ideas of the kind of elements

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.090
that you can
include in your apps

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.641
to make them equally compelling.

00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:10.640
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.190
So without further
ado, let's get to it.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.400
So the app I want to
talk about is Foursquare.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.272
Now, I'm sure a lot
of you folks out

00:01:18.272 --> 00:01:19.730
there are familiar
with Foursquare.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.120
You probably use it every day.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.430
But I just wanted to point out
a couple of specific design

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.940
features that I really
love about this app.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.450
Now, specifically, I'm going
to do a search for something

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.640
like pizza and
see what comes up.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.190
And I'll talk
through the process.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.317
So first, I'm going to go ahead
and enter this search field.

00:01:38.317 --> 00:01:39.650
I'm going to start typing pizza.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.240
And actually, before
I type anything,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.656
you'll notice that
I have a couple

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:46.100
of different suggestions, a
couple different categories

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.740
of food or I guess
of places that I

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.070
can look in, which is great.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.257
But I'm going to go
ahead and type pizza.

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:53.840
And you'll notice
that immediately, it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.170
gives me a bunch
of common searches.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.770
So you have pizza, Pizza
Hut, pizza place, and so on.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.720
I'm just going to go
ahead and choose pizza.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.428
Now, once I get into
here, this is really

00:02:07.428 --> 00:02:10.130
the meat of what I want to
talk about, no pun intended.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.630
So on the left here-- and this
is a tablet UI-- on the left,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.490
you have the list
of search results.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.050
On the right, you have this map.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.060
So this is kind of a
very common two-pane view

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.660
for lists of search results.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.260
Now, the most interesting
thing here, I guess,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.870
is what happens with the
actual list of search results.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.370
If you look on the
left here, you'll

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.890
notice that it's not just
the title and the category

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.110
or the title and the photo.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.780
There's actually a
lot of information

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.780
compressed into
this small space.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.450
So for example, Amici's
East Coast Pizzeria here,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.920
you see that it's a $1 sign.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.180
It's got a couple of friends
of mine that have been there.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.130
It shows this to me immediately
in the form of avatars.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.641
It actually shows the
photos of my friends

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.140
that have been here, which is
a really nice signal that hey,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.960
this is important.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.500
This may be a
really good result.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.790
And it actually
kind of brings up

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.630
the score, the rating of
the restaurant, as well.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.650
So if I scroll through
here, you notice

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.960
that the information
hierarchy is very clear.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.420
The very first thing you see,
the very most obvious thing

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.120
in the search
results, is the photo.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.820
But after your eye
glances at the photo,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.540
you immediately take a
look and start processing

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.690
the other information
on the screen, things

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.090
like the title, the type,
the category, and then

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.330
who's been there.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.230
Now, so that's kind of one of
my favorite pieces of this app

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.400
is it really has so much.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.099
It really communicates so much
in a very interesting way.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.640
Really quickly, I
wanted to point out

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.770
that the typography
here is very good.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.550
The information
hierarchy is further

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.510
complimented by the use of
things like Roboto Light.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.631
So for example, pizza, pizza,
pizza, Italian, Italian, and so

00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:51.130
on.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.796
These categories are
kind of repetitive.

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:55.670
It's not adding too
much to my sense

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.220
of what this place is about.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.440
And so it's actually using
a slightly lighter font

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.620
to distract me less while I'm
looking at the different search

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.017
results.

00:04:09.017 --> 00:04:11.350
So the other nice thing I
wanted to point out real quick

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.840
is let's say, you
know, I've seen

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.600
this first page of results.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.120
And I start scrolling down.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.894
Now, usually when
you start scrolling

00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:21.269
in a set of search results,
it means that you haven't yet

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.977
found what you wanted to find.

00:04:22.977 --> 00:04:24.560
So as I start
scrolling, you'll notice

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.770
that this bar at
the bottom pops up

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.440
that says, hey, if you haven't
found what you want yet,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.190
maybe you're looking
for something else.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.270
Try searching for food, dinner,
Italian, or lunch, or things

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.100
like that.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.290
And so these kind
of contextual cues

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.890
are really important to overall
making the search results

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.844
and search experience
really key.

00:04:45.844 --> 00:04:48.010
There are obviously other
nice things involved here,

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.760
like as I touch
items in the map,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.620
they focus in on the
left in this list.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.090
But these are really some
of my favorite features,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.550
this information hierarchy,
this bottom bar that

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.950
shows up at the bottom.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.380
Overall, this is just a great
search results experience

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.654
in the Foursquare app.

00:05:05.654 --> 00:05:06.820
RACHEL GARB: Hi, I'm Rachel.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.250
I'm going to tell
you about things

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.410
I really like about
the Airbnb app.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.850
First of all, what's great is
that you can jump right in.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.720
You don't have to
sign in or sign up.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.990
You can immediately start
looking at the content

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.900
and enjoying it.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.000
And the content
is just beautiful.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.750
We have full bleed images
and beautiful typography.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.020
The key information
is there at a glance,

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.840
which is the price, of course.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.150
And once you drill into
the details, same thing.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.600
It's beautifully laid out.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.700
The transition is satisfying
to look at for a few seconds.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.390
And you can swipe
through and really

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.840
quickly get all the
information that you

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.380
need about a particular place.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.620
Call to action very obvious.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.430
And also lots of
sharing options.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.600
So if you're trying to
make a decision about where

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.190
to stay with other people,
very easy to get to that.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.800
For something that's
supposed to be work,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.620
this makes it a lot
more fun and enjoyable.

00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:16.060
MARCO PAGLIA: Hi everybody.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.580
My name is Marco.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.740
I'm an Android
designer, and I lead

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.885
a set of different
applications that we work on

00:06:21.885 --> 00:06:25.110
on Android Design, in
particular, Google Play.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.980
So today I'm going to be talking
to you about a new application

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.210
that we have just
finished working on

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.780
and has just been released,
which is Newsstand,

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.090
and we're very proud about.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.090
We're just going to be
looking into some details

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.040
that I really like.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.600
So here's the
Newsstand application.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.300
It's a typical play application.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.790
It has a side drawer
with all the sections.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.330
And we've built these
very beautiful cards

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.840
as you sign in in order to tell
you what the experiences are

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.530
about, what my news is about,
what [INAUDIBLE] is about,

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.050
et cetera.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.669
And you can just dismiss them.

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:57.710
We have a nice animation.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.920
Everything feels very fluid.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.880
Let me get to another
detail that I really like.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.060
These are all my sources.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.700
It's a mix between
sources that I

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.910
follow, like "The
Verge," and topics.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.740
Every topic has a
different color.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.300
Google Play is blue.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.180
Google is red.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.740
Architecture at the
bottom is purple.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.110
So let me open that
one in particular.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.780
You see the action
bar changes color

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.560
according to the
topic where I'm in.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.540
And we spent a lot of
time doing it right.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.780
And actually, all the
rendering is done dynamically.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.420
And then look when I
slide, when I edge swipe

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.460
and I open the drawer.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.770
The action bar color itself
back into the application color.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.309
And this is very nice.

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:40.350
This is a detail we spent
a lot of time doing it.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.520
Let me do that again.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.280
You see the color just merges
into the application's color.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.830
I'm going to look
into another detail.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.880
Let's check the sources instead.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.539
Let's check "The Verge."

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:55.080
There you go.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.230
This is "The Verge."

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.740
You see that we wanted to give
to a particular source a very

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.620
emotional feeling.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.960
So you have an image,
which is in the background.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.560
And with a sort of
Ken Burns effect,

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.580
it's fading out
different images.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.390
It feels very much alive.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.430
And as soon as I
scroll up the view,

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.130
the logo moves right
into its position,

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.942
and the source name shows up.

00:08:17.942 --> 00:08:20.150
And that's another detail
that we spent a lot of time

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.270
doing it right, and
we think it really

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:28.690
distinguishes this
application from others.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.340
Let's look at another detail.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.210
Let's look at the article view.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.360
We have developed a lot
of different layouts

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.480
so that the articles feel
very unique and beautiful

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.299
on all devices.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.298
I'm going to look at "The
New York Times," which

00:08:41.298 --> 00:08:46.662
is a source that we
worked with in details.

00:08:46.662 --> 00:08:48.120
So you see in the
"New York Times,"

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.940
you have all your news
as for everything else.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:56.970
But the font in the "New
York Times" is personalized.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.990
It's the "New York Times" font.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.130
It's not Roboto as
we use it elsewhere.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.580
So we try to make every
source to be different

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.280
from one another,
to be very specific.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.030
So when you look at
the "Financial Times,"

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.740
it has a different font,
and so on and so forth.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.300
So we invite,
actually, the developer

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.758
to try to play with
different fonts

00:09:14.758 --> 00:09:17.020
if they have them available.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.080
So see this detail here.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.220
This news right now is metered.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.680
So I only have 18 free
articles that I can read today.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.140
And if I want to read it, I
can just swipe up the page.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.680
And you see the number
is changing into 10.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.750
And when it reaches
the end, there you go.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.980
Now the page is unlocked,
and now I can scroll it,

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.400
and I can finally read it.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.650
This is something else we spent
quite a bit of time doing it.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.230
And every layout is
really beautiful.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.210
Let me show you a couple
of my favorite articles

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.020
that I have saved here.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.460
This is an article
about a new car,

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.472
the Stingray that just came out.

00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:00.430
See when you're in article
view, the action bar

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.270
disappears as soon as
you get into the article.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.200
And it's full of beautiful
photos, beautiful photos

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.440
everywhere that we
got from the source.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.020
Now check this out.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.879
We want to have the
view to be full screen

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:15.170
and to be very immersive, so
I don't see the action bar

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.270
when I'm navigating
through the page.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.450
But as soon as I pull this
down, the action bar comes back.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.910
But I haven't finished.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.770
Look when I get all the way up.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.692
The action bar
becomes transparent

00:10:27.692 --> 00:10:29.150
as it reaches the
end, and it wants

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.360
to melt with the
rest of the view

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.450
and not feel like a colored
thing on top of the view.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.440
So these are just
some of the examples

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.870
that we worked on in order
to make this application feel

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.470
special, feel
immersive, and feel

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.440
very different from a lot of
other applications we built

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.410
so far.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.420
It has very individual patterns
that we invite everybody

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.770
to play with so that we can
have more patterns, more

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.380
differentiation, and better
application across the Android

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.221
platform.

00:10:57.221 --> 00:10:57.720
Thanks.

00:11:00.562 --> 00:11:01.270
NICK BUTCHER: Hi.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.470
The app that I have
selected to talk about

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.330
is Chrome, the browser.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.850
And in particular, I'd like to
talk about some of the gestures

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.680
that they use in
the application.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.240
So here I am in
Chrome app, looking

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.580
at a particularly interesting
playlist on YouTube.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.210
And you can see from
the little three

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.900
up here and just
next to the URL bar

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.019
that I have three tabs open.

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:25.810
So I can just go ahead
and tap that button,

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.810
and I'll get into the
tab management UI.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.660
But another more interesting
way of doing this

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.830
is using a gesture.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.470
You can see that when I tap that
three, the bar itself animates

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:42.140
down, kind of shifts down,
kind of implying spatially

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.590
how you might bootstrap this,
the knowledge of this gesture.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.620
So what you can do is
you can drag it down

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.920
and to enter the same
UI here from the bar.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.650
So a few things about how
they've done this gesture I

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.130
think work really, really well.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.340
Firstly, I always
feel in control of it.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.760
So as I drag down, it
kind of tracks my finger

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.240
so I can move down
and up, and I always

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.550
feel very much in control
of what's going on.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.560
The second thing is
it's very contextual.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.400
So if I was on, say, this
bottom tab here, as I drag down,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.990
it maintains the
order of my tabs.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.540
But it tracks my fingers.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.415
So again, I always feel
very much in control,

00:12:18.415 --> 00:12:22.580
and it retains the context
of where I've come from.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.970
You can also do some things
like dragging sideways

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.470
on it to switch the tabs here.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.130
So again, it's maintaining
that spatial model

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.600
so I know I can move
on easily to them.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.890
And my favorite thing
I think about this

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.399
is just the element of whimsy.

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:38.940
As per the Android
design guidelines,

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.780
you should be aiming to delight
your users in surprising ways.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.460
This task you're doing,
the goal I guess,

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.180
is managing tabs, is switching
between tabs, closing a tab.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.560
Could be seen as
kind of a chore,

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.450
something you're
forcing the user to do.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.360
But by introducing a really
satisfying way of doing it,

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.370
it actually makes
it more delightful.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.170
So action here, say dragging
down and then swiping away,

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.350
is kind of much more visceral.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.745
Using direct manipulation
to actually grab the content

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:09.470
and manipulate it, rather
than operating machinery

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.290
to perform a task I think
is really, really great.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:16.410
So yeah, that was
gestures in Google Chrome.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.180
Great job, and
think about how you

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.120
might use similar
kind of gestures

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:25.310
to make tasks more directly
manipulated and more fun.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.437
Cheers.

00:13:27.437 --> 00:13:29.770
RICHARD FELCHER: Hi, this is
Rich Felcher on the Android

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.980
Design team, and I'm here
today to talk about an app

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.220
that I've been using for a
couple of years now called

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.590
Libra.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.350
Libra is an app
that is used to help

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.420
you keep track of your weight.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.530
It does a lot of
things that I like.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.580
It does things like
prompting you every day

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.340
with a notification to
enter your weight, so

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.590
positive little
reminders like that.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.880
But the thing I wanted
to focus on today

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.010
is the way that Libra visualizes
the data that the user enters

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.440
over time and how it
can kind of respond

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.690
to different scales of time
when showing that data.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.980
So in the typical
view for Libra,

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.680
you're seeing a graph of
your most recent weights

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.550
that you've entered
within the application.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.660
So here I've got a couple of
weeks' worth of content here.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:22.440
And for every day, I'm just
seeing a small orange dot

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.847
that represents what the
value on a particular day was.

00:14:25.847 --> 00:14:27.680
And they've got the
gray lines connecting it

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.750
to the average, which is a
trend line that's rolling back

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.650
across several days of data.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.130
It also does some forecasting,
so you get this kind of line

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.980
to the right hand
side here that's

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.860
kind of predicting if you
continue the way you've

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.330
been doing and
managing your meals,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.580
your weight should
go in that direction.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.480
What Libra does that's really
kind of well implemented

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.810
and smoothly done
is, if I decide

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.550
to shift this time scale--
so maybe I want to go back,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.510
and I look across a slightly
wider scope of time--

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.540
as I do that, the
way that the data is

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.990
being reflected
actually changes.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.330
So now those orange
circles have dropped away.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.080
I still have the gray
bars, so I can still

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.580
get a sense of what those
individual day values were.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.020
But that's honestly just
less important in this view.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.160
And if I keep squeezing
out a little further,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.800
the gray lines
themselves disappear,

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.390
and I'm really just
looking at trend over time.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.330
It also, in addition to kind of
doing the two-finger gestures,

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.290
I can do tap to snap to
different time scales.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.390
So tap once, and then tap
again to get closer and closer.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.655
And you'll see it moves
through those different views,

00:15:33.655 --> 00:15:35.030
and there's even
little shortcuts

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:39.400
for moving to the current
day view and matching that.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.610
So a neat small app,
something I maybe spend

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.450
less than 30 seconds
with each day.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.340
But still does a really
good job of considering

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.270
kind of what the user
goals are at any instant.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.180
If I am in the moment of
putting in that one value,

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.730
it's giving me a real detailed
view for a short range.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.880
But as I start to go
further and further out

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.150
to look for a wider
set of data, it really

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.042
adapts and kind of
simplifies the views

00:16:05.042 --> 00:16:07.125
so that only the most
pertinent things to the user

00:16:07.125 --> 00:16:10.510
are displayed, and I can kind
of quickly glance and read

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.370
and understand what's happening.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.230
So that's Libra.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.840
Recommended.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.244
Thanks.

00:16:18.244 --> 00:16:20.660
MIKE DENNY: So the app I'm
going to be talking about today

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.620
is Timely by the
awesome guys at Bitspin.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.810
So Timely, if you've been
following Android design,

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.770
if you've seen the show,
we've talked about it before.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:35.560
It's been discussed a lot
on different platforms

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.660
because it's just a fantastic
example of Android design,

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:44.990
and it just really encapsulates
a lot of the design principles

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.060
in the Android design
guide, especially principles

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:53.060
around the idea that our Android
devices should enchant us.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.570
And I'm specifically going to
be talking about things that

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.410
stand out in this
app that just show

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.210
that they went the extra mile.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:05.300
They have just an awesome
level of polish in this app.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.099
And this kind of
polish isn't just

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.369
the fundamental things
in your app are working.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:13.180
Timely, for example, is a
clock, a timer, a stopwatch,

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.480
and I use it as an alarm to
wake me up in the morning.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.750
So all that stuff
behaves as expected,

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.630
but it's the extra
little details.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.800
It's the tiny animations
that are just gorgeous,

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.160
and the use of color, the use of
typography throughout the app.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.840
It's that extra 1% effort that
really makes a huge difference

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.230
in the overall quality
of your app experience.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.820
So like I mentioned,
it's a clock,

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.170
and if you look at the seconds
animating here, and even

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:45.040
responding to my touch,
it's just a perfect example

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.550
in dozens of places in this
app that real objects are

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.330
more fun than buttons and menus.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.180
So just up here,
at first glance,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.620
this doesn't look like a
traditional Android app, right?

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.930
It doesn't have a
solid color action

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.850
bar with a light or
dark theme throughout.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.450
It's bright, it's colored, it's
got this live wallpaper thing

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.220
going on in the background.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.510
But it behaves like
an Android app,

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.660
and that makes the
beautiful aesthetic

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.300
that they've gone with
just that much better.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.140
When you page between
the different colors,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.820
they kind of crossfade.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:27.180
And all of these
elements are touchable.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.850
They're very inviting.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:33.680
You don't have to be told
explicitly what to do.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.630
For example, you just
hit the play button,

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:39.790
and it starts counting down
from the time I set for it.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.770
And if you're
interacting with it

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.850
and you get a little
bit off track,

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.830
and you start dragging here,
you notice that it tilts.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.670
And so that's kind
of curious, right?

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.130
And so if you go down to the
split action bar on the bottom

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.400
and tap the
stopwatch button, you

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.440
notice that the timer
actually flips end over end.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.050
And so that kind
of gives me the cue

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.555
that I can just flip
it using a gesture,

00:19:01.555 --> 00:19:04.520
and I don't even have to worry
about the button down here.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.090
And that's just a lot more fun.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.210
When there are things that
are a little bit harder

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.590
to communicate to a new
user, for example, like how

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.970
to drag from the edge here
to create a new alarm,

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.620
it's gently taught.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:23.640
So I can swipe from
the edge of the screen

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:30.760
and pull in a new alarm
and set it for 6:30,

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:36.300
and I have that nice
pulse to interact with.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.870
It shows me here that I
can tap below to increment

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:43.390
or tap above to reduce the time.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.490
And when I'm done, I
just hit done at the top.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:52.290
And there I've set an alarm,
and it's just awesome.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.000
So I can move it up and down.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.490
Very interactive
throughout the app.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.550
So just again, I
want to emphasize

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:05.380
that this is that extra 1%
of effort that just makes

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.790
it possible to delight your
users, surprise your users.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.705
Because it's not generic.

00:20:10.705 --> 00:20:14.020
The things in your app
that just make them smile,

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.090
make you think, oh,
somebody thought of that.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.410
That extra percent
of effort is going

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:23.640
to make a lot of difference
and have that polish that

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.030
will really make a great
experience for your users.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.580
ADAM KOCH: So for those of
you unfamiliar with Etsy,

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.801
it's essentially an online
marketplace for handmade goods.

00:20:32.801 --> 00:20:35.050
So you can browse the various
goods that are available

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.610
and then of course purchase
and have them delivered to you.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.040
So let me go ahead and
open up this application.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.466
I've just downloaded and
installed it from Google Play,

00:20:42.466 --> 00:20:43.590
so I haven't run it before.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.760
And you'll notice immediately
I'm shown content.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.660
So I'm not thrown up into
any sort of roadblocks,

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.910
no tutorial, no login required.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.820
I just immediately see these
sort of trending items on Etsy.

00:21:00.472 --> 00:21:02.254
So I think that's
really great, and I'm

00:21:02.254 --> 00:21:03.920
pretty sure Nick
Butcher would be pretty

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.214
happy with this onboarding flow.

00:21:07.214 --> 00:21:11.960
Now, if I scroll down, you'll
notice this staggered grid view

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.540
layout of the various items.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.230
And I really like this as well.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.660
It really means that instead
of a traditional square kind

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.810
of grid, it means
that the images don't

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.130
need to be cropped quite
so much to get them down

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:27.290
into that square.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.650
So you can see more images.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.980
Like this one on the left
here, this black sweater--

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.140
this back sweater, rather.

00:21:34.621 --> 00:21:36.120
You can see more
of the image there.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.205
It fits nicer onto the screen.

00:21:38.205 --> 00:21:39.830
The other great thing
about this layout

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:43.360
is it will work very well
across different screen sizes.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.030
So I think on
phone, in portrait,

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.200
they just show one column.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.890
But then as the screen
size gets bigger,

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.330
they move to multiple columns.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.260
So I think it's really nice.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.420
Another thing worth mentioning
is you'll see here--

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.420
and it's kind of hard
to notice as I scroll

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.440
through-- but the
placeholder images

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.277
that they show before
the image actually

00:22:02.277 --> 00:22:04.485
fades in-- now these images
are just loading so fast,

00:22:04.485 --> 00:22:05.484
it's really hard to see.

00:22:05.484 --> 00:22:06.650
OK, here we go.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.429
You'll notice there's sort of
a composite of the image that's

00:22:09.429 --> 00:22:10.720
eventually going to load there.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:16.570
So for example, this ornament,
which is sort of primarily

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:20.800
green and brown, it was sort
of a green/brown combination

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.604
shade of color.

00:22:22.604 --> 00:22:25.270
So I'll scroll down a little bit
more so you can see a few more.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.879
So I really like that.

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:28.420
There you go.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.780
You can see a bit better.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.710
Now, their touch
feedback is very subtle.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.350
You can see here.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.970
It actually fits in very
nicely with the updated

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.110
recommendations after Android
4.4 KitKat was announced.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.370
So that's quite nice as well.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.666
One of my favorite
things actually

00:22:49.666 --> 00:22:51.040
of this app I'm
about to show you

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.780
now is as you open
the drawer, you'll

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.150
notice they kind of blur
out the actual content here.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.990
I think this is a really
nice design flourish,

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.220
and it really helps
to put the focus

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.620
on the drawer, which
just popped open.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.190
So if I close it
again, the images

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:12.090
just fade back into being
nice and clear again.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.710
It's great because they actually
blur whatever the content was

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.720
that was on the
screen at the time.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.886
So here, let me do it again.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.480
Quite nice.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.060
Now, if you try and
like something--

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.810
so I'm going to tap
this little heart here

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:29.550
in one of the corners--
now, at this point,

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.940
you do need to
sign up or sign in.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.160
They've got a clear
button that says, not now.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.030
So if you don't want
to go down that path,

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.664
you can just click that
and continue on your way.

00:23:38.664 --> 00:23:40.080
But if you do want
to sign in, you

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.100
can just continue on with this
flow, sign in appropriately.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.967
And they also use that
blurred-out effect here again,

00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:48.550
and I think it just
looks really nice.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.770
Popping quickly into
the details screen.

00:23:59.633 --> 00:24:01.466
So this is an item that
I'm sure many of you

00:24:01.466 --> 00:24:07.350
will be interested in,
a tortoise cozy, yes.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:11.660
So again, this layout, it's
very focused on the content.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.262
There's not a lot of
system UI going on here,

00:24:15.262 --> 00:24:17.220
really it's just the
action bar, a description,

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.080
and the key actions there
either in the action bar

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.610
or within the actual layout.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:27.490
And then as you sort of
scroll down the description,

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:31.650
you'll see these additional
images pop up from the bottom.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:35.290
These are sort of other items
from this particular seller.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.420
So if you're really into
getting turtle cozies,

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.640
you can see here you've
got plenty to look through.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.060
So that's it.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.440
I just thought this
was a fantastic app.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.650
Check it out.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.249
Thanks very much.

00:24:52.249 --> 00:24:54.790
ROMAN NURIK: So those are some
of our favorite design details

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:56.412
and some of our favorite apps.

00:24:56.412 --> 00:24:58.620
We hope that you guys drew
some inspiration from some

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.119
of the things we
talked about today.

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:02.300
And that's all we have
for this week's episode.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.200
