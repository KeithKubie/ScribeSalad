1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,080
This is a setup. I don't like
that. What was that? His debut.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,390
He's never fought before.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,840
So having a fight in a
smaller organization or
not just feed them to these

4
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:13,560
fucking, he shouldn't be initiating
pencil. He shouldn't be in jeans.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,370
It's not disrespectful to him and
it's not disrespectful to the sport,

6
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:22,260
but it's disrespectful to a large scale
organization to have a guy who's a guy

7
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:26,580
who's coming in from pro wrestling. He's
got a big fan base. Do it the right way,

8
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,980
and then eventually make your
way into a bigger organization.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,760
What are you talking about? He's like
homemade event on ESPN. The how'd that go?

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,350
How'd that work? Awful. We watch it
together was a joke. It was a jet. Well,

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,480
I knew that guy was, uh, was fading quick.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,270
We were talking about it in your
green room. I was like, he's fading.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,580
I don't like to wait,
stepping. He looks exhausted.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,400
He tired out quick and then he hit
that too. With the illegal knee.

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,440
Do you think he's still going
to be in the UFC after that?

16
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:51,720
100% they've invested too much in them.

17
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:55,360
Dana said he's going to have another
fight. Wow. Interesting interest.

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,840
It's a bummer. But that's the life we
live. And what do you do with them?

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,390
What I do with them dances and God
wouldn't have his learning here, Derek.

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,200
I did give him Derek Lewis and give him
the fuck out of there. Go. He like women.

21
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,870
Here's Derrick Lewis who came
from a domestic violence home.

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,160
He's pretty good enjoying
this. Oh, you want to be a
fighter? Here's Derrick Lewis,

23
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,810
Derek, Derek. But there [inaudible].
I know he has some added.

24
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:18,570
How many fights is Greg hardy had was as,
that'd be his fourth.

25
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:22,020
He had three on the f whatever,
getting white. So with a guy like that,

26
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:25,920
it was a pro bowler. Really Athletic.
Wouldn't his learning curve be very,

27
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:30,060
very steep. But what are quick
wouldn't he wouldn't. He is too much.

28
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:32,910
There's too much. There's too much
to download. Especially at his age.

29
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:35,580
He's 30 so that you've got to
download a lot of information.

30
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:39,360
So maybe he's working a lot on striking,
but you can't cover Jiu Jitsu,

31
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,020
kickboxing, wrestling, bottom. Not all
you are, no matter who you are. No,

32
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,930
it doesn't matter.
You Take Herschel Walker,

33
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:48,690
it doesn't matter if they're that great
of an athlete takes a fucking while to

34
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,600
learn the skill.
Well,

35
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,620
Herschel Walker was world class
athlete and a lifelong martial artists.

36
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:56,060
Different animals. Yeah, different. Yeah,

37
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:59,670
but I'm saying even if you take an
athletic like Lebron James would struggle,

38
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,930
did you throw them to the UFC?

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,290
I firmly believe that Hershel Walker
would have given a lot of dudes a hard

40
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,460
fucking time at his age or if you started
in his forties even as forward as I

41
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,310
think he was such a fucking
freak stud of an athlete.

42
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,420
He's such an outlier who would
have given a lot of that speed.

43
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,280
He had a 35 he's running, he was running
Olympic speed, which was in the Olympics.

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,480
He was such a freak.

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,130
She's such unbelievable and a real
martial artists like really had skills.

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,650
Like when, when I first saw
him fight the UFC, I was like,

47
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,250
or it strike force rather. I was like,
oh my God. Like he can actually fight.

48
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,300
Like dudes are scared of him. Like he
was, he was moving in the right way.

49
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:39,780
He wasn't doing anything wrong.
Who's taken guys down, smashing them.

50
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,430
And the physical power that he had was
just scared body. So stupid. Ridiculous.

51
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,970
So the team, he trained with Ak q's
ready. He did it, went to the right place,

52
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,240
and they gave him the right fights. It
was good. Yeah. But if you start younger,

53
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:54,810
you dove real prominent. Yeah, no problem.
