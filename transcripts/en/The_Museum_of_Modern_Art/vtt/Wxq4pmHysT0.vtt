00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:14.625
Being living sculpture is
our lifeblood, our destiny,

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:19.291
our romance,
our disaster, our light and life.

00:00:22.416 --> 00:00:25.541
As day breaks over us,
we rise into a vacuum

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.833
and the cold morning light

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.166
filters dustily
through the window.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.166
We step into
the responsibility suits of our art.

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.791

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.833
So do contact us.

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:54.916
Name, address and phone number.

00:00:55.083 --> 00:00:57.791
And nobody did,
that's very good.

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:04.541
We didn't want to be
the art students who left college

00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:06.875
and ran to buy some bundle
of canvases,

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:08.916
or some plaster or bronze.

00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:12.666
We thought we had something new
to say and we wanted a new form.

00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:15.531
And I remember
in the end of the school year,

00:01:15.698 --> 00:01:17.916
we had these objects
that we made,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.083
and we asked somebody to take
photographs of us holding these.

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.666
And half way through we realized

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:29.541
that we didn't need
the objects to be sculpture.

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:33.500
That was a revelation for us.

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:46.333
We invented Postal Sculptures
as a means of reaching

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.708
a lot of people

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.791
that we couldn't reach
through having a gallery.

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.916
We had no representative, we couldn't
put our art on a gallery wall,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.125
but we could do Postal Sculptures.

00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:57.875
We'd go and post them,
and it would arrive the next day.

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:02.000
Because they're what you call
the visual of the Postal Sculpture

00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:05.500
would create a three-dimensional
feeling in your brain.

00:02:07.916 --> 00:02:12.458
We managed to get
the mailing list from Konrad Fischer.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.666
300 different people, collectors
and people who were interested in art

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.750
and overnight we were
totally known in the art world.

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:24.791
It wasn't the sort of thing
you received in the post

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.916
from most galleries at that time.

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:28.333
It had something new,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.291
it had something
very traditional about it,

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:32.250
it had something
very polite about it.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.750
It was all the things
that the art world didn't have.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:42.000
So here we are with the Red Boxers,
and each part, Postal Sculpture.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.750
And they are based
on a certain period

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:48.708
where we were
out of control in some way.

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:50.458
Here, there is one.

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:56.000
"Stillness, breathing through
our air makes us still breathe."

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.041
The Red Boxers were
really when we became quite...

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.390
unhappy, drunk,
and what do you call, political,

00:03:06.556 --> 00:03:08.833
and completely enclosed
in our rooms.

00:03:10.458 --> 00:03:14.333
Feeling the what you call
atmosphere around our bodies.

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:16.541
It’s a lot to do with the constraints

00:03:16.708 --> 00:03:18.833
of the modern life
that we felt at that time

00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:21.875
the fear of
excessive collectivism

00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:23.708
in the art world
and in general...

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:27.000
We still wanted to feel
that we could up every day

00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:29.541
and get out of bed being oneself,

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:33.958
not being citizen or subject,
but to be free and individual.

00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:42.750
May we describe to you
with picture and words,

00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:44.583
the sculpture which began...

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:49.708
on the last Saturday, misspelt,
in November 1969.

00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:53.958
We had just made some cocoa
when it began to snow...

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:58.583
We realized you cannot
just be a living sculpture alone

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.416
and leave nothing behind.

00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:04.958
So, we thought
we can leave suggestions behind,

00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:06.708
feelings behind.

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:09.791
What is that feeling

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:13.250
you get when you see the snow falling
when you weren't expecting it?

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:18.666
It's very difficult to say exactly
what that magic moment of...

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.250
It's not just the snow falling
and the unexpectedness.

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:23.291
It means all sorts
of other things.

00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:26.375
It goes from childhood and
one’s relationship with other people,

00:04:26.541 --> 00:04:29.791
Christmas cards, and events
in your life, and future and past.

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:33.875
So we positioned
ourselves at the window.

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:37.291
As we began to look,
we felt ourselves taken

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:40.333
into a sculpture
of overwhelming

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.958
purity, life and peace,
a rare and new art piece.

00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:49.291
We thank you for being
with us for these few moments.

00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:55.875
It takes me back, it feels
emotional to read it even.

00:04:56.208 --> 00:04:57.166
Extraordinary.

00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:09.208
Everything became human for us,

00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:12.708
I think that was
the art that we wanted.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.485
If you could feel pain or happy

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:18.083
or all these feelings
that are inside a person,

00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:22.250
like sexuality,
that became our art of that day.

00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:24.958
To be with art is all we ask.

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:28.541
To be human.
