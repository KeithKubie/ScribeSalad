NAOUM FARES MARAYATI:
The main way

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.870
that my Princeton
experience has shaped

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.360
me is to become in the service
of humanity -- whether it

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.180
was in my career, what
I'm doing on campus --

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.990
I really strive to be
in service of everyone.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.835
My name is Naoum Fares Marayati.

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:22.560
I go by Fares.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.520
I'm Class of 2019, and
I'm studying psychology.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.620
I'm originally
from Aleppo, Syria.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.890
I used to visit New
Jersey when I was young,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.640
and I finally settled in
North Carolina in 2012.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.270
I've always been interested
in the way humans think,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.240
the way we interact with each
other, and the way our brain

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.030
works.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.720
I took a cognitive psychology
course my freshman fall,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.190
and then took a psychology of
language course my freshman

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.780
spring.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.170
I realized that it was something
that I really enjoyed doing.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.240
It was always the first
thing that I started

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.950
reading when I came back home.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.530
I also started working
in the Baby Lab.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.300
It all just came together,
and I found my path.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.220
CASEY LEW-WILLIAMS: I
met Fares three days

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.690
before his freshman year.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.740
I was at the
undergrad expo, which

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.350
is Princeton's event
for new freshmen

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.740
where they can learn about
concentrations and apartments.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.770
And Fares came up to
the psychology table,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.300
and I introduced myself.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.480
And he said, oh, you
directed the Baby Lab.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.100
I know about your work.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.650
He also immediately
gave me the impression

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.200
that he is an
intellectual force,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.620
that he is somebody who
contributes to the community,

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.026
that he has an
enterprising spirit.

00:01:39.026 --> 00:01:41.150
And every interaction I've
had with him since then,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.980
whether in the lab or
over a meal at Forbes

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.450
College or Butler College,
has truly confirmed that.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.867
He is a gift to our lab.

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:54.700
NAOUM FARES MARAYATI:
The Princeton Baby Lab

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.920
is a group of
incredible people that

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.240
work together to study child
development and perception,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.870
more specifically the way
children acquire patterns.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.360
Babies are statistical
learning machines.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.610
They perceive the world in
such unique and amazing ways.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.430
And the lab just tries to
answer that same question

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.090
from different approaches,
based on different graduate

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.016
students that work there and
the different professors.

00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:29.160
[SINGING]

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.926
Outside of the Baby
Lab, I am a baritone

00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:36.210
for Umqombothi, Princeton's
premier African a cappella group.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.040
I am also a tutor at McGraw,
and I am a tour guide

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.064
for the University Art Museum.

00:02:43.064 --> 00:02:47.686
[SINGING]

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:50.640
I'm very involved in
Forbes, my favorite community

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.990
on campus.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.790
I'm a peer academic adviser.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.040
I served on the Forbes
College Council,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.760
and I will also be an assistant
residential college adviser

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.840
next year.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.900
Being involved in
Forbes has really

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.970
strengthened the community feel,
and Forbes has become my home

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.897
very quickly.

00:03:09.897 --> 00:03:11.730
It's very comforting
to know that at the end

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.580
of the day, when all my classes
are over, when all my work is

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.590
over, I can just go back home.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.582
Princeton has just been
surreal, and I still

00:03:20.582 --> 00:03:21.790
can't believe that I go here.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.340
But it was just an incredible
opportunity that I was given.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.006
I couldn't have done
it without the help

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:27.560
of so many people in my life.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.900
And yeah, I just rose
to the challenge.
