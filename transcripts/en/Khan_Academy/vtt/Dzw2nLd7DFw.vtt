00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.490
- [Instructor] We are told a pig runs

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.210
rightward 20 meters to eat a juicy apple.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.040
It then walks leftward five meters

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.270
to eat a nut.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.070
Finally it walks leftward

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.950
another 25 meters

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.990
to eat another nut.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.030
The total time taken by the pig

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.300
was 300 seconds.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.480
What was the pig's average velocity

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.070
and average speed over this time?

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.190
And assume rightwards is positive

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.280
and leftwards is negative

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.580
and round your answer to
two significant digits.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.500
So, pause this video
and try to work it out

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.620
on your own.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.160
All right, now let's do this together

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.520
and first let's just draw a diagram

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.180
of what is going on.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.400
So, this is our pig.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.500
It first runs rightward 20 meters,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.800
so we could say that's a
positive 20-meter displacement,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.750
so it goes plus 20 meters,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.290
ends up right over there.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.020
Then it walks leftwards five meters,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.270
so then from there

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.750
it's gonna walk leftwards five meters,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.130
so we could call that a
negative five-meter displacement

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.460
and then finally, it walks
leftward another 25 meters.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.380
So, then it walks leftward
another 25 meters,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.213
so it gets right over there,

00:01:15.213 --> 00:01:16.490
so that would be a displacement

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.869
of negative 25 meters to eat another nut,

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.850
so it ends up right over there.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.920
Now, to figure out our average velocity,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.180
let me write it down,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.060
so our velocity average

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.970
and even this is one dimensional,

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.070
it is a vector, it has direction to it.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.280
We specify the direction with the sign

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.600
positive being rightwards being positive

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.240
and leftwards being negative.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.180
You oftentimes for one-dimensional vectors

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.500
might not see an arrow there

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.490
or might not see it bolded

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.060
and just written like this.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.050
But our average velocity
is going to be equal

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.470
to, you could view it as our displacement

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.340
or our change in X

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.370
divided by how much time

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.870
has actually lapsed

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.450
and so, what is our
displacement going to be?

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.544
What's it?

00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:05.280
We have plus 20 meters

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.182
and then we have minus five meters

00:02:08.182 --> 00:02:11.620
and then we go to the
left another 25 meters,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.710
minus 25 meters

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.900
and then all of that is going
to over the elapsed change

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.800
or change in time,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.340
all of that is over 300 seconds.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.790
So, what is this numerator going to be?

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.390
This is 20 minus 30,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.240
so that's gonna be equal to negative 10,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.442
so this is equal to negative 10 meters

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:36.050
over 300 seconds.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.050
So, the average velocity

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.050
is going to be equal to
negative 1/30 meters per second,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.770
the negative specifies that on average

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.630
the velocity is towards the left.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.500
If you wanna specify this as a decimal

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.010
with two significant digits,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.130
this is going to be,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.130
so this will approximately equal to 0.033.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.430
That would be 1/30.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.807
Now let's try to tackle average speed.

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:08.880
So, our speed,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.580
R sometimes is used for speed, R for rate,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.610
our average speed

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.100
is not going to be our displacement

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.800
divided by our lapsed time,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.620
it is going to be our distance

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.630
divided by our elapsed time

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.710
and we'll see that these are
not going to be the same thing.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.210
That's one of the points of this problem,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.570
so our distance divided
by our lapsed time.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.070
So, what's our distance traveled?

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.380
Well, it's gonna be the absolute value

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.420
of each of these numbers,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.150
so it's gonna be 20 meters

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.090
plus five meters plus 25 meters.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.590
Notice, there's a difference here.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.280
We're not subtracting the five and the 25,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.820
we're just adding all of that.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.224
We just care about the magnitudes.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.260
Divided by 300 seconds

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.940
and so, this is going to
be equal to 50 meters,

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.160
over 300 seconds

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.200
which is equal to five over 30

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.050
which is equal to 1/6
of a meter per second

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.510
and if we want to write it as a decimal,

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.450
let's see, six goes into one,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.340
let's put some zeros here,

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.680
six goes into 10 one time,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.260
one times six is six,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.430
I can scroll down a little bit

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.260
and then we subtract, we get a four,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.460
six goes into 40 six times,

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.140
six times six is 36

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.120
and then we get,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.850
let me just scroll down
a little bit more again

00:04:27.858 --> 00:04:31.540
and then we get another four

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.810
and then we're just gonna
keep getting sixes over here,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.600
so this is gonna be
approximately equal to 0.1,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.380
if we want two significant digits,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.520
17 meters per second

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.450
and we are done.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.410
We figured out the average velocity

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.980
and the average speed.
