Americans and the society as a whole so

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
Americans and the society as a whole so
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.819
Americans and the society as a whole so
I think I mean I think that definition

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
I think I mean I think that definition
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.369
I think I mean I think that definition
needs to be changed I think that

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379
needs to be changed I think that
 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.220
needs to be changed I think that
attitude and idea needs more needs to be

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
attitude and idea needs more needs to be
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.720
attitude and idea needs more needs to be
blown open a bit more needs to be

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
blown open a bit more needs to be
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.830
blown open a bit more needs to be
explored and I think you see it

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
explored and I think you see it
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.219
explored and I think you see it
happening more and more of these days

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229
happening more and more of these days
 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.810
happening more and more of these days
but I still think there is this general

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
but I still think there is this general
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.030
but I still think there is this general
attitude that oh it's just this set of

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
attitude that oh it's just this set of
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980
attitude that oh it's just this set of
people it's this something like and they

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
people it's this something like and they
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.480
people it's this something like and they
all behave the same they all act the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
all behave the same they all act the
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.550
all behave the same they all act the
same they all you know and things have

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
same they all you know and things have
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.289
same they all you know and things have
changed and are changing or getting

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
changed and are changing or getting
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.399
changed and are changing or getting
better but I think there's still that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
better but I think there's still that
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.990
better but I think there's still that
attitude that needs to be attacked and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
attitude that needs to be attacked and
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.190
attitude that needs to be attacked and
blown open

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200
 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.080
I really don't like questions like that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
I really don't like questions like that
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.120
I really don't like questions like that
but I I mean because I would experience

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
but I I mean because I would experience
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.649
but I I mean because I would experience
I would describe my experience in the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
I would describe my experience in the
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.300
I would describe my experience in the
States as a person before anything else

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
States as a person before anything else
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.620
States as a person before anything else
a person who happens to be these

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
a person who happens to be these
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.789
a person who happens to be these
different things and so I know I don't

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
different things and so I know I don't
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.589
different things and so I know I don't
know that there's actually an answer to

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:42.599
know that there's actually an answer to
 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.029
know that there's actually an answer to
that question that would be fulfilling

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039
 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:57.730
so then I'm just going to skip it

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740
 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.799
