the measurement to keep track of the
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.860
the measurement to keep track of the
next two years will be LPL the likes per

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
next two years will be LPL the likes per
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.440
next two years will be LPL the likes per
line and we've seen as we've seen in the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
line and we've seen as we've seen in the
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.710
line and we've seen as we've seen in the
previous talks that for example chrome

WebGL examples from from people that
 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.630
WebGL examples from from people that
know this really well but the question

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640
know this really well but the question
 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.390
know this really well but the question
now is how do we get this into more

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400
now is how do we get this into more
 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.820
now is how do we get this into more
hands how do we get WebGL into the hands

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
hands how do we get WebGL into the hands
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920
hands how do we get WebGL into the hands

interface designers and so on how do we

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820
interface designers and so on how do we
 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.410
interface designers and so on how do we
give them the power of WebGL and the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
give them the power of WebGL and the
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.390
give them the power of WebGL and the
answer to that question is we build

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400
answer to that question is we build
 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.250
answer to that question is we build
pipelines and we design work flows

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260
pipelines and we design work flows
 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
pipelines and we design work flows
because not everyone not everyone dreams

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
because not everyone not everyone dreams
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.090
because not everyone not everyone dreams
about spending all their fried and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
about spending all their fried and
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.310
about spending all their fried and
nights with shader debugging I know it's

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320
nights with shader debugging I know it's
 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.480
nights with shader debugging I know it's
really hard to imagine those people

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
really hard to imagine those people
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.590
really hard to imagine those people
exist but they do so the first step as

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
exist but they do so the first step as
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.380
exist but they do so the first step as
we've already seen also is to get a 3d

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
we've already seen also is to get a 3d
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.410
we've already seen also is to get a 3d
engine going it takes care of all the

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420
engine going it takes care of all the
 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.390
engine going it takes care of all the
low-level WebGL stuff that we don't want

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400
low-level WebGL stuff that we don't want
 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.670
low-level WebGL stuff that we don't want
to do every time it gives us a nice API

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
to do every time it gives us a nice API
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.190
to do every time it gives us a nice API
to play with and one thing that I think

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
to play with and one thing that I think
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.780
to play with and one thing that I think
is very important when we do this is

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
is very important when we do this is
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.450
is very important when we do this is
that we try to use open web standards as

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
that we try to use open web standards as
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.610
that we try to use open web standards as
much as possible in this case it means

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620
much as possible in this case it means
 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.270
much as possible in this case it means
nothing but javascript HTML 5 and of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
nothing but javascript HTML 5 and of
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.520
nothing but javascript HTML 5 and of
course WebGL because what happens then

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
course WebGL because what happens then
 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.070
course WebGL because what happens then
is that a lot of people know JavaScript

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
is that a lot of people know JavaScript
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.740
is that a lot of people know JavaScript
and suddenly they have now had tools to

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
and suddenly they have now had tools to
 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.920
and suddenly they have now had tools to
also kind of know 3d and it also means

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
also kind of know 3d and it also means
 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.869
also kind of know 3d and it also means
that you don't have any plugins or in

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879
that you don't have any plugins or in
 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.920
that you don't have any plugins or in
downloads necessary to share your work

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930
downloads necessary to share your work
 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.250
downloads necessary to share your work
later so i want to show you this show

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260
later so i want to show you this show
 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.449
later so i want to show you this show
you some more demos so that's kind of

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459
you some more demos so that's kind of
 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.949
you some more demos so that's kind of
why we're here right so this first demo

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959
why we're here right so this first demo
 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.720
why we're here right so this first demo
can show you that not only can you

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730
can show you that not only can you
 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.789
can show you that not only can you
render cool 3d stuff you can also

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799
render cool 3d stuff you can also
 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.759
render cool 3d stuff you can also
integrate other things and it's like for

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769
integrate other things and it's like for
 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.309
integrate other things and it's like for
example video like in this case once you

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319
example video like in this case once you
 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.289
example video like in this case once you
decide to use all these open standards

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299
 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.209
the other demo I want to show is this

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:46.219
the other demo I want to show is this
 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:50.949
the other demo I want to show is this
one is something that we've seen so many

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959
one is something that we've seen so many
 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.220
one is something that we've seen so many
sliders I need more resolution Peter

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230
sliders I need more resolution Peter
 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.699
sliders I need more resolution Peter
where's the resolution oh well then oh

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709
where's the resolution oh well then oh
 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.110
where's the resolution oh well then oh
now we see the slider and I can click

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120
now we see the slider and I can click
 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.050
now we see the slider and I can click
that one sorry about that there we go

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060
that one sorry about that there we go
 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.399
that one sorry about that there we go
this is a demo of a pretty much a

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409
this is a demo of a pretty much a
 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.170
this is a demo of a pretty much a
full-fledged flight simulator of a

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180
full-fledged flight simulator of a
 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.349
full-fledged flight simulator of a
really old Swedish fighter plane those

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359
really old Swedish fighter plane those
 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.199
really old Swedish fighter plane those
exist actually it's a thing I did not

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209
exist actually it's a thing I did not
 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.319
exist actually it's a thing I did not
make that up it's this is screencast is

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329
make that up it's this is screencast is
 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.569
make that up it's this is screencast is
running in is recorded in chrome and

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579
running in is recorded in chrome and
 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.459
running in is recorded in chrome and
it's something that we've have developed

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:24.469
it's something that we've have developed
 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:26.050
it's something that we've have developed
internally while we are a gue are

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060
internally while we are a gue are
 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.819
internally while we are a gue are
building our go engine because it turns

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829
building our go engine because it turns
 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.199
building our go engine because it turns
out it's not easy to build a pipeline

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209
out it's not easy to build a pipeline
 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.699
out it's not easy to build a pipeline
and it's really hard to define a

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709
and it's really hard to define a
 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.229
and it's really hard to define a
workflow and you need people to kind of

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239
workflow and you need people to kind of
 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.129
workflow and you need people to kind of
tell you how they want it to be done so

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139
tell you how they want it to be done so
 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.869
tell you how they want it to be done so
this is what can be done of course and

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879
this is what can be done of course and
 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.369
this is what can be done of course and
it's really useful to have people in

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379
it's really useful to have people in
 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:46.089
it's really useful to have people in
house to do that kind of stuff that so

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099
house to do that kind of stuff that so
 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.059
house to do that kind of stuff that so
so that's that's great now if we have we

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069
so that's that's great now if we have we
 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.360
so that's that's great now if we have we
have a couple of different 3d 3d engines

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370
have a couple of different 3d 3d engines
 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.890
have a couple of different 3d 3d engines
and open web standards that we can use

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900
and open web standards that we can use
 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.960
and open web standards that we can use
but what do we do about the people that

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970
but what do we do about the people that
 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.689
but what do we do about the people that
don't don't want to code or don't know

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699
don't don't want to code or don't know
 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.990
don't don't want to code or don't know
how to code well the answer is again we

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000
how to code well the answer is again we
 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.119
how to code well the answer is again we
build a pipeline we build more things we

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129
build a pipeline we build more things we
 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.770
build a pipeline we build more things we
build a pipeline that's that can handle

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780
build a pipeline that's that can handle
 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.689
build a pipeline that's that can handle
things so if you have a model of a

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699
things so if you have a model of a
 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.479
things so if you have a model of a
really old Swedish fighter plane and you

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489
really old Swedish fighter plane and you
 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.249
really old Swedish fighter plane and you
want to get this online you need a way

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:12.259
want to get this online you need a way
 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:14.289
want to get this online you need a way
to do that and you need a way to do

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299
to do that and you need a way to do
 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.360
to do that and you need a way to do
things with visually without necessarily

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370
things with visually without necessarily
 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.249
things with visually without necessarily
writing code code all the time to move

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259
writing code code all the time to move
 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.140
writing code code all the time to move
things around and then of course you

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150
things around and then of course you
 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.999
things around and then of course you
want to be able to share it with as many

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.009
want to be able to share it with as many
 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.610
want to be able to share it with as many
power users as possible to get as many

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620
power users as possible to get as many
 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.790
power users as possible to get as many
likes as possible that's the whole point

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800

all this there's a Python back-end

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300
all this there's a Python back-end
 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.980
all this there's a Python back-end
running and the backend takes care of

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990
running and the backend takes care of
 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.380

exporting and importing models into a

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390
exporting and importing models into a
 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.690
exporting and importing models into a
format that the engine understands but

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700
format that the engine understands but
 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.940
format that the engine understands but
it also feels the very important part of

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950
it also feels the very important part of
 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.610

managing users and projects because in a
pipeline of course you want to play you

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120
pipeline of course you want to play you
 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.120
pipeline of course you want to play you
want a place to to do your things you

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130
want a place to to do your things you
 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.550
want a place to to do your things you
want one place to to to store all your

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560
want one place to to to store all your
 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.850
want one place to to to store all your
work so the way this works is say that

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860
work so the way this works is say that
 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.000
work so the way this works is say that
you have a a 3d model that's someone

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010
you have a a 3d model that's someone
 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.160
you have a a 3d model that's someone
built in this case and save it in an

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170
built in this case and save it in an
 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.650

colada kind of large large FBX file

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660
colada kind of large large FBX file
 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.480
colada kind of large large FBX file
format and what you can do here you see

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490
format and what you can do here you see
 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.790
format and what you can do here you see
simply if we can get all the windows to

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800
simply if we can get all the windows to
 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.430
simply if we can get all the windows to
see at the same time you can drag and

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440
see at the same time you can drag and
 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.820
see at the same time you can drag and
drop this onto the canvas and once the

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830
drop this onto the canvas and once the
 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.310
drop this onto the canvas and once the
the backend has converted this to a

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320
the backend has converted this to a
 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.730
the backend has converted this to a
model a sorry a format that the engine

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740
model a sorry a format that the engine
 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.770
model a sorry a format that the engine
understands we can start to interact

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780
understands we can start to interact
 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.580
understands we can start to interact
with it so there we go now we have this

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590
with it so there we go now we have this
 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.860
with it so there we go now we have this
3d model here and I can start start

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870
3d model here and I can start start
 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.570
3d model here and I can start start
interacting with it looks kind of creepy

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580
interacting with it looks kind of creepy
 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.680
interacting with it looks kind of creepy
right now but luckily the designers

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690
right now but luckily the designers
 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.440
right now but luckily the designers
thought of that and and put some put

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450
thought of that and and put some put
 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.850
thought of that and and put some put
some materials and textures on through

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860
some materials and textures on through
 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.310
some materials and textures on through
this so clothing for example what we can

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320
this so clothing for example what we can
 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.450
this so clothing for example what we can
do here now is do some more more

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460
do here now is do some more more
 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.860
do here now is do some more more
dragging dropping because I happen to

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870
dragging dropping because I happen to
 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.680
dragging dropping because I happen to
have textures in a standard PNG format

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690
have textures in a standard PNG format
 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.540
have textures in a standard PNG format
here so this was the clothing so let's

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550
here so this was the clothing so let's
 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.210
here so this was the clothing so let's
just actually let's do see if we can see

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220
just actually let's do see if we can see
 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.090
just actually let's do see if we can see
what happens here drag and drag and drop

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100
what happens here drag and drag and drop
 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.880
what happens here drag and drag and drop
that onto onto the model and then we can

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890
that onto onto the model and then we can
 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.610
that onto onto the model and then we can
do the same thing for for the hair there

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620
do the same thing for for the hair there
 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:36.160
do the same thing for for the hair there
we go and for the skin as well

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170
 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.940
there we go and that looks a little

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950
there we go and that looks a little
 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.630
there we go and that looks a little
better right and this interface lets us

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640
better right and this interface lets us
 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.850
better right and this interface lets us
interact with the with it and add things

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860
interact with the with it and add things
 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.340
interact with the with it and add things
like sounds and cameras and lights and

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350
like sounds and cameras and lights and
 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.290
like sounds and cameras and lights and
so on and this this model happens to

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300
so on and this this model happens to
 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.240
so on and this this model happens to
have an animation so if a pets play here

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250
have an animation so if a pets play here
 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.880
have an animation so if a pets play here
you can we can we can watch it and see

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890
you can we can we can watch it and see
 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.410
you can we can we can watch it and see
it in real time without writing any code

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:56.420

so let's try to a delight for example

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860
so let's try to a delight for example
 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.190
so let's try to a delight for example
and see what happens add light here and

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200
and see what happens add light here and
 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.350
and see what happens add light here and
we can start moving that around set some

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360
we can start moving that around set some
 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.980
we can start moving that around set some
parameters and see the scene change in

and put it on the Internet but we need
 

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.140
and put it on the Internet but we need
to think about what

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:48.150
to think about what
 

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.750

in the future and I want to talk a

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760
in the future and I want to talk a
 

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.820

it's a kind of a pipeline right you take

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:54.750
it's a kind of a pipeline right you take
 

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.590
it's a kind of a pipeline right you take
a lot of input and you get a very

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600
a lot of input and you get a very
 

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.070
a lot of input and you get a very
defined one kind of output so here's my

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080
defined one kind of output so here's my
 

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.700
defined one kind of output so here's my
invention it's the double funnel

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:03.710
invention it's the double funnel
 

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.110

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.710
between the rest based world and the
WebSocket based world is that you have

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720
WebSocket based world is that you have
 

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.600
WebSocket based world is that you have
the ability to keep this connection open

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:14.610
the ability to keep this connection open
 

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.510
the ability to keep this connection open
between your client and the server and

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:17.520
between your client and the server and
 

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.610
between your client and the server and
send these messages with extreme low

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:19.620
send these messages with extreme low
 

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.800
send these messages with extreme low

and whenever I press a button here on my
 

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.590
and whenever I press a button here on my
phone the WebSocket server passes that

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600
phone the WebSocket server passes that
 

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.430
phone the WebSocket server passes that
message to the application and we close

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440
message to the application and we close
 

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.380
message to the application and we close
this and it allows us to navigate on the

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.390
this and it allows us to navigate on the
 

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.650
this and it allows us to navigate on the
screen so a few words about this

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:48.660
screen so a few words about this
 

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.920
screen so a few words about this
communication technique originally it

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:51.930
communication technique originally it
 

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.010

web applications that we have in the
 

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.760
web applications that we have in the
world of any connected application in

00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:58.770
world of any connected application in
 

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.010
world of any connected application in
the TCP world so now you can say that

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:01.020
the TCP world so now you can say that
 

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.020
the TCP world so now you can say that
whatever app there is out there whenever

and I decided to bring mine so here i
 

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.760
and I decided to bring mine so here i
have my 3d model just look at the

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:25.770
have my 3d model just look at the
 

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.010
have my 3d model just look at the
textures here look at the reflections on

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:28.020
textures here look at the reflections on
 

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.300

so what is this we went out to toys r us

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040
so what is this we went out to toys r us
 

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.990
so what is this we went out to toys r us
and we bought a radio-controlled truck

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000
and we bought a radio-controlled truck
 

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.480
and we bought a radio-controlled truck
and after driving it around a little bit

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:41.490
and after driving it around a little bit
 

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.210
and after driving it around a little bit
in the office we said that maybe we can

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220
in the office we said that maybe we can
 

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.850
in the office we said that maybe we can
do it better so we ripped out all the

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:46.860
do it better so we ripped out all the
 

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.550
do it better so we ripped out all the
radio control functionality and we glued

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560
radio control functionality and we glued
 

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.000
radio control functionality and we glued
a credit card sized little computer onto

a credit card sized little computer onto
 

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.870
a credit card sized little computer onto
the back of the truck and what this does

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880
the back of the truck and what this does
 

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.400
the back of the truck and what this does
is it has USB ports you can attach a

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:01.410
