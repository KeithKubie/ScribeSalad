00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.174
MAN: You're trapped.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:09.743
I wouldn't mind having
toad legs tonight.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.382
But I'm not sure
if I can eat him.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:18.518
What I do notice is all
these orange little vessels

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.220
popping up on his stomach.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.056
And I know sometimes that means
it's poisonous to the animals

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.257
that eat it.

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.559
But the animals that
eat it don't cook it.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.427
So.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.061
I don't know.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.135
Man.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:39.739
Since I can't confirm whether or
not the toads are safe to eat,

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.542
little guy is free.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:43.910
Better safe than sorry always.

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:51.885
I'm thinking about hunting
anything and everything I can.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.788
If you have an opportunity
to get some valuable meat,

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.489
you have to seize it.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.091
So every morning,
I hear these ducks

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.093
landing here on this bend.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.561
They float down the
river a little bit,

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.797
flapping their wings,
making all this commotion.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.800
And so, trying to figure out
a way to get one of those.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.803
But I can't just shoot
my arrows into the water.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.005
What I'm going to
try and do is I'm

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:16.976
going to attach some
paracord to my arrow

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.545
and see if I can
shoot and retrieve it.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.384
Instead of using the
whole heavy paracord,

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:27.420
and pull out all these
inner filaments and tie them

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.723
end to end will be much lighter.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.526
I think I might have the least
practical knowledge of anybody

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:34.894
here.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.729
These aren't things that I've
been practicing all my life,

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.199
or even things I've
gone to school for.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.434
I'm kind of like an
ad hoc survivalist.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.635
I have an idea.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.504
I see something that
needs to be done.

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.474
And then I try and
fabricate a means to do it.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:48.541
All right.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.642
So there it is.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.277
I've laid all my
line out, and then

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:55.348
brought it all the way back and
secured it to my leg, you know,

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:56.883
to anchor it obviously.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.818
Going to take this
down to the water.

00:01:58.818 --> 00:01:59.552
I'll give it a try.

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.757
I haven't eaten
anything yet today.

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:08.661
I'm hungry, but I'm worried
that I missed my window.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:12.932
They usually land up there,
float all the way down here.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.806
And they've done that
two or three times a day

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:20.740
and nothing now.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.710
So I've got all
my line laid out.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.681
Just going to sit here and wait.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.017
I know there's supposed to be a
lot of grouse and other ground

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:31.851
birds around here.

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:32.785
Some tarmigan.

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:35.154
So I'm hoping to
spot some of them.

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:36.589
My plan is to set some traps.

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.392
I know that there are all
types of weasels and badgers

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.527
that run around here.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:43.096
So my game is to stand
out as many as I can

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:46.232
and hopefully get
something to bite.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:49.702
Oh [bleep].

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.671
at this.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.373
Freaking deer floating
down the river.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:01.314
Got to get it, I got to
get it, I got to get it.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:08.955
Oh, I see you.

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:09.956
You're still sitting there.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:11.257
You're stuck.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:14.661
You can't hide.

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:17.330
[bleep] Skimmed its back.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.900
You're sitting like a
freaking deer target.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.501
I can do this.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.204
Right over his neck.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:31.678
[bleep] It's taking off.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:35.515
Damn.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.624
It's heartbreaking that I wasn't
able to bring down that deer.

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:45.825
Could have smoked it all.

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:50.129
I could have made that
deer last a month.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.134
You know, so it just
leads me now to have to,

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.369
you know, I've
decided that I need

00:03:56.369 --> 00:04:01.874
to tap deeper into my
resolve and determination.

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:10.717
I've emerged with a new idea.

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:14.053
Just a new method of
going about things.

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:17.557
Every time I catch a fish, I'm
using the entrails for traps.

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:20.193
Every time I go for
walks, I'm setting snares.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.861
I go for too many
walks and I don't

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:23.663
do these things when I'm
passing all the areas

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:25.131
that I should be doing them.

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:28.868
And me getting that free meal
that just left me so easily

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.937
leads me to believe that I
need to be out here doing

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.505
a whole lot more.

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.308
I need to conquer the land a
little bit more than I have.

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:36.809
I've been slowly traversing it.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.611
I need to be stomping
it and taking it over.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.017
So that's what I'm going to do.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.325
He agrees.
