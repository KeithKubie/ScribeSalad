00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.080
Go back a hundred... no, no, no! A hundred twenty years. A hundred twenty years ago,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.280
you want to do adding and subtracting, well...

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.560
you'll do long adding and substracting.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.160
If you were really clever,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.420
and you were really rich,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.900
you would have a French Arithomether.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.560
But, if you really wanted to do a lot of arithmethic,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.860
You were kinda stuck.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.240
Hans Egli, 1894, 1895, Switzerland,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.500
came up with an absolutely wonderful device: a calculator... called the millionaire.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:48.280
I'll not only add; it'll multiply, it'll divide... It'll even subtract! So it's a four-function calculator!

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.420
It has handles on either side. I can lift this up...

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.980
[Laughing] Just...

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.280
...And it only weighs 60 or 70 pounds!

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:08.720
A portable calculator smaller than a piano! You can't get cooler than that. Let's try to just... add 3.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.300
Crank this around once...

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.860
Errrrup!

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.700
Three once.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.360
This three... again.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.620
3 plus 3 is 6.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.940
Again... 9! And then 12!

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.960
15... 18... 21...

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.380
Okay, so every time I want to add a number, I crank this around once!

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.420
I crank it around once. Every time I want to add.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.220
Let's try something slightly more complex.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:52.300
Let's set this to fourteen-million, six-hundred... five... three... one.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:00.020
So this is fourteen-million, six-hundred thirty-seven thousand, five-hundred thirty-one.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:10.300
Okay. I'll add this once. Okay, the answer is fourteen-million, six-hundred thirty-seven thousand, five-hundred thirty-one

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.660
Again! This number plus itself: Twenty-nine million, two-hundred seventy-five thousand, sixty-two.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.340
Again... So, each time I add this, I've now multiplied this by three.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:35.080
Fourteen-million, six-hundred thirty-seven thousand, five-hundred thirty-one times three is: 43,912,593

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:45.160
Not bad! It adds, and by successive addition, I can just crank around, add one more time, add again, and go... oh yeah!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:00.240
Yeah, big deal. The cool thing, the absolute wonderful thing about the Millionaire Machine is it has one-crank-multiplication.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.500
I can multiply a big number by a single digit in one turn.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:17.720
Let's do a reset. I'll set to multiply. So I'll multiply this big number - instead of by one - by seven.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.200
Seven times this number will wind up down here.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.580
Crank it around one time - one single crank!

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:43.580
This big number, 14,637,531 times 7 is 102,462,717.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.100
But watch this: Instead of multiplying by 7, let's multiply by 74.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.640
One turn! One turn!

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:05.680
Now, let's multiply this big number times 749!

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.160
We should pick up a 9 over here. One turn! Errrrup!

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:22.460
14 million blah-blah-blah times 749 is 10,963,510,719.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.880
So, we're already into the billions. Let's multiply once more by 6.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.160
Single turn.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:58.900
14,637,531 times 7,496 is 109,722,932,376. All that multiplying required just four turns of this!

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:07.520
Because this Millionaire has - built into it - a read-only memory that knows the multiply tables!

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.860
It knows that 7 times 2 is 14

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.820
This thing knows that 1 times 7 is 7

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.060
It knows that … 8 times 4 is … err … 32?

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.580
Brady, can I take you upstairs?

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.400
Brady says it's ok for me to show you the read-only memory. Come over here. Come here, come here, come here.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.900
Ok guys, I actually have two of these.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.620
This one I'm reparing. Boy, there's a lot to fix inside.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.680
This is the multiply-unit.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:51.720
All milled by hand out of brass. Along here is the
read- only memory is the multiply table put in

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.490
brass it'll multiply any one digit. Essentially, it knows that zero times

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.210
anything is zero, it knows that one times
anything is itself, all the way up to nine.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:13.750
It knows its tables from 0 to 9. It knows the 9s table, 
here's the 0 table 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all the way up to 9.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:21.919
So, maybe I can show this. By bringing this
over here and turning this you'll see

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:27.819
these levers engage with the table.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.319
Right now if I want to multiply by zero
you'll notice nothing engages with this.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.480
Multiplying by 1.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.340
Multiplying by 2.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.240
Let's multiply by 9, crank this all the way over here,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:07.620
and the bottom row of fingers will push along here and

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:15.700
register nine times each of these digits to bring them down into the results table.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.500
Absolutely amazing! I'm blown away!

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:30.660
In Switzerland, a hundred-twenty years ago, people had the smarts to figure out how to build the

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:37.849
predecessor to today's computers. I got
two of them about 35 years ago, 38 years ago

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:42.960
in Buffalo New York, a bank was closing up, I was at the auction

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.060
I paid a good penny for this, it was
considered to be worth its weight in brass.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.440
Yep, I paid $75 for it, which was about
how much the brass was worth.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.900
I made it even more portable by mounting it on wheels, so that I can close it up

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:10.880
and take it wherever I wish. Next time I
need to multiply, add, subtract, or divide

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:14.769
I know just how to go to.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:25.639
Now the cost of this is the chiropractic
bills of carrying it. Whatever it's worth on eBay

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:32.039
would be subtracted by the shipping
costs of something that weighs 50/75/100 pounds.
