00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.789
In today's video,

00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.300
we're taking a classic build,
the mini metal foundry,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.900
and we're scaling it way down
to a desktop version,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.700
the micro metal foundry.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.440
[Music]

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.240
Guys, in the past,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.600
you've seen both Grant
and Nate build

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.305
different types of foundries.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:22.658
But today, Nate has found a way
to make that even smaller,

00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:23.900
the micro metal foundry.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.449
That's right.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.849
Sometimes, you don't need
to melt a lot of aluminum,

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.600
you just need
little bits at a time.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.240
And so for that,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.313
we are going to build
an entire foundry

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.280
in this tiny little bucket.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.000
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.320
Using plaster and sand,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.620
we'll make a fire resistant
shell inside of a small bucket.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.500
We'll then build
a propane jet nozzle

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.700
that can heat up the inside

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.800
of our foundry hot
enough to melt aluminum.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.056
And we got this bucket
for two dollars at Hobby Lobby.

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:49.056
There are similar versions
at most craft stores,

00:00:49.056 --> 00:00:51.100
and that's the first thing
we're going to need is

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.900
a little bucket.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.200
Next thing we need

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.900
is this little stainless steel
coffee scoot those from Walmart,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.290
and this was also
about two dollars,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.900
and this is going
to be used for two things.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.589
First, we're going
to use it for measuring,

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.880
and then it's actually
going to become the crucible

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.150
inside the foundry.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.200
To start our build,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.100
we're also going to need a cup
and a spoon just for mixing,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.832
some water,

00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:11.000
some Plaster of Paris
and playground sand.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.930
We need to fill this bucket
about 65% to 75% of the way.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.082
So what we're going to do is
two batches of plaster, sand,

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:21.200
and water mixed up.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.980
So we need four scoops
of plaster, four scoops of sand,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.020
and three scoops of water.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.040
[Music]

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.000
Mix those three ingredients
together thoroughly,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.107
being sure to get all

00:01:38.107 --> 00:01:40.257
of the plaster off
of the bottom of the cup.

00:01:40.257 --> 00:01:42.557
Now, you have a little bit
of time to mix here,

00:01:42.557 --> 00:01:44.800
but as soon as you start
feeling this warm-up,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.868
that's the plaster
reacting to the water,

00:01:46.868 --> 00:01:49.300
and that lets you know
that you gotta move fast.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.400
This small quantities
with the sand,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.649
you've got a few minutes,

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.800
but it is something you
need to be aware of.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.320
Once it's all stirred in,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.900
pour it into the bucket
and then mix up a second batch.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.000
If you have really big cups,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.909
you can do this all at once
with eight scoops of plaster,

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.000
eight scoops of sand,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.500
and six scoops of water.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.060
[Music]

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.080
Okay, our bucket is now
about two-thirds full.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.640
We do want to try and get out
all of the air bubbles we can,

00:02:19.643 --> 00:02:21.490
so it's good to take
a minute or two,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.800
and just tap the bucket
to sort of vibrate it,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.538
and get as much air out
as you can.

00:02:25.538 --> 00:02:26.050
All right.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.500
Our de-bubbled, degassed
plaster is about ready.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.780
So now, we're going
to take our plastic cup,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.740
and we're going to drop
this down into the center.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.720
The water is in
there to add weight.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.100
So all of this is going
to displace the plaster,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.600
and it's gonna make
a nice border around this cup.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.160
So I'm going to put this down,
and try and position just right.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.150
Calli's going to use
the tape to tape the cup

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.500
in place to just hold it right
where we want it.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.480
[Music]

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.000
With your cup full of water
taped in place inside the plaster,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.595
you'll want to give
it at least an hour,

00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:57.388
possibly more depending
on the temperature

00:02:57.388 --> 00:02:59.240
and humidity of where you are.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.400
If you want it to speed
up a little bit,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.100
you can also throw it in
the oven on the lowest setting

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.180
for an hour or so.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.089
While that's curing,

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:07.000
we're going to work
on building the burner.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.400
The burner for this foundry

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.339
isn't going to use one
of the large propane tanks.

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:12.200
We're actually just going
to use the small ones,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.700
either the blue ones
or the green camping version.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.124
First thing we're going
to need is a torch head

00:03:17.124 --> 00:03:18.600
that goes to a propane tank.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600
This is the kind
of just threads right on.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.612
And normally, you can just
use this as a torch.

00:03:23.612 --> 00:03:24.495
However, this,

00:03:24.495 --> 00:03:27.942
while it is pretty hot,
isn't quite the volume of fire

00:03:27.942 --> 00:03:30.972
that we want, and it's
definitely hard to place.

00:03:30.972 --> 00:03:33.100
With these types
of propane tanks,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.660
if you turn them
upside down or anything

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.815
to get this nozzle,right
where we would want it,

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:38.600
they do have a tendency
to start flickering

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.977
and sputtering after a while.

00:03:39.977 --> 00:03:42.400
And so, we are going to hook
up a whole little hose,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.600
and build ourselves
a customized burner.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.800
We've got some thread tape,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.260
a 1/4 inch or 6 millimeter
wire welding contact tip.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.350
These things are removable.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.300
They're replaceable,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.864
and they have just
this wonderful sized hole

00:03:55.864 --> 00:03:56.700
as the nozzle.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.940
We have a 1/2 inch
to 1/4 coupling.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.440
This is some steel pipe.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.000
Got four of these
socket cap screws.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.804
They have the hex head in them,

00:04:05.804 --> 00:04:07.900
and they are
machine threaded screws.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.160
This is a number
8 by 32 threads.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.400
And this one is 3/4
of an inch long.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.180
We have a 1/4 inch
brass pipe cap.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.000
We have a 1/4 inch
to barbed fitting,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.100
and a 3 inch segments
of 1/4 inch pipe.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.298
And lastly, we've got
about a three-foot segment

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:28.000
of 3/4 inch braided hose.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.940
This is what's actually going
to carry our propane

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.400
from the tank down
into our burner.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.920
So our first step is going
to be the take our coupling,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.570
file it down,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.190
and drill and tap it
so that our screws fit in.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.644
We're filing this down

00:04:39.644 --> 00:04:42.800
because trying to drill right
into the side of a curved pipe

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.700
is pretty impossible.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.760
At least accurately.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.760
[Music]

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.800
We've now had the four sides
of this coupling filed down,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.244
and they aren't being all
filed down in the same places.

00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:56.829
We've got two that are going
to be right here at the top,

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:59.600
and the ones on the sides are
going to be a little bit lower.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.400
Now, in each
of those four spots,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.600
we need to drill a hole
using a 9/64 inch drill bit.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.600
Once the holes are drilled using
8x32 tap to add some threads.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.100
[Music]

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.319
We've now got all four holes
drilled and tapped,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.900
so that we can thread
our screws into them.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.000
We now need to do the same
drilling and tapping process

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.094
with our brass cap,

00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:24.800
so that our contacts tip
will thread into that.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.020
With a 3/16 inch drill bit,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.234
we want to drill a hole
as close to the center

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.980
as possible into our brass cap.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.900
This time, we're going
to be using an M6 by 1.0 tap.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.100
Now, this contact tip threads
beautifully into the threads

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.000
that we just cut.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.300
So we have all of our pieces,
it's time for assembly.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.560
[Music]

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.400
With the thread tape,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.511
this should form
a pretty tight seal.

00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:55.100
It was a little bit
on the loose side before,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.060
but now, it goes in

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.000
and it shouldn't let
any gases escape.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.300
That's what's important.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.700
And now, we need to take
the four screws,

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.900
and fit them into the sides,

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.535
and have them hold
everything in place.

00:06:05.535 --> 00:06:06.785
The four screws are going

00:06:06.785 --> 00:06:09.200
to grip onto the contact tip
to hold everything in place.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.580
So the contact tip fits down
through all four of those,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.700
and then once it's in place,

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.100
we want to tighten
these four screws by hand.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.600
Make sure that
doesn't go anywhere.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.353
Once we've got it lined up,
we want to take an allen wrench,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.180
and just tighten those screws
down to really hold it in place.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.480
[Music]

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.920
That's now holding itself
in place quite nicely.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.880
Just what we're looking for.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.000
On the other side
of this coupling,

00:06:35.012 --> 00:06:38.000
we're going to attach our 3
inch piece of 1/4 inch pipe.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.680
[Music]

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.800
We now need to attach the hose

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.180
from the propane tank
on to our burner.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.600
We need to modify this
so it can attach to the hose,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.600
and so it has
a higher propane output.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.700
First Step, we're just going
to unscrew this top diffuser.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.413
As this nozzle is,

00:06:59.413 --> 00:07:01.100
when you attach it
to a propane tank,

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.180
it lets out just the tiny
tiniest amount of propane.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.395
You can't even see the hole
where the propane's coming out.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.800
It's that fine.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.020
Right in the center there,

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.100
there's just tiny bits
of corrosion on the brass,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.400
and that's enough
to just entirely hide it.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.700
[Music]

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.440
There you go.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.840
If I turn that up
even the tiniest bit,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.080
it's going to go out.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.320
We need to widen that nozzle.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.058
We're going to use

00:07:25.058 --> 00:07:28.300
the smallest size drill bit
that comes with our drill set,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.400
which is 1/16 of an inch.

00:07:30.777 --> 00:07:32.470
If you drill this out,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.500
it'll work for your
micro metal foundry,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.400
but it will not work for
regular propane torch anymore.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.980
[Music]

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.200
[inaudible].

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.500
To attach the hose onto this,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.440
it already has threads,
and we're going to use them.

00:07:48.447 --> 00:07:50.208
First, what we need
to do is make the hose

00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:51.415
a little bit more pliable.

00:07:51.415 --> 00:07:52.900
So we're going
to take a lighter,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.007
and slowly warm it up

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:56.096
so that it can fit right
on these threads.

00:07:56.096 --> 00:07:57.930
We'll have to push
and twist this on,

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.240
it should work pretty nicely.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.180
[Music]

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:01.920
Here we go.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.495
That's a good seal.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.460
Hose attached.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.300
On the other side,

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.999
we're just going
to be using the barbed,

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:07.100
and that just fits in.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.680
All right, so now,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.660
we should be able to attach this
to our propane tank,

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.900
attached that onto the burner
we've just built.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.700
Hopefully, we'll get
a nice ignition.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:26.800
[Music]

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.100
Our burner is built and attaches
to our propane tank,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.050
so let's get back to finishing
up our plaster filled bucket,

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:33.900
and turning this all
into a foundry.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.824
The plaster is largely set.

00:08:35.824 --> 00:08:37.674
It's not a 100% cured yet,

00:08:37.674 --> 00:08:41.680
but it's definitely set enough
that we can take this off.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.220
I'm just gonna pour
out the water here.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.560
All right, so now we should
be able to collapse this cup,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.120
just like Grant did
in the larger version.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.660
Use sort of a twisting,

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.760
squeeze all the
cup down smaller.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.380
[Music]

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.500
There it goes.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.560
We now want to use a hole saw

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.348
to make a hole
in the side of our bucket.

00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:09.264
Just large enough

00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:11.500
for the nozzle
of our burner to fit in.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.380
Our goal is to keep it as low
down as possible in the bucket,

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.580
but not so low that
when we're using the whole saw,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.360
it's going to cut
into the bottom.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.420
[Music]

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.140
All right.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.700
With our plaster
cured this much, it's,

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.800
like I was saying,
it's not cured all the way,

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.472
but it was cured some.

00:09:28.472 --> 00:09:31.210
It's extremely easy
to drill through.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:36.840
[Music]

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.660
See what this looks like.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.411
World's tiniest foundry?

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.560
There you go.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.740
Tiny little foundry
with a powerful gas jet.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.900
Do we have any marshmallows?

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:54.500
[Music]

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.100
It's almost the size
of a jumbo marshmallow.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.400
Here, I made this for you.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.320
Thank you.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.720
Mmm.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.000
Taste like a drill.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.380
Now, while our burner does work
inside our foundry at this point,

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.400
we really want to make sure

00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:10.284
that the plaster gets
all the way dry

00:10:10.284 --> 00:10:12.139
before we really
use it for anything.

00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:14.435
So you can just let it sit
for a day or two,

00:10:14.435 --> 00:10:17.800
but what I recommend is putting
in the oven at about 200 degrees

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.060
for two hours,

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.660
and then at about 450 degrees
for another three hours.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.400
That should really bake it dry.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.200
So plaster,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.061
while you're using it
and while it's drying,

00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:28.100
has a tendency to crack,

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.048
which is one of the reasons
that we tapped all

00:10:30.048 --> 00:10:31.551
of the bubbles
out of it beforehand.

00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:32.266
If you're worried

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:34.335
about the longevity
of your micro metal foundry,

00:10:34.335 --> 00:10:36.800
you can also use Grant's trick
of tearing up a little bit

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.017
of course steel wool,

00:10:38.017 --> 00:10:39.900
and mixing it in with the slurry

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.900
before you cast it
into the bucket.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.900
It kind of acts like mini rebar.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.772
You may also notice

00:10:44.772 --> 00:10:46.700
that our propane tank
is sitting in a bowl,

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.900
and that's because
these propane tanks

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.100
with the nozzle
opened up extra wide,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.700
as they depressurize quickly,

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.760
they tend to cool
down quite a bit,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.900
and once they get too cold,

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.100
the propane inside them
doesn't exit as quickly,

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.100
and you end up having keeping
your flame consistent.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.260
So this is just a bowl
of lukewarm water,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.900
and our propane tank
is just sitting in it,

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.000
and that will help prevent it
from freezing up too fast

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.900
as we let it burn.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.980
Now, we're going to go ahead
and take our scoop,

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.264
and turn it into our crucible.

00:11:11.264 --> 00:11:13.249
We were going to do
that is take this handle,

00:11:13.249 --> 00:11:15.100
bend it over so we
have something to raise

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.590
and lower it out of the foundry.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:22.240
[Music]

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.020
This now fits nicely
into our foundry,

00:11:24.023 --> 00:11:26.200
but it actually just
goes too far down in.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.146
We don't want it resting
quite at the bottom,

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.886
because it won't get
the fire circulating

00:11:29.886 --> 00:11:31.152
around it as well as we want.

00:11:31.152 --> 00:11:32.900
So we're also going
to use a little bit

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.660
of hanger wire to build a stand.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.700
The hanger wire
is made of steel,

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.651
so we shouldn't have
to worry about it melting.

00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:38.504
Although the coating

00:11:38.504 --> 00:11:40.600
will burn off the first time
you put it in there,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.100
but that will just hold
our crucible right at the height

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.940
that we wanted.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.360
[Music]

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.360
Yay, it fits.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.190
A little stand
that goes down inside.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.600
Our crucible sits
right on top of that.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.300
We are ready to test out
our micro metal foundry.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.900
There's a couple things
we need to do.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.300
First is we probably
want to set this on

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.800
like a piece of brick
or stone or something.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.000
It doesn't conduct
a lot of heat down,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.700
but we still wouldn't want
to put it on a wooden surface.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.000
The other is, of course,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.200
that we need some aluminum
to try and melt down.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.440
I think we're going to try
using some soda tabs.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.720
[Music]

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.460
That right there is the coating
on the hanger catching on fire.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.460
Now, let's let this run, and see
if we can help these tabs.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:30.040
[Music]

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.900
All right, our aluminum
is nice and molten.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.000
So I'm going to take it
out of the foundry,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.800
and then we've got,

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.140
I made this tiny little
sword shape mold.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.380
There are a few other things
that we might be able to try,

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.100
but we're going to start
with the sword one.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.800
Now, aluminum is a very
lightweight metal as you know,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.900
and with this little of it,

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.050
it doesn't have a lot
of weight to push down

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:52.000
and force it to flow.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.400
So my plan is to pour it on,

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.600
and then use the wire to try
and encourage it

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.900
into the shape that we want.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.300
We'll give this a shot.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:05.300
[Music]

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.060
Hey!

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.340
You made a very
tiny aluminum sword.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.990
There's a sword shape in there.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.690
We may have over poured
the aluminum just a little bit,

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.200
but it need some encouragement,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.446
but that flowed
into the general shape there.

00:13:16.446 --> 00:13:19.000
We made some aluminum
with our micro metal foundry,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.543
and now, I've got some Orbeez
that are not fully expanded.

00:13:21.543 --> 00:13:22.597
So they are also little,

00:13:22.597 --> 00:13:25.144
and we're going to now pour
the aluminum into those Orbeez,

00:13:25.144 --> 00:13:26.330
and see what result we get.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:26.980
Here it goes.

this is cool down all the way.
