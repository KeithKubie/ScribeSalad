00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:02.679
Voiceover:In the last video,

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:04.121
we were able to model the average

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:05.959
high temperature in Santiago, Chile

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:07.583
as a function of days

00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:09.055
as we go through the year,

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:10.367
where the days were the days

00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:11.279
after January 7th,

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:12.511
so this right over here.

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.768
Day zero is actually January 7th.

00:00:14.768 --> 00:00:16.079
But we weren't done.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:16.930
They want us to figure out

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.599
how many days after January 7th

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.384
is the first spring day,

00:00:20.384 --> 00:00:21.583
when the temperature reaches

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:23.087
20 degrees celsius

00:00:23.087 --> 00:00:24.087
And I told you, be careful.

00:00:24.087 --> 00:00:25.128
Pay attention to this whole notion

00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:26.623
of the first spring day

00:00:26.623 --> 00:00:28.223
and the reason is because there's actually

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:30.287
two days where the temperature reaches

00:00:30.287 --> 00:00:31.415
20 degrees celsius,

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:32.831
So let's say this is 20 degrees celsius

00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:34.223
right over here,

00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:36.591
notice you have this day right over here

00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:39.807
and then you have this
day right over there

00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:41.935
and which one is in the spring

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:43.463
or the first spring day?

00:00:43.463 --> 00:00:44.959
Well, if this is -

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:47.895
we're in summer right over here

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:50.815
We're in the southern hemisphere,

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:52.135
so our summer is going to be

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.887
when it is the winter

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.095
in the northern hemisphere.

00:00:55.095 --> 00:00:56.703
Summer, what season comes after summer?

00:00:56.703 --> 00:00:58.647
Well, this is going to be the fall,

00:00:58.647 --> 00:01:00.959
this is going to be the winter,

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:03.303
Now this is going to be the spring.

00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:06.207
Of course, you go back to summer.

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:08.103
So, we want this value,

00:01:08.103 --> 00:01:09.479
not this value.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.199
This one will be the day in fall

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:12.399
when the average high temperature

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:13.711
is 20 degrees celsius,

00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:14.991
This is the first day of spring

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:16.559
where the average high temperature

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:19.839
is 20 degrees celsius.

00:01:19.839 --> 00:01:21.784
The first spring day.

00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:23.151
I guess it's not necessarily
the first spring day,

00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:24.439
it's the first spring day

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.599
where the temperature
reaches 20 degrees celsius.

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:30.687
So, this is happening in the spring,

00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:33.015
so this is the value we want.

00:01:33.015 --> 00:01:34.311
So, let's just think about that.

00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:35.983
As we try to manipulate this a little bit.

00:01:35.983 --> 00:01:39.431
So, we want to get to 20 degrees celsius,

00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:41.591
so we could write 20 is equal to

00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:52.575
7.5 times cosine of 2 pi over 365

00:01:52.575 --> 00:01:56.999
times the days,

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:00.951
plus 21.5

00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:03.663
Now, we could subtract
21.5 from both sides

00:02:03.663 --> 00:02:07.215
and we get -1.5 is equal to-

00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:09.255
and I'll just copy and paste all of this-

00:02:09.255 --> 00:02:11.639
is going to be equal to that.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.255
So, copy and paste.

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:17.663
It's going to be equal
to that right over there.

00:02:17.663 --> 00:02:20.407
Now I could divide both sides by 7.5.

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:21.967
Notice, I'm trying to solve for cosine,

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:23.527
and eventually solve for D,

00:02:23.527 --> 00:02:24.855
but we're going to take a pause,

00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:27.031
once we have this in terms of cosine,

00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:28.159
we have to be careful here.

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.007
So we're going to divide both sides by 7.5

00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:33.687
And we're going to get, let's see...

00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:35.223
Actually, I don't even need
a calculator for this..

00:02:35.223 --> 00:02:36.407
1.5 divided by 7 -

00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:37.562
this is one fifth.

00:02:37.562 --> 00:02:41.103
5 times 15, or 5 times 1.5 is 7.5

00:02:41.103 --> 00:02:43.287
so this is -1/5

00:02:43.287 --> 00:02:51.527
or I could write it as -0.2 is equal to

00:02:51.527 --> 00:03:00.751
cosine of 2 pi over 365
times days after January 7th.

00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:05.247
Now, this is where we
have to be very careful

00:03:05.247 --> 00:03:06.895
instead of just blindly applying

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.359
the inverse cosine function,

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.407
we have to make sure which angle

00:03:10.407 --> 00:03:11.807
we are actually getting.

00:03:11.807 --> 00:03:14.111
That we're getting the
right angle over here.

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.234
'Cause remember, we want the argument

00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:17.231
to the cosine,

00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:18.559
that doesn't give us this point,

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:20.391
that gives us this point right here.

00:03:20.391 --> 00:03:23.167
Or that corresponds to this
point right over there.

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:26.295
So let's draw a unit circle,

00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:28.551
just to make sure we know what's going on.

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:30.967
And I actually do this all the time,

00:03:30.967 --> 00:03:32.335
especially if I'm trying to apply

00:03:32.335 --> 00:03:34.743
the inverse trigonometric functions

00:03:34.743 --> 00:03:37.039
in a kind of applied context,

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:40.407
where I just can't blindly plug it in

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:42.391
to my calculator.

00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:44.663
So, let me draw a unit
circle right over here.

00:03:44.663 --> 00:03:46.991
X-axis, y-axis...

00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:55.079
Circle of radius 1, centered at the origin

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.319
You get the picture

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.871
we've done this many times before.

00:03:59.871 --> 00:04:02.303
And January 7th, that corresponds

00:04:02.303 --> 00:04:04.831
to this point right over here.

00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:06.823
That's that point right over here,

00:04:06.823 --> 00:04:10.951
that we are in the summer.

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:12.815
Then, as the days go by,

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:15.183
our argument to the cosine increases,

00:04:15.183 --> 00:04:16.911
the angle increases,

00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:18.703
and this right over here

00:04:18.703 --> 00:04:21.103
will be the fall.

00:04:21.103 --> 00:04:22.991
So, this point right over here,

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:25.903
so we're at the fall right over here.

00:04:25.903 --> 00:04:28.471
And then we move on to the winter

00:04:28.471 --> 00:04:31.735
right over there.

00:04:31.735 --> 00:04:36.439
And then finally, we go to the spring.

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.703
This is the spring right over there.

00:04:39.703 --> 00:04:43.831
And we want the angle that gets us -0.2

00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:45.903
So, this is -1.

00:04:45.903 --> 00:04:49.543
-0.2 is a fifth of the way,

00:04:49.543 --> 00:04:53.263
so it's -0.2 and notice,

00:04:53.263 --> 00:04:55.471
there's two angles that get us there.

00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:57.487
There's this angle,

00:04:57.487 --> 00:05:01.071
there's that angle right over there.

00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:03.343
And then there's also,

00:05:03.343 --> 00:05:05.063
let me draw a little dotted line here,

00:05:05.063 --> 00:05:06.607
there's that angle.

00:05:06.607 --> 00:05:10.039
But then there's also this angle.

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.239
which is going even further.

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:15.639
Or another way you could think about it,

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.959
you could go backwards
to get to that angle

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:20.175
and then if you wanted
to go all the way around,

00:05:20.175 --> 00:05:21.055
to the next spring,

00:05:21.055 --> 00:05:23.327
you could add 2 pi to it.

00:05:23.327 --> 00:05:24.383
So which one do we want?

00:05:24.383 --> 00:05:26.631
Of course, we want the one in the spring.

00:05:26.631 --> 00:05:29.751
But if we just blindly
apply the inverse cosine,

00:05:29.751 --> 00:05:36.583
of -0.2, that's going to give us this one.

00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:39.625
And we can verify that. So, let's see...

00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:47.663
Inverse cosine of -0.2 is 1.77.

00:05:47.663 --> 00:05:48.895
Remember, this is zero,

00:05:48.895 --> 00:05:52.887
this is pi right over, so this is 3.14159,

00:05:52.887 --> 00:05:55.039
and this is 1.77,

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.463
so notice it's a little
bit more than half of pi

00:05:57.463 --> 00:05:58.847
which is exactly what it gave-

00:05:58.847 --> 00:06:00.991
it gave this angle right over here.

00:06:00.991 --> 00:06:06.007
So this is approximately 1.77 radiants

00:06:06.007 --> 00:06:09.015
is this angle, is that
angle right over there.

00:06:09.015 --> 00:06:10.479
But we don't want that one,

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:11.647
we want this one,

00:06:11.647 --> 00:06:13.127
so how do we figure that out?

00:06:13.127 --> 00:06:14.215
Well, we could view it as,

00:06:14.215 --> 00:06:17.079
we could go all the way around to 2 pi,

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:21.455
and then subtract 1.77,

00:06:21.455 --> 00:06:26.351
so we could say 2 pi minus 1.77 roughly

00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:28.039
to get this angle, so let's do that.

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:35.495
Let's take 2 times pi,

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.783
and then subtract this number

00:06:37.783 --> 00:06:39.615
and I'm going to do second answer,

00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:42.335
so answer is just the
previous answer that I got

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.271
so that way I have good precision here.

00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:48.031
So I get 4.511,

00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:50.815
and we can kind of make
sure that is the right thing

00:06:50.815 --> 00:06:52.039
because that's going to be between

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:53.983
pi and 2 pi.

00:06:53.983 --> 00:06:56.690
2 pi is 2 times 3.14159,
so it's going to be

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.471
6.28 something.

00:06:58.471 --> 00:07:00.471
This is 3.14159,

00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:02.471
this is the right angle.

00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:03.447
Now, we're not done yet.

00:07:03.447 --> 00:07:04.271
That's just the angle,

00:07:04.271 --> 00:07:05.863
that's the argument that we need to give

00:07:05.863 --> 00:07:07.903
in here to get to that point,

00:07:07.903 --> 00:07:10.423
but what's the days going to be.

00:07:10.423 --> 00:07:13.519
Well 2 pi over 365 days is going to be

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:16.359
equal to this number 4.511,

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:18.447
so let me write that down.

00:07:18.447 --> 00:07:20.495
So, this right over here is going to be

00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:24.615
approximately equal to 4.511.

00:07:24.615 --> 00:07:26.071
So, we scroll down a little bit

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:29.783
We can say 2 pi over 365

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:33.423
times the days after January 7th

00:07:33.423 --> 00:07:40.375
is approximately going
to be equal to 4.511

00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:41.783
to solve for days,

00:07:41.783 --> 00:07:43.207
we can just multiply both sides

00:07:43.207 --> 00:07:45.391
by the reciprocal of the coefficient,

00:07:45.391 --> 00:07:47.047
so we're going to multiply both sides

00:07:47.047 --> 00:07:50.783
by 365 over 2 pi.

00:07:50.783 --> 00:07:51.711
So that's going to cancel,

00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:55.063
and now we can use our
calculator for this.

00:07:55.063 --> 00:07:58.559
So, we've got much better precision there.

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:00.175
So let's take our previous answer,

00:08:00.175 --> 00:08:03.335
times 365, we deserve a drumroll here...

00:08:03.335 --> 00:08:09.319
Divided by 2 pi, and we get

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:11.575
if we round to the nearest day

00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:16.487
262 days after January 7th.

00:08:16.487 --> 00:08:20.487
So 262 days. and we are done.
