00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
Winter break?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.040
Who needs breaks?

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.980
In America, we work until our
hearts give out, literally.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.360
Hey everyone, Laci
Green here for DNews.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.190
Winter break is upon
us, a time of year

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.450
when people hold up
and take a breather.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.880
But surely there should be
more than one time of the year

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.360
that we take a break, right?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.152
Otherwise, you start
to get a little loony.

00:00:24.152 --> 00:00:25.818
You wouldn't think
that we need time off

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:27.090
by looking at the statistics.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.097
Americans receive an average
of 14 vacation days per year

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:30.930
from their employer.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.070
And they only took up about
10 of those days last year.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.550
That leaves over
a half a billion--

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.050
that's right billion with a B--
vacation hours unused in 2012.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.820
Why wouldn't people take
their vacation time?

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.250
This is an absurdity, a tragedy.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.180
In a study by Expedia,
the most common reason

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.200
people couldn't get away
was because, well, work

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.010
got in the way.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.510
You saw that one
coming, didn't you?

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.340
But it's strange.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.970
I mean, it's not like 14 days is
some grand break to begin with.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.890
Two weeks out of 52?

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.550
In the European
Union, workers are

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.200
guaranteed at least four
weeks of vacation time.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.486
And those are paid
days, unlike the US.

00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:08.230
The USA is actually
the only country

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.390
of the 20 most advanced
economies in the world that

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.507
doesn't require workers
have paid time off.

00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:14.840
Paid time off, including
holidays, in the private sector

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.960
averages 16 days,
which is less than

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.117
is required by law in all
19 of the other countries.

00:01:20.117 --> 00:01:22.200
The fact that many workers
don't get paid time off

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.990
may contribute to the
pattern of Americans

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.055
not taking a vacation.

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:26.680
They can't afford to
take time off work

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.740
or they feel like it's
not really worth it.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.700
No pay while you're
away and you also

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.570
have to pay out of pocket
expenses to take a vacation.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.156
Effectively, vacation could
cost two to three times as much.

00:01:37.156 --> 00:01:39.260
Amongst the kindest
countries toward vacationing

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.710
are France, Spain, Belgium,
New Zealand, and Germany.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.140
But Austria and Portugal
come out on top.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.120
Both guarantee five weeks in
paid vacations and holidays,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.310
the most in the world.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.407
Austrian workers, however,
work even fewer hours

00:01:52.407 --> 00:01:53.240
than the Portuguese.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.323
And they have almost double
the labor productivity

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:57.080
and GDP per capita.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.240
That said, the US has even
higher labor productivity,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.900
which some might
use as an argument

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.540
for never taking a vacation.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.170
The problem is that France and
Germany, two other countries

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.870
with 30 plus days off, have
comparable labor outcomes

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.711
to the US.

00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:11.210
The other problem
with that argument

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.210
is, of course, that
vacation is friggin awesome.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.480
As the number of hours that
we work goes up and up,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.535
it's important to take
a step back and remember

00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:20.434
to live our lives man.

00:02:20.434 --> 00:02:21.725
You're not getting any younger.

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:23.870
And vacationing has been
linked with a number

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.120
of positive effects.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.680
The obvious being
breaking the stress cycle,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.880
which allows us to
relax and renew,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.340
rejuvenating motivation
and creativity.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.980
Stress is a sneaky one.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.210
It's a lot harder on the
body than it might seem.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.120
Stress relief is vital to
a good quality of life.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.130
A new study has also
found that traveling

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.540
is linked to a decreased
risk of heart disease, heart

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.920
attacks, and depression.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.416
All of this and more is why
pretty much every country

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:48.790
in the developed
world makes sure

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.110
that its people
can take a break.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.610
After all, happy workers
are productive workers.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.762
So America, when are you
going to get with the program?

00:02:56.762 --> 00:02:58.470
Thanks for joining me
for DNews everyone.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.110
How much vacation time do you
take every year where you live?

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.660
Tell me about it down below.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.030
