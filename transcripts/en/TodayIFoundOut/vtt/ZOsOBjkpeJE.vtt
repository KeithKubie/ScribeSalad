00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.080
Why Nuclear Bombs Create Mushroom Clouds

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.840
The mushroom cloud created by a nuclear blast
is incredibly striking, but have you ever

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.120
wondered why the cloud forms this way?

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.150
Well, wonder no more.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.530
This phenomenon all comes down to a little
something called the Rayleigh-Taylor instability,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.300
and by extension, convection.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.130
I’ll begin with the somewhat longer, but
less geeky explanation before descending once

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.599
again into extreme nerdery.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.599
It all starts with an explosion that creates
a Pyrocumulus Cloud.

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.190
This ball of burning hot gases is accelerated
outwardly in all directions.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.760
Since the burning ball of accelerated gases
is hotter, and therefore less dense, than

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.679
the surrounding air, it will begin to rise-
in the case of nuclear explosions, extremely

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:43.719
rapidly.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.320
This ultimately forms the mushroom cap.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.789
As the ball rises, it will leave behind air
that is heated, creating a chimney-like effect

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.630
that draws in any smoke and gases on the outer
edge of the chimney- convection in action!

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.679
Visually, this forms the stipe (stalk) of
the mushroom.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.160
The perception that the mushroom cap is curling
down and around the stipe is primarily a result

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.010
of the differences in temperature at the center
of the cap and its outside.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.510
The center is hotter and therefore will rise
faster, leaving the slower outer edges to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.180
be caught up in the stipe convection’s awesome
attributes.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.470
Once that cloud reaches a certain point in
our atmosphere, where the density of the gas

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.970
cloud is the same as the density of the surrounding
air, it will spread out, creating a nice cap.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.620
This brings me to the shorter, yet more geeky
answer.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.160
This entire process is something that describes
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.330
This instability is well known in physics
and, in general, describes the merging between

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.130
two different substances (mainly liquids and
gases) that have different densities and are

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.370
subjected to acceleration.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.950
In the case of an atomic bomb, the acceleration,
and the hotter gases creating the differing

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.550
densities of material, are caused by the explosion.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.420
From this, you might have guessed you don’t
necessarily need an atomic bomb to create

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.450
a mushroom cloud.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.700
All you need is enough energy delivered rapidly
(in this case an explosion) that creates a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.770
pocket of differing densities of material
(in this case, heated gases).

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.649
There are numerous other examples in our world
that create, and are described by, the same

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.880
phenomenon that gives us this formation.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.740
For instance, the magnetic fields of planets,
the jet-stream of winds that help control

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.970
our planet’s climate, the sound of snapping
shrimp, even our understanding of certain

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.980
different forms of fusion can all be attributed
to Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.970
Now, you might have also noticed that nuclear
explosions, besides producing this frightening

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.710
fungal formation, also sometimes result in
a cloud ring around the mushroom cap.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.260
What’s going on here is that a low pressure
area is created via the negative phase of

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.590
the shockwave (the phase that follows the
wave of compressed gases at the leading part

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.070
of the shock wave).

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.930
This results in a drop in temperature, which
along with the low pressure can potentially

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.790
lower the dew point sufficiently for a temporary
cloud to form.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.270
This cloud halo around the explosion is known
as a “Wilson Cloud”, named after Scottish

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.770
physicist Charles Wilson who invented the
Wilson Cloud Chamber where similar sorts of

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.660
things can be observed.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.330
Bonus Fact:
• What has been commonly referred to as

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.700
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability was first
brought to light by Lord Rayleigh in 1880.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.650
He was attempting to describe the motion of
liquids when one of higher specific gravity

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.770
was supported by one that was lighter.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.400
Specifically, trying to better understand
how cirrus clouds were formed.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.380
In 1950, Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor discovered
that Rayleigh’s “interfacial instability”

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.690
occurs for other differing substance accelerations
as well.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:44.200
The phenomenon, and all the equations that
describe it, became known as Rayleigh-Taylors.
