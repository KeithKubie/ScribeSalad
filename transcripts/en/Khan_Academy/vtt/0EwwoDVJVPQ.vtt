00:00:01.038 --> 00:00:05.118
- Rewrite each fraction
with a denominator of 10.

00:00:05.118 --> 00:00:06.650
So we have two fractions,

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.905
three fifths and seven halves

00:00:08.905 --> 00:00:13.001
and we wanna take their
denominators of five and two

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:17.811
and change them to be a
common denominator of 10.

00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:19.868
Lets start with three fifths

00:00:19.868 --> 00:00:21.969
and we can look at this visually.

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:25.091
Here we can use this rectangle
to represent a whole,

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.549
one whole.

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:29.605
To show three fifths of
that whole, we're gonna need

00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:33.438
to divide it into fifths
or five equal pieces.

00:00:34.516 --> 00:00:35.599
Lets do that.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:37.953
Try to make these

00:00:39.343 --> 00:00:41.093
as equal as possible.

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:46.996
We have three pieces, and then finally,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.354
there we go.

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:53.575
So, these should represent
five equal pieces, or fifths.

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:57.809
To show three fifths,
we need to shade three

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.614
of those five pieces.

00:00:59.614 --> 00:01:02.947
So, one, two, three of those five pieces

00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:07.834
should be shaded in to show three fifths.

00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:11.940
We've decided we don't
want fifths anymore.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.179
Now, we want tenths.

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.846
We want a new denominator of 10.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.640
To change this fraction over here,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.973
to change this to be tenths,

00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:27.658
we need to split each
of these fifths in half.

00:01:27.658 --> 00:01:30.434
We need to double the amount of pieces.

00:01:30.434 --> 00:01:32.101
We can do that here.

00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:36.996
Now, instead of fifths,
or five equal size pieces,

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:37.948
we have tenths.

00:01:37.948 --> 00:01:39.823
We have one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:39.823 --> 00:01:42.424
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:01:42.424 --> 00:01:45.733
We found a way to have
tenths without changing

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.312
the amount that's represented.

00:01:47.312 --> 00:01:51.797
The same amount is still
shaded, but now we have tenths.

00:01:51.797 --> 00:01:53.797
Our denominator doubled.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.247
We multiplied it be two, we
have twice as many pieces.

00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:02.848
But look at what happened
to our numerator,

00:02:02.848 --> 00:02:04.809
instead of three pieces, now we have

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:08.529
one, two, three, four, five, six pieces.

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:09.862
It also doubled.

00:02:10.977 --> 00:02:13.477
It also was multiplied by two,

00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:18.065
because if we double all of the pieces,

00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:20.225
well then the shaded
ones will also double.

00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:23.054
Each of those pieces also split in two,

00:02:23.054 --> 00:02:26.897
so now there's twice
as many shaded pieces.

00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:30.897
So, three fifths can be
rewritten as six tenths.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.417
Three fifths is equal to six tenths,

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:38.067
and again, we didn't change the fraction.

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:40.195
We didn't change how much was shaded.

00:02:40.195 --> 00:02:44.114
Three fifths and six tenths
represented the same amount.

00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:46.068
We just changed the denominator

00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:47.432
and wrote it a different way.

00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:51.599
So, three fifths can be rewritten
in tenths as six tenths.

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:57.583
Now, for seven halves, we
again want a denominator of 10.

00:02:58.954 --> 00:03:02.211
So, we can draw it out, or we
could try to use this pattern

00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:05.628
we just noticed up here to
figure out how to make halves

00:03:05.628 --> 00:03:07.045
turn into tenths.

00:03:07.972 --> 00:03:10.700
To get from fifths to
tenths we had to double,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.660
or multiply by two.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.908
To get from halves to tenths,

00:03:14.908 --> 00:03:17.449
we'd have to multiply each of our pieces

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:18.366
times five.

00:03:21.095 --> 00:03:24.976
Each of our halves would
be split into five pieces.

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:29.524
So, we multiply two
times five to get tenths.

00:03:29.524 --> 00:03:31.304
Like the pattern showed us up here,

00:03:31.304 --> 00:03:34.418
if the denominator is
multiplied by a number,

00:03:34.418 --> 00:03:37.075
we multiply the numerator
by the same number.

00:03:37.075 --> 00:03:41.833
Those shaded pieces would
also be split five times.

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:45.000
We multiply our seven times five also.

00:03:45.896 --> 00:03:48.629
You should match the
numerator and denominator

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.302
are multiplied by the same number.

00:03:51.302 --> 00:03:53.219
Seven times five is 35.

00:03:55.564 --> 00:03:58.731
So 35 tenths is equal to seven halves.

00:04:01.928 --> 00:04:05.828
To change these two fractions
to have a common denominator

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:06.661
of 10,

00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:10.853
three fifths will become six tenths,

00:04:10.853 --> 00:04:14.103
and seven halves will become 35 tenths.
