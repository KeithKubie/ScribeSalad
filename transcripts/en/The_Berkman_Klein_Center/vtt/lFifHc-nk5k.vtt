00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.240
My name is Nagla Rizk. I am a professor of economics and founding director of the

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.660
Access to Knowledge for Development
Center at the American University in

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.250
Cairo School of Business. My take on AI
and inclusion comes from the stance that

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.800
we need neither to romanticize nor
demonize the technologies. But rather

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.970
democratize and harness for the
betterment of human lives. So I bring a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.060
voice of the south, from the South to
this debate. I think the discourse should

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.710
be inclusive, the discourse itself should be inclusive to look at how these

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.150
technologies from the sense of use of
the technologies and the production of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.660
technologies, and in that sense we need
to think of how we can devise business

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.610
models that actually engage players from
different parts of the world and that

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.480
lead to the openness of knowledge from a paradigm of openness, from a paradigm of

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.500
engagement and sharing. It's very
important to realize that the debates

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.840
regarding AI and inclusion are not
entirely new. They're quite similar to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.149
the issues that came about with
the digital technologies, the Internet,

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.310
looking at the potential of bringing
development, but at the same time the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.979
opposite argument of how the digital
divide is actually exacerbated by these

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.369
new technologies. A key area that
needs to be tackled is actually context

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.079
based research. For example the future of
work in the global north as opposed to

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.659
other areas when there is informal labor:
what does AI mean for the type of jobs

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.639
and the type of tasks that are taking
place. Another area is business models:

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:49.130
what business models are appropriate for
the development of AI based models,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.359
production and use. What is the
concept of value? What is the concept of

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.409
intellectual property models: patent
pools, knowledge sharing, data commons. All

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.450
of these issues, there has to be a
conversation to inform the discourse, the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.009
discourse itself has to be inclusive.
