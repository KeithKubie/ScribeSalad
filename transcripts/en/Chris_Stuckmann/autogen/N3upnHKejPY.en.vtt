that was by far the part of this film

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020
that was by far the part of this film
 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.719
that was by far the part of this film
that I thought excelled the most was the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
that I thought excelled the most was the
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.190
that I thought excelled the most was the
chemistry between the actors some of the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
chemistry between the actors some of the
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.569
chemistry between the actors some of the
girls are also really good in the movie

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579
girls are also really good in the movie
 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.830
girls are also really good in the movie
and that's not really my issue with the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
and that's not really my issue with the
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.389
and that's not really my issue with the
film the acting was about as good as it

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
film the acting was about as good as it
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.770
film the acting was about as good as it
can beat with the screenplay they had to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
can beat with the screenplay they had to
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.630
can beat with the screenplay they had to
work with my issue is the screenplay

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
work with my issue is the screenplay
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.940
work with my issue is the screenplay
is filled with romantic cliches to the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
is filled with romantic cliches to the
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.560
is filled with romantic cliches to the
point where you can literally tell where

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
point where you can literally tell where
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.880
point where you can literally tell where
everything is about to happen but I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890
everything is about to happen but I
 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.050
everything is about to happen but I
think the movie feels like it's a little

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
think the movie feels like it's a little
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.819
think the movie feels like it's a little
more clever than it actually is because

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
more clever than it actually is because
 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.649
more clever than it actually is because
of these cliches I mean every single

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659
of these cliches I mean every single
 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.789
of these cliches I mean every single
character in the movie has the big

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
character in the movie has the big
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.589
character in the movie has the big
argument scene where oh the relationship

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
argument scene where oh the relationship
 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.180
argument scene where oh the relationship
isn't going so well let's have a big

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
isn't going so well let's have a big
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.160
isn't going so well let's have a big
argument scene and of course all

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
argument scene and of course all
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.960
argument scene and of course all
three of these guys seem to have this

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970
three of these guys seem to have this
 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.600
three of these guys seem to have this
around the exact same period and they

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
around the exact same period and they
 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.729
around the exact same period and they
clash of course because you can't have a

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739
clash of course because you can't have a
 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.170
clash of course because you can't have a
movie where characters get into an

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
movie where characters get into an
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.220
movie where characters get into an
argument with a whole bunch of different

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230
argument with a whole bunch of different
 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.660
argument with a whole bunch of different
relationships unless they all end up in

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670
relationships unless they all end up in
 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.220
relationships unless they all end up in
the exact same place having a big

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230
the exact same place having a big
 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.839
the exact same place having a big
argument that somehow involves all the

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849
argument that somehow involves all the
 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.220
argument that somehow involves all the
characters because then it wouldn't be a

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230
characters because then it wouldn't be a
 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.840
characters because then it wouldn't be a
movie now we've seen that work really

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850
movie now we've seen that work really
 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.520
movie now we've seen that work really
well before in the past with movies like

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530
well before in the past with movies like
 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.530
well before in the past with movies like
Crazy Stupid Love the best scene in that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540
Crazy Stupid Love the best scene in that
 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.790
Crazy Stupid Love the best scene in that
movie in my opinion is when all the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800
movie in my opinion is when all the
 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.170
movie in my opinion is when all the
characters mean you're like oh my

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
characters mean you're like oh my
 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.490
characters mean you're like oh my

really well written the character seemed

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580

real and it was surprising in this movie

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950
real and it was surprising in this movie
 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.949
real and it was surprising in this movie
when that moment happens which really is

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959
when that moment happens which really is
 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.660
when that moment happens which really is

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
just trying to copy off a whole bunch of
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.250
just trying to copy off a whole bunch of
other romantic comedies where that exact

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260
other romantic comedies where that exact
 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.320
