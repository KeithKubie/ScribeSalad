00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.580
 
I think the question

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590
 
 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.060
 
and I'll tell you why I don't think we

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070
and I'll tell you why I don't think we
 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.870
and I'll tell you why I don't think we
have a right to talk about evil people

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880
have a right to talk about evil people
 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.510
have a right to talk about evil people
if we could see the inside of people's

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520
if we could see the inside of people's
 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.660
if we could see the inside of people's
souls we might have a right to do that

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670
souls we might have a right to do that
 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.550
souls we might have a right to do that
but if anybody can do that it's God and

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560
but if anybody can do that it's God and
 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.190
but if anybody can do that it's God and
on some accounts even God doesn't know

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200
on some accounts even God doesn't know
 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.640
on some accounts even God doesn't know
how people are going to act and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650
how people are going to act and
 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.490
how people are going to act and
certainly on Kant's account and on

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500
certainly on Kant's account and on
 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000
certainly on Kant's account and on
Freud's account we don't know our own

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010
Freud's account we don't know our own
 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.610
Freud's account we don't know our own
souls very well we're subject to

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620
souls very well we're subject to
 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.439
souls very well we're subject to
self-deception we tell ourselves that

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449
self-deception we tell ourselves that
 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:45.670
self-deception we tell ourselves that
we're doing things for all kinds of

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680
we're doing things for all kinds of
 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.040
we're doing things for all kinds of
reasons that aren't true so talking

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050
reasons that aren't true so talking
 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.229
reasons that aren't true so talking
about evil people I think completely

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239
about evil people I think completely
 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.689
about evil people I think completely
misses the mark where an awful lot of

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699
misses the mark where an awful lot of
 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.910
misses the mark where an awful lot of
progressives go wrong is that they see

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920
progressives go wrong is that they see
 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.799
progressives go wrong is that they see
that they see that things are

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809
that they see that things are
 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.720
that they see that things are
complicated and then they say well we

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730
complicated and then they say well we
 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.329
complicated and then they say well we
can't talk about evil at all I think on

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339
can't talk about evil at all I think on
 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.370
can't talk about evil at all I think on
the country we can as long as we talk

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380
the country we can as long as we talk
 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.430
the country we can as long as we talk
about evil actions and I think it's not

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440
about evil actions and I think it's not
 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.580
about evil actions and I think it's not
hard to come up with a whole list of

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590
hard to come up with a whole list of
 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.430
hard to come up with a whole list of
evil actions and I think pointing it to

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440
evil actions and I think pointing it to
 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.740
evil actions and I think pointing it to
the Nazis is too easy I think they're a

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750
the Nazis is too easy I think they're a
 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.330
the Nazis is too easy I think they're a
whole bunch of other evil actions that

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340
whole bunch of other evil actions that
 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.420
whole bunch of other evil actions that
we can point to we have to realize that

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430
we can point to we have to realize that
 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.590
we can point to we have to realize that
they can be committed by people who not

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600
they can be committed by people who not
 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.410
they can be committed by people who not
only may not have evil intentions but

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420
only may not have evil intentions but
 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.510
only may not have evil intentions but
sometimes have good ones and certainly

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520
sometimes have good ones and certainly
 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.620
sometimes have good ones and certainly
very often have mediocre ones
