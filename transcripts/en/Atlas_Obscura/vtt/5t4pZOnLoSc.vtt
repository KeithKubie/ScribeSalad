00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.910
- We collect special interest stuff.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.482
You know, there's always that
special interest section?

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:06.120
That's what we want.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.160
- I want you to look at
all of those wiggles.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.120
- We have one video called 'Rent-A-Friend'

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.624
It's a guy who will be your friend

00:00:13.624 --> 00:00:16.490
for 45 insane minutes.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.440
He'll ask you a question,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.062
he'll leave a space for you to answer,

00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:21.637
and then he has a conversation with you.

00:00:21.637 --> 00:00:23.480
- I want to be your friend.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.433
How's that sound?

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.480
Great!

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.740
- I'm Joe, this is Nick.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.940
This is our collection here of VHS tapes.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.523
- Yeah, we've been
collecting for 26 years.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.810
These are all videos that weren't meant

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.100
to be shown in public.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.700
So, there are things like exercise videos,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.030
that's a whole category.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.931
But with within that, we've
got a section called 'ercise'

00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:50.200
Which are all videos that
had the word ercise in it.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.950
So it would be like Protect-ercise

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.933
with self-defense exercise videos.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.381
- We have a whole section over there

00:00:56.381 --> 00:00:59.450
of scarf-tying videos.
- Right.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.593
- There's a whole row of all
videos on how to tie a scarf.

00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:08.450
- We have a category
called 'Unusually Specific'

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.540
And that's all stuff
like, we have one called

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.500
'How to Identify Machine-Made Marbles'

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560
And it's like, what
three people in the world

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.100
was that VHS tape made for?

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.610
- We have one 'How to Spot
Counterfeit Beanie Babies'

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.443
- [Nick] Yeah.

00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:21.310
- [Joe] I guess that was a problem.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.330
- [Nick] In the early 90s
that was just rampant.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.580
- [Joe] It's a needle in a haystack

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.550
to find something that's
good in the right way.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.260
We have some rules, like it has
to be unintentionally funny,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.970
we have to find it physically in hand.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.194
I mean, we put too many
restrictions on ourselves.

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:35.186
But, when you find something that's gold?

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:38.686
- You can't wait to show it off to people.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.624
- [Joe] VHS officially died in 2007.

00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:47.550
The last plant that made VHS tape--

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.680
- [Nick] On a mass scale, yeah.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.780
- Yeah, they're gone now,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.947
so everything is at thrift stores now.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.490
- [Joe] How's that?

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.113
- Yeah.

00:02:02.113 --> 00:02:03.930
There's a lot of movies, but
I think if you dig deep enough

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.390
there's some other stuff here.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.573
You've just got to look
through every single thing.

00:02:08.657 --> 00:02:10.300
- Ooh, a white tape.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.660
- [Nick] Wow.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.923
- You only see that

00:02:12.923 --> 00:02:14.010
with Barneys usually.
- Yeah

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.300
- How many 'Land Before Time' movies

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.010
do you think there were?

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.843
- Uhh...

00:02:17.843 --> 00:02:19.950
- Including straight to video.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.330
- Oh.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.163
Four?

00:02:22.163 --> 00:02:22.996
- 14.
- 14?

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:24.321
- 14. Yup.

00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:26.070
I don't know why I was looking that up.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.968
In 1991 I was working at a
McDonald's in my hometown

00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:31.710
and my friend was training
to become a manager there,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.619
and had to watch 30 different videos

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.575
on how to do everything at McDonald's.

00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:38.560
And he told me to come
into the break room one day

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.017
because there was a video called

00:02:40.017 --> 00:02:42.960
'Inside and Outside Custodial Duties'

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.520
And, I watched it with him that day

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.670
and I could not believe how
profoundly stupid it was.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.640
And my thought was this
can't stay in the break room,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.030
like, Joe needs to see this.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.860
- [Man] Finesse that wall.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.540
That's the way!

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.870
Make it shine, guy, make it shine!

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.603
- That became a regular
video we would screen

00:03:00.603 --> 00:03:02.480
on a Friday night, and we had

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.762
this running commentary of jokes.

00:03:03.762 --> 00:03:06.086
And that just got us thinking
there has to be more videos

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:09.680
like this right under our
noses in out-of-the-way places.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.405
Oh yeah, I think we got a winner here:

00:03:11.405 --> 00:03:14.359
Calvin Klein Men Fall 1997

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:15.300
- Yeah, there you go.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.133
That's it.

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:19.100
- So, some kind of fashion
show, and this is vintage 1997.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.596
So, this one is I'm most
excited about so far.

00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:22.841
- Got another one.

00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.700
Got another one.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.871
'Balloonacy'
- Oh?

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.620
- Two! (laughs)

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.380
- The sequels are never as good, but--

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.220
- Oh, look at the guy.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.070
Oh, we have other videos of this guy.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.533
- Cool.

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:35.740
- We have not even come close

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.470
to watching every single tape here.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.770
I think we've probably watched, what, 35%?

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.951
- Yeah, a third, maybe?

00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:43.530
Because it was a unique moment in time

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.480
for a technology, it
reached market saturation.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.230
Everybody had a VCR at one point,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.301
and it was so cheap to produce VHS,

00:03:50.301 --> 00:03:52.339
and that's why you got all these weird

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:55.083
esoteric things ending up on tape.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.567
- [Joe] How much are VHS?

00:03:57.567 --> 00:03:59.000
- [Cashier] $2 each.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.833
See? Good price.

00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:01.165
Good price.
- Yeah.

00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:04.128
- We've been doing the
touring show for 14 years now.

00:04:04.128 --> 00:04:06.780
It's Nick and I giving a guided tour

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.340
of our latest, greatest finds.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.700
- [Nick] Which, we used to do
it in my parents' living room

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.561
or our college dorm room, apartments,

00:04:12.561 --> 00:04:14.850
and now we're able to do
that all over the world.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.530
- [Joe] I think about three
years into it, for me,

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.030
I think that my parents were confused

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.470
like, how I made money.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.730
Now they're just like Oh,
okay, he has this weird job.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.130
And I think it's harder to
explain to like, aunts and uncles

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.060
who are just like, 'So
what are you doing?'

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.820
It's like, sit down.
- Yeah.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.653
- [Joe] It's hard to explain.

00:04:28.653 --> 00:04:30.045
- I think my grandparents
went to their graves

00:04:30.045 --> 00:04:31.538
not understanding what I did.

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.140
(Joe laughs)

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.270
- [Joe] I think 10-year-old
me, if he came into this room

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.980
and saw everything, he'd be like,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.813
You made it.

00:04:37.813 --> 00:04:38.646
- [Nick] It all paid off.

00:04:38.646 --> 00:04:39.900
- You did it.
- Yeah.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.116
- I tip my hat to you, older Joe.

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:44.080
- [Nick] We just don't know
how to do anything else.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.913
- We really don't (laughs).

00:04:44.913 --> 00:04:46.240
- That's the honest answer.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.330
This is our skill set.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.913
- We're in way too deep.
- Yeah.
