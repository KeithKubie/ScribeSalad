MANO MARKS: Hello, and welcome
to a special episode of Google

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.990
Developers Live with Google
Maps and Android.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.450
I'm Mano Marks of the Maps
developer relations team.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.550
And this week, I'm teamed
up with Fred Chung

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.060
on the Android team.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.720
FRED CHUNG: Hello everyone.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.660
MANO MARKS: We'd like to talk
to you about the new Google

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.580
Maps Android API V2.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.060
FRED CHUNG: So yeah, we just
launched Google Play Services.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.950
It's an update to Google
Play Services.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.290
For those of you that aren't
familiar with Google Play

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.910
Services, it is a new platform
through which third-party

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.520
developers, Android developers
can integrate with Google

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.650
services like Google Plus,
OAuth 2.0 authentication.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.900
And now they can also integrate
with Panorama and

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.000
Maps, the new Maps API
through this service.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.350
And the good thing is that
this service is backward

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.270
compatible all the way
back to Froyo or 2.2.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.620
And the beauty of this is that
for users, as new updates

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.430
become available, the users
automatically get the new

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.800
services on their devices.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.140
And for developers, all you have
to do is to grab a thin

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.995
client library to integrate
with your Android project.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.850
MANO MARKS: In this update, we
added a number of interesting

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.680
components.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.360
In particular today, we're going
to talk to you about

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.710
Google Maps Android API V2.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.380
In this new map library, we're
making available to all

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.180
Android apps the same experience
that Android users

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.720
get using the Google Maps app.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.080
You're going to get
vector tiles.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.490
You can rotate and
tilt the map.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.790
And these interactions are
something that users are

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.200
already familiar with.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.390
So if you just take a quick look
here, you can see here we

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.960
are in a tilted map view
with 3D buildings.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.370
If I zoom in, you can see that I
actually have some access to

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.660
some indoor maps.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.800
So here we have Moscone
Center West.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.036
I can also switch very quickly
to terrain mode.

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:10.910
FRED CHUNG: Very nice.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.440
MANO MARKS: Or I can switch
to hybrid, satellite,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440
and vector data mode.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.230
And one of the really cool
call-out features on this is

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.190
you will notice that
as I rotate this

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.990
map, which I can do--

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.280
rotate and tilt it--

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.590
the labels all stay in
the same direction.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.600
Even though this is a raster
map, it's got vector overlay

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.936
on top of it.

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:34.180
FRED CHUNG: So I don't
need to turn my head.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.170
So essentially, the experience
is just like Google Maps.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.900
MANO MARKS: That's right.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.650
And anywhere I go, I can
get traffic data.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.810
So whatever layer I'm looking
at, I get an overlay of

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.810
traffic if that's what I want
to show to my users.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.630
--users are already
familiar with.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.820
So if you just take a quick look
here, you can see here we

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.420
are in a tilted map view
with 3D buildings.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.540
If I zoom in, you can see that I
actually have some access to

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.100
use some indoor maps.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.250
So here we have Moscone
Center West.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.552
I can also switch very quickly
to terrain mode.

00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:20.350
FRED CHUNG: Very nice.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.880
MANO MARKS: Or I can switch
to hybrid, satellite,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.880
and vector data mode.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.670
And one of the really cool
call-out features on this is

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.620
you will notice that
as I rotate this

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.430
map, which I can do--

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.710
rotate and tilt it--

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.990
the labels all stay in
the same direction.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.060
Even though this is a raster
map, it's got a vector overlay

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.610
on top of it.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.660
FRED CHUNG: So I don't
need to turn my head.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.650
So essentially, the experience
is just like Google Maps.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.330
MANO MARKS: That's right.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.070
And anywhere I go, I can
get traffic data.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.230
So whatever layer I'm looking
at, I get an overlay of

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.106
traffic if that's what I want
to show to my users.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.430
FRED CHUNG: I talk to
a lot of developers.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.460
And I know that this update
is much anticipated.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.050
I'm sure a lot of them will be
thrilled about this update.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.019
So from a coding perspective,
this new library addresses a

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.829
couple of developer concerns.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.390
It is now fragment friendly,
which is a good thing.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.320
Because this is one of the major
concerns that we hear a

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.910
lot from the developers
trying to use

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.210
the old MapView libraries.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.780
There are some limitations
to it.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.970
It can only be hosted in
[? a map ?] activity, which is

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.450
kind of limiting for a
lot of developers.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.970
People have tried all sorts
of tricks to make

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.930
it work with fragments.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.340
But it's very messy.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.030
So the good thing is that
it is now available.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.075
So feel free to update your
app to this new API.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.670
For today's show, there
are two parts to it.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.770
In the first part, Mano will do
some more additional demos

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.280
to show off some
of the features

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.340
available in this API.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.570
And then we'll hang out with a
couple of developers, Trulia

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.320
and Expedia hotels
and flights.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.190
Both of them have started using
the API to migrate their

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.630
existing maps to this new API.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.260
So we're going to listen to what
they have to share with

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.510
the audience.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.840
MANO MARKS: Probably the best
way to learn about the new API

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.750
and what it can do is
to see these awesome

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.840
new features in action.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.335
I've installed the Google Maps
Android API Demo app-- that's

00:05:37.335 --> 00:05:38.360
a really long name--

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.530
FRED CHUNG: It is.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.930
MANO MARKS: --on this tablet
as you've been seeing.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.780
And I'll show you the main
features of the new API.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.720
The source code for this app is
actually part of the Google

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.380
Play Services package that
you can get with

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.470
the Android SDK manager.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.450
We're planning to cover
more technical

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.820
details in future shows.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.760
But in the meantime, you can
check out the code for the

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.960
demo app to get a better feel
for how the API works.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.510
So you'll see that there's
actually a ton of demos here.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.530
And we're going to just show you
a few of the really cool

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:24.850
and interesting things that
are new in the new Maps.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.560
So here, we have a sample
app that shows you

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.420
how the camera works.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.890
So because you have this sort
of bearing and tilt of the

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.150
map, you can also control the
zoom and center of the map.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.940
This is something that not only
your users can do through

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.480
the UI but you can also
do programmatically.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.270
So if you'll see here, I'm
looking at Sydney.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.450
The Maps team is in Sydney,
the engineering team.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.670
So that's why we always have
these Sydney demos.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.300
FRED CHUNG: I wonder why.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.750
MANO MARKS: So here I
can go to Sydney.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.620
You see this gets this
nice, smooth, and

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.650
quick transition here.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.110
Also, I can go to Bondi, which
is a beach nearby.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.000
And you'll see how it does that
nice, smooth animation

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.220
but also tilted and zoomed
it at the same time

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.280
and rotated the map.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.550
FRED CHUNG: It's kind of like
the Google Earth experience.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.970
MANO MARKS: Yeah, it is
very much like that.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.980
And then if I turn off
animation, I can just go

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.430
directly there.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:28.750
So these sort of things you get
also different kinds of

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:37.110
animations built in for both
zooming and moving in this for

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.060
short hops as well.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.430
FRED CHUNG: Very nice.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.150
MANO MARKS: The next thing I'm
going to show you is ground

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.160
overlays just really quickly.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.100
This is something that users of
the JavaScript Maps API are

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.760
familiar with.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.820
But you'll see here I've
actually overlaid an old

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.590
raster image on top
of the map.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.240
And along with that,
I get this nice

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.160
sort of tilting effect.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.880
So this is something you can
use your geolocated--

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.300
your georeferenced
raster imagery.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.890
And then you can do things
like control the

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.800
transparency there.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:19.500
It's a great way to showcase
old and new data together.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.220
FRED CHUNG: So, Mano,
one quick question.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.610
Can you use any arbitrary
images?

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.470
MANO MARKS: Yeah, you could put
my face on your map if you

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.100
really wanted to.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.900
Not that anybody
would do that.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.030
I would really suggest
you not do that.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:31.760
Because that's going
to be a little

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.950
surprising for the users.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.760
So let's take a look
at markers.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.770
You get new features
with markers here.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.610
First of all, we get the
standard default info window.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.225
You can also customize the
contents of the info window.

00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:57.460
So you get a little bit more
interesting interaction there.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.250
You can also customize the
info window itself.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.400
So you see here it's got these
sort of rounded corners.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.440
But not only that, your markers
can be draggable.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.940
So here, I'm just dragging
that marker.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:15.100
And as I drag it, I get a
on-marker drag end event,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.470
which then you can do
something with.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.080
This is a great way for allowing
people to collect

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.120
data for you.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.750
Or you could use this for
positioning in games or

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.190
anything like that.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.240
You can provide your own
custom icons as well.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.870
And yeah, I think these
are great new

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.120
features and markers.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.050
Quickly just show you
this fun one.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.040
You don't have to use our
map tiles if you want.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:51.330
You can use this as a serving
technology for

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:51.965
your own map tiles.

00:09:51.965 --> 00:09:53.530
FRED CHUNG: So what are
we looking at now?

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.080
MANO MARKS: We're looking
at the moon.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.620
Google Maps has published tile
overlays for the moon.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.160
And as you see, we have
these raster images.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.490
And I can do some nice movement
around using these

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.420
raster tiles.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.950
I can turn them.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.560
FRED CHUNG: It's really cool
that you can tap into the

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.350
basic infrastructure for
manipulating a UI while using

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.860
your own overlay.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.210
It would be an ideal tool for
game developers, for example.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:22.690
MANO MARKS: That's right.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:26.370
And you can do custom tiles,
custom tile projections.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.830
You don't have to use the
standard Mercator projection.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:29.085
FRED CHUNG: Nice.

00:10:29.085 --> 00:10:31.380
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.900
OK, polygons.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.850
Polygons are new in this API.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.250
And you can see you've got
lots of ways that you can

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.170
control how polygons
look and feel.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.700
So polygons are basically
a line with fill.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.620
You can change the
fill hue here.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.760
You can change the fill
alpha as well.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.735
You can change the
stroke width.

00:11:00.735 --> 00:11:04.070
And you'll see you also have
nice little holes in your

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.810
polygons and a lot of new
features as well.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.530
We also have poly lines, which
are basically polygons without

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.350
the fill in them.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.540
Those give you interesting
features, like you can do a

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.050
geodesic poly line.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.990
So they match the curvature
of the earth rather than a

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.240
direct, straight line.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.910
Then finally, I wanted
to demonstrate for

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.610
you multiple maps.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:37.685
Now, because maps are
now in a fragment--

00:11:37.685 --> 00:11:39.060
FRED CHUNG: That's a big win.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:39.990
MANO MARKS: It's a big win.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:45.170
So you longer have to
extend map activity.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.030
Maps can now be added
to any activity.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:53.630
And you can also add
them to fragments.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:58.070
You can see one of the results
of that is you can do multiple

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.870
maps in the same view.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:01.810
FRED CHUNG: That's very cool.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.830
MANO MARKS: So that's nice
if you want to do sort of

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.080
side-by-side comparisons.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.330
FRED CHUNG: Definitely.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.000
All right, great.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.100
Thanks for demos, Mano.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.610
Now, let's have a look at what
some of the early adopters are

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.770
doing with the API.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.330
Hello.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.330
We have invited Trulia
on air today.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.450
We have two representatives
from

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.110
Trulia, Stephen and Alice.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.120
Stephen and Alice, do you
guys want to do a quick

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.000
introduction.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.070
STEPHEN: Sure.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:32.540
Thank you Fred.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.820
Thanks for this opportunity.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.880
We're here to introduce
Trulia.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.660
We have a great Trulia Android
engineering team here.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.540
And what Trulia is, first of all
to set it up, we are a US

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.890
residential property
search site.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.840
And mobile is extremely
important to us.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.440
Mobile is the fastest growing
part of our traffic right now.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.850
It's up over 140%
year on year.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.130
And currently is over 30% of our
traffic on a weekly basis.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.570
So mobile is very
important to us.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.520
And Android, particularly, is
a big part of that as well.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.040
FRED CHUNG: That's great.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.150
So you have a tablet app
in Google Play store.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.360
Well, you actually have
multiple apps.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.700
And I understand that you have
spent some time working with

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.180
the new maps API.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.330
And let's go ahead and have a
look at what you've done with

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.210
it, shall we?

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.710
STEPHEN: Sure, let's do it.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.430
FRED CHUNG: So I've gone ahead
and launched the tablet

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.310
version, which looks great.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.560
I'm looking at San Francisco,
downtown San Francisco.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.400
I see a bunch of properties, a
bunch of expensive properties.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:38.610
As I'm panning the map around,
I notice that you guys have

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.610
incorporated the new API.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.340
So you can see the tilting.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:48.600
As I zoom in closer and closer,
3D buildings begin to

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.170
pop up any minute.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:57.180
And in certain locations you do
also have the indoor maps

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.130
available from the API,
which is awesome.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:06.340
So as I click on one of the
markers, a pop up shows up,

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.480
showing me some property.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.780
I clicked on it.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.480
A pane shows up with some
more property details.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.220
So that's kind of cool.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.840
STEPHEN: Yes.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.660
This is what users really
enjoy about us.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.740
They can look for properties.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.580
They can see photos.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.630
We have big photos,
a lot of cases.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.805
And then if they want, they
can contact a real estate

00:14:24.805 --> 00:14:28.056
agent right from that property
page that you're looking at.

00:14:28.056 --> 00:14:28.494
FRED CHUNG: That's great.

00:14:28.494 --> 00:14:29.750
STEPHEN: So we've really focused
on making that a great

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.470
experience for them.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.020
FRED CHUNG: Right.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.160
And I notice that you guys have
incorporated a couple of

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:34.970
interesting features.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.820
The first one that I'd like to
touch on is the layer, custom

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.020
layer information.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.630
As I click on the Layer icon,
a pop up comes up.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:50.200
And I'm going to go ahead and
click on Crime layer.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.590
Can you walk us through a little
bit on how the crime

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.300
data layer is rendered?

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.110
It looks pretty visually
appealing right now.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.640
ALICE: Yeah, we used the new
tile overlay the new API

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.170
[? provide ?] that we're easily
just give the URL of

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.840
our tiles and then it will
render nicely on the map.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.220
FRED CHUNG: Cool.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.420
And I also understand that
there's a feature.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.250
There's a pretty cool feature
where you can hand draw an

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.590
arbitrary polygon, an
arbitrary shape.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.080
And in the app, it's going to
do a search based on the

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.990
hand-drawn area.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.070
STEPHEN: Draw search, you can
draw your own search in the

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.200
area you want.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.930
And we really try to focus on
giving you the inside scoop.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:38.960
So not only property details,
but crime, as you looked at,

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.380
school attendance [? zone, ?]

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.060
zip code boundaries, and things
around the area that

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:43.870
users are interested
in when they're

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:44.870
looking for a property.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.360
FRED CHUNG: Yeah, it's
very interactive.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.846
Good job, guys.

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:49.110
STEPHEN: Thank you.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.300
FRED CHUNG: So can you maybe
share a little bit more

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.620
information on your experience
using the new Maps API?

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.320
From an engineering standpoint,
what sort of

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.570
effort is needed?

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:05.060
ALICE: The new app Map API
provides a lot of new features

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.000
that we were looking
for before.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.130
For example, the support
maps [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.570
that we no longer need to
use a revised version,

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:13.065
[? our own. ?]

00:16:13.065 --> 00:16:15.110
We can use the default one.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.160
And the camera and camera
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.880
[? event ?] change is great that
we don't need to handle

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.200
[? the touch ?]

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.207
[? event ?] and figure out if
maps [INAUDIBLE] or not.

00:16:26.207 --> 00:16:32.170
The custom info window
that is kind of

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.330
nicely tied with a marker.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.410
So it's great.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.450
Yeah, these are the great
features that it's-- the

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:44.890
migration is about a week or
two effort to make our app

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.140
really stable.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.020
FRED CHUNG: That's great.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.400
You mentioned fragment.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.920
I personally anticipated that
fragment would be one feature

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.470
that a lot of Android
developers

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.470
would be excited about.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.960
So that's great.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.160
Do you have a separate phone
app and a tablet app?

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.956
Or what's your model like?

00:17:08.956 --> 00:17:13.290
ALICE: Yeah, we have two form
factors, one for X-large

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.790
devices and one for others.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.320
So X-large device would be
10-inch tablet and larger.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.140
FRED CHUNG: Right.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.290
But you are using one APK for
the two form factors, right?

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.910
Got it.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:30.990
Is this app available with
the new Maps API?

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.980
STEPHEN: Yes, this app is
available as soon as the new

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.360
Maps API is public.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.150
This app that you're looking
at today will be available.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.500
All of our apps are free.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.620
We actually have three top-rated
Android apps.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.580
And this is our main app.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.520
It'll be available
as soon as the

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.910
Google Maps API is available.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.210
FRED CHUNG: Awesome.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.810
Cool.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:52.250
So I look forward to seeing you
upgrade the other apps to

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.590
the new Maps API.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.150
STEPHEN: That will
be coming soon.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:55.730
FRED CHUNG: All right, great.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:56.470
Thanks, guys.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.953
STEPHEN: Thank you.

00:17:56.953 --> 00:17:58.203
ALICE: Thank you.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.390
FRED CHUNG: Hello.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:05.470
We have invited Dan Lew
from Expedia hotels

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.140
with us here on-air.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.720
DAN LEW: Hi.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.480
FRED CHUNG: Dan is the Android
developer behind Expedia

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.550
Hotels and Flights application
and the FlightTrack

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:18.800
application.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:25.410
He is here to share with us some
of his experience using

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.530
the new Maps API.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.930
I understand that, Dan, you guys
have started looking into

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.280
the API and have started
incorporating the API into the

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.050
two apps that I just
mentioned, right?

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:39.880
DAN LEW: Yeah.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.530
It's been working out
great so far.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:43.690
It's really jumped
past the previous

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.550
version of the Maps library.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.140
FRED CHUNG: That's great.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.460
So shall we do a quick walk
through of the application?

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.770
Let's start with Expedia
hotels and flights.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.640
My understanding is that you
just recently launched an

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.920
update to this beautiful app.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.440
And then you're in the process
of updating the map portion of

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.700
it with the new Maps API.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.950
DAN LEW: Mm hm.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.380
FRED CHUNG: I'm at the
landing screen.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.030
And I'm scrolling through.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.420
And it's what seems to
be an infinite list

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.760
view of pretty pictures.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.600
And let's get into the
hotels portion.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.190
Can you walk us through what's
available there?

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:29.290
DAN LEW: Yeah, I mean it's a
pretty simple idea, which is

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:32.940
simply that on the hotel side,
you can search for a location.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.390
And there is the traditional
list view of just hotels.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.950
But if you click the button on
the bottom right, it will

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:44.290
switch you over to a map view
version of the application.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:45.400
FRED CHUNG: There you go.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.750
I can see in this demo version,
you are using the

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.220
vector-based map so that
I can twist, and turn,

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.422
and tilt the tiles.

00:19:54.422 --> 00:19:55.870
DAN LEW: Yeah.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.210
FRED CHUNG: That's
pretty cool.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.970
And right now, I'm trying
to search for

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.365
hotels in San Francisco.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:10.240
So it brought me to San
Francisco with a nice

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.780
animation, flyover animation.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.400
So that's something that's
supported by the new API.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.820
DAN LEW: Yep.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.520
FRED CHUNG: So as I zoom closer
into the clusters of

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:31.330
hotels in downtown San
Francisco, I can click on the

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.030
markers as you would expect.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.840
And are these custom markers?

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.960
DAN LEW: Yeah, we have our
own assets for those.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.970
But we also played around with
the different hues that you

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.920
can build into the
app as well.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.275
FRED CHUNG: Do you have an
example of a custom view or is

00:20:46.275 --> 00:20:49.280
that still something that's
in the works?

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.750
DAN LEW: I think it's
still in the work.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.175
But I did play around
a bit with--

00:20:53.175 --> 00:20:57.050
there's this adapter interface
if you want to create your own

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:00.120
info window pop-ups or
info window content.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.520
And I played around with
that for a bit.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.700
But I haven't actually
used it yet.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.720
FRED CHUNG: OK, cool.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:10.030
And as I'm panning around
downtown for certain retail

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:16.540
stores, it's showing me the
indoor map for those

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.310
locations, which
is pretty cool.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.160
DAN LEW: Yeah, it's really cool
to have all the features

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.755
that the current Google Maps
app has in our own map.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.610
FRED CHUNG: Now that you've
taken a look at the API, what

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:36.020
are some of the features that
interest you, that you are

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.810
excited about?

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.240
DAN LEW: I think a lot of the
things I'm excited about are

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.770
just all the things that, with
the old map view, we had to

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.460
roll on our own.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.080
So for example, we used
to have to make

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.560
our own pop-up bubbles.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:53.830
We used to have to write our own
draw routines to lay over

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.650
all the lines or whatever
we wanted on the map.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.910
And now, all of that stuff is
built into the library.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.790
And it's just a lot
easier to use.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.980
FRED CHUNG: That's great.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.660
And I notice that as you zoom
closer into the map, 3D

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.700
buildings start to pop up
left and right, which is

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.900
kind of cool also.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:16.170
It gives the user some visual
cues of their orientation.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.930
DAN LEW: Yeah, and I mean, with
hotels, I feel like the

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.400
map's a core part of
the experience.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.460
It's incredibly important to see
where you are on a map and

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.920
what hotels are nearby.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.980
Or if you're going to visit
someone else, you want to see

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.570
all the hotels that are nearby
where they're living.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.820
So an improved map experience
really makes a big

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.310
difference to users.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.050
FRED CHUNG: Definitely.

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:41.180
Shall we take a quick look at
your other application?

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:41.620
DAN LEW: Sure.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:45.160
FRED CHUNG: FlightTrack I just
launched FlightTrack.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.870
I have a saved route.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:48.890
I clicked on it.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.290
And I have the start time.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:55.210
And this flight is
in progress.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.970
And I clicked into
the map view.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.410
It shows me a flight between
San Francisco and JFK.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.290
DAN LEW: For this one, for the
Expedia hotels, we're mostly

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.990
just using markers
and info windows.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.940
But here, we're really using
a whole array of features.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.170
So for example, it looks like
today there's a whole lot of

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.840
weather around, kind of, the
south belt right now.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.420
So we're using a ground
overlay for that.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.280
And actually one of my favorite
things, we used to

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.310
have to download the bitmap
and then add alpha

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.440
transparency on our own.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.270
And now, the ground overlay, I
can just make it transparent

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.405
right from the API itself.

00:23:32.405 --> 00:23:35.520
And we're also using
poly lines to

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.380
represent the flight path.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.000
And actually, one of the cool
things there is it supports

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.670
geodesic poly lines right out
of the box, which is one of

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:48.170
those things that before, we had
to calculate by hand all

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.270
the different ways of doing
the shortest distance on a

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.835
Mercator projection.

00:23:50.835 --> 00:23:53.770
And now, we just get that
in the library as well.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:54.230
FRED CHUNG: That's great.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.810
It sounds like you're getting a
number of features for free

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:58.990
in this update.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.580
DAN LEW: Yeah, a whole
bunch of them.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.680
FRED CHUNG: Right.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.730
I'm just looking at the weather
information that you

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.040
have added on the overlay.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.290
It looks pretty cool.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.660
So Dan, one question is that
from an engineering

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:23.030
standpoint, what sort of effort
is involved when you

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.520
need to incorporate
the new API?

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.710
DAN LEW: Well, I think initially
you need to do a lot

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.570
of reading of the documentation
because the new

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.730
API is really nothing like
the old map view.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.920
I mean, for one thing,
it's fragment-based.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.710
It's modern.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:42.040
The whole itemized overlay
paradigm is out the window.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.610
It's completely different.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:45.630
So it took a bit of time to
read through all that.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.100
But ultimately, the new library
is just so much easier

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.210
to use that it really only took,
I think, two days to

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.640
convert our existing apps to
using the new library.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.820
FRED CHUNG: That's great.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:02.680
So I assume you are planning
to launch soon, these apps?

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.255
DAN LEW: Yeah, as soon as we get
a chance to really update

00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:08.640
and polish it and make sure that
there's no issues just

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.590
lingering around that we haven't
tested properly yet.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:12.500
FRED CHUNG: All right, cool.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.150
I look forward to seeing the
updates on Google Play.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:16.475
DAN LEW: Yeah.

00:25:16.475 --> 00:25:16.800
Thanks.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.592
FRED CHUNG: Thank
you very much.

00:25:18.592 --> 00:25:19.464
DAN LEW: Have a nice day.

00:25:19.464 --> 00:25:20.310
FRED CHUNG: All right, thanks.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.560
Bye.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.700
Good stuff.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.590
I wanted to say thank you to
our friends from Trulia and

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.790
Expedia for sharing
their feedback.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.930
So for the developer audience
out there, I bet you really

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.210
want to check out the new API.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.900
You can get it now by
downloading the latest Google

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.280
Play Services from your
Android SDK manager.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.860
Play around with the API.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.040
And let us know what
you think.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.240
We look forward to seeing the
kinds of innovation that you

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.380
can do with the API.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:49.910
Thank you.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:50.330
MANO MARKS: Great.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:51.580
Thanks.
