Robert: From NPR News this
is All Things Considered.

00:00:02.874 --> 00:00:03.789
I'm Robert Siegel.

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:05.464
Michele: And I'm Michele Norris

00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:07.965
A lot of struggling math
students have found comfort

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.852
in the sound of this man's voice.

00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:11.961
Sal: Welcome to the presentation

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:14.213
on using the quadratic equation.

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:16.460
Michele: Salman Kahn
started making math videos

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.789
to help tutor his cousin,

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.467
but they became so popular he quit his job

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:23.240
with a hedge fund to
work on them full time.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.381
Now his online Khan
Academy attracts countless

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:27.872
teachers and students.

00:00:27.872 --> 00:00:30.654
NPR's Larry Abramson
reports on the first effort

00:00:30.654 --> 00:00:35.152
to brings Khan's approach
into the classroom.

00:00:35.152 --> 00:00:37.739
Larry: It is shocking.
Three dissolute students

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.651
in Northern California
are using school time

00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:42.351
to play a computer game.

00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:43.641
What's it called?

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:48.375
Student: Trigonometry
Challenge. The one half. What?

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:49.958
Student: 2X. Oh, yeah. Okay.

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.552
Larry: Fifth graders
Michael Ahn, Lucas Nuin,

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.382
and Reese Tumrie are actually hip deep

00:00:54.382 --> 00:00:57.469
in the Trigonometry
Challenge at Khan Academy.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:58.891
They're gobbling up math problems

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.874
like a plate of Doritos.

00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:02.888
This school is part of a pilot program

00:01:02.888 --> 00:01:04.790
at Santa Rita Elementary School

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.711
in Los Altos, California.

00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:07.956
They're making the Khan Academy

00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:10.470
an integral part of the math curriculum.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.376
Teacher Kami Thordarson
says for half an hour a day

00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:15.870
Khan Academy dunks these students into

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.152
a completely self-paced world.

00:01:18.152 --> 00:01:19.839
Kami: They're all in different places.

00:01:19.839 --> 00:01:23.456
Some of them are working on
calculus and high school math.

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:25.039
Some of them are working on multiplication

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.780
of decimals, and that's okay.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.940
Larry: It's okay because
students who need help

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.776
can look up the appropriate video,

00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:33.772
and listen to the academy's explanation

00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:37.364
of concepts like direct
and inverse variation.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:40.122
Sal: I'll do direct variation
on the left over here,

00:01:40.122 --> 00:01:42.639
and I'll do inverse variation,

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.604
or two variables that vary inversely

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:48.123
on the right hand side over here.

00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:50.339
Larry: Salman Kahn scribbles
on the video screen

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:51.833
and guides students along

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:55.663
with his signature approach,
patient and unthreatening.

00:01:55.663 --> 00:01:58.533
Kami Thordarson says kids
are comfortable turning

00:01:58.533 --> 00:01:59.828
to Kahn for help.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.245
Kami: It's kind of a private thing.

00:02:01.245 --> 00:02:02.243
It's not like you have to raise your hand

00:02:02.243 --> 00:02:03.341
in front of the whole class and say,

00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:06.036
"I don't get this." You can go not get it

00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:08.082
on your own and nobody
needs to know about it.

00:02:08.082 --> 00:02:11.080
Larry: There's nothing flashy
about the videos or the exercises,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.074
but somehow Khan has
clearly hit a sweet spot

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:16.658
that makes this the most
popular part of the day.

00:02:16.658 --> 00:02:19.435
Student: You square that. That's 36,

00:02:19.435 --> 00:02:22.735
and you square that. That's 9.

00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:24.833
Larry: Kami Thordarson
says during Khan time

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:27.657
her class looks more like
a busy engineering office

00:02:27.657 --> 00:02:29.333
than a traditional classroom.

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:31.846
Kid's collaborate. The
teacher facilitates,

00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:33.847
and she doesn't have to lecture.

00:02:33.847 --> 00:02:36.661
Some kids like Hannah
Albright work on their own

00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:39.655
following online exercises
as they do calculations

00:02:39.655 --> 00:02:42.434
on a whiteboard or with pencil and paper.

00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:48.619
Hannah: Nine minus seven.
Then that would be 83.

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:50.333
It's like an online teacher.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:51.909
They can help you anywhere.

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.125
Larry: You can go as fast as you want.

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:57.936
Hannah: Yeah. (students
talking) We don't have to wait.

00:02:57.936 --> 00:02:59.651
Next door in Kelly Rafferty's class

00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:01.435
kids put their name on the board.

00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:03.033
Some want help on a concept.

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:04.434
Others offer to teach something

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:05.858
that they've mastered.

00:03:05.858 --> 00:03:07.493
Rafferty says that Kahn helps her deal

00:03:07.493 --> 00:03:09.836
with the big class sizes that even

00:03:09.836 --> 00:03:12.134
this affluent district is facing.

00:03:12.134 --> 00:03:14.340
Kelly: Kahn has definitely helped me reach

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.752
all of the students so when
you have that many kids,

00:03:17.752 --> 00:03:20.728
you end up sort of teaching to the middle.

00:03:20.728 --> 00:03:24.840
Kahn has allowed me to reach
the lowest and the highest.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.730
Larry: Much more than a
textbook would Rafferty says.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.663
Kahn Academy also offers a kind

00:03:29.663 --> 00:03:31.230
of back office function.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.750
While kids are working independently

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.334
on exercises, Rafferty checks her computer

00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:36.934
to see how they're doing.

00:03:36.934 --> 00:03:38.244
Kelly: With this I can
look at all the kids,

00:03:38.244 --> 00:03:41.250
and I can see who's struggling, who's not,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.082
which they've passed, how
many it took for them to pass.

00:03:44.082 --> 00:03:46.334
It gives me a lot more information.

00:03:46.334 --> 00:03:47.534
Larry: Information she can use

00:03:47.534 --> 00:03:49.837
to see who needs extra help.

00:03:49.837 --> 00:03:52.829
Santa Rita Elementary
Principal Sandra McGonagle says

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.440
for her the Khan Academy has some

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.250
big advantages over other math materials.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.633
Sandra: One, it's free, and it's created

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:02.833
by people who really just love math.

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.634
The quality is so great.

00:04:04.634 --> 00:04:06.164
Larry: After this year's pilot program,

00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:07.544
the Los Altos schools are going

00:04:07.544 --> 00:04:10.182
to start using Khan Academy district wide

00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:12.411
for 5th and 6th grade.

00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:13.830
The Khan Academy is hoping to see how

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.305
this experiment plays out

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:17.138
in a wider range of schools.

00:04:17.138 --> 00:04:20.315
They expand to at least
10 new schools next year.

00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:22.641
Math class may never be the same.

00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:26.567
Student: I'm okay. (students talking)

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.000
