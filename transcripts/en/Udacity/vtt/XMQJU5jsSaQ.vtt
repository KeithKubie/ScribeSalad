00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.330
Now we draw our image at location 192 by 192. Which as you can see placed the

00:00:05.342 --> 00:00:10.420
top left corner of the image, 192 by 192 pixels up from the top left corner of

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:15.305
the canvas, which has been conveniently placed at location zero, zero on the page.

00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:20.159
That is to say that on the canvas, the origin of its coordinate system, i.e., the

00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:24.911
location of it's zero, zero, is in the top left hand corner. Any drawImage functions will

00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:29.774
follow this coordinate system and place the top left hand corner of the image at

00:00:29.786 --> 00:00:32.942
the location specified by the drawImage call.
