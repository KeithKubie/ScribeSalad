00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.800
[Music]

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.300
Music is the language of the soul.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.690
For thousands of years, humans have been creating
songs and symphonies which enthrall, inspire

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.200
and hypnotize.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.340
Our history and our culture is closely entwined
with musical notes.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.289
It should come as no surprise that music has
a profound effect on the human mind.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.170
We've all felt it before; music helps us relax,
it gives us goosebumps and it encourages us

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.220
to push ourselves to the limit.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.150
But what's the science behind all of this?

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.300
Here are seven psychological facts about music.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.150
The Mozart Effect; the Mozart Effect is one
of the most popular scientific concepts surrounding

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.150
music.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.360
It was developed by Dr. Gordon Shaw a few
decades ago, and the premise is simple; classical

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.219
music makes you smarter.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.140
In his research, he claimed that listening
to classical music can raise your IQ by up

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.480
to 9 points.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.960
The main basis for this line of thought has
to do with spatial reasoning.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.030
This type of brain activity is used in math,
chess, engineering and science.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.560
According to the Mozart Effect, classical
music boosts spatial reasoning considerably.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.149
Maybe it's time to start playing some Mozart
while we study.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.080
Music therapy helps repair brain damage.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.470
Brain damage is one of the most discussed
topics in the world of psychology.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.820
Some people suffering from brain damage go
through tremendous pain and discomfort, and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.040
their life is seriously impacted.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.750
But what if music could help?

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.619
New research shows that music can actually
repair brain damage, and it's been hypothesized

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.580
that music therapy could be responsible for
neurogenesis, which is the birth of new brain

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.040
cells.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.100
Hearing music in your dreams is incredibly
rare.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.080
Think about every dream you've ever had, can
you remember hearing music in a single dream?

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.920
If you're like the vast majority of the population,
you've probably never heard so much as a jingle

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.330
in your dreams.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.450
According to a 2018 study, only 6% of all
remembered dreams include music.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.890
Unsurprisingly, you're much more likely to
hear music in your dreams if you're a musician

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.330
or someone who listens to a lot of music.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.090
But even then, the number is still very low.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.540
Your entire brain is activated when you listen
to music.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.810
There aren't many activities that make your
whole brain light up, but listening to music

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.670
is definitely one of them.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.030
When you listen to music, there's not a single
part of your brain that isn't activated.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.710
Parts of the brain that are responsible for
emotions, creativity and even motor functions

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.030
are working while listening to music.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.670
So if you're looking for a full brain workout,
simply put on your favorite song.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.360
Music can improve language proficiency.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.440
The relationship between language and music
is one of the most fascinating things in the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.080
world of psychology.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.390
To put it simply, these two things are very
closely linked to one another.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.050
A 2012 study pointed out that despite what
previous research suggested, music and language

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.490
are not separate functions in the brain.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.850
Traditionally, speech functions were thought
to exist in the left hemisphere of the brain

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.740
while music functions existed in the right
hemisphere.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.950
But today, it's widely accepted that both
hemispheres are responsible for music and

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.950
speech.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.140
What this means is that music functions can
actually improve speech functions and vice

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.150
versa.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.340
In a sense, both activities are working the
same muscle.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.630
Your taste in music says a lot about your
personality.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.310
Have you ever wondered why you like certain
music?

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.640
Have you ever wondered why your favorite songs
might sound absolutely terrible to others?

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.900
The answer lies in our unique personalities.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.260
Numerous studies have shown that if you like
a certain musical genre, you're probably going

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.660
to have certain personality traits.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.780
For example, a 2004 study found that extroverts
were more likely interested in music in a

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.140
general sense, but they were also more likely
to enjoy pop music.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.140
That's just one example and there's tons of
research on this one topic.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.930
Think about your favorite song, what does
it say about your personality?

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.060
Music therapy helps children with autism.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.070
Remember what we said about music lighting
up the entire brain?

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.760
Well, this makes music therapy an ideal choice
for children with autism.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.569
When both hemispheres are activated, children
are self-aware while still forming relationships

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:21.030
with others.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.770
Research has shown that this type of therapy
is incredibly beneficial for autistic children

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.990
as it encourages them to interact with their
instruments and communicate with others in

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.660
a band, ultimately creating music in a collaborative
effort.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.160
What do you think your favorite songs says about
you?

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160
Comment below.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.160
Thanks for watching!
