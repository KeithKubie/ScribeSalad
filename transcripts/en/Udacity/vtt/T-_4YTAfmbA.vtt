00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.800
In addition to choosing
major breakpoints,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.490
where layout changes significantly,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.240
it's also helpful to add minor
breakpoints to make some small changes.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.930
For example, between major breakpoints,
it may be helpful to adjust margins and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.820
paddings on an element.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.570
Or to increase the font size to make
things, a little bit easier to read and

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.670
feel more natural in the layout.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.800
In this case let's boost the font, when
the viewport width is between 400 and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.910
550 pixels,
where our break point kicks in.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.300
I'll also separate the low and
high temperature, so

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.150
that they're not on the same line and
make the weather icons bigger as well.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.490
Let's switch to the source and
I'll add a media query that's applied,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.220
when the viewport is between 450 and
550 pixels.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.800
It ups the base font,
changes the low and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.890
high temperature to be inline block,
and increases the icon size.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.099
I'll save the file, and
then take a look in the browser.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:08.560
Sure enough, my icons are now bigger,
my fonts are now bigger, and

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.980
everything looks like I expect it to.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.570
In this before and after, you can
see how things have really changed.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.080
The icons are much bigger,
the font sizes have also changed, and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.800
the minimum and maximum temperatures are
now shown in a slightly different way.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.850
For larger view ports I want to limit
the maximum width of the forecast page.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.820
Panel, so that it doesn't consume
the entire view port as it gets wider.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.010
I already have a link style sheet
with min-width query of 700 pixels.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.940
So in there, I just need to
set some margins and padding.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.230
Let's take a look.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.430
I'll set the width to 700 pixels,
and set margin left and

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.440
margin right to auto.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.430
I'll come back to Chrome, hit Refresh,
and now we've got what I want.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.180
There you have it.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.440
You can use minor break points,
to adjust the little things and

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.420
really make things shine.
