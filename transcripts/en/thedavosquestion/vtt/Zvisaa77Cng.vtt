Hi You Tube, I'm Rick Haythornthwaite, Chairman
of MasterCard. And I think in Davos the whole

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:13.400
issue about regulation ethics has been a big
issue. My view is very clear, that yes, absolutely,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.369
chief executives or senior executives must
have a code of ethics. But there's no such

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.179
thing as one size fits all. That's what boards
are for and that's what chairmen are for,

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.749
to make sure that ethic occurs. And the best
CEOs have that anyway, they don't need boards.

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:33.649
But occasionally the board has to step in
because on very few occasions it goes wrong.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.460
Unfortunately those few occasions police in
public opinion so it's important to get someone

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.920
for these.
