and then say,

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:54.620
"Yo, you playing tomorrow?"
That's just how we do it.

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:56.122

God damn it, you're supposed
to say "fore," [BLEEP]!

forehead, here come the ball."

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:45.905
- Let's check out Snoop's swing.

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.773
He got a stiff-ass takeaway,

chains smackin'
all over his face.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.645
He got them Greg Oden knees
look like two bent blunts,

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:54.814
and he got a slice
over the top swing.

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:57.984

Have you guys ever encountered
any haters, any racists?

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.846 align:start position:0%

of equality.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.247
- Right. Right.
- Yes.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.082 align:start position:0%

And because it's equal,

you know, everybody treats
each other equal out here.

00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:34.220
