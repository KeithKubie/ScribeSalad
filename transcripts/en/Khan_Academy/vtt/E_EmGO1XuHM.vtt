00:00:01.341 --> 00:00:03.126
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:03.126 --> 00:00:05.709
is think about the market for chocolate

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:07.320
and we're going to think about
supply and demand curves,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.149
but we're going to get an intuition

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:11.079
for them in a slightly different way.

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.670
In particular for the demand curve

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.753
we will think about the
idea of marginal benefit.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.030
Now marginal benefit, when
we're talking about margin

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.307
it's really thinking about, well,

00:00:23.307 --> 00:00:24.619
what happens on the increment?

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.070
What happens for each
little extra that you do?

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.221
So this is saying, what
is the benefit that I get

00:00:30.221 --> 00:00:34.360
if I get a little bit more
of, in this case, chocolate?

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.928
Well, from the market's point of view,

00:00:35.928 --> 00:00:37.219
imagine if there was no chocolate,

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:38.940
but there's people in the market who

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.671
crave chocolate, who dream of chocolate.

00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:43.817
If all of a sudden they were able to

00:00:43.817 --> 00:00:46.100
get their hands on some chocolate,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.138
they would get a huge benefit for

00:00:48.138 --> 00:00:51.061
that incremental amount of chocolate.

00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:53.104
Maybe for these folks, their benefit,

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:56.039
which we could quantify
as, in terms of dollars,

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.091
maybe their benefit is
50 dollars per pound.

00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:01.269
One way to think about
it, they'd be willing

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.591
to pay 50 dollars because
they get that much benefit,

00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:05.571
or if they paid less than 50 dollars,

00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:08.470
let's say they paid 10 dollars for it,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.388
well then they're getting
40 dollars of extra benefit

00:01:12.388 --> 00:01:15.900
a kind of surplus of benefit
from being able to get it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.650
at a price lower than
their marginal benefit.

00:01:21.392 --> 00:01:24.280
But then let's say more
chocolate becomes available.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.262
People still like it but some
of that really deep need,

00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:31.391
that deep addiction for
chocolate has been satiated,

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.481
and so the marginal benefit
tends for, in most markets,

00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:39.141
the marginal benefit tends to
go down as quantity increases.

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:41.840
One way to think about it,
that first initial amount

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.401
of quantity if you, so
we have some small amount

00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:48.011
of quantity right over here,
I'll say delta quantity.

00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:50.620
That first quantity, if
you multiply it times

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.830
the marginal benefit, well
that gives you an area

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.440
roughly of a rectangle
like this, it's not quite

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.128
rectangular at the top,
it's more of a trapezoid

00:01:59.128 --> 00:02:01.031
if this is downward sloping, but you could

00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:03.841
approximate it as a rectangle.

00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:06.741
But either way, the area right over here,

00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:09.492
the area under the marginal benefit curve,

00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:11.242
you could think about this as, well,

00:02:11.242 --> 00:02:14.040
that's just the benefit
that the market is getting

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.623
from consuming this
chocolate in this case.

00:02:19.442 --> 00:02:22.771
And so let's just continue on this trend.

00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:24.437
If there's more and more chocolate

00:02:24.437 --> 00:02:26.350
the market will get benefit from it,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.892
but people aren't as
excited about it anymore.

00:02:28.892 --> 00:02:30.811
They're saying, oh, well,
the chocolate's around,

00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:32.242
yeah, it'd be nice to
have a little bit more,

00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:33.821
but I don't need so much more.

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:35.121
And at some point people might be

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.501
all chocolated out, and they have maybe

00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:39.150
even zero marginal benefit from

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.710
that incremental amount of chocolate,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.942
chocolate has filled up the town,

00:02:41.942 --> 00:02:44.520
there's nowhere to actually put it.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.191
Now that won't always be the case,

00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:48.060
you might go someplace like that,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.191
but either way you think about it

00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:52.771
we would view this as our
marginal benefit curve.

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:54.870
And notice, this is exactly the same as

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.918
a demand curve in the
market for chocolate.

00:02:57.918 --> 00:03:00.120
We have plotted price versus quantity

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.582
in the market for
chocolate, but we've thought

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:05.742
about it in terms of marginal benefit.

00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:08.262
Now on the supply side
there's a related idea,

00:03:08.262 --> 00:03:12.429
we're going to think about
marginal cost, marginal cost.

00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:17.152
So let's say at first there's no chocolate

00:03:17.152 --> 00:03:19.312
being produced in this market.

00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:21.271
And a savvy entrepreneur says, hey,

00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:22.922
I know some folks who are
addicted to chocolate,

00:03:22.922 --> 00:03:25.051
they would get a lot of benefit from it,

00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:27.231
so I'm going to try to
produce some chocolate.

00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:28.321
And they look around and they find out,

00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:31.200
hey, there's actually a
derelict chocolate factory

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.441
in town that no one is
using and it's surrounded

00:03:33.441 --> 00:03:36.761
by these wild cocoa bushes
that are perfect for chocolate.

00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:38.041
And there are some people in town

00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:39.652
who are actually unemployed, but they are

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:41.782
amazing at producing chocolate.

00:03:41.782 --> 00:03:44.662
And so the first units of chocolate,

00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:48.829
the marginal cost to produce
it is actually quite low.

00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:51.573
But once you utilize those folks,

00:03:51.573 --> 00:03:52.992
you utilize that derelict factory,

00:03:52.992 --> 00:03:55.602
you utilize those free
cocoa bushes or whatever,

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.802
cocoa trees, well then
you've got to plant new ones,

00:03:57.802 --> 00:03:59.068
you've got to train new employees,

00:03:59.068 --> 00:04:00.600
you've got to build a new factory.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.533
And so to produce that next increment,

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.802
well that's going to cost
a little bit more and then

00:04:04.802 --> 00:04:06.651
a little bit more and
then a little bit more,

00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:10.050
which is the general
trend in most markets.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.651
Initially that first amount
you produce in as cheap a way,

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:14.671
using the low hanging fruit, as possible,

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.732
but then you've got to go up the tree,

00:04:16.732 --> 00:04:19.471
find higher and higher fruit,
maybe I'm mixing metaphors.

00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:22.551
But your cost, your marginal cost per unit

00:04:22.551 --> 00:04:25.872
goes higher and higher and higher.

00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:27.303
Now, what have we constructed here?

00:04:27.303 --> 00:04:29.892
Well you might say, hey, Sal,
that's a marginal cost curve.

00:04:29.892 --> 00:04:32.852
But once again, this
also could be viewed as

00:04:32.852 --> 00:04:36.860
the supply curve for
this particular market.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.582
Now what is happening at these

00:04:38.582 --> 00:04:41.002
low quantities right over here?

00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:43.669
Well, the cost of production is,

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:46.750
let's say they produce
this delta Q amount,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.482
the cost of production would be the area

00:04:50.482 --> 00:04:54.392
right over here under
the marginal cost curve,

00:04:54.392 --> 00:04:56.232
that would be the cost of production.

00:04:56.232 --> 00:04:57.301
But they're able to sell it,

00:04:57.301 --> 00:05:00.153
the benefit to the market I should say,

00:05:00.153 --> 00:05:03.352
would be the total area
under this red curve,

00:05:03.352 --> 00:05:06.312
would be the benefit to the market,

00:05:06.312 --> 00:05:08.692
the total area under this curve.

00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:12.053
So if you have the total
benefit to the market,

00:05:12.053 --> 00:05:13.992
you take out the cost, then what you have

00:05:13.992 --> 00:05:16.883
in between these curves,
you could view this

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:20.502
as a surplus, you could view this as

00:05:20.502 --> 00:05:23.547
a surplus of benefit right over here.

00:05:23.547 --> 00:05:26.285
So let me write this
down, this is surplus,

00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:28.708
and you won't hear this
term but I like to use it,

00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:29.927
because it makes it intuitive on what

00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:32.458
we're talking about,
this is surplus benefit.

00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:34.237
So as long as there's surplus benefit

00:05:34.237 --> 00:05:35.747
the suppliers are going to say, hey, wow,

00:05:35.747 --> 00:05:38.157
I can produce this cheaply, people have a,

00:05:38.157 --> 00:05:39.875
people get a lot of benefit for it,

00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:41.188
they'd be definitely willing to pay

00:05:41.188 --> 00:05:43.908
10 dollars a pound wherever I am.

00:05:43.908 --> 00:05:45.197
If people are getting this much benefit,

00:05:45.197 --> 00:05:46.497
they're definitely going to be willing

00:05:46.497 --> 00:05:48.808
to pay 10 dollars for it.

00:05:48.808 --> 00:05:50.987
So I'm going to produce some, or actually

00:05:50.987 --> 00:05:52.369
I'm going to produce some
and I could even charge,

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:55.048
I could charge anywhere
in between these areas.

00:05:55.048 --> 00:05:56.589
Maybe I could charge right over here

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.466
and I get some of the benefit and then

00:05:58.466 --> 00:06:01.108
the consumers get some of the benefit.

00:06:01.108 --> 00:06:04.675
But then another maybe
entrepreneur realizes, hey,

00:06:04.675 --> 00:06:06.997
well, there's more benefit to be had

00:06:06.997 --> 00:06:09.081
in this market, so they keep producing,

00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:13.032
they keep producing as long
as there is benefit here,

00:06:13.032 --> 00:06:15.261
as long as the marginal benefit is

00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:17.722
higher than the marginal
cost, all the way until

00:06:17.722 --> 00:06:20.401
we get to that point right over here.

00:06:20.401 --> 00:06:24.520
Now what happens, what
happens right over here?

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.941
Well we talked about
just supply and demand,

00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:27.480
we talk about that's an efficient price

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.380
and efficient quantity,
but let's just think about,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.940
we said up until this point it makes sense

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.931
to produce more and more and more.

00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:38.600
Even this increment, if we're
already at this quantity,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.261
it makes sense to produce
even a little bit more

00:06:41.261 --> 00:06:44.220
because you're going to have this cost,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.402
you're going to have this cost to incur,

00:06:46.402 --> 00:06:49.458
but then the market
could have all of this,

00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:52.758
the market could have all of this benefit,

00:06:52.758 --> 00:06:55.258
which is larger than the cost.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.029
And so you say, well, as long as I sell it

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:59.950
for something in between we can split

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.558
that surplus benefit, so to speak.

00:07:03.558 --> 00:07:06.018
But once these two lines intersect

00:07:06.018 --> 00:07:10.185
and we have the situation
where our marginal benefit,

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.327
marginal benefit, is equal
to our marginal cost,

00:07:15.327 --> 00:07:17.290
well at that point there
is no surplus benefit

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.088
now to be had, there's no really

00:07:20.088 --> 00:07:22.100
incentive to produce more than this.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.980
Beyond this point, your
incremental cost of production,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.540
your marginal cost is higher
than your marginal benefit.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.991
So, if you actually wanted
to give it to someone

00:07:30.991 --> 00:07:32.610
for their benefit, you
would be taking a loss.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.680
Or even if you just think
about the market itself,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.425
the society would be incurring more

00:07:37.425 --> 00:07:39.579
incremental cost per unit than they would

00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:42.905
be getting of benefit, so why even do it?

00:07:42.905 --> 00:07:44.920
And so this point right over here

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.478
where these two lines,
these two curves intersect

00:07:48.478 --> 00:07:50.490
and we've talked about this
with just supply and demand,

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.751
but when we think about it
in terms of marginal benefit

00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:55.920
and marginal cost, we
think about this quantity

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.090
right over here, let's
just call it Q subzero,

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.848
this quantity is considered allocatively

00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:05.939
efficient, allocatively efficient.

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:10.106
Which is a very fancy word,
allocatively efficient.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.411
Why is that the case?

00:08:13.411 --> 00:08:16.240
Well, any other quantity
would not be efficient.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.790
For example, let's say
for some reason we were at

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.957
this quantity right over
here, let's say Q, Q one.

00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:29.968
Well what happens at this
quantity right over here?

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:34.570
Well, at this quantity, at
this quantity right over here,

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.413
the marginal benefit is
higher than the marginal cost.

00:08:38.413 --> 00:08:42.580
Marginal benefit is greater
than the marginal cost.

00:08:43.733 --> 00:08:45.821
And so we're leaving a
bunch of stuff on the table,

00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:49.181
the market is leaving a
bunch of surplus benefit,

00:08:49.181 --> 00:08:52.513
you could say total surplus, on the table.

00:08:52.513 --> 00:08:56.132
And so this benefit that
the market could have had,

00:08:56.132 --> 00:09:00.863
but it does not get, this
is called a deadweight loss,

00:09:00.863 --> 00:09:05.030
deadweight loss, and we talk
about it in other videos.

00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:09.189
Remember, in the allocatively
efficient quantity

00:09:09.189 --> 00:09:11.542
we have this huge total surplus,

00:09:11.542 --> 00:09:15.922
which is the area under
the marginal benefit curve

00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:18.672
and above the marginal cost curve

00:09:19.789 --> 00:09:22.030
up until the point of intersection.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.083
But if you do a quantity less than that

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:25.671
allocatively efficient quantity,

00:09:25.671 --> 00:09:26.931
your marginal benefit is higher than

00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:28.990
your marginal cost, and you are leaving,

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:33.070
you are leaving all of this
total surplus on the table,

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.782
regardless of how you would
have actually allocated it

00:09:35.782 --> 00:09:39.713
or distributed it between the
consumers or the producers.

00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:41.493
And what if you produced a quantity larger

00:09:41.493 --> 00:09:44.239
than the allocatively efficient quantity?

00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:46.598
Once again, very fancy word, so let's say

00:09:46.598 --> 00:09:48.841
that's Q two, what happens over here?

00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:52.761
Well, here you're able to take advantage

00:09:52.761 --> 00:09:55.503
of all of this surplus right over here,

00:09:55.503 --> 00:09:57.622
this total surplus right over here,

00:09:57.622 --> 00:10:00.381
but now you're creating negative surplus.

00:10:00.381 --> 00:10:04.048
So, in this part, now
all of this area shows

00:10:05.723 --> 00:10:09.791
a net negative benefit, or
a net I guess I should say

00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:13.861
a net cost that our market is incurring.

00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:16.241
And so this here it was
a deadweight loss because

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:18.412
we were leaving stuff on the
table that we could have had.

00:10:18.412 --> 00:10:22.363
Here we're producing at
a cost that our market,

00:10:22.363 --> 00:10:24.423
not just our suppliers
are producing at a cost,

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:26.171
the benefit our market is getting

00:10:26.171 --> 00:10:28.852
is less for each incremental unit,

00:10:28.852 --> 00:10:32.352
is less than, or is far less than the cost

00:10:33.229 --> 00:10:37.813
and so we are incurring a
net negative total surplus.

00:10:37.813 --> 00:10:39.980
And so this, too, would be considered,

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.992
this, too, would be considered
a dead, let me write that

00:10:43.992 --> 00:10:47.672
in a color you can see, a deadweight loss.

00:10:47.672 --> 00:10:49.231
Deadweight loss we often
assume it was, hey,

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:51.083
we're leaving some total
surplus on the table,

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:54.354
but we also have
deadweight loss in the case

00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:57.605
where we are producing unnecessarily

00:10:57.605 --> 00:11:01.854
because the benefit is
less than the actual cost.

00:11:01.854 --> 00:11:04.083
And so whether our
marginal benefit is greater

00:11:04.083 --> 00:11:06.312
than our marginal cost, or in this case

00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:09.592
our marginal cost is greater
than our marginal benefit,

00:11:09.592 --> 00:11:12.724
we are going to produce deadweight
loss in either situation.

00:11:12.724 --> 00:11:15.172
And a properly functioning
market should be

00:11:15.172 --> 00:11:18.625
producing the quantity that
is allocatively efficient.

00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:21.152
In an ideal world and of
course all of our models assume

00:11:21.152 --> 00:11:24.633
a lot of assumptions to make
things a little bit cleaner,

00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:28.212
so we can do lines to
describe market behavior.
