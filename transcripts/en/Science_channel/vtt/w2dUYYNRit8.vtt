00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:05.267
Narrator: NORTH PHILADELPHIA
BORN AND RAISED,

00:00:05.267 --> 00:00:09.033
IN A GIANT VASE IS WHERE
HE SPENT MOST OF HIS DAYS.

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:13.133
THIS IS PHYSICS
AT ITS MOST MESMERIZING.

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.868
Narrator: GREG KENNEDY IS
THE ONLY JUGGLER ON EARTH

00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:19.868
TO NAIL NINE BALLS OF LIGHT
IN A GIGANTIC CONE.

00:00:19.868 --> 00:00:21.567
THIS GUY DOESN'T
EVEN LIKE JUGGLING.

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:23.133
BUT NO ONE WILL LET HIM
OUT OF THE CONE.

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.367
Narrator: WE'RE IN PHILLY
TO ENTER THE CONE ZONE

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:29.601
AND SHED SOME LIGHT
ON GREG'S CAPTIVATING SKILLS.

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:32.367
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED
TO CHALLENGE MYSELF.

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:35.300
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU MIGHT
SEE ME DO IN THE CONE

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.667
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT TOOK
A MONTH OR A YEAR.

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:42.634
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON SOME OF
THOSE PATTERNS FOR A DECADE NOW.

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:44.501
I'M COMING UP
WITH WHOLE NEW THINGS

00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:46.067
THAT NOBODY EVER DREAMED OF.

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:49.033
AND FOR ME, THAT'S PART
OF BEING HUMAN,

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:50.601
PART OF BEING ALIVE.

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:53.801
Narrator:
WHO WANTS TO LIFT THE LID
ON THIS BEWILDERING BALL SHOW?

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:57.634
GREG'S SKILL IS IN HOW
HE THROWS THOSE BALLS.

00:00:57.634 --> 00:00:59.167
HE DOESN'T LET THEM BOUNCE,

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:03.100
BUT INSTEAD ROLLS THEM SMOOTHLY
'ROUND THE INSIDE OF THE CONE.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.133
ONCE THEY'RE ON THE WALL
AND TRAVELING,

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.133
THE CENTRIFUGAL EFFECT KEEPS
THE BALLS STUCK TO THE WALL.

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.934
IT'S TRYING TO TRAVEL
IN A STRAIGHT LINE,

00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:13.400
BUT THE SHAPE OF THE CONE
IS MOVING IT IN A CURVE.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.567
Oluseyi:
AND THIS MEANS AT ALL TIMES,
THE BALL IS PUSHING ON THE WALL

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.767
AND THE WALL IS PUSHING BACK
ON THE BALL.

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:21.300
SO IF I TAKE A BALL
AND I THROW IT HORIZONTALLY

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.167
AND WITH THE RIGHT ENERGY,
IT'LL STAY...

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:28.100
IN A PERFECT CIRCLE.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.534
I CAN ALSO DO THAT DOWN LOW.

00:01:29.534 --> 00:01:31.868
BUT I'LL HAVE TO THROW
WITH A LITTLE LESS ENERGY.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.834
I CAN TAKE THAT BALL
AND I CAN THROW IT DOWNWARDS

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:39.667
WITH A LOT OF ENERGY...

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:41.000
AND IT WILL COME BACK UP.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.200
I CAN ALSO THROW IT UPWARD...

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.033
AND IT'LL GO DOWN AND BACK UP.

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:48.534
Narrator:
BUT HOW DO GREG'S BALLS
GO DOWN AND BACK UP AGAIN?

00:01:48.534 --> 00:01:52.300
EACH BALL IS BEING FORCED
TO FOLLOW A CURVED PATH,

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.501
WHICH MEANS IT'S GETTING
ANGULAR MOMENTUM.

00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:57.801
Oluseyi: ANGULAR MOMENTUM
IS A CONSERVED QUANTITY.

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:01.100
THAT MEANS THAT UNLESS SOME
OUTSIDE FORCE ACTS ON THE BALLS,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.167
THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM
WILL REMAIN THE SAME.

00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:05.734
ANGULAR MOMENTUM
DEPENDS ON THREE THINGS --

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:07.133
THE MASS OF THE BALL...

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:09.234
Oluseyi: ITS DISTANCE
FROM THE CENTER OF ROTATION,

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:11.901
WHICH IN THIS CASE
IS THE CENTRAL AXIS OF THE CONE,

00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:13.868
AND HOW FAST
THE BALL IS MOVING.

00:02:13.868 --> 00:02:16.133
Arney: IF YOU CHANGE
ONE OF THESE THINGS,

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:18.334
THE OTHER TWO HAS TO CHANGE

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:20.267
SO THAT THE TOTAL
IS ALWAYS THE SAME.

00:02:20.267 --> 00:02:22.667
Pampena: BECAUSE EACH BALL
IS MAKING ITS WAY

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:24.934
DOWN THE CONE DUE TO GRAVITY,

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:28.534
IT MEANS THE TIGHTNESS
OF ITS CURVE IS GETTING SMALLER.

00:02:28.534 --> 00:02:31.200
THAT FORCES THE BALL
TO GET FASTER

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.167
JUST TO KEEP ANGULAR MOMENTUM
THE SAME.

00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:36.334
THE FASTER EACH BALL GETS,

00:02:36.334 --> 00:02:40.334
THE GREATER THE CENTRIFUGAL
EFFECT ACTING UPON IT,

00:02:40.334 --> 00:02:41.767
WHICH IS PUSHING IT OUTWARDS.

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:46.534
BUT BECAUSE IT'S IN A CONE,
IT EFFECTIVELY GOES UPWARDS.

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:48.767
Narrator:
IT'S CIRCUS WITH SCIENCE.

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:50.300
Kennedy:
OVER TIME, AS I'VE GOTTEN OLDER,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.834
I FIGURED OUT IT WAS
GONNA BE BETTER FOR ME

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:55.534
TO CONTINUE JUGGLING LESS
WITH MY BODY

00:02:55.534 --> 00:02:57.234
AND A LITTLE BIT
MORE WITH MY MIND.

00:02:57.234 --> 00:02:58.968
MY CONTRIBUTION AT THIS POINT

00:02:58.968 --> 00:03:01.501
IS ACTUALLY EXPANDING
THE REALM OF JUGGLING

00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:03.767
AND CREATING NEW CONCEPTS.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:06.634
AND, IN A LOT OF WAYS, I THINK
THAT'S GONNA BE MY LEGACY.

00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:09.300
Narrator: GREG,
YOU TOTALLY OWN THE CONE.
