00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.150
- [Instructor] In this video,
we're gonna do a couple

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.320
of examples that deal with
parallel and perpendicular lines.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.850
So you have parallel,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.138
you have perpendicular,

00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:15.412
and of course you have lines
that are neither parallel

00:00:15.412 --> 00:00:17.100
nor perpendicular.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.340
And just as a bit of a review,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.990
if you've never seen this before,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.640
parallel lines they never intersect.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.300
So let me draw some axes.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.570
So if those are my
coordinate axes right there,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.530
it's my X-axis, that is my Y-axis,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.530
if this is a line that
I'm drawing in magenta,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.600
a parallel line might
look something like this.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.420
It's not the exact same line,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.720
but they have the exact same slope.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.458
If this moves a certain amount,

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:47.770
if this change in Y over
change in X is a certain amount

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.140
this change change in Y over
change in X is the same amount.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.750
And that's why they never intersect.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.750
So they have the same slope.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.490
Parallel lines have the same slope.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.130
Perpendicular lines, depending
on how you wanna view it,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.253
they're kind of the opposite.

00:01:06.253 --> 00:01:10.200
Let's say this is some line,
a line that is perpendicular

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.240
to that, will not only intersect the line,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.810
it won't only intersect the line,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.470
it will intersect it at a right angle.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.450
At a 90 degree angle.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.730
At a 90 degree angle, and
I'm not going to prove it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.270
for you here, I actually prove it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.900
in the linear algebra playlist,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.470
but a perpendicular lined slope,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.750
let's say this one right here,
let's say that yellow line

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.560
has a slope of M, then this orange line

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.690
that's perpendicular to the yellow line

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.120
is going to have a slope
of negative one over M.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.936
Their slopes are gonna
be the negative inverse

00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:46.810
of each other.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.790
Now, given this information,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.140
let's look at a bunch
of lines and figure out

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.660
if they're parallel, if
they're perpendicular,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.140
or if they are neither.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.700
And to do that, we just have
to keep looking at the slopes.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.710
So let's see, they say
one line passes through

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.350
the points four and negative three

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.470
and negative eight, zero.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.150
Another line passes through
the points negative one,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.080
negative one,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.507
and negative two, six.

00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:14.910
So let's figure out the
slopes in each of these lines.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.810
I'll first do this one in pink.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.640
So this slope right here, so line one.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.920
So I'll call it slope one.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.130
Slope one is, let's just say it is,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.730
well I'll take this as
the finishing point,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.130
so negative three minus
zero, remember change in Y,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.263
negative three minus zero, over four,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.720
minus negative eight.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.240
Four minus negative eight,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.890
so this is equal to negative three,

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.860
over, this is the same
thing as four plus eight,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.860
negative three over 12, which
is equal to negative 1/4.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.860
Divide the numerator by
the denominator by three,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.870
that's this line, the first line.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.800
Now what about the second line?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.630
The second line, the slope
for that second line is,

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.740
well let's take, here negative one,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.197
negative one minus six, over negative one,

00:03:12.198 --> 00:03:16.615
minus negative two is equal
to negative one minus six

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.586
is negative seven, over
negative one minus negative two,

00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:26.920
that's the same thing as
negative one plus two,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.430
well that's just one.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.460
So the slope here is negative seven.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.970
So here their slopes are neither equal,

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.470
so they're not parallel.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.560
Nor are they the negative
inverse of each other,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.010
so this is neither, so
this is neither parallel

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.410
or perpendicular.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.490
Neither parallel nor perpendicular,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.070
so these two lines they intersect

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.913
but they're not going to
intersect at a 90 degree angle.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.234
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:59.190
So I have here, once
again, one line passing

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.650
through these points, and
then another line passing

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.483
through these points.

00:04:04.483 --> 00:04:06.890
So let's just look at their slopes.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.120
So this one in green, what's the slope?

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.500
The slope of the green one,
I'll call that the first line.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.680
We could say, let's see change in Y,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.913
so we could do negative two minus 14,

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.960
over, I did negative two
first, so I'll do one first,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.230
over one minus negative three.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.270
So negative two minus 14 is negative 16.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.820
One minus negative three
is the same thing as one

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.650
plus three, that's over four,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.120
so this is negative four.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.770
Now what's the slope of that
second line right there?

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.550
So we have the slope of that second line,

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.830
let's say five minus,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.660
so we'll say five minus negative three,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.440
that's our change in Y,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.883
over negative two minus zero.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.460
So this is equal to five
minus negative three

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.650
that's the same thing as five plus three,

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.320
that's eight.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.610
And then negative two
minus zero is negative two,

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.830
so this is also equal to negative four.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.440
So these two lines are parallel.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.450
These two lines are parallel.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.770
They have the exact same slope.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.400
And I encourage you to find the equations

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.750
of both of these lines and
graph both of these lines

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.003
and verify for yourself that
they are indeed parallel.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.733
Let's do this one.

00:05:34.597 --> 00:05:37.380
Once again, this is just an
exercise in finding slopes.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.330
So this first line has those points.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.210
Let's figure out it's slope.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.830
The slope of this first line.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.820
One line passes through these points,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.820
so let's say three minus negative three,

00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:51.610
that's our change in Y,

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.483
over three minus negative six.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.440
So this is the same thing as
three plus three which is six

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.300
over three plus six which is nine.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.703
So the first line has a slope of 2/3.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.750
What is the second line's slope?

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.180
This is the second line there.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.010
That's the other line
passing through these points.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.820
So the other line's slope, let's see,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.003
we could say negative eight minus four,

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.150
over two minus negative six.

00:06:26.342 --> 00:06:28.840
So what is this equal to?

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.280
Negative eight minus four is negative 12.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.330
Two minus negative six,
that's the same thing

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.260
as two plus six, right?

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.750
The negatives cancel out.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.220
So it's negative 12 over
eight, which is the same thing

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.850
if we divide the numerator
and the denominator by four,

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.753
that's negative 3/2.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.820
Notice these guys are the
negative inverse of each other.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.870
If I take negative one over 2/3,

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.588
that is equal to negative one times 3/2,

00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:03.010
which is equal to negative 3/2.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.470
These guys are the negative
inverses of each other.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.940
You swap the numerator and
denominator make 'em negative,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.560
and they become equal to each other,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.513
so these two lines are perpendicular.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.880
I encourage you to find the equations,

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.080
I've already got the slopes for you,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.150
but find the equations
of both of these lines

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.750
plot them and verify for yourself

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.163
that they are perpendicular.
