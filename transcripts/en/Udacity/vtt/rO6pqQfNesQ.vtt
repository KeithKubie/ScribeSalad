00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.260
As we saw in the first of
the last three quizzes,

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.930
deciding if a system has a solution
at all comes down to looking for

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.690
equations of the form 0 = k for
some non-0 k.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.948
If we ever find one then we know
that the system has no solution.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:18.038
But deciding whether a system
has a unique solution or

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:20.728
infinitely many solutions
is much trickier.

00:00:20.728 --> 00:00:25.529
As we saw, it's not enough to just
count the number of equations or

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.460
look for an equation of the form 0 = 0.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.710
Instead, deciding whether
there's a unique solution or

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.390
not comes down to seeing if in
triangular form we end up with

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.530
every variable as a leading variable,
which we also called pivot variables.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.420
If every variable is a pivot variable,
then there's a unique solution.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.610
Otherwise, we're going to have
infinitely many solutions.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.790
In fact, each non-pivot, or

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.850
free variable, will be an independent
parameter in our solution set.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.150
This means that the dimension
of our solution set

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.090
will be equal to the number
of free variables we have.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.160
If there's one free variable,
the solution set will be a line.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.440
If there are two free variables,
the solution set will be a plane.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.340
As we move into higher dimensions,
this pattern will continue.
