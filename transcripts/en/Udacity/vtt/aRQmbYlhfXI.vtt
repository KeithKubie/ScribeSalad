Congratulations!

00:00:01.195 --> 00:00:05.420
You've made your first step
towards a path in iOS programming.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.200
This course will introduce you
to iOS app development and

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.320
swift, a new programming
language from Apple.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.140
As you dive into foundations
of programming through swift,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.690
there may be times where
you reach your strain zone.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.470
I encourage you to reach out for
support on the forums.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.840
By the end of this course, you should
have a better idea of whether iOS

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.450
app development is the right path for
you.
