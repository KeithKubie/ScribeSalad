00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.740
The optimist will say that this glass is half
full, while the pessimist proclaims it’s

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.360
half empty. Of course, others may suggest
that it’s completely FULL of the atoms that

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.530
make up water and air. Others still might
remind you that atoms are 99.99% empty space,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.380
making the glass...mostly nothing! But in
all seriousness, can science explain your

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.580
emotional perspective and outlook on life?

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.970
It turns out, it may not be in your control.
Research has shown that those with two long

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.340
alleles on specific genes controlling serotonin
are more likely to focus on positive images

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.000
- like someone enjoying ice cream - compared
to those with a short allele on the same gene,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.040
who are more likely to focus on negative images
- like someone being robbed. Variation in

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.430
the oxytocin receptor gene can also affect
your outlook; Individuals with two copies

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.850
of guanine are noted to be more optimistic
with higher self-esteem, while those with

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.130
copies of adenine were less positive. So it
seems that people may be genetically susceptible

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.670
to pessimism.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.329
Interestingly, optimists are less likely to
be rehospitalized after coronary artery bypass

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:09.810
surgery, show higher academic achievements
and even better socioeconomic status. But

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.540
it’s not all good; they can overestimate
their abilities and underestimate risk. Pessimist,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.400
on the other hand, have a more realistic view
of the world, are more cautious when planning

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.880
for the future and may even live longer. A
landmark study spanning 20 years found that

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.260
pessimists use a cautious approach to their
finances and health, avoiding risky behaviours

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.170
such as smoking and excessive drinking, ultimately
giving them the last laugh - literally - over optimists.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.710
But, statistically, most of us are hardwired
to lean towards optimism. Known as the Optimism

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.909
Bias and found in around 80% of the population,
we tend to overestimate the probability of

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.420
positive events occurring in the future, while
grossly underestimating the probability of

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.220
negative ones. For example, even though the
divorce rate can be as high as 40%, most newlyweds

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.060
predict their probability of getting divorced
at...0%. Chances are, when you imagine your

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.880
future, it’s usually better than your current
situation. Furthermore, we often imagine ourselves

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.310
as being more intelligent, sociable and honest
than other people.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.489
When we look at the brain, we actually see
the left half exhibits increased activity

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.120
when imagining positive events, whereas during
negative events the right half’s activity

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.000
increases, but to a much lesser degree. This
suggests that the brain chooses to ignore

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.540
and filter out negative information and focus
on positivity.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.319
Our perspective is, whether you’re genetically
predisposed to see the glass as half empty

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.690
or half full - don’t waste water and just
drink the damn glass already!

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.690
This actually reminded us of another common
saying though, that “Giving is better than

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.660
receiving” - but is that scientifically
accurate? We answered that one over on AsapTHOUGHT

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.410
with a special GIVEAWAY which you can click

Special thanks to audible for supporting this

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.900
episode and giving you a free audiobook at
audible.com/asap. This week we wanted to recommend

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.670
the book ‘The Wright Brothers’ which is
the amazing story behind the brothers who

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.560
taught the world how to fly - while staying
optimistic through all the challenges they

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.879
faced! You can get a free copy at audible.com/asap
or any others of your choice from a massive

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.629
selection! We love them as they are great
when you’re on the go.
