00:00:01.283 --> 00:00:02.116
(techno music)

00:00:02.116 --> 00:00:03.432
- Then I seen, like, the Virgin Mary,

00:00:03.432 --> 00:00:04.840
but she was stripping like she was dancing

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.156
to No Quarter. (laughter)

00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:06.989
And I woke up from that shit.

00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:07.939
I go, I'll never do heroin again.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:08.772
But I'm lying. (laughter)

00:00:08.772 --> 00:00:09.755
I did it in New York one time

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:11.273
in a gay bar up on the
third floor. (laughter)

00:00:11.273 --> 00:00:13.114
Ramrod. Fuck it. (laughter)
Gotta take a chance.

00:00:13.114 --> 00:00:14.199
Columbus did, right?

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.282
(intense rock music)

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:30.998
(applause)

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.417
- Welcome to This Is
Not Happening Presents:

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:33.250
One Crazy Night.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.484
So this is what we do.
A bunch of comedians

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:37.260
tell stories about a similar subject.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.642
So this is just one crazy night.

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.042
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend yours,

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:44.209
Mr. Joey Diaz, everybody.
(applause and cheering)

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:49.631
- One more time for Ari
for putting this together.

00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:52.964
(applause and cheering)

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:56.809
So all messed up, you know, like half of

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.193
the motherfuckers in here
been all fucked up, all right?

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:00.026
(laughter)

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.969
Ah, something's always fucking us up.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.427
For me, it was 30 years of just drugs.

00:01:04.427 --> 00:01:08.963
And no fucking JK here. We
got down, bitch. (laughter)

00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:11.077
All right, so, when he called me up,

00:01:11.077 --> 00:01:13.279
and he's like hey, I
want you to do the story,

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:15.780
I did like a, I got high,
right, I smoked a joint, right,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.613
(laughter)

00:01:16.613 --> 00:01:19.036
and I made like a drug
tombstone, right. (laughter)

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:22.147
Like acid, you know, '79 to like '85.

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:25.540
And then I did like Quaaludes,
you know, '80 to '87.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.704
And, you know, THC crystal
(laughter) and I went,

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:29.604
and then, you know, I
did blow for a long time.

00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:31.872
Towards the end, in 2005, I was fucked up.

00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:33.188
I really wanted to quit. I wanted to quit

00:01:33.188 --> 00:01:35.699
at the 25 year mark. You
follow me? (laughter)

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:37.835
But I just, I couldn't do it.

00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:39.218
Like once I hit that centennial,

00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:40.911
I had to fucking do something.

00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:42.698
But I had too much pride to go to a rehab.

00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:45.386
There was a rehab on Hollywood
Boulevard next to Robek.

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:47.479
I went down there for like
a week under an alias,

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.312
(laughter)

00:01:48.312 --> 00:01:49.154
but then they started snooping around.

00:01:49.154 --> 00:01:51.615
I had to get the fuck out
of there, right. (laughter)

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:52.947
In the old days, you could push an alias

00:01:52.947 --> 00:01:53.987
like a motherfucker.

00:01:53.987 --> 00:01:56.189
After 9/11, it's tough
out there for a pimp,

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.031
you follow me? (laughter)

00:01:58.031 --> 00:01:59.858
So fuck it, they saw that, Jose what?

00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:01.834
Fuck you, motherfucker,
none of your business.

00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:02.667
(laughter)

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:03.500
It's fucking anonymous, what's with

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.667
the questions, cocksucker? (laughter)

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:09.853
So. (laughter)

00:02:09.853 --> 00:02:11.396
I had done heroin before, right.

00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:13.736
Like when I was like
17, I stole this thing

00:02:13.736 --> 00:02:14.960
with Didi Contero, this little

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.825
fucking crazy Cuban kid.

00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:18.586
We stole like this thing
where you put dishes in it.

00:02:18.586 --> 00:02:19.721
It was brand new, the people left it

00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:21.227
in front of the people's houses.

00:02:21.227 --> 00:02:22.904
Me and Didi picked it up
and walked five blocks

00:02:22.904 --> 00:02:25.940
to Gunther Brown's house,
if you ask me again,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.204
I'll knock you down, right.

00:02:27.204 --> 00:02:29.660
This fucking guy, he was like
the neighborhood loan shark.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.480
Like if you stole something,
he'd buy it from you.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.313
(laughter)

00:02:32.313 --> 00:02:33.747
So I go over there,
and I'm like, you know,

00:02:33.747 --> 00:02:34.664
I want to sell you this.

00:02:34.664 --> 00:02:36.881
He's like, you can drop it off
and come back in two hours.

00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:38.909
He looked like Tony
Iommi, the guitar player

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.357
from Black Sabbath. (laughter)

00:02:40.357 --> 00:02:41.551
And he always answered
the door with a robe

00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:43.885
and his underwear showing,
like the fucking dude

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:44.828
in Boogie Nights. (laughter)

00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:48.269
He was creepy, but not really,
you know what I'm saying?

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.102
(laughter)

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:49.935
Like, you had to take a chance

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:52.319
with this motherfucker, right? (laughter)

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.669
So he goes, come back in two hours.

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.156
I go in there, we're rocking,
we're talking shit, right.

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:59.261
He goes, I got your $60. So
then he's like, hang out, man.

00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:00.788
I want to do business
and hang out with you.

00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:02.364
You seem like a cool dude.

00:03:02.364 --> 00:03:03.197
So I'm sitting there. He's like,

00:03:03.197 --> 00:03:04.465
you want to do some heroin?

00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:06.439
At the time, I had done everything, right.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.300
Like, uh, you know, coke.
I had done, like, Tuminols.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.502
I had done like, uh, THC
crystal, aka gorilla biscuits,

00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:17.669
aka fucking elephant
tranquilizers. (laughter)

00:03:18.853 --> 00:03:20.086
So I'm like, fuck it, if you want.

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:22.336
At this time, I was a
fucked up kid, you know.

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:23.487
I had no direction.

00:03:23.487 --> 00:03:25.477
I said, fuck it, I'll
do the heroin, right.

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:26.772
And I did this gagger of this white

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:27.904
Chinese fucking heroin.

00:03:27.904 --> 00:03:29.781
I heard, like, Chinese
music in the background.

00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:32.214
(imitates Chinese music)

00:03:32.214 --> 00:03:34.464
(laughter)

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.981
I do this thing, all of a sudden,

00:03:36.981 --> 00:03:38.299
it's like the fucking
room starts spinning,

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.165
and I gotta puke, and I
puked, and I pass out,

00:03:41.165 --> 00:03:42.549
and I think I'm dead.

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.972
But I heard, like, No
Quarter, by Jimmy Page.

00:03:45.972 --> 00:03:47.701
The live shit, live from the Garden.

00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:49.425
And that's how I knew I was alive.

00:03:49.425 --> 00:03:50.769
So I got up on my hands and knees,

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.941
and I sat with the puke on my face

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.302
and fucking Jimmy was blasting.

00:03:54.302 --> 00:03:55.937
At the five minute mark, if you listen to

00:03:55.937 --> 00:03:58.736
The Song Remains The
Same, fucking Jimmy Page

00:03:58.736 --> 00:04:01.294
drops it like a fucking soldier.

00:04:01.294 --> 00:04:02.127
(laughter)

00:04:02.127 --> 00:04:03.269
Especially when you're on heroin.

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.980
You got the tingles up
and down your back, right.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.893
And it was on. I felt that
heroin, the warmth from God.

00:04:08.893 --> 00:04:10.894
Like, that's what it
is. Your balls are warm,

00:04:10.894 --> 00:04:12.077
you want to come.

00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:14.012
But it don't matter, you
know what I'm saying.

00:04:14.012 --> 00:04:15.238
Like you want to come, but fuck it,

00:04:15.238 --> 00:04:17.201
it wouldn't be good enough
as the warmth you're feeling

00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:18.793
in your body, my ears.

00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:20.292
And I could see all these, like,

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:22.145
I wasn't hallucinating but it was so warm,

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:24.100
I was feeling like, I seen every woman

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.317
that I ever seen in my
life and made contact with.

00:04:26.317 --> 00:04:27.883
Not sex, I was too young for that.

00:04:27.883 --> 00:04:29.953
Like I seen the lunch
lady there, Mrs. Sabatino.

00:04:29.953 --> 00:04:32.219
(laughter)

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:34.428
I seen the lady who gave
me birth, you follow me,

00:04:34.428 --> 00:04:35.829
who smacked me in the ass.

00:04:35.829 --> 00:04:38.513
I seen the fucking nun who I
tackled in the fourth grade.

00:04:38.513 --> 00:04:40.913
I seen all these bitches
in this fucking dream.

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:43.347
I seen my mother. Then I
seen, like, the Virgin Mary.

00:04:43.347 --> 00:04:45.036
And that's when I knew I was fucked up.

00:04:45.036 --> 00:04:47.297
And she was stripping like
she was dancing to No Quarter.

00:04:47.297 --> 00:04:48.130
(laughter)

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.215
And that's fucked up right there, right.

00:04:49.215 --> 00:04:50.048
(laughter)

00:04:50.048 --> 00:04:51.817
And I had already made my confirmation,

00:04:51.817 --> 00:04:53.381
I was fucked up right there, I was

00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:55.926
fractured as a Catholic
already at that age, right.

00:04:55.926 --> 00:04:58.269
(laughter)

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:00.210
So that was it. When I
woke up from that shit,

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.244
I go, I'll never do heroin again.

00:05:01.244 --> 00:05:04.122
But I'm lying. I did it again
at the halfway house in '94,

00:05:04.122 --> 00:05:06.061
right, then I did it in New York one time

00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:08.094
at a gay bar up on the
third floor, Ramrod.

00:05:08.094 --> 00:05:09.254
That's what you do when you're up there.

00:05:09.254 --> 00:05:10.714
Fuck it. You've gotta take a chance,

00:05:10.714 --> 00:05:12.563
Columbus did, right?
(laughter and applause)

00:05:12.563 --> 00:05:14.515
Gotta do heroin at a gay bar, fuck it.

00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:16.082
That's how you know and shit.

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:17.545
You're over there dancing,

00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:19.336
looking at the gay dudes and shit,

00:05:19.336 --> 00:05:21.355
(laughter)

00:05:21.355 --> 00:05:23.971
driving them fucking
bananas and shit. Anyway.

00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:25.238
(laughter)

00:05:25.238 --> 00:05:27.222
So it's 2005, I'm living in Hollywood,

00:05:27.222 --> 00:05:29.955
and I'm doing a fucking gram
of blow a night sometimes.

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:32.251
That was like a bad night.
By eight o'clock every night

00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:35.550
I'd be watching TV and I'd get
this pain in my fucking soul.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.674
And I'd get, my bones would
hurt. I couldn't hear the TV.

00:05:38.674 --> 00:05:41.000
Like I wanted to watch
something on TV and I couldn't.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.308
And I get in my car and I take the ATM.

00:05:43.308 --> 00:05:45.977
I lived on Schrader. And
I go all the way to Sunset

00:05:45.977 --> 00:05:47.440
and fucking Hollywood Ralph's.
Rock and Roll Ralph's.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.306
There's an ATM right there.

00:05:49.306 --> 00:05:51.040
And I sweared on my fucking mother's grave

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.217
I wouldn't stop for a red light.

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:55.284
I didn't give a fuck,
I didn't give a fuck.

00:05:55.284 --> 00:05:56.274
I parked right in front of there,

00:05:56.274 --> 00:05:58.733
put my hazard lights on,
fuck it, like a doctor.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:05:59.824
(laughter)

00:05:59.824 --> 00:06:02.023
Without a handicap sticker,
I don't give a fuck.

00:06:02.023 --> 00:06:03.023
(laughter)

00:06:03.023 --> 00:06:05.345
I take out 60 bucks and right
there I call the drug dealer.

00:06:05.345 --> 00:06:06.178
I had a couple of them.

00:06:06.178 --> 00:06:07.945
The Armenian only came on the weekends.

00:06:07.945 --> 00:06:08.778
(laughter)

00:06:08.778 --> 00:06:09.611
The black guy was there every night,

00:06:09.611 --> 00:06:10.815
and the Mexican motherfucker was there

00:06:10.815 --> 00:06:12.130
like four nights a week, depending

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.657
what shift he was working.

00:06:13.657 --> 00:06:15.290
So I knew all their shifts and shit.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.143
So I would go buy a gram, go home,

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:18.943
do it in the fucking garage, go upstairs,

00:06:18.943 --> 00:06:20.519
make believe I was shitting and jerk off

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:22.426
in the bathroom or look
out the fucking window.

00:06:22.426 --> 00:06:23.367
That was the extent of
my fucking addiction

00:06:23.367 --> 00:06:24.682
at the time.

00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:26.335
Then at two o'clock
when it would wear off,

00:06:26.335 --> 00:06:28.392
I called another drug dealer so

00:06:28.392 --> 00:06:30.800
they wouldn't know my addiction, right.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.601
Now, was I going to go to
a fucking rehab? Fuck no.

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:34.727
So I'm talking to a buddy of mine one day.

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:36.463
After 9/11, he moved back to Newark.

00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:37.903
I go, I say, you living with your mother?

00:06:37.903 --> 00:06:38.831
He's like forty something.

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:40.043
I go, so do you still do heroin?

00:06:40.043 --> 00:06:41.528
He goes like, fuck yeah, every night.

00:06:41.528 --> 00:06:42.995
He goes, I cop down in Newark.

00:06:42.995 --> 00:06:44.661
I cop seven dollar bags of heroin.

00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:46.568
I go, send me a couple.

00:06:46.568 --> 00:06:47.401
Now.

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:50.997
You ever have a
conversation with somebody,

00:06:50.997 --> 00:06:52.821
and they, you just try to be cool.

00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:54.781
You're like, yeah, count me in.

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:57.937
Wrong fucking dude, right. (laughter)

00:06:57.937 --> 00:06:59.982
(laughs) About a week
later, I go to my mailbox.

00:06:59.982 --> 00:07:01.689
And it was in like
Crayola writing, you know.

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:04.462
(laughter)

00:07:04.462 --> 00:07:07.097
Like, Joey, Koko. He spelled Koko wrong.

00:07:07.097 --> 00:07:09.982
With two K's and shit. Diaz, right.

00:07:09.982 --> 00:07:11.934
And I'm like, what the fuck? (laughter)

00:07:11.934 --> 00:07:14.302
No return address, right.
I take it upstairs.

00:07:14.302 --> 00:07:15.448
I open it, and there they are.

00:07:15.448 --> 00:07:17.232
Three little fucking bags of H.

00:07:17.232 --> 00:07:19.659
White, that Chinese
shit that the terrorists

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:21.766
are bringing in like a
motherfucker. (laughter)

00:07:21.766 --> 00:07:24.294
By the day load with a
picture of Obama on it,

00:07:24.294 --> 00:07:25.718
balls ass naked, (laughter)

00:07:25.718 --> 00:07:27.686
smoking a joint and
shit, with a white chick

00:07:27.686 --> 00:07:32.419
licking his fucking nuts,
like a doctor, right.

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:33.916
So I'm like, fuck it. So
I'm, I'm doing the blow

00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:35.083
every night, so there's Monday night.

00:07:35.083 --> 00:07:36.788
I go, fuck it, tonight's
a different night.

00:07:36.788 --> 00:07:39.372
I'm doing, like a little line of this H.

00:07:39.372 --> 00:07:41.180
And I usually, what I would
do, I was fucking crazy.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.628
My girlfriend's great. She don't get high.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:43.461
So I would trick her. I'd go,

00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:44.426
you gotta go to bed, dog.

00:07:44.426 --> 00:07:48.270
You gotta get eight hours. (laughter)

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.176
You're at that age. You need
every fucking (mumbles).

00:07:50.176 --> 00:07:51.760
Don't worry about me.
I'm a fucking comedian.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.069
This is what I do. (laughter)

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:54.811
You gotta go to bed right now.

00:07:54.811 --> 00:07:56.453
While all this is going on,

00:07:56.453 --> 00:07:59.162
there was a cat population
growing in my backyard.

00:07:59.162 --> 00:08:00.553
(laughter)

00:08:00.553 --> 00:08:01.554
And I had already adopted three

00:08:01.554 --> 00:08:03.755
of these little motherfuckers, right?

00:08:03.755 --> 00:08:05.822
And they had, the problem
was, they had two.

00:08:05.822 --> 00:08:07.778
They had the mama, who was a dirty whore,

00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:09.595
and then they had two big
cats that were slinging dick

00:08:09.595 --> 00:08:10.578
like, you know. (laughter)

00:08:10.578 --> 00:08:13.153
They had the Siamese, the
warbler, I called him the Samurai.

00:08:13.153 --> 00:08:15.824
He had big black balls.
(laughter) But he was Siamese.

00:08:15.824 --> 00:08:16.921
I'm not kidding you. When he'd walk,

00:08:16.921 --> 00:08:18.770
he'd walk all fucked up. (laughter)

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.331
Like this guy fucking meant it.

00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:21.604
Never talked to me, nine years.

00:08:21.604 --> 00:08:23.464
Never took a lobster, nothing.

00:08:23.464 --> 00:08:25.032
He was a soldier. He'd just stare me down.

00:08:25.032 --> 00:08:27.424
Fuck you, bitch. You ain't
buying my fucking love,

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:28.808
cocksucker, right.

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:29.641
(laughter)

00:08:29.641 --> 00:08:31.313
Then there was a black and
white one who was a big cat,

00:08:31.313 --> 00:08:34.008
and they were both fucking mama,
so she kept having kittens.

00:08:34.008 --> 00:08:36.150
And then they would kill the kittens

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.419
so she would stop ovulating
and get back to fucking.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.808
This is how serious these
motherfucking cats were, right.

00:08:41.808 --> 00:08:42.703
(laughter)

00:08:42.703 --> 00:08:44.067
Now how did I learn about this? You know,

00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:45.719
I did some reading on the internet.

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:47.663
When you're doing coke,
you stay up late night.

00:08:47.663 --> 00:08:49.111
(laughter)

00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:52.044
And you do investigating, you follow me?

00:08:52.044 --> 00:08:54.328
So she had the kittens,
and they were beautiful.

00:08:54.328 --> 00:08:55.761
There were three Siamese kittens.

00:08:55.761 --> 00:08:58.162
And this one black and white
dirty motherfucker, right.

00:08:58.162 --> 00:08:58.995
(laughter)

00:08:58.995 --> 00:09:00.788
But the three Siameses, there
was two girls and a boy,

00:09:00.788 --> 00:09:03.207
DJ, DJ was the best
little cat in the world.

00:09:03.207 --> 00:09:05.623
They lived outside, and I'd
step out in my backyard,

00:09:05.623 --> 00:09:06.706
and I'd go, DJ.

00:09:06.706 --> 00:09:08.714
And he'd come fucking
running like a superhero.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:09.923
And the two little girls would come.

00:09:09.923 --> 00:09:12.073
And then that Superbad,
this little black and white

00:09:12.073 --> 00:09:12.923
would come.

00:09:12.923 --> 00:09:14.935
And like, they would
all hang out around me.

00:09:14.935 --> 00:09:16.351
But Superbad, the black and white one,

00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:19.016
would take DJ and take
him up trees and shit,

00:09:19.016 --> 00:09:20.258
and take him off the territory.

00:09:20.258 --> 00:09:22.266
Would take him on Selma by the YMCA.

00:09:22.266 --> 00:09:23.571
And I'd have to get Superbad,
going one of these days,

00:09:23.571 --> 00:09:25.766
I'm going to fucking kill
you, cocksucker, right.

00:09:25.766 --> 00:09:27.462
And I caught myself. Even
though I loved the cats,

00:09:27.462 --> 00:09:28.580
I would never put a hit on a cat.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.413
(laughter)

00:09:29.413 --> 00:09:30.246
But in my mind,

00:09:30.246 --> 00:09:31.079
(laughter)

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:32.380
I'm like I'm gonna fucking kill

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.007
this little fucking cat, seriously.

00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:35.364
And I love cats, don't get me wrong,

00:09:35.364 --> 00:09:36.650
but do you know those
cats that just get on

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.483
your last fucking nerve.

00:09:37.483 --> 00:09:38.316
(laughter)

00:09:38.316 --> 00:09:39.149
And you don't know how to do it,

00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:40.076
but you love animals too much,

00:09:40.076 --> 00:09:42.326
so you know you just
bullshitting yourself.

00:09:42.326 --> 00:09:43.619
So I, I'm like one day, he's just gonna

00:09:43.619 --> 00:09:44.982
get hit by a truck or something, fucking

00:09:44.982 --> 00:09:45.815
that little cocksucker.

00:09:45.815 --> 00:09:47.268
Don't hang with him no more, DJ.

00:09:47.268 --> 00:09:48.101
(laughter)

00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:50.162
And I was just waiting
to bring DJ upstairs,

00:09:50.162 --> 00:09:51.794
and I had a chick that was gonna take

00:09:51.794 --> 00:09:54.142
the two Siameses, and then fuck Superbad.

00:09:54.142 --> 00:09:54.975
I didn't know what the hell was going

00:09:54.975 --> 00:09:56.768
to happen to Superbad, right.

00:09:56.768 --> 00:09:59.736
So, my addiction's
getting worse and worse.

00:09:59.736 --> 00:10:01.923
And one night I got home
and my wife was fucking,

00:10:01.923 --> 00:10:03.985
at the time she was my
girlfriend, she's crying.

00:10:03.985 --> 00:10:05.317
And she said, the fucking cats outside,

00:10:05.317 --> 00:10:06.150
they're going to die.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.251
I go what the, what are you talking about?

00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:09.353
So we got the two girls.
We brought them to the vet,

00:10:09.353 --> 00:10:11.686
and she adopted them out through Petco.

00:10:11.686 --> 00:10:13.344
And then I go, what are you
going to do with Superbad,

00:10:13.344 --> 00:10:15.861
that fucking mutt, and DJ, my baby.

00:10:15.861 --> 00:10:17.283
And she goes, well, I'm
gonna bring them up.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.606
And I go, leave Superbad outside.

00:10:18.606 --> 00:10:19.613
(laughter)

00:10:19.613 --> 00:10:20.643
Just leave him the fuck outside.

00:10:20.643 --> 00:10:22.125
That's how much I hated Superbad.

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:23.757
(laughter)

00:10:23.757 --> 00:10:25.974
So I go out one night.
And my rule was, people,

00:10:25.974 --> 00:10:27.309
this is how fucked up in my addicted mind,

00:10:27.309 --> 00:10:28.759
my rule was never to do coke in the house

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:30.018
cause it was bad luck.

00:10:30.018 --> 00:10:32.334
(laughter)

00:10:32.334 --> 00:10:33.411
I would always do it in the car,

00:10:33.411 --> 00:10:34.493
so by the time I got upstairs,

00:10:34.493 --> 00:10:35.877
I had to shit and I'd
run into the bathroom

00:10:35.877 --> 00:10:37.292
and hide, you follow me? (laughter)

00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:38.844
That was the fucking plan. I had a plan.

00:10:38.844 --> 00:10:41.118
I was an organized cocaine
type of motherfucker, right.

00:10:41.118 --> 00:10:42.061
(laughter)

00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:43.085
So this night, something happened,

00:10:43.085 --> 00:10:43.918
I had to go to the bathroom.

00:10:43.918 --> 00:10:45.710
I didn't have time, I ran upstairs,

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.587
and when I got upstairs, my
wife goes in the bathroom.

00:10:47.587 --> 00:10:49.031
The two cats are in the bathroom.

00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:51.396
So I go in the bathroom,
and I, I do the coke,

00:10:51.396 --> 00:10:52.515
and I'm looking at the both of them.

00:10:52.515 --> 00:10:53.391
I'm like, I don't even know

00:10:53.391 --> 00:10:55.465
why she fucking brought you up here.

00:10:55.465 --> 00:10:58.367
And I go back outside, and I do the coke,

00:10:58.367 --> 00:11:00.461
and I probably got some oh,
I don't know fucking story,

00:11:00.461 --> 00:11:01.748
and I went to bed.

00:11:01.748 --> 00:11:02.898
And when I got up, my wife woke me up

00:11:02.898 --> 00:11:03.731
in the middle of the night.

00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:05.265
She goes hey, I just want to tell you

00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:06.748
that fucking DJ died.

00:11:06.748 --> 00:11:09.421
And that was the Siamese that
I was gonna adopt, right.

00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:11.500
And, ah, when she said it, guys,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.966
I fucking knew it was the
coke. I fucking knew it.

00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:17.910
And I just said, do me
a favor, close the door,

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.735
and I cried a little bit,
and I put the pillow,

00:11:19.735 --> 00:11:21.387
I put my sleep apnea mask on first,

00:11:21.387 --> 00:11:23.127
then I went to fucking bed, right.

00:11:23.127 --> 00:11:23.960
(laughter)

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.811
Yeah, whatever, sleep apnea,
whatever the fuck it is.

00:11:25.811 --> 00:11:26.747
I'm a fat dude, right. (laughter).

00:11:26.747 --> 00:11:28.087
And then,

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:29.915
so I'm laying there thinking
I finished my crying.

00:11:29.915 --> 00:11:31.323
I go, you know what, that little cat died

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:33.131
because I brought the coke upstairs.

00:11:33.131 --> 00:11:35.021
Even if I fucking hate Superbad,

00:11:35.021 --> 00:11:36.715
that motherfucker's not
going to die up here,

00:11:36.715 --> 00:11:37.947
cause that's even more bad luck.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:39.915
So I went in there, I
got on my hands and knees

00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:41.214
like a Catholic fucking soldier,

00:11:41.214 --> 00:11:44.387
and I said, God, if you
save these fucking cat,

00:11:44.387 --> 00:11:48.245
this Superbad who I can't
stand, I'll never do coke again.

00:11:48.245 --> 00:11:50.021
And I like, winked at
him, like right, whatever.

00:11:50.021 --> 00:11:52.271
(laughter)

00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:55.823
I said, God, don't let
this motherfucker die.

00:11:55.823 --> 00:11:58.157
And I promise you, and like the first day,

00:11:58.157 --> 00:12:00.183
I had the jitters, you
know, but every day,

00:12:00.183 --> 00:12:02.982
I would go in the bathroom, and he'd live.

00:12:02.982 --> 00:12:04.141
Like, by the fourth day, I was ready

00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:06.207
to fucking shoot myself. (laughter)

00:12:06.207 --> 00:12:07.574
I was ready just to shoot him and end it.

00:12:07.574 --> 00:12:08.751
I would go in there like, die.

00:12:08.751 --> 00:12:10.069
Don't you feel like dying yet?

00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:11.318
(laughter)

00:12:11.318 --> 00:12:12.461
It's over. You don't want to live.

00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:14.853
It's fucking terrible. Things
are tough out there, trust me.

00:12:14.853 --> 00:12:15.742
(laughter)

00:12:15.742 --> 00:12:17.792
That was seven years ago,
and I haven't done blow.

00:12:17.792 --> 00:12:19.578
I'll tell you what, I'll
tell you how close I am

00:12:19.578 --> 00:12:21.539
with this filthy motherfucker that I love.

00:12:21.539 --> 00:12:23.464
Cause if you go to my house
and you look at my cats,

00:12:23.464 --> 00:12:25.379
and you look at him, and you're like, eh.

00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:27.433
(laughter)

00:12:27.433 --> 00:12:28.811
He's like Marilyn on the Munsters,

00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:29.848
you follow what I'm saying to you?

00:12:29.848 --> 00:12:30.681
(laughter)

00:12:30.681 --> 00:12:31.722
I got good looking Siameses and he's like

00:12:31.722 --> 00:12:34.156
black and white, and he
got a little head and shit,

00:12:34.156 --> 00:12:35.324
but he's fearless.

00:12:35.324 --> 00:12:36.644
Well, I'll tell you
how much that dude knew

00:12:36.644 --> 00:12:38.385
I'd made a promise for
him, cause at night,

00:12:38.385 --> 00:12:40.808
my other cats are cool, but
they ain't that fucking cool.

00:12:40.808 --> 00:12:42.793
But at night, when I go in to my bedroom,

00:12:42.793 --> 00:12:45.282
I take my slippers off, I
put my sleep apnea mask on,

00:12:45.282 --> 00:12:48.401
I put the fan on, and I lay
down, and I pick the blanket up,

00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:49.275
and I go, Superbad.

00:12:49.275 --> 00:12:50.815
And wherever the fuck
this motherfucker is,

00:12:50.815 --> 00:12:52.714
you hear, like, boom. You
hear him hit the door.

00:12:52.714 --> 00:12:55.359
And he jumps next to me, and
I put the blanket over him,

00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:56.699
and that's the end of the fucking night.

00:12:56.699 --> 00:12:59.025
He's still there, cocksuckers. Stay black.

00:12:59.025 --> 00:13:00.418
Thank Ari Shaffir one more time

00:13:00.418 --> 00:13:02.034

00:13:02.034 --> 00:13:02.933

00:13:02.933 --> 00:13:05.306

00:13:05.306 --> 00:13:06.306

00:13:07.489 --> 00:13:08.322
