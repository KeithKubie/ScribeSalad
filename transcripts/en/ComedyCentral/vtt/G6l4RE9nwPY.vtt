ANNOUNCER:
<i> And now a special message</i>

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.440
<i> from the 45th and final
 president of the United States.</i>

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:13.279
Welcome
to the presidential response

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:16.315
to my presidential
State of the Union.

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:19.585
Here's my speech
about my speech.

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:21.788
I did it! I did it!

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.924
I read all the words as they
were put in the right order,

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:27.894
and I'd never even
seen them before.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.196
Nobody can do that but me.

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.032
I'm not just America's leader.

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:35.068
I'm America's reader!

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.070
Tonight I made history.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.205
I'm very proud to announce

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:41.574
that this is the first
State of the Union

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:43.910
to stream live on PornHub.

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.279
After every big performance,

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:49.015
I always run
to my dressing room.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:51.150
Which is my plane!

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:55.054
I hide there and wait
for the reviews to come in.

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:57.256
And they're unanimous!

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.128
Tonight is the night I finally
became presidential again

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.530
for, like, the 17th time.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.299
Everybody loved it.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.167
It was so incredible.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.036
Everyone was standing.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.238
But I wish I was a Democrat

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:15.441
because they didn't have
to stand at all.

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:19.112
Did you see those guys
behind me-- Mike and Paul?

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.181
They look like the top
of a gay wedding cake.

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:25.351
But we both know
they're bottoms.

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:28.121
This is a new American moment.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.456
Before I took office,

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:34.327
all our moments
were old and Australian.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.562
They were all in the past.

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:39.799
And now, we're in the future,
and in the sky

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:42.101
where no one is underage.

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:46.105
Tonight I said we will no longer
allow immigrants

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:48.074
to exploit loopholes.

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:50.843
Exploiting loopholes
will be reserved

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:54.514
for real estate developers
like me.

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:58.751
I also announced
my four pillars of immigration,

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:01.787
and I'll announce them again.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.090
Be white.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.292
Don't<i> not</i> be white.

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:09.962
Have a marketable skill
like being white.

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.198
And Norway.

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.767
Oh, and<i> Norbit!</i>

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.370
That's the secret fifth pillar.

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.672
Wow! I remembered it!

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:24.410
MAUREEN: What are you...
what are you doing, sir?

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:26.646
I'm holding for applause,
Maureen.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.648
MAUREEN:
Oh. Okay.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.650
-Applause.
-Okay. Okay. Okay. -(clapping)

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.218
-Okay, that's enough, Maureen.
-Sorry.

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.519
-Save it.
-Sorry. -(clapping stops)

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:35.354
-Don't push it.
-Sorry, sir.

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:37.723
-Clap again, Maureen!
-All right. -(clapping)

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:40.293
She's an incredible welder.
