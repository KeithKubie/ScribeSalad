00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
&gt;&gt; We had a meeting this morning, a lively
discussion of the global gender parity group.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:17.090
We talked about the issue of maintaining our
commitment to gender parity during a time

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.270
of economic stress, we talked about it in
the corporate context. And a major strategy

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:33.130
that evolved was to use the diversity in the
organization as a particular set of skills

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.659
or capabilities to address the crisis. Actually
use diversity as a way to address the crisis.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:47.199
For example, women often times can communicate
and lead teams through a crisis situation,

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:54.329
by reaching out and making an appeal to the
sense of community to deal with the crisis.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.059
As far as a barrier or constraint, we talked
about the fact that a deep crisis creates

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.150
a risk aversion and fear and that undermines
the ability of the organization to perform

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.390
as a team. And as people get more and more
concerned about their own situation, those

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.190
concerns began to dominate the concerns of
the organization. We concluded that it was

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:25.820
very important to renew oneâ€™s commitment
to parity and equity in opportunity and promotion

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:36.060
in retention, efforts in talent development
during periods of economic stress.
