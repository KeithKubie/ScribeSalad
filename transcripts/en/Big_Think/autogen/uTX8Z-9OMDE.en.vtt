even if we cut dramatically in our
 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.359
even if we cut dramatically in our
carbon emissions now we wouldn't really

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.369
carbon emissions now we wouldn't really
 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.929
carbon emissions now we wouldn't really
be able to see the impact by 2050 and we

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939
be able to see the impact by 2050 and we
 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.150
be able to see the impact by 2050 and we
would only see a smaller impact towards

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160
would only see a smaller impact towards
 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.429
would only see a smaller impact towards
the end of the century so most of global

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439
the end of the century so most of global
 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.200
the end of the century so most of global
warming is simply going to happen if we

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210
warming is simply going to happen if we
 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.540
warming is simply going to happen if we
have to face up to that we have to say

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550
have to face up to that we have to say
 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.179
have to face up to that we have to say
we should also talk about adaptation now

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189
we should also talk about adaptation now
 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.040
we should also talk about adaptation now
this doesn't mean we shouldn't also fix

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050
this doesn't mean we shouldn't also fix
 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.109
this doesn't mean we shouldn't also fix
climate change but we need to look at

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119
climate change but we need to look at
 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.810
climate change but we need to look at
adaptation how should we tackle this

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820
adaptation how should we tackle this
 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.910
adaptation how should we tackle this
well we again love to believe that this

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920
well we again love to believe that this
 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.530
well we again love to believe that this
is something that individuals and

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540
is something that individuals and
 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.329
is something that individuals and
companies could do something about but

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339
companies could do something about but
 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.100
companies could do something about but
fundamentally this is much more about

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110
fundamentally this is much more about
 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.979
fundamentally this is much more about
what should societies do the simple and

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989
what should societies do the simple and
 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.789
what should societies do the simple and
very broad bruh a brushed answer is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:47.799
very broad bruh a brushed answer is
 

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:50.410
very broad bruh a brushed answer is
societies that are rich that are well

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420
societies that are rich that are well
 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.210
societies that are rich that are well
structured that have good infrastructure

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220
structured that have good infrastructure
 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.910
structured that have good infrastructure
a much better able to deal with all the

a much better able to deal with all the
 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.619
a much better able to deal with all the
problems that the world throws at it

problems that the world throws at it
 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.929
problems that the world throws at it
including global warming for instance if

you look at hurricanes if a hurricane

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890
you look at hurricanes if a hurricane
 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.880

hits Florida it costs a lot of money but

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890
hits Florida it costs a lot of money but
 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.530
hits Florida it costs a lot of money but
it's still only a couple percent in

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540
it's still only a couple percent in
 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.350
it's still only a couple percent in
terms of GDP of Florida and it kills

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360
terms of GDP of Florida and it kills
 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.870
terms of GDP of Florida and it kills
very few people if it hits Honduras it

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880
very few people if it hits Honduras it
 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.680
very few people if it hits Honduras it
will cost easily one-third two-thirds of

will cost easily one-third two-thirds of
 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.610
will cost easily one-third two-thirds of
Honduras GDP and it will eradicate tens

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620
Honduras GDP and it will eradicate tens
 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.980

it's about having better planning it's

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090
it's about having better planning it's
 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.149
it's about having better planning it's
about having better infrastructure it's

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159
about having better infrastructure it's
 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.430
about having better infrastructure it's
about having better ability to withstand

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440
about having better ability to withstand
 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.920

us this has the advantage of not just

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970
us this has the advantage of not just
 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.700
us this has the advantage of not just
being able to protect us against global

being able to protect us against global
 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.530
being able to protect us against global
warming but also all the other problems

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540
warming but also all the other problems
 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.660
warming but also all the other problems
that we probably haven't even started

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670
that we probably haven't even started
 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.750
