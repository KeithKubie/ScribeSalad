00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:02.160
We humans love to meddle.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.950
We just get our little homosapien brains workin'
and the next thing you know BAM.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.580
Disaster.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:16.410
What's up people, Trace here for DNews -- How
do you feel about invasive species?

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.980
Thanks to humans meddling with the environment
we've got nutria all over the damn place,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.900
rabbits in Australia, the Kudzu vine here
in the US, cane toads, nile perch, asian carp,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.900
zebra mussels...

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.350
We're... not awesome at this invasive species
thing are we?

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.840
An invasive species is one that is brought
to an area and outperforms the native species,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.450
often pushing them out as it consumes resources
and out-breeds the locals.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.960
There are so many invasive species around
the world that here in the US we have a National

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.960
Invasive Species Council and information centers
from the EPA and the Department of Agriculture

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.340
-- they affect every aspect of natural life
all over the world.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.310
Before our tendency to take stuff with us
natural barriers like mountains, oceans and

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.500
the like kept many species at bay -- no pun
intended -- but now we bring them all over!

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.100
Burmese pythons are an invasive species in
Florida.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.650
In case you never realized... their name is
BURMESE.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.650
As in Burma.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.650
South Asia.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.390
They were either accidentally or purposefully
released and now there are as many as 100,000

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.020
of these 20+ foot behemoths slithering around
down there in the Everglades.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.540
Even doing something as simple as moving firewood
can bring with it an invasive species, like

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.030
the Emerald Ash Borer which is native to Asia
and thanks to us humanos has devastated the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.070
ash population in 14 states and Canada causing
$3.5 billion dollars in damage, every year!

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.680
How'd it get here from Asia?

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.640
We're not exactly sure, but it's likely they
hitched a ride on an automotive parts crate

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.640
shipped to Detroit.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.060
So now that we know that invasive species
are bad, we should like.. stop them and stuff,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.060
right?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.060
So.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.060
How...
[eyebrows]

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.060
...
Exactly.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.060
It's really really hard!

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.140
State and Federal agencies have spent millions
attempting to contain species with a smattering

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.470
of success, and now we're getting ready to
play this game again.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.490
In California and Florida, they grow citrus
fruit.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.680
It's a thing they do.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.930
But the Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP) is just
reaving all over their crops.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.380
And no one likes reavers.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.479
The pest gets into their trees and carries
a bacterial infection that attacks the fruit

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.390
causing it to shrivel up and taste terrible.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.920
Kill the psyllid, save the fruit!

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.309
So now the growers have imported a wasp from
Pakistan to do the dirty work -- the Tamarixia

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:21.489
radiata has been released periodically since
2011 and SO FAR it seems they're ONLY attacking

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.709
the ACPs.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.599
Since then fruit yields have improved and
the University of California Riverside says

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.980
the wasps have only migrated about 65 miles
from their release points... so far...

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.780
Knowing what we all know about invasive species,
Is the industry pulling a 'Crazy Ivan' to

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.819
save their fruit trees?

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.260
Could this actually work?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.330
Or are we just kidding ourselves?

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.200
Tell us what you think and thanks a bunch
for checking out DNews today!

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200
See you next time.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.379
Bye guys!
