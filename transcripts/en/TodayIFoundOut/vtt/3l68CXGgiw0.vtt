00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.630
Most moms are pretty great, so great in fact
that in the early 20th century a woman called

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:21.020
Anna Jarvis campaigned tirelessly to recognise
them on a national scale- a decision Jarvis

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.250
would later come to regret culminating in
her more or less dedicating her life and life’s

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.920
savings to destroy the Frankenstein’s monster
of a holiday the greeting card industry molded

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.129
her creation into.

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.120
First celebrated on May 10, 1908, the first
official Mother’s Day was a somewhat sombre

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.180
affair marked by a touching speech given by
the aforementioned Anna Jarvis in memory of

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.180
her late mother, social activist Ann Maria
Reeves Jarvis, who’d passed away some 3

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.180
years earlier.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.010
The approximately 70 minute speech, which
was delivered in the auditorium of the Wanamaker’s

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.950
department store in Philadelphia to a reported
crowd of about 5,000 people, was by all accounts

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.580
profoundly moving and resonated deeply with
the audience in attendance.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.900
Around the same time, Jarvis paid to have
500 white carnations sent to the Andrews Methodist

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.140
Episcopal Church in Grafton, West Virginia,
where she once taught Sunday School, with

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.200
attendees encouraged to wear these as a small
token of their gratitude for all their own

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.750
mothers had done for them.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.590
While this was by no means the first attempt
Jarvis had made to celebrate mothers as a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.880
concept, it was the first that had a big ol’
stack of cash behind it, with noted Philadelphia

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.869
businessman and former U.S. Postmaster General
John Wanamaker (who owned the store Jarvis

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.550
gave the aforementioned speech at) backing
Jarvis financially and politically.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.200
Spurred by the success of the event, Jarvis
began a letter writing campaign to have Mother’s

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.950
Day officially recognised as a national holiday.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.369
After six years, she got here wish, with Mother’s
Day being acknowledged by no less of an authority

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.239
than the President of the United States himself,
Woodrow Wilson.

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:03.470
On May 9, 1914, he issued a presidential proclamation
that read that this is the day we “[publicly

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.759
express] our love and reverence for the mothers
of our country.”

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.230
The thing is, as soon as Mother’s Day became
officially recognised as a national holiday,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.950
the greeting card and floral industry began
circling it like hungry sharks that had smelled

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.140
the unmistakable whiff of a seal basting itself
in BBQ sauce.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.459
Jarvis responded by denouncing any commercialization
of Mother’s Day, thinking any attempt to

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.079
make money off of Mother’s Day – even
if it was for a good cause – was wrong and

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.100
not in the spirit of the thing.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.000
After all, something like a hand written note
expressing your personal feelings is far superior,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.909
in her opinion, than some store bought card.

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.040
As she said,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.890
A printed card means nothing except that you
are too lazy to write to the woman who has

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.030
done more for you than anyone in the world.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.030
And candy!

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.150
You take a box to Mother—and then eat most
of it yourself.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.670
A pretty sentiment.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.190
She went on in a 1924 interview with the Miami
Daily News,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.349
The white carnation is the emblem of Mother’s
Day because it typifies the beauty, truth

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.510
and fidelity of mother-love.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.480
This emblem is used on the Mother’s Day
association printed matter and official buttons.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.680
But it does not mean that people should wear
a white carnation.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.739
This false idea has led to florists flagrantly
boosting the price of white carnations for

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.439
the Mother’s Day trade.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.660
The red carnation has no connection with Mother’s
Day.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.900
Yet florists have spread the idea that it
should be worn for mother who has passed away.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.180
This has boosted the sale of red carnations.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.769
Confectioners put a white ribbon on a box
of candy and advance the price just because

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:38.769
it’s Mother’s Day.

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.999
There is no connection between candy and this
day.

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.609
It is pure commercialization.

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.799
Thus, offended by the amorphous blob of empty
saccharine sentiments her creation had been

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.930
morphed into, Jarvis spent the rest of her
life trying to destroy Mother’s Day, among

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.640
other things filing countless lawsuits against
various entities related to the holiday, including

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.540
one against a non-profit Mother’s Day organization
headed up by none other than First Lady Eleanor

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.540
Roosevelt.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.630
Although, it should be noted that while Jarvis
hated the commercialization of Mother’s

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.400
Day, in fact, it is very possible that had
it not been commercialized it would have been

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.140
largely relegated to a minor holiday, or disappeared
altogether, as has happened to numerous other

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.340
such holidays over the centuries.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.390
As you look at the history of holidays, the
ones that survive and become extremely popular

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.810
are nearly always the ones that get commercialized
in some way.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.460
If there’s money to be made on a certain
holiday, businesses will literally advertise

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.330
the holiday, making sure that it is as popular
as it can be and that it sticks around.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.890
Of course, this would have been little consolation
to Jarvis, who would rather have seen Mother’s

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.430
Day die completely than see the commercialized
version survive, with Jarvis lamenting “that

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.120
she was sorry she had ever started Mother’s
Day.”

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.099
In the end, Jarvis was unable to stop Mother’s
Day from becoming something she didn’t want.

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.639
She subsequently went into reclusion in the
final years of her life.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.000
In debt, angry and in failing health, she
lived for a time in a giant brick mansion

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.120
in Philadelphia with her blind sister, Lillian.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.520
Outside the mansion was a sign alerting visitors
“Warning — Stay Away.”

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.130
Eventually her health declined to the point
where she herself went blind and she needed

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.949
outside care, at which point she was put into
the Marshall Square Sanitarium in Pennsylvania.

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.270
As she didn’t have any money to pay for
the care she was receiving there, ironically,

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.979
the bill was reportedly largely paid for by
a group of businessmen in the floral industry

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.199
that so benefited from her great idea.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.639
Naturally so as to avoid upsetting the elderly
Jarvis, it appears she was never told of their

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.630
part in paying for her care.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.780
Jarvis ultimately lived to the ripe old age
of 84, dying penniless and, as she never married

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.160
nor had children, more or less alone in the
sanitarium…

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.750
If you’ve ever wondered why it is “Mother’s
Day” and not “Mothers’ Day”, that

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.050
is largely thanks to Jarvis who stated it
should “be a singular possessive, for each

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:26.710
family to honour their mother, not a plural
possessive commemorating all mothers 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.460
in the world.”
