00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.970
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Welcome.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.110
I'm Steve Winick and we are
here at the Library of Congress

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.520
where I will be interviewing
Connie Regan-Blake

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.540
with my colleague Valda Morris.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.020
Valda and I both work in the
American Folklife Center here

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.530
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.390
So, I will begin our
interview with Connie.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.600
Connie is a prominent
storyteller.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.890
And so, I'm interested
in your early life

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.850
and how you became
interested in storytelling.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.420
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
Well, I never knew

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.200
that this might unfold this way.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.710
When I was in grade school,
high school, I loved math.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.430
I ended up going to
college to get my--

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.320
I thought my doctorate in
mathematics and help people,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.850
put people up in a spaceship.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.440
I want to work with NASA.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.060
And things shifted, you
know, as they often do.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.010
I ended up getting a
degree in political science

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.540
which some people say is a good
background for storytelling.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.610
But I decided that I didn't
want to go to any more school.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.520
I thought about law school.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.730
And I'd work during the
summers and I'd save my money.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.130
And so, I bought a one way
ticket to Europe and ended

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.150
up hitchhiking and
living over there

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.720
for about a year and a half.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.120
And when I came back, my
cousin, Barbara Freeman,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.260
who has become my storytelling
partner for 20 years,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.510
she was a librarian,
children's librarian

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.390
at a library in Tennessee.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.070
And she told me we are
looking for a storyteller.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.610
You know, it was
unheard of really

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.380
to hire a full-time storyteller,
but still it is kind of today.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.680
But that's what they
were looking for.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.040
They'd gotten a federal
grant to take the library

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.370
out to daycare centers which
in 1971 was also brand new.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.380
That was a new thing
coming into the world.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.070
And so, they hired me to
tell stories to all three,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.370
four and five-year-olds.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.460
And that was the very beginning.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.460
I was at the library for
four years loving it,

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.360
but then decided that what
I really wanted to do was

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.630
to travel with storytelling.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.660
And that's when Barbara
and I quit our jobs

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.300
and got a pickup
truck and headed out.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.660
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: So, you
bought a pickup truck?

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.960
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
That's right.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.260
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris:
That's interesting.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.560
Why a pickup truck?

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.100
Not-- Why not a car?

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.400
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
Well, we put a--

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.450
I used to call it a camper.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.900
But someone said
it's not a camper.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.200
It's tiny.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.500
It's a topper.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.200
So, that's what we actually
lived out of for three years.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.620
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: So,
how was it on the road?

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.060
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
It was amazing.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.890
You know, I look back on it now
and a lot of people will say

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.010
when they've heard story
or during those days even,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.200
they would say, you sure are
putting in your time or you're--

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.990
you know, as if it
was a big hardship.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.020
But I'll tell you, everywhere
we went, people opened

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.440
up their hearts and their homes.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.600
They end up inviting us on stage

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.030
and it was a marvelous
adventure.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.880
And there were certain times
when, you know, it was pouring

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.340
down rain and we had to get
out to make a phone call to see

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.700
if that nursery school-- make
sure we have the right address

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.840
to go there the next
morning to tell stories

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.850
or to the local college
to teach a workshop.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.200
So, there were some
of those moments.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.910
But we actually devised a
system called business weeks.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.040
And so, we would
each take a week.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.100
And that meant if it was raining

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.880
and it was your week,
you had to get out.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.230
You had to make sure
that truck was locked.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.550
But in general, the experience
on being on the road then

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.890
and meeting people in the folk
world and in the library world

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.400
and just in the world
in the general,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.320
people just welcomed us.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.760
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: And how long
were you on the road for?

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.400
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
Three years.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.910
You know, again, when
I think about that,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.470
it's like, how did we do that?

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.770
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Yeah.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.070
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
But, you know,

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.370
we didn't have almost any money.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.670
We put money we had.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.090
We needed to have it take us a
long way and mostly pay for gas.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.170
And we actually did not
end up staying in the back

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.830
of that truck all that much
because often, librarians

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.240
or people that ran the
festivals, you know,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.570
they always had extra bedrooms
or would say you can crash

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.110
on the floor or something.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.880
But we always had
that as a backup.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.160
So, it wasn't like every time
we were traveling, it was like,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.670
you know, because we never
could've afforded hotels

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.970
and things.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.760
And so, it was great
having the truck

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.340
for that reason especially.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.640
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: All right.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.230
So, one of the figures that
comes up in your descriptions

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.230
of your own sort of life

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.080
in storytelling is Ray
Hicks and his family.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.310
How was it that you
came to meet Ray

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.690
and what was his
influence on you?

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.800
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Enormous
influence and enormous influence

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.310
to this day, continuous.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.640
I met him at the very first
National Storytelling Festival.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.530
And a friend had told
me about that festival

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.990
and I wrote the person
that was--

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.820
Jimmy Neil Smith who has become
the director and a leader

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.580
of the first organization.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.860
And I wrote him and said
I'm a storyteller and I live

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.380
in Chattanooga down the
road from Jonesborough.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.780
And he wrote me a letter
and said, come on up.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.670
We'll put you on the stage.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.970
S, I told Barbara.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.270
I said, we got to go up there.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.260
And so, we went to this
festival on a Sunday afternoon

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.010
and I remember the moment
that they introduced Ray.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.000
And he walked up on stage,
all six feet seven inches tall

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.870
and he had on those
bib overalls.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.230
He always had one gallus open,

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.680
had a can of Prince
Albert tobacco

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.800
and he would roll his
cigarettes, you know,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.110
and had harmonica in there.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.760
And as soon as he was finished,
they transported all of us

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.000
that day into another world.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.620
And when the storytelling was
finished, Barbara and I went

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.510
up to meet Ray and
his wife Rosa.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.220
And we walked around
downtown Jonesborough.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.320
And he told us Wicked
John and the Devil.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.690
We asked him lots of questions.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.340
And that began this
long friendship.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.060
Actually, Rosa in later
years because I was--

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.860
really they were-- we were
like family until each

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.430
of them passed away, and
that was in the 2000s.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.460
So, I got a good chunk
of time with them.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.740
And I remember Rosa telling me.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.890
She said that she had fallen
in love with me that day

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.140
as we walked around
Jonesborough.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.470
And so then, we found out--

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.430
you know, I found out where
they lived in every chance.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.650
I got both with Barbara
and just on my own.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.810
And then after folk tellers
came to a close in '95,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.620
I kept up a real
relationship with him.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.480
And I felt like there's
so much to say about Ray.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.190
But to try to put it into
a sentence or two, it was--

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:20.290
he did open a lot of windows
for me and showed me a path

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.530
to storytelling that
really is of the heart

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.190
and of the whole body.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.290
He was one of the most
present storytellers I've

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.590
ever encountered.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.200
And I feel like that's
just one of the many gifts

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.770
that he gave me because that's
something I really aimed for to.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.980
It's not this memorized text
or it's not, you know, yeah,

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.280
I'm going to tell that
story or it's right there.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.950
It's brand new for him.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.550
You could just see it
unfolding in that moment.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.380
So, it was-- I am so glad
my life has been enriched

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.930
in so many ways because
of the Hicks family.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.230
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: OK.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.210
So obviously, Ray has-- had
a lasting impression on you.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.340
Do you have any other mentors

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.960
or any other traditional
storytellers

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.910
that would play a
role that Ray did?

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.210
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.060
Not anything quite
on that same place.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.850
There certainly have been people

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.840
that have influenced
me in wonderful ways.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.120
Kathryn Windham who was not
really telling stories exactly

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.550
then, but had been a journalist,
came from that background.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.170
And she and I became
deer friends.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.030
And she had a directness
about her.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.170
It's not-- She's a southerner--
She was a southerner.

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.820
She was born and
raised in Selma.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:43.210
And so, she had that
[inaudible] about her,

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.660
but also this directness

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.140
that she would just
cut through things.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.520
So, I feel like she taught
me a lot in that area too.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.620
And, you know, Jackie
Torrence became a good friend

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.970
and she taught me a lot

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.470
about using my hands
when I tell stories.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.020
She was fantastic at that.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.320
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Yeah.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.620
She was good for the gestures.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.920
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Yes.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.840
I feel like I've learned from
a lot of people along the way,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.140
and also from a lot
of folk musicians.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.660
Because when we first
started telling, when Barbara

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.650
and I were traveling
in that little truck,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.630
there was only two festivals,

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.460
storytelling festivals
in the United States.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.180
And so, we were mostly being
invited on to the stages

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.830
at folk music festivals.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.820
And there were so many people
that went to bat for us

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.850
because back then, it wasn't
just sending a text to him.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.670
It was sitting down
and writing a letter,

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.400
making a long distance call to
the Winnipeg Folk Festival or,

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.730
you know, out to Vancouver,
out to San Diego or something.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.020
It took a lot more effort.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.950
And everywhere we went, as we
met people and people heard us,

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.870
they really, you know,
said to other people,

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.840
you got to hire these two, you
got to put them on main stage.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.910
And-- Because I think
then if any--

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.950
We didn't really know anyone
telling stories, but--

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.250
except Marshall Dodge.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.590
Now, he was another influence.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.110
Oh gosh, and we just--
we all fell in love,

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.410
you know, with each other.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.600
It was just amazing, what
an extraordinary unusual man

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.900
he was.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.190
But he was the only-- And he
called himself a humorist.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:28.110
But he was the only that was
kind of on that folk circuit.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:33.600
But a lot of people-- At that
time, it really took a couple

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.330
of decades before this shifted.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.320
When people heard the word
storytellers and storytelling,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.150
they immediately went
to children thinking

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.560
that it was only for children.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.910
It certainly is for children.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:50.520
But I think all of the people
that helped us in so many ways,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.530
they're the ones that
told the festival folks,

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.860
you got to put them
on main stage

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.560
because this is for adults.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.980
This is for everyone,
but it's for adults.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.910
Don't just put them
in the children's.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.730
Put them there too.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.610
But put them-- And I
think that was a huge gift

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.510
because it could've turned
out very differently.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.990
It could've still been,
you know, a great ride.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.910
But I think it would've
turned out very differently.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.210
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: All right.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.150
Well, you mentioned before the
National Storytelling Festival

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.960
and your first experience there.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.230
Could you expand on
that on how that was--

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.530
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Oh gosh.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:29.160
Yes. So when I'd written
Jimmy Neil and actually

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.420
in the archives have a copy
of the letter he wrote me back

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.370
in 1973 and saying, you
know, yeah, come on up.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.780
And if we have time,
we'll put you on.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:43.090
So on that Sunday afternoon
after Ray had told stories,

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.270
some politicians had gotten
up and there was some music,

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.440
they asked if anyone
wanted to tell a story

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.560
and I raised my hand and
went right up and told one.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:59.730
And then I've been involved
in the Cosby Folk Festival.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.000
It's actually around
John McCutcheon

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
in '72 I think it was.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.300
But I've been involved there

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.570
and had told some
stories there as well.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.410
And through this wonderful
confluence of events,

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.400
I ended up back in Jonesborough
because I met an amazing woman,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.620
grandam of Jonesborough,
Caroline Moore,

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.430
and I went up to
visit her and it was

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.330
about a month before the
second storytelling festival.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.310
And when I pulled up
into her driveway,

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.930
she had a dramatic
flair about her.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.350
And she didn't even
let me get inside.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.580
She just said, Connie,
come with me.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.260
And I got into the
car and she drove me

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.540
down to Jimmy Neil
Smith's office.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.000
And she opened the door to
the kitchen of the restaurant

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.980
that he was running at the
time, The Parson's Table.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.270
She opened the door and said,
Jimmy Neil, here she is.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.570
And she closed the door.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.700
And I wasn't quite
sure what that meant.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.260
Come to find out.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.860
She must have called
him or something.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.320
But he then said, will you
come and be a storyteller

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.040
at the second national?

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.830
So, that was in a month.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.420
I said I'd be delighted
to and I was.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.320
And then at the third, I think
the third, by the end, Barbara

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.180
and I had quit our jobs
and we were featured.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.140
And I actually-- You
might already know this.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.810
But I actually have, that I'm
so proud of, a distinct honor

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:25.670
of being the only person, the
only storyteller to be on stage

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.430
at all 45 festivals so far.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.730
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Wow.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.030
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: So,
I have been on stage either

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.770
as a featured teller or as
an emcee every single year.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.380
And I'm going back this
year as a featured teller.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.680
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: All right.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.980
Congratulations.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.280
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: I
have quite a history there.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.580
Yeah.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.810
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: That's
quite an accomplishment.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:48.240
OK. So, you have been involved

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.030
in the national storytelling
scene now what we call the

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.040
national storytelling revival.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.700
How did you see the scene
growing and changing over time?

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.980
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Well,
you know, in those early days,

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.850
as Jimmy Neil used to say,

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.790
he ran the fourth
there in Jonesborough.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.360
And Barbara and I, I think I
was never on stage without--

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.360
all these festivals, music
events, coffee houses and things

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.820
like that without telling
people about that festival.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:22.610
And in some ways, it grew in
this wonderful way because if--

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.330
there had been 3,000
people the second year,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.630
it might have fallen apart

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.930
because they couldn't
have handled it.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.020
But it was 150, and
then it went up to 400

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.330
and it kept growing till
today to where there's

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.890
about 10,000 people
or something.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:41.420
But it's changed a lot, you
know, this net of storytellers

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.340
that goes out across the United
States and across the world now.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.840
It brings in lots
of different people.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:54.440
In the United States, a real
shift happened in the 1980s

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.320
where people started
telling a lot

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.620
of personal experience stories.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.340
Before then, it was
all traditional.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.610
You would maybe tell
a little bit about--

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.380
you know, I might tell about
Ray and how I got this story,

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.750
but your stories or all
the traditional stories,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.680
those ones that have been around
hundreds or thousands of years.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.730
And in the late 80s,
that started shifting.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.470
And I think that
shift has maintained.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:28.630
And now, there's a lot of people
telling funny stories on stage

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.270
about themselves
or their childhood.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.330
And I really like a blending.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.630
I love now.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.760
It's a wonderful
experience to be--

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.890
I tell not so much about
my fourth grade teacher,

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.860
but more about my own adventures
traveling around the world

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.870
and I also tell some true life
stories about historical figures

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:53.190
or people that I've met who
had amazing lives or something.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.920
So, I don't tell
all traditional.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.200
But I really like
the interweaving.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.620
And I think we're
missing something by a lot

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.260
of people turning
away from tradition.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.430
And one thing that we're missing
is introducing our listeners

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:13.330
to these traditional
stories because, you know,

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.610
they might have that same
idea that we used to have

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.240
about storytelling
is only for kids.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.540
They might have that idea.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.970
Traditional stories
are a little boring

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.400
or who would want to
really tell those.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.980
But if they could see some of
their favorite storytellers

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.670
and see more of them or go to
an event and in the evening hear

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.590
at least half traditional
stories,

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.200
I think it could
really change things.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.380
Not only for storytellers
coming up in what they're doing,

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.220
but there's something
about the old stories.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.990
There's a reason they've
been told for these hundreds,

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.840
sometimes thousands of years.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.140
It resonates in us.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.310
There's something in our
DNA that wants to hear those

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.500
and then often wants
to tell them.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.770
And if we turn away from that,

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:05.280
I think we're losing a
richness as human beings.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.880
I know what you mean.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.920
And you definitely have observed
something there in that shift

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.080
to personal stories which
I think nowadays for a lot

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.270
of people, that's what
storytelling means.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.570
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: I
think that's what it is.

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:18.870
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Yes.

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:21.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: -- and
all of those radio programs--

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.970
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: I
remember a poignant letter

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.950
that I got during
some of this shift.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.390
And it was from a
seventh grade teacher.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.950
And it was after the National
Storytelling Festival.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.180
This was maybe in the 1990s.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.870
And she said, you know, I used
to always be able to come back

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.440
after a weekend in Jonesborough

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.450
and tell the stories
to my students.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:44.850
Now, I can't tell
them because they're

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:48.340
about somebody else's
experience when I went swimming.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.640
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.940
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: You know.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.240
The other thing that I'll
mention and I'm heartened

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.670
by this is that this is
only in the United States.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.490
You know, in Ireland, I was
in a festival last year,

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.680
this time actually, the
Cape Clear Festival,

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.050
it's almost all traditional
stories.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.100
And you go down to New
Zealand or Australia,

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.340
you're hearing traditional
stories,

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.390
and other places all
around the world.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.520
So, it seems that America
is the one that's gone more

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.820
on this path.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.210
And I love that people
are listening to The Moth,

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.850
having StorySLAMs, but I would
just want that room, you know,

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.720
to invite the old stories
up there with us too.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.220
Well, going back to your
experience with Barbara

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.170
as the folk tellers,
you and Barbara

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.930
to a certain extent have
different storytelling styles.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.890
So, how did you-- Could
you explain a little bit

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.630
of the dynamics of creating
a story with the two of you?

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.240
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
Well, it was very easy.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.500
All we would do what we
called tandem stories.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.660
And now, there are tandem--
a lot of tandem tellers.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.250
So, that's-- that phrase is
still definitely out there.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:57.650
But we would swap
lines back and forth

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.650
and then say words together
and then go back to swapping

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.760
and telling one story together.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.090
We also told our
individual stories.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.470
So, an evening would
include all of that.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.760
But in these tandem stories,
sometimes people would say, oh,

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.560
I bet you really have
to practice those

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.570
and your timing is so precise.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:21.680
But we likened it more
to family gospel singers.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.030
You know, their voices
just kind of go right in

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.230
and there is almost
this intuitive sense.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.550
So, we would, you know,
work out a story sometimes

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.860
when we were driving around
those first three years.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.800
We decide who would
say what, you know,

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.700
and kind of work on things.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.900
But it was not this laborious,
oh, we got to figure this out.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.120
It just was-- You know,
it's kind of there.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.880
It was clear and we would
just go right into it

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.080
and our voice is clicking.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.690
I think because we're
related, we're first cousins.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:50.990
That might be part of it.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:59.730
And so, that's not any kind
of an effort which is lovely.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.040
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris:
So, you have a--

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.210
you had a play which ran for
a couple of years as well?

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.510
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Yes.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.810
Yes.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.110
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Can you
please tell us about that play.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.410
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
Oh boy, it was great.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:13.570
The reason-- The impetus for
the play, I had gotten married

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.160
to my dear sweet husband Phil.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.250
And I wanted to stay
in Asheville more.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.940
I didn't want to be
traveling quite as much.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.910
And Barbara was up for
hanging around more too.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.180
And so, we wrote this play.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.160
We thought first that--

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.900
we didn't ever thought
about it being a play.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.390
We thought it would be an
evening of our stories,

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.660
but more polished in
deciding ahead of time

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.330
which stories we would tell,

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.700
how they would unfold
for the evening.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.020
And so, we asked a dear
friend, John Basinger, to come

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.080
and help us put that together.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.580
And it was in the summer time

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.550
and he brought his
daughter, Savannah Basinger.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:58.340
And what ended up unfolding
out of that was this play

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.700
about our great aunt Jenny.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:05.300
It's part fictional,
part our own biography.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.990
And then, we interwove all
the stories that we wanted to.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.130
We co-wrote it, the four of us.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.920
And we called it Mountain
Sweet Talk and it ran

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.330
for seven seasons in Asheville,
over 300 performances.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.140
And actually, I love these
little titles and such,

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.050
but it actually is still
Asheville's longest running

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.180
theatrical production.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.180
But-- And my husband Phil was--
he would do sounds and lights.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.110
We had other friends who would
hire people to help on that.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.800
And his mom, my mother-in-law,
worked the door.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.100
She would take tickets.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:45.030
And it was a very different
experience for us to be

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:50.810
on stage doing same words
almost every night and knowing

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:56.380
that a light cue or a sound cue
for a fiddle to come in depended

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.230
on a particular word,
you know, a saying

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.120
or a phrase or something.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.180
So, that was a different
experience.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.000
But we really both
got into it, you know.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.180
We both really enjoyed it.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.380
It kind of got right inside
of us and it was lovely being

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.330
at home that much
and not traveling.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:14.630
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: So,

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.640
you performed it
during the summer time?

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.940
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
Yes, in the fall.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.440
So, Asheville is a
big tourist place.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.670
The theater was at the Folk
Art Center which is right

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.540
on Blue Ridge Parkway.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.980
And we got a lot of
folks from out of town.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.440
We also got a lot
of repeat visitors

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.150
that would come and hear it.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:40.860
And we started keeping a list of
frequent buyers, we called it,

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.170
and we gave them
a little discount.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:47.080
And we had some people that saw
it 23 times, that was the most.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.380
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Wow.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.510
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: And they
would plan their family reunions

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.160
when-- so they would call
us like in April or March

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.870
and say now, what are the
dates for this summer and fall,

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.850
and then they would plan
events or have guest come in.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:06.150
So, we had a grand reception
there in North Carolina for it.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Wow that's great.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.530
So eventually, you and
Barbara parted ways.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.550
The folk teller stopped
being an act per se.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.630
How did that come about
and was that just organic?

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:18.930
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Well,

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:23.560
we both took very different
paths in the early '90s.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:29.030
And Barbara-- Well, maybe I
described some of this as well,

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:33.550
but she kind of took a
path back to Catholicism,

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:37.230
and that became the
main focus of her life

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:45.070
and as she would self
describe as a pretty out there

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:48.690
on the edge, especially
from my perspective.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.380
And so even as far as some of
the stories that she wanted

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.520
to tell and whether to continue
telling some of the stories

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.480
that we were already telling,
she was feeling maybe not

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.830
so much this one because
it has that mention.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:06.660
So, that was part of
it and we just got

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:12.130
on such different tracks that
I know it was a hard decision.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:17.190
I had only been on stage except
for an emcee, as being an emcee.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.290
I think I had only been on stage
telling stories once or twice

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.230
in 20 years without her.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:27.010
And I remember thinking, when do
you drink water, when do you--

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:30.300
how do you do this one
after another, you know.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:35.400
So, it was really emotional
and it was a hard decision

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.130
to come to, but there was--

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:42.100
I was very grateful that I
had a clarity, that this was--

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.480
we were on different paths.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.920
And so, one of my images was
that we were both opening doors

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.860
for each other to go
on a solo journey,

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.580
and that's what we've done.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.910
And it has-- You know,

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:57.860
I'm hoping Barbara will
say the same thing.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.520
But, you know, she's the one

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.570
that brought me into
storytelling.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:08.880
And I am so grateful for my life
unfolding in that way and I look

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.850
to Barbara with all
the gratitude for that.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:19.590
But the next 23 years now
have unfolded in amazing ways

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:24.060
that I am so grateful
that I made that shift

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.070
and made that decision.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.040
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Well,
tonight's program is going

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.450
to have you guys back
on the stage again.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.100
So, tell me what it
is like preparing

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.130
for this concert tonight.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.420
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Well,
we did a concert one other time

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.080
at the national festival.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.510
I think it's been about
maybe 10 years ago.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.290
And I was featured there
that year and I asked,

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.060
would you all be up for a
folk teller performance?

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.470
And Barbara was up for it.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.420
People in the festival were too.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.020
And that time and this
time, so those are the--

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.170
these will be the only
two times, that was once.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.340
This is only the second time.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.590
And we do some things
at family reunions,

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.210
but not on stage behind mics.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.690
But the same has
happened this time,

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.490
it did when we were
preparing for that.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.280
You know, we just went--
flowed right back into it.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.290
It was-- I mean, we'll
see what happens tonight

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:18.170
and how it unfolds.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:26.430
But I think it's such body
memory in some way that starting

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.030
into it and-- because we're
doing familiar stories.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:34.480
We're doing our old chestnuts
as they say, I guess.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.040
But I don't know if I
necessarily like that word

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.180
for it, but our old
favorites really,

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.950
and that's what we've
picked on to tell tonight.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.140
And I think it's
going to be good.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.540
I think, you know, our
voices are right there,

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.790
like aged in similar
ways, I guess.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.160
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: We are
looking forward to it for sure.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Absolutely.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.760
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
Thank you.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.060
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
So, you mentioned some

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.360
of your favorite stories.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.170
What are your favorite
kinds of stories to tell

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.670
and if you wouldn't mind
mentioning some specific

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.410
examples of your
top stories maybe.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:07.710
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Sure.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.090
Well, one story that
became such a favorite story

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:16.370
of mine was the one that
I heard Ray tell walking

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:17.780
through the streets
of Jonesborough,

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.080
Wicked John and the Devil.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.870
I had this-- You know,
I love that image

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.780
of doors opening
and windows opening.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:29.210
And so, there was another
door that opened as Barbara

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.880
and I were bringing
folk teller to a close.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.270
And that was the Kandinsky Trio.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:36.970
And they are a chamber
music trio

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.170
and they were looking
for a storyteller.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.340
Their agent thought
it would be great

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.930
for the chamber music world and
the storytelling world to bring

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.530
on a storyteller and have some
original music be written.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:55.590
And so, I met with them
and interviewed and such

00:27:55.590 --> 00:28:00.480
and they heard my recordings and
brought me on board for that.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.390
And we picked a version that I
came up with with Ray's help.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.970
It was very similar
to his version.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:12.650
But Ray helped me a lot on
it and inspired me in ways,

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:16.260
not helped maybe in ways that we
would think helping on a story,

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.280
but we can get into
that if you'd like.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.340
But we called it the
Cantankerous Blacksmith.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.460
It was a version of
Wicked John and the Devil.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.900
And the intention
was that the four

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.440
of us tell it all
on stage together.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.170
So, it wasn't music and some
storytelling for interest,

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:39.040
or it wasn't vocal with
this music as background.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.640
The four of us were telling it.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.970
So sometimes, the cellist was
telling it, sometimes I was,

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:45.820
sometimes all four of us.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:51.710
And Mike Reid is the person that
wrote the original music for it.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:56.440
He was a football
hero at Penn State.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.340
And then, he left there and went

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.140
to the Cincinnati
Bengals, NFL football.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.910
And at the height of his career,

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.280
he quit because he didn't
want anything to happen

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.390
to his fingers because
he loved the piano.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.770
So, they chose him
as the composer.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.930
And I met with him first
in Nashville, Tennessee.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.660
He went on to become--
He's still a songwriter

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.330
and a musician and has written--

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.250
you know, received Grammies
from Bonnie Raitt and lots

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.630
of different people,
written things for the Judds.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.860
So, he's the one that
wrote the music for it.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:37.000
And we-- Right away when
we started working on that,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.190
it was again almost
like that tandem.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:40.490
I hadn't thought of that before,

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.380
but almost like that
tandem with Barbara.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.280
After our first weekend
of rehearsal,

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.100
six months before our
first performance,

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.610
we all felt like we could
go out on stage and do this.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:56.060
And we opened at Penn State,
that a thousand people

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.410
in the audience, the largest
audience they'd ever had

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.060
for chamber music and they came

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.210
because of Mike being
the football hero there,

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:05.380
and then that took me on
this other whole adventure.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.960
So, working on Wicked
John and the Devil,

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.690
in that way with music,
with that classical music

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.800
which I didn't know at
all, I remember them saying

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.100
when we were talking about--

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.880
when I would come in and he
said, oh, you can just look

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.500
over my shoulder
and see the music.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.220
I said, well, I don't
read music, you know.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.090
So, I've had these
images for the music

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.390
of where I would then come in.

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:33.600
And one of the highlights of my
life was Ray Hicks coming to one

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.090
of those performances.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.250
There's emotion there.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.380
And I didn't know he
didn't have a cellphone.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.090
And I've written him we were
going to be performing it.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.390
And the very first season--

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:46.780
We went on for nine
seasons with that show.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:52.470
But at the very first season,
Appalachian State in Boone,

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.420
North Carolina had invited--

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:59.180
you know, they were one of the
presenting performance places.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.490
And so, I've written
a letter to Rosa.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.590
That's-- She and I
always correspond.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:07.080
I've got lots of letters
from Rosa in the collection.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.470
But I had written her, but I
had no idea if they were going

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:10.770
to be able to make it.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:13.000
And I'd given them a few
suggestions of who might be able

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.070
to drive them and
they had no phones

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.370
and they had to work
all that out.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:17.980
They didn't have
any car, anything.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.850
And, boy, when we
walked out on that stage,

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:24.370
it was a full theater
filled with people.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:29.880
But-- And we were-- I wore a tux
with pants, so this fancy kind

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.090
of shiny, white with
a black tux over it

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:38.620
with a few little sparkles on it
and trio was all in their vest.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.520
The four of us walked out and
I saw Ray in that second row

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.590
and it was quite an experience.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:48.460
And he listened to that
story with an open heart.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.700
Yeah, there was about eight
of them that were there.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:56.070
And he just would laugh and
slap his leg and it was just--

00:31:56.070 --> 00:32:01.120
to bring that back right
now to see how open he was

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.690
to new experience, to hear
this traditional story

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.570
that he had known since he
was five years old being told

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:13.740
with a chamber music, trio and
a violin and piano and cello.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.960
And afterwards, I'll tell
you, I walked him out

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.820
and he-- I remember standing.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.730
They had parked in a garage.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:27.450
And I remember standing
right there

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:29.400
as we were saying our goodbyes.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:34.850
And he told me how much he'd
enjoyed the performance.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:39.950
And he said, Connie,
don't let them forget

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.860
about me when I'm gone.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:46.460
And then he said, you,
Connie, that's how he used

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:52.240
to say my name, Connie,
you tell on, tell on.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.020
And that's my license
plate right now

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.400
with an exclamation point, North
Carolina, tell on, tell on.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.700
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: All right.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.000
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Wow.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.690
OK. So your stories, I
guess rather your stories

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:11.790
and albums have won many
awards for ELE given example.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:15.020
So, where do you get
your story material from?

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.060
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Well,
I have a new one coming

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.060
out literally in three weeks.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.330
It will be in time for
the national festival.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:26.140
It's called Leap and Laugh,

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.060
exclamation point,
Tales of Adventure.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:34.760
And so, I have-- I actually
have this experience that I went

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.660
on I was invited to tell
in-- down in New Zealand.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.720
And after telling
stories, my husband

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.930
and I took a two-week
trip throughout the north

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.230
and south island.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:50.610
And I ended up getting
with a parapenter.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:51.910
Do you know what that is?

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:53.210
Being strapped on.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.510
He was behind me.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:55.940
Parachute on the ground.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:00.310
And he reached over my shoulder
and said, Connie, jog, jog, jog.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:03.970
And I started running towards
the cliff and we went off

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:06.890
into the air over Queenstown.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:10.000
So, that's the link
part of the story.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.990
So, that's a personal
experience story and adventure.

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:18.760
And that story is on there as
well as an old Scottish tale

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.580
that was being told at
the time of Shakespeare.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.320
And it's called the
Well of True Water.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.720
There's a story about
my husband.

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:37.690
That is-- I named it Dorky
Spandex versus Macho Leather.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:43.440
And it's about his bicycle rod
going up to Mount Mitchell,

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.540
the tallest peak east
of the Mississippi,

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.840
and these motorcyclists

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.030
that were passing him
on their motorbikes.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.560
So, there's both
personal experience

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.970
and traditional stories,
lots of humor.

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:58.710
That will be a new thing for me.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.980
The focus on this in
some ways is humor.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.470
So, that CD is coming out
with a digital download.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.420
That will be my first CD

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.590
to actually have a
digital download included

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.290
which is kind of cool.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.980
And then, I have
some general stories.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.250
I have some stories about
Ray that's on my Dive,

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.560
Into Stories CD,
so those CDs, so.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So once
you've come up with a story

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:24.920
or found a story, how do you
craft it into a performance?

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.100
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: So, this
has evolved over the years.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.940
And what happens now
and probably the last 10

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:35.680
or 15 years, I have this idea
about a story and they come

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.980
to me in different ways.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.910
One story, I was reading
a newspaper article.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:43.550
I was heading down
to visit my parents

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:44.910
in Jacksonville, Florida.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:49.460
And I read a newspaper article
about a woman who was now living

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.430
in St. Augustine, Florida

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:57.180
who had been a spy
during World War II.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.010
She was English.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.350
At 17, had learned how to fly

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.580
and she helped get
people out of Dunkirk.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.630
And extraordinary story, I
went down and interviewed her

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:13.240
and I called her, interviewed
her in St. Augustine.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.860
And for whatever reason,
that story got put

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.910
on a back burner two years ago.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:20.320
So, that's one that
I'm now telling

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.340
at the national festival.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.910
So, some stories are like that.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.850
So, they're more historical
or true life events.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:29.370
Some are about myself.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.990
But when I'm working on them,
sometimes there's just a nugget.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.830
And I have a group of
friends, other storytellers,

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:40.110
Jay O'Callahan, Beth
Horner, Milbre Burch

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:41.970
that we work on Skype.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.010
We get together sometimes
in person.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.790
We also work on Skype.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:48.290
And we have devised this method.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:52.970
I'll tell you just briefly
about the Blue Lakers.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:55.330
I don't know if you know
about those people yet.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:37:00.130
But they are a group of
national storytellers

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:07.380
and we started meeting over 30
years ago and we spend a week

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.290
with each other every
year for 30 years.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:14.620
And that's Bill Harley,
[inaudible], Jim May,

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:18.440
Jay O'Callahan, David Holt,
all these amazing stories.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.740
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris:
-- storytellers.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.530
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Yes,
Beth Horner and Milbre.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:26.770
And so, we developed this whole
way of working on stories.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:30.560
And then, each of us kind of
tweaked it to our own versions.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.320
But what my version is now is
I might be working with Jay

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.780
or Beth on Skype or in person
is even better, but Skype works.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.280
And we'll just-- I have
lined up, you could look

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.710
at my calendar now and
see the time is coming

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.510
up in the next month and
a half that I'm going

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.120
to be working with them.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.630
And it might be that this
particular afternoon,

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:52.740
we are each taking 45 minutes.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.620
We always have our timer.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:57.450
And so, I take say
the first 45 minutes

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:00.870
and it might be I'm
working on a colonel.

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:04.110
All I have is, boy, this
amazing thing happened to Phil

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:06.850
on this bike rod going
up to Mount Mitchell.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:10.350
So, I'm just talking about
it and I record myself.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:11.910
Nowadays, the last
however many years,

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.970
it's on my phone, a voice memo.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:17.120
And I record even as I'm
thinking out loud about it.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.610
So, this is just
literally the, I don't know,

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.390
but this might happen
or what-- you know.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:24.850
And then when I finish up,
because I've been telling,

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:27.760
I can [inaudible] make it
sound like a story right away.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.870
It comes to a close the very
first thing in my system

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.170
of this way of working

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:35.220
on stories is I give
myself an appreciation.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:36.850
What did I like about that?

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:38.710
Well, I really liked it
when I talked about him.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:40.090
Putting on that helmet
that's dorky

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:43.930
and that little tiny
mirror like a dentist,

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.550
what happened to your mouth.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:46.920
And so, I really like that.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.180
So-- And then whoever
I'm working with,

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.000
they tell me what they liked.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.220
And then, we go back to any
tweaks, what can make it better?

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.840
I think I'll investigate
about a motorcycle, you know,

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.140
how is it that they end up--

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.760
you know, what would
they be wearing.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.450
I guess if Phil is on the
ground looking up trying

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:07.250
to get his feet unclipped from
those bike clips on his bicycle

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:08.550
and this guy is backing up.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:10.740
He might look like
he weighs 350 pounds.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:14.270
So, I might say some of that
out loud, and then that is all

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:17.950
on that tape as I'm
working with Beth on it.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.110
And she might have
some suggestions.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:25.260
And then at some point, I go
to text, so it's typed out,

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.740
but I never think
of it as a script.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.640
It's not, oh, it's those words.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.780
Because each time of the
telling, especially the next 8,

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.760
10, 20 times, and I'll be
doing this tonight with one

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.880
of the stories I'm telling, I'll
have my phone on stage with me.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.900
I've got a little microphone.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.820
So, I'm recording and then
I'll go back to that text.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:48.710
See, I like things better the
way I actually did it as it,

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.690
you know, was happening on
stage with the listeners.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:54.270
And that's been the biggest
lesson for me on working

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:57.860
on stories is knowing
that I need a listener.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:01.070
I can't go into an empty
room and sit and go, OK.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:05.080
I go back to fourth grader,
blank page in front on me.

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.340
I don't have anything to say.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.860
But if somebody walks
in the door,

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.680
sometimes it's my assistant.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:14.070
You know, I'm working on a story
with or more often it's some

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.830
of these other storytellers.

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:18.130
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Great.

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:19.430
All right.

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:20.890
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well, so
we're going to talk a little bit

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:23.560
about your collection
because one of the things

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.360
that we're very excited about at
the American Folklife Center is

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.910
that we have a collection
of your materials.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:33.430
So, just give us an
overview of what's

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.060
in the collection
that you gave to us.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.360
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
Gosh, Steve, you know,

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:41.730
when I look back especially now
that you know the story of us,

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:43.990
doing all this traveling,
literally only having

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:46.570
that little truck
and not much stories.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:49.960
My sister's place in Atlanta
was a place we would drop

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.260
things off.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:54.580
But I think of it as a little
blessing or a little grace

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.040
that I saved all
these pieces of paper.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.000
And I would make copies
before I sent letters out.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.860
So if we were writing
different festivals or--

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:08.760
because all of it mostly was
done through writing and sitting

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.620
and through the mail, I
get copies of all of that.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:19.810
And then Barbara and I, we
would do touring schedules.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.040
We would send out three
months worth of schedules

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.900
and we would sit down
and handwrite this.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.040
Eventually I had
somebody working for us.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.730
I get copies of all those.

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:33.210
So, I've got notes from my
correspondents back and forth

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:36.780
with Jimmy Neil, correspondents
with Maurice Sendak

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.900
and Ezra Jack Keats, you know,

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:43.720
two famous children's book
authors, and Ashley Ryan,

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.660
correspondents, I've kept
all that correspondents.

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.620
My mother kept all
of my correspondents.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.260
So, a lot of that talks
about storytelling.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.690
A lot of it is personal and
what's happening at home.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:58.500
But we mostly communicated
by mail

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.720
and we would do general
delivery.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.770
So, we'd walk into Vermont
at the post office and say,

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.310
could I have my mail, please?

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.520
And they'd go back and find
Connie and Barbara and bring it

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.270
out and we'd sit on the steps.

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:13.470
They were at the Philadelphia
main post office downstairs,

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.130
that-- downtown, that
magnificent building.

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.470
I remember going out on the
steps outside, you know,

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.520
and [inaudible], what's
folk teller, what's Connie,

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.300
what's Barbara, you know.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.310
And so, I've saved
all those letters.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:26.320
I've saved every program.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:31.090
I think I'm the only one that
has a program from all 45

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:34.810
of the national storytelling
festivals and,

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:36.110
you know, posters.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:37.880
And so, that's what
I've been sending.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:44.470
Plus a lot of correspondents,
I have always enjoyed.

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:48.110
The calendars that we kept
weren't just, here we do this.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:51.540
You know, I'd often put a little
reflection, not exactly diaries.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.370
There's a few diaries,
but not so much of that,

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:56.180
but a few moments of--

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.240
or how that was or maybe a
little drawing or something.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.920
So, I've saved all of
that, all of the stuff

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.860
with the Kandinsky Trio.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:08.770
I saved long before knowing that
this was even a possibility.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:15.050
So, I'm thrilled and I've
got a lot more to say.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:18.060
Yes. I'm hoping to
do some more soon,

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.660
and then you guys will get
all of them once I got it.

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:21.960
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Great.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.640
So if somebody was coming
here to the library to look

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:30.140
at your collection, what would
you tell them to look for?

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.520
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Gosh.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.440
Well, there's going to be a lot
of photos of the Hicks Family.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.530
That jumps in my mind.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:42.380
And something that I kind of
thought of, I've kept a copy

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:47.480
of every single promotional
piece of material that we had

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:51.160
as the folk tellers all the
way through my solo career.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.730
And I actually thought
about that at one point

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:58.060
that that might be cool for
someone that is an artist

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:02.330
or a designer to go back and
just see what is that sheet

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:06.750
of paper that was
mimeographed with a photograph

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.910
and a few quotes at the bottom

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:11.210
that Bill Dumler [assumed
spelling] up in Hartford,

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:13.320
Connecticut helped
us put together.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.150
In addition to running
that festival up there

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:21.120
in the coffee house,
he ran a copy company,

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.600
you know, a little shop.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.180
So, he was literally the one.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.680
He got Sandy Payton who
had folk legacy records

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.710
to give us a quote because
he had heard us tell stories.

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.690
And what would that be like for
a designer to come in and see

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:39.910
that first page up to
my business cards now

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:44.050
that have that, you know,
soft feeling and rounded edges

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:47.290
and to see that whole
progression.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:50.980
So, that's just one tiny way
and certainly storytellers,

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:54.810
you know, that's what I'm hoping
that people will be inspired

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:58.360
to tell their own stories
traditional and personal

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.710
and not only necessarily
thinking of it on stage,

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:04.790
but how can they do that with
their family, how can do they do

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:06.090
that in their community.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:07.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: All right.

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:10.560
Well, we've reached the
point where we say thank you.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.140
But we also ask whether
there's anything that you would

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.940
like to add, that
you want to add

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.340
for the record in
this interview.

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.200
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
You know, I would really

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:27.080
like to thank Todd for being the
one that pursued this with me

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.820
to do this collection.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.130
You know, I called him

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:35.330
up because I came upon old
cassettes of some of the people

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.200
from the folk music
world, Red Clay Ramblers,

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.760
some of the performers
back because I was there

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.750
with my little cassette
recorder recording people back

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:47.310
in the early days as
well as Ray and such.

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:50.830
But a lot of musicians, I want
to keep the storytelling ones.

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:53.120
But I thought, you know,
Todd might want this.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.190
And I called him and that's
when this started unfolding.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.320
So, I'd really like
to thank him.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.620
And thank you guys.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:00.920
You got good questions.

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.220
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Well, thank you.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.520
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
My memory is rolling.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: I should
clarify that Connie is talking

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.640
about Todd Harvey who is
our acquisitions coordinator

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.360
at the American Folklife Center.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.430
And this is where you can
find this wonderful collection

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:14.510
of material relating to
storytelling and to the career

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:16.250
of Connie Regan-Blake.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.830
So, thank you very much
on behalf of myself

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:21.270
and Valda Morris and the
American Folklife Center.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.580
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: I thank
anyone who's listening to this.

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:27.890
I hope that you will
tell stories.

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:29.190
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Tell on.

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:30.490
Tell on.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.530
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Exactly.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:37.190
&gt;&gt; So, you want to ask?

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:38.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, we have--

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:42.150
Feel free to say no
to this request, but--

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:46.420
and also it may not be
necessary because of things.

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:51.130
So to explain, we do a lot
of programming on our blog

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:53.150
and our podcast around
Halloween.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.450
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Yes.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And so,
I was wondering if you plan

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:57.850
to tell any stories
with the kind

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:00.260
of supernatural focus tonight.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.950
And if not, would you be willing
to tell one at some point here

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:06.930
in this studio for us
to put in the podcast.

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.230
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
Oh, absolutely.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:12.320
And actually, I'm like
99% sure that I'm going

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.180
to tell Two White
Horses tonight--

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.480
&gt;&gt; [Simultaneously] OK.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.780
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
-- which is--

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:19.890
you know, would be
perfect for that.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:22.190
But-- Because I need to--
You all kind of need to know

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:25.230
because I need to do
something else for the podcast.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:28.350
Yeah, I'm sure because
that's the story that I feel.

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.910
It's the one that help
people see this was

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:32.420
for adults and for--

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:33.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.020
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: --
you know, the festivals

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:36.320
and such, festival audiences.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.620
So, I am going to tell that one.

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:38.920
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: OK.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.220
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: So you'll
get that and you'll be glad.

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.940
I'll be delighted
when you do that.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.240
&gt;&gt; -- John the Devil?

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.540
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Wicked John and the Devil.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.170
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
Wicked John and the Devil.

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:50.090
So, that's a 22-minute story.

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:53.750
And that's actually not scary.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.550
It's not a Halloween story.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.010
Yeah. It's--

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.580
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.880
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Oh,
there'd be a lot of other ones.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.180
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Mr. Fox.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.480
Yeah. Mr. Fox is a good one.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.780
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: I mean,
Mary Culhane and Rag Doll and--

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.080
I mean, there's a
lot of other ones.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.350
But I think Two White Horses
would be perfect, don't you?

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:09.650
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:10.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:12.250
Yeah. As long as there's
something we would love--

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:13.550
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
It definitely has that.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:14.850
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.150
All right.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:17.950
&gt;&gt; Halloween is very,
very special [laugher].

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:21.660
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: We started
our blog at Halloween just

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:28.140
by coincidence really, but it's
becoming this kind of thing

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.670
in the Folklife Center.

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:30.970
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
So, do you--

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:32.830
So the blog, do you
have-- is it a video?

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:34.470
Is it a long video?

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:35.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Well, it's mostly--

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:38.660
So, the only way we can put
this video on the blog is

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.890
if it's already online
at the library website.

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:42.190
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Yes.

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:43.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
So for example,

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.270
I can blog this webcast
once it goes online.

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:47.570
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Yes.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:48.870
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And we will.

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:52.190
But otherwise, it's-- mostly
what we can put up is audio.

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:53.730
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: So,
I'll give you one of my CDs.

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.440
So, I've got the chilling
ghost stories with me.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.740
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That would be good.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.040
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: That's great.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.340
Yeah.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.640
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
As long as you're OK

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.940
with putting one
of those online.

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.240
Yeah.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.540
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake:
Oh absolutely.

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.840
Yeah. Yeah.

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.140
And if you let me know about
it, I'll do social media--

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.440
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: All right.

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.740
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: --

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:11.040
to let you know when
that's coming up in October.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.340
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Awesome.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.640
&gt;&gt; Connie Regan-Blake: Yeah.

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.940
&gt;&gt; Valda Morris: Thanks Connie.
