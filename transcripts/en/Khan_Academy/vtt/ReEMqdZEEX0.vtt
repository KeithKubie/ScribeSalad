00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.150
Let's do a couple more examples

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.310
graphing rational functions.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.530
So let's say I have y is equal
to 2x over x plus 1.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.600
So the first thing we might
want to do is identify our

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.180
horizontal asymptotes,
if there are any.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.440
And I said before, all you
have to do is look at the

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.510
highest degree term in the
numerator and the denominator.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.210
The highest degree term here,
there's only one term.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.140
It is 2x.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.450
And the highest degree
term here is x.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.780
They're both first-degree
terms.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.630
So you can say that as x
approaches infinity, y is

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.150
going to be-- as x gets
super-large values, these two

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.300
terms are going to dominate.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.280
This isn't going to
matter so much.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.710
So then our expression, then y
is going to be approximately

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.570
equal to 2x over x, which
is just equal to 2.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.140
That actually would
also be true as x

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.990
approaches negative infinity.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.440
So as x gets really large or
super-negative, this is going

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.340
to approach 2.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.210
This term won't matter much.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.330
So let's graph that horizontal
asymptote.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.980
So it's y is equal to 2.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.810
Let's graph it.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.800
So this is our horizontal
asymptote right there.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.340
y is equal to 2, that right
there-- let me write it down--

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.340
horizontal asymptote.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.820
That is what our graph
approaches but never quite

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.950
touches as we get to more and
more positive values of x or

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.890
more and more negative
values of x.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.800
Now, do we have any vertical
asymptotes here?

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.700
Well, sure.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.410
We have when x is equal to
negative 1, this equation or

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.630
this function is undefined.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:07.030
So we say y undefined when
x is equal to negative 1.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.800
That's definitely true because
when x is equal to negative 1,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.130
the denominator becomes zero.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.830
We don't know what 1/0 is.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.200
It's not defined.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.670
And this is a vertical asymptote
because the x

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.160
doesn't cancel out.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.490
The x plus 1-- sorry--
doesn't cancel out

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.610
with something else.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.050
Let me give you a quick
example right here.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.170
Let's say I have the equation
y is equal to x plus

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.070
1 over x plus 1.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.430
In this circumstance, you might
say, hey, when x is

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.730
equal to negative 1, my
graph is undefined.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.470
And you would be right because
if you put a negative 1 here,

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.770
you get a 0 down here.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.420
In fact, you'll also
get a 0 on top.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.330
You'll get a 0 over a 0.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.370
It's undefined.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.040
But as you can see, if you
assume that x does not equal

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.630
negative 1, if you assume that
this term and that term are

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.310
not equal to zero, you can
divide the numerator and the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.340
denominator by x plus 1, or you
could say, well, that over

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.710
that, if it was anything
else over itself, it

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.950
would be equal to 1.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:14.740
You would say this would be
equal to 1 when x does not

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.340
equal negative 1 or when these
terms don't equal zero.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.810
It equals 0/0, which we don't
know what that is, when x is

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.090
equal to negative 1.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.570
So in this situation,
you would not

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.140
have a vertical asymptote.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:36.610
So this graph right here,
no vertical asymptote.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.350
And actually, you're probably
curious, what does

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.850
this graph look like?

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.470
I'll take a little aside here
to draw it for you.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.170
This graph right here, if I had
to graph this right there,

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.810
what this would be is this would
be y is equal to 1 for

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.250
all the values except for x
is equal to negative 1.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.760
So in this situation the graph,
it would be y is equal

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.090
to 1 everywhere, except for
y is equal to negative 1.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.355
And y is equal to negative
1, it's undefined.

00:04:06.355 --> 00:04:08.710
So we actually have
a hole there.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.070
We actually draw a little circle
around there, a little

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.760
hollowed-out circle, so that we
don't know what y is when x

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.990
is equal to negative 1.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.360
So this looks like
that right there.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.940
It looks like that
horizontal line.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.580
No vertical asymptote.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.270
And that's because this term and
that term cancel out when

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.370
they're not equal to zero,
when x is not equal to

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.310
negative 1.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.640
So when your identifying
vertical asymptotes-- let me

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.160
clear this out a little bit.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.680
when you're identifying vertical
asymptotes, you want

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.160
to be sure that this expression
right here isn't

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.080
canceling out with something
in the numerator.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.410
And in this case, it's not.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.160
In this case, it did,
so you don't

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.400
have a vertical asymptote.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.410
In this case, you aren't
canceling out, so this will

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.560
define a vertical asymptote.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.610
x is equal to negative 1 is a
vertical asymptote for this

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.690
graph right here.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.720
So x is equal to negative 1--
let me draw the vertical

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.510
asymptote-- will
look like that.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.080
And then to figure out what the
graph is doing, we could

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.630
try out a couple of values.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.270
So what happens when
x is equal to 0?

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.080
So when x is equal to 0 we have
2 times 0, which is 0

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.800
over 0 plus 1.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.700
So it's 0/1, which is 0.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.970
So the point 0, 0
is on our curve.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.990
What happens when
x is equal to 1?

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.860
We have 2 times 1, which
is 2 over 1 plus 1.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.040
So it's 2/2.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.310
So it's 1, 1 is also
on our curve.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.380
So that's on our curve
right there.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.630
So we could keep plotting
points, but the curve is going

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.730
to look something like this.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.020
It looks like it's going
approach negative infinity as

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.600
it approaches the vertical
asymptote from the right.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.500
So as you go this way it, goes
to negative infinity.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.010
And then it'll approach our
horizontal asymptote from the

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.665
negative direction.

00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:07.100
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.850
And then, let's see, what
happens when x is equal to--

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.765
let me do this in
a darker color.

00:06:14.765 --> 00:06:16.520
I'll do it in this red color.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.540
What happens when x is
equal to negative 2?

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.420
We have negative 2 times
2 is negative 4.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.420
And then we have negative-- so
it's going to be negative 4

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.950
over negative 2 plus 1,
which is negative 1,

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.760
which is just 4.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.460
So it's just equal
to negative 2, 4.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.940
So negative 2-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.460
Negative 2, 4 is on our line.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.560
And what about-- well, let's
just do one more point.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.040
What about negative 3?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.536
So the point negative 3-- on the
numerator, we're going to

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:55.010
get 2 times negative 3 is
negative 6 over negative 3

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.570
plus 1, which is negative 2.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.290
Negative 6 over negative
2 is positive 3.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.150
So negative 3, 3.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.890
1, 2, 3.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.090
1, 2, 3.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.660
So that's also there.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.393
So the graph is going to look
something like that.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.570
So as we approach negative
infinity, we're going to

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.170
approach our horizontal
asymptote from above.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.115
As we approach negative 1, x is
equal to negative 1, we're

00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:26.270
going to pop up to positive
infinity.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.340
So let's verify that once again
this is indeed the graph

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.180
of our equation.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.780
Let's get our graphing
calculator out.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:46.660
We're going to define y as 2x
divided by x plus 1 is equal

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.530
to-- delete all of that out--
and then we want to graph it.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.650
And there we go.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.520
It looks just like
what we drew.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.680
And that vertical asymptote, it
connected the dots, but we

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.240
know that it's not
defined there.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.450
It just tried to connect
the super-positive

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.490
value all the way down.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.660
Because it's just trying out--
all the graphing calculator's

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.740
doing is actually just making
a very detailed table of

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.460
values and then just connecting
all the dots.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.740
So it doesn't know that this
is an asymptote, so it

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.340
actually tried to connect
the dots.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.350
But there should be no
connection right there.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.190
Hopefully, you found this
example useful.
