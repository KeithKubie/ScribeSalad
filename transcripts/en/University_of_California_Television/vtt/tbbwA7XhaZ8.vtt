00:00:05.552 --> 00:00:08.135
(upbeat music)

00:00:31.132 --> 00:00:33.762
- Hello, my name is Leslea Hlusko.

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:35.439
I'm an associate professor
here in the Department

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:38.996
of Integrative Biology,
and it is my distinct honor

00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:42.345
to get to introduce Professor
Nina Jablonski today.

00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:45.856
For those of you who were able
to attend her talk yesterday,

00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:47.726
you've heard of her
academic accomplishments.

00:00:47.726 --> 00:00:50.180
She did her undergraduate
work at Bryn Mawr.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.786
She got her PhD from the
University of Washington.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.381
She then became an anatomy instructor

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.842
at the University of Hong Kong.

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:59.619
She was a lecturer at the
University of Western Australia,

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:01.681
and the a curator of anthropology

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:03.572
at the California Academy of Sciences,

00:01:03.572 --> 00:01:05.825
and then served for a while as the head

00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:08.308
of the Department of Anthropology
at Penn State University,

00:01:08.308 --> 00:01:10.299
where she now has the luxury of just being

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.572
a full professor, and
all that comes with that.

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:15.463
She's had numerous research grants,

00:01:15.463 --> 00:01:18.553
support that came from the
National Science Foundation,

00:01:18.553 --> 00:01:20.236
The Wallenberg Foundation,

00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:22.083
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:23.672
and the Rockefeller Foundation.

00:01:23.672 --> 00:01:28.090
And her accolades include,
some of the most recently,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.648
membership in the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences,

00:01:31.648 --> 00:01:33.553
among many, many others.

00:01:33.553 --> 00:01:36.944
So as you know, from this lecture series,

00:01:36.944 --> 00:01:38.853
she is well-known for
her work on the evolution

00:01:38.853 --> 00:01:42.029
of human skin color, and is deeply admired

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:44.489
for her talent in conveying
this excellent research

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:45.749
to the public.

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:48.710
But she is also highly
respected to those of us

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.860
in academia for her meticulous
paleontological research

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.120
in Asia and eastern Africa.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.912
And it is this less famous
side of her research

00:01:58.912 --> 00:02:01.134
over the years that had initially brought

00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:03.075
the two of us together.

00:02:03.075 --> 00:02:06.352
Now, all of us in this
room, if we're lucky,

00:02:06.352 --> 00:02:09.237
we have a small handful
of people who have served

00:02:09.237 --> 00:02:11.646
as an inspiration or
role model in our lives,

00:02:11.646 --> 00:02:15.590
people who we hold up as
our intellectual heroes.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.476
Nina is mine.

00:02:17.476 --> 00:02:20.230
We first met years ago when
I was a graduate student

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.683
studying baboon teeth,
and she graciously gave me

00:02:23.683 --> 00:02:25.993
some of her time, and even gave me a copy

00:02:25.993 --> 00:02:28.430
of a beautiful monograph
that she had edited

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.959
about these magnificent animals.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.349
And I remember clutching
that book to my chest

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.134
with pride and excitement
the whole way home that day.

00:02:37.134 --> 00:02:39.632
So Nina has continued
over the intervening years

00:02:39.632 --> 00:02:42.045
to be my validation and inspiration,

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:44.525
and her opinion has
always mattered more to me

00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:46.742
than that of anyone else.

00:02:46.742 --> 00:02:49.820
But more than that, for
all of us in academia,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.492
her research and outreach efforts

00:02:51.492 --> 00:02:54.391
on the evolutionary history
and importance of skin color

00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:57.584
variation is a beautiful
inspiration to follow.

00:02:57.584 --> 00:02:59.636
So Nina, thank you for
being a shining light

00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:01.708
in our discipline, and thank you so much

00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:04.234
for spending this week
with us in Berkeley.

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:05.670
Thank you.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.648
(audience applauding)

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:12.406
- Thank you, Leslea for that beautiful

00:03:12.406 --> 00:03:14.481
and generous introduction.

00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:17.578
Thank you to the Hitchcock
lecture committee,

00:03:17.578 --> 00:03:20.112
of which there are at least
a few representatives here,

00:03:20.112 --> 00:03:23.945
for their gracious and
generous invitation,

00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:28.112
and for really making possible
several wonderful days

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.879
of intellectual feasting on my part

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.129
with accomplished faculty and students.

00:03:39.295 --> 00:03:42.128
Studying human skin and skin color

00:03:43.364 --> 00:03:48.192
has been one of the most
rewarding possible adventures

00:03:48.192 --> 00:03:51.192
that I think any scholar could have.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:57.199
From our early studies of the
evolution of skin pigmentation

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:01.088
many research programs have flowed.

00:04:02.965 --> 00:04:06.132
In short, we can understand human skin

00:04:07.256 --> 00:04:09.620
really quite simply.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.947
The skin pigmentation that
we see so beautifully arrayed

00:04:13.947 --> 00:04:17.114
in a geographic pattern is not random.

00:04:19.487 --> 00:04:23.488
It evolved as the product
of natural selection.

00:04:23.488 --> 00:04:26.738
86% of variation in the skin color

00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:30.697
of indigenous peoples can be explained

00:04:30.697 --> 00:04:34.608
by variation in ultraviolet radiation.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.775
So we have, in human skin,

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.077
a beautiful example of evolution

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.402
acting on the human body.

00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:48.416
And we understand that skin pigmentation

00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:53.108
is an evolutionary compromise
between the demands

00:04:53.108 --> 00:04:57.275
of protecting against very
strong solar ultraviolet

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.229
radiation at the equator

00:05:01.637 --> 00:05:04.852
and the equally important demands

00:05:04.852 --> 00:05:07.852
of being able to continue to produce

00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:12.294
vitamin D in the skin,

00:05:12.294 --> 00:05:15.285
and I will advance today other arguments,

00:05:15.285 --> 00:05:17.983
but continue to produce
vitamin D in the skin

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:21.824
under conditions of low
ultraviolet radiation

00:05:21.824 --> 00:05:23.999
closer to the poles.

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:27.800
In the terms of evolutionary biology,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.550
what we have here are two clines.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.402
And in the intermediate
zone here and here,

00:05:37.043 --> 00:05:41.453
we find lots of people of
intermediate pigmentation

00:05:41.453 --> 00:05:44.993
who are able to gain and lose pigmentation

00:05:44.993 --> 00:05:48.056
season to season through tanning.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:52.629
We now recognize not only
this phenotypic pattern,

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:55.752
the appearance, but we understand a lot

00:05:55.752 --> 00:05:58.208
of the genetic architecture.

00:05:58.208 --> 00:06:00.791
Today I want to talk more about

00:06:01.697 --> 00:06:03.030
what this means.

00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:10.273
A few decades ago, the
Brazilian artist Angelika Dass

00:06:10.273 --> 00:06:14.440
started to compile what she
called a chromatic inventory

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.397
of her fellow Brazilian citizens,

00:06:19.397 --> 00:06:23.564
people who came in every
range of sepia coloration.

00:06:25.081 --> 00:06:28.453
She wanted people to appreciate

00:06:28.453 --> 00:06:30.916
just how similar we were,

00:06:30.916 --> 00:06:35.083
how much our colors graded
beautifully into one another,

00:06:36.961 --> 00:06:41.128
that there was no discontinuity
in the colors of humanity.

00:06:42.274 --> 00:06:46.261
And so today what I
want to do is to develop

00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:51.153
more of our own as well as
that of others' research

00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:53.570
on the meaning of skin color,

00:06:54.995 --> 00:06:58.146
what it means to us as social organisms,

00:06:58.146 --> 00:07:00.985
as social primates,
and what it means to us

00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:03.235
with respect to our health.

00:07:04.823 --> 00:07:08.419
It's important to recognize,
when we think about the social

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:12.060
meaning of skin color today, often we use

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.188
the term colorblind, or
we should be colorblind.

00:07:16.188 --> 00:07:20.669
Well, from the literal
perspective, we can't

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:24.836
because we as catarrhine
primates as monkeys and apes

00:07:27.528 --> 00:07:31.611
are endowed with superb
trichromatic color vision

00:07:32.855 --> 00:07:37.298
that allows us to see
beautiful richness of color

00:07:37.298 --> 00:07:38.916
in very high definition.

00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:40.583
So, we notice color.

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:45.013
We can't help but notice color

00:07:45.013 --> 00:07:48.190
because of our trichromatic color vision.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.282
So that's really important.

00:07:50.282 --> 00:07:52.358
We're visually oriented animals.

00:07:52.358 --> 00:07:55.001
The color of our fellow human beings,

00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:57.168
the shape of their bodies,

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.226
all of these physical
features are important to us

00:08:01.226 --> 00:08:04.367
because we are visually oriented animals.

00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:08.735
So that's an important
thing to think about

00:08:08.735 --> 00:08:12.068
from a cognitive behavioral perspective.

00:08:13.303 --> 00:08:16.636
How did people start
interacting with one another,

00:08:16.636 --> 00:08:19.295
people who had different skin colors,

00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:22.001
in the course of human history?

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:25.949
We don't know a lot about
these early interactions.

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:30.116
Some of the best written and
artistic records that we have

00:08:31.276 --> 00:08:34.026
actually come from Ancient Egypt.

00:08:35.986 --> 00:08:40.436
We know that there were
extensive interactions

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:43.447
at many times in Egyptian history,

00:08:43.447 --> 00:08:46.703
extensive interactions between peoples

00:08:46.703 --> 00:08:49.036
in the upper and lower Nile.

00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:53.342
Peoples who were mostly
very darkly pigmented

00:08:53.342 --> 00:08:56.788
and moderately pigmented
or quite lightly pigmented

00:08:56.788 --> 00:08:57.871
in the north.

00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:04.179
The salutary message from
all of these interactions

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:06.096
is that trade occurred.

00:09:07.027 --> 00:09:11.194
There were lots of diplomatic
exchanges, artistic exchanges.

00:09:12.409 --> 00:09:16.576
And although there were
conflicts and there was warfare,

00:09:17.794 --> 00:09:21.961
these were not on the basis
of any color distinction,

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:25.928
but rather of inequities of resources

00:09:27.668 --> 00:09:32.423
or trade imbalances and other
various kinds of disagreements

00:09:32.423 --> 00:09:36.256
that might exist sort
of any polities in time.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.927
Very importantly, the idea of

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:46.472
calling another group
other, because of color,

00:09:47.777 --> 00:09:50.444
did not exist, to our knowledge.

00:09:52.038 --> 00:09:55.371
This is not to say that we didn't engage

00:09:56.275 --> 00:09:59.858
in what Michael Omi
and many other scholars

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:04.679
have called the process of othering.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:08.296
The process of racial formation.

00:10:08.296 --> 00:10:10.910
If we go back again in ancient history

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.709
to look at the interaction
between the Greeks

00:10:13.709 --> 00:10:16.571
and the Persians, for instance,

00:10:16.571 --> 00:10:20.488
the Greeks refer to the
Persians as barbarians.

00:10:22.692 --> 00:10:26.523
They were distinctly
defined by their language,

00:10:26.523 --> 00:10:29.797
by their dress, and
their costumes as other,

00:10:29.797 --> 00:10:33.047
and as barbarians, in a negative sense.

00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:37.652
The category of other
existed, although it was not

00:10:37.652 --> 00:10:39.902
associated with skin color.

00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:46.048
When we think about coming
into the more modern

00:10:46.048 --> 00:10:49.157
Western scientific tradition
and how people started

00:10:49.157 --> 00:10:51.563
to think about human diversity,

00:10:51.563 --> 00:10:55.730
it's not inappropriate to pick
up the story with Linnaeus,

00:10:56.639 --> 00:10:59.404
because he was one of the first,

00:10:59.404 --> 00:11:03.944
albeit not the very first, to
think about human variation

00:11:03.944 --> 00:11:07.177
and how we might classify it.

00:11:07.177 --> 00:11:10.519
Now, what's really interesting
and incredibly important

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:13.735
to remember is that for Linnaeus,

00:11:13.735 --> 00:11:17.816
and many other European
scholars at the time,

00:11:17.816 --> 00:11:21.759
there was no personal
experience with people

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:24.460
in foreign countries outside of Europe.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.960
Many people, many naturalists, historians,

00:11:28.936 --> 00:11:32.608
like Linnaeus and others,
basically stayed at home.

00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:34.470
I mean, travel was logistically difficult,

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.325
plus they enjoyed the comforts
of their life at home,

00:11:38.325 --> 00:11:41.742
and they relied, instead, on information,

00:11:42.727 --> 00:11:46.310
biological samples,
and sort of travel logs

00:11:48.238 --> 00:11:50.851
that came to them via a series of sources

00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:54.934
often from Portuguese,
French, Italian explorers.

00:11:57.069 --> 00:12:00.854
So people like Linnaeus
got biological specimens,

00:12:00.854 --> 00:12:03.119
not so much of primates and humans,

00:12:03.119 --> 00:12:04.845
although he did a few primates.

00:12:04.845 --> 00:12:09.012
But they learned about human
variation from stories,

00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:14.270
second, third, and often fourth-hand.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.941
And when Linnaeus turned
his attention to classifying

00:12:17.941 --> 00:12:22.024
humans, initially he
classified them very simply.

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:27.306
Four groups, Europeans,
Americans, Asians, and Africans,

00:12:28.322 --> 00:12:32.433
separated by what he saw
as the cardinal distinction

00:12:32.433 --> 00:12:35.766
of skin color, white, red, brown, black.

00:12:36.682 --> 00:12:38.849
No hierarchy, just a list.

00:12:42.633 --> 00:12:45.273
What happens in the intervening years?

00:12:45.273 --> 00:12:49.106
Here we are, middle of
the 18th century, 1748.

00:12:51.017 --> 00:12:53.184
1758, only 10 years later,

00:12:55.799 --> 00:13:00.477
his description of variation
in humans is much longer,

00:13:00.477 --> 00:13:03.784
and I've only given a little digest here.

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:07.268
Significantly, we have the same groups

00:13:07.268 --> 00:13:11.827
and the skin colors
again, red for Americans,

00:13:11.827 --> 00:13:14.765
white for Europeans, brown for Asians,

00:13:14.765 --> 00:13:16.425
black for Africans.

00:13:16.425 --> 00:13:19.342
But we also have these other words,

00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:23.379
choleric, sanguineus,

00:13:24.355 --> 00:13:26.772
melancholicus, phlegmanticus,

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:31.806
describing temperament and behavior.

00:13:31.806 --> 00:13:34.545
And here, Linnaeus is really referencing

00:13:34.545 --> 00:13:38.698
Hippocrates, Herodotus, and other scholars

00:13:38.698 --> 00:13:41.948
of Ancient Greece who wrote extensively

00:13:43.294 --> 00:13:45.871
on human temperaments being formed

00:13:45.871 --> 00:13:48.817
by the intensity of the
sun and their environment.

00:13:48.817 --> 00:13:52.219
Are people experiencing too
much heat, too much cold,

00:13:52.219 --> 00:13:53.833
too much moisture?

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:58.177
Their temperament, their
behavior would be formed

00:13:58.177 --> 00:14:00.102
by their environment.

00:14:00.102 --> 00:14:04.492
And what's remarkable
here is that Linnaeus,

00:14:04.492 --> 00:14:07.348
the systematist of the natural world,

00:14:07.348 --> 00:14:11.798
who is describing mosses and
monkeys in a most objective,

00:14:11.798 --> 00:14:14.461
what we would called scientific way,

00:14:14.461 --> 00:14:18.628
is here describing humans
according to their temperament.

00:14:20.562 --> 00:14:24.465
And this heralds of
different treatment of humans

00:14:24.465 --> 00:14:27.053
that we see elaborated in various ways

00:14:27.053 --> 00:14:29.149
in the coming decades.

00:14:29.149 --> 00:14:33.737
The middle 18th century
is the seething hotbed

00:14:33.737 --> 00:14:37.570
of intellectual thought
about human diversity.

00:14:38.816 --> 00:14:43.686
Scholars throughout the
western intellectual tradition

00:14:43.686 --> 00:14:46.172
are trying to understand what does it mean

00:14:46.172 --> 00:14:48.422
when people look different?

00:14:49.534 --> 00:14:52.031
Are these people all from one source?

00:14:52.031 --> 00:14:54.658
Are they separate creations?

00:14:54.658 --> 00:14:56.540
Where did this diversity come from?

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.703
And what does it mean with
respect to people's cultures,

00:15:00.703 --> 00:15:03.370
their capacity for civilization?

00:15:05.118 --> 00:15:09.142
And this is where we
come to the work of many

00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:11.930
important philosophers, but
I'm singling out here today

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.013
Immanuel Kant, because
Kant holds a special place

00:15:17.348 --> 00:15:20.030
in the history of philosophy
and critical thought.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.780
He is lionized, rightly, for many

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:26.040
of his philosophical writings.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.964
But early in his career,
Kant thought deeply

00:15:29.964 --> 00:15:32.064
about human diversity.

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:35.999
He was trying to understand
why do people seem to have

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:40.356
different predilections for
behaving in certain ways

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:45.043
to be civilized, different
abilities to develop

00:15:45.043 --> 00:15:47.632
higher modes of thought.

00:15:47.632 --> 00:15:50.215
And so in a series of writings,

00:15:51.425 --> 00:15:54.842
beginning in 1775 and concluding in 1788,

00:15:55.777 --> 00:15:59.570
he is writing on the
subject of human diversity,

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:03.608
something that very few people recognized.

00:16:03.608 --> 00:16:07.108
And what he does is he formally constructs

00:16:08.417 --> 00:16:10.167
four races of humans,

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.435
and he is the first to
formally use that term.

00:16:15.435 --> 00:16:19.103
He uses the German noun
(speaking in foreign language),

00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:22.645
not race, but these are formal categories.

00:16:22.645 --> 00:16:24.562
And very significantly,

00:16:25.473 --> 00:16:28.302
he differs from Linnaeus,

00:16:28.302 --> 00:16:31.959
because these aren't just four groups.

00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:35.126
These are four groups that are ordered

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.383
in the order of their
potential for civilization,

00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:44.959
their potential for
developing higher thoughts,

00:16:44.959 --> 00:16:47.626
for being able to use reasoning.

00:16:48.909 --> 00:16:51.492
And very importantly, for Kant,

00:16:52.576 --> 00:16:56.031
these categories were immutable.

00:16:56.031 --> 00:17:00.198
And once a particular group,
for instance the Negro race

00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:04.866
as he defined it here, or the Hunish race,

00:17:04.866 --> 00:17:09.388
once they developed a certain
series of morphological

00:17:09.388 --> 00:17:11.655
characteristics, including color,

00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:14.405
that was an irreversible pathway.

00:17:15.287 --> 00:17:17.620
So he had a very rigid idea,

00:17:19.315 --> 00:17:22.282
as well as a hierarchical notion

00:17:22.282 --> 00:17:24.532
of how humans were arrayed.

00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:30.807
And famously, Kant almost never
left his own sitting room.

00:17:30.807 --> 00:17:34.807
So Kant got information
from many of these rich,

00:17:35.917 --> 00:17:39.020
by then very rich travelers' tales,

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.194
and he distilled it in his own way.

00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:46.280
And he was joined in this,
slightly earlier in time,

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.870
by the Scottish philosopher David Hume.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.037
Hume made less thorough
investigations of human diversity,

00:17:54.551 --> 00:17:59.305
but when you read Hume's
writings, one is left in no doubt

00:17:59.305 --> 00:18:01.805
that he knew who was superior.

00:18:03.287 --> 00:18:06.926
"There was never a civilized
nation of any complexion

00:18:06.926 --> 00:18:08.509
"other than white."

00:18:10.042 --> 00:18:12.625
So, even though there were many

00:18:14.746 --> 00:18:18.454
influential, quite influential detractors

00:18:18.454 --> 00:18:21.871
in the mid-18th century to Kant and Hume,

00:18:23.009 --> 00:18:24.509
why did this idea,

00:18:26.323 --> 00:18:29.823
this notion of human races in a hierarchy,

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.620
immutable, unmixable,

00:18:35.161 --> 00:18:39.818
how did this view come
to have such popularity

00:18:39.818 --> 00:18:40.818
to this day?

00:18:42.994 --> 00:18:45.702
Races for Kant and Hume were physically

00:18:45.702 --> 00:18:49.402
and culturally distinct from one another,

00:18:49.402 --> 00:18:53.569
and there was no doubt in
either of these man's minds

00:18:54.874 --> 00:18:58.457
that the so-called
White race was superior.

00:18:59.432 --> 00:19:04.012
This ascendancy we can now
look at through the richness

00:19:04.012 --> 00:19:07.845
of history as being
completely understandable.

00:19:09.951 --> 00:19:12.397
Both of these people were highly regarded.

00:19:12.397 --> 00:19:15.530
One of the things I'm
most interested in is

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.210
who's managing reputations.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.467
In the days before software companies

00:19:21.467 --> 00:19:26.223
were managing reputations,
who managed reputations?

00:19:26.223 --> 00:19:30.705
Basically, some scholars
were highly regarded,

00:19:30.705 --> 00:19:32.680
their works were widely circulated,

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.810
in particular salons.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.004
The information about
them was communicated

00:19:37.004 --> 00:19:40.578
from one scholar to
another by correspondence.

00:19:40.578 --> 00:19:44.997
People, these books, their
books became widely distributed,

00:19:44.997 --> 00:19:48.330
largely on the basis of personal circles

00:19:49.824 --> 00:19:53.324
of influence to the extent that these two,

00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:59.337
David Hume and Immanuel
Kant, in their lifetimes,

00:19:59.337 --> 00:20:01.865
became very, very highly regarded

00:20:01.865 --> 00:20:06.274
and their books were widely
distributed and translated.

00:20:06.274 --> 00:20:10.362
Their writings were taken up
by other prominent scholars

00:20:10.362 --> 00:20:14.336
and by statesmen, so that you
have politicians including

00:20:14.336 --> 00:20:18.503
politicians in the nascent
colonies and the United States

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:22.742
reading these works, as well.

00:20:22.742 --> 00:20:26.409
And we must bring in
economics at this time.

00:20:28.995 --> 00:20:32.817
This transatlantic slave
trade is expanding.

00:20:32.817 --> 00:20:36.060
There is pressure, especially in England,

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.560
to lessen or do away with the slave trade,

00:20:40.421 --> 00:20:43.914
but there is tremendous,
tremendous support

00:20:43.914 --> 00:20:47.566
from mercantile interests
in Europe to continue

00:20:47.566 --> 00:20:51.774
to promote it, to grow it
in whatever way is possible.

00:20:51.774 --> 00:20:56.667
This is where we begin to
see tremendously interesting,

00:20:56.667 --> 00:21:01.069
and in retrospect nefarious
and tragic alliances

00:21:01.069 --> 00:21:05.111
between commercial mercantile interests,

00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:09.028
philosophers, and some
very, very bad theology.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.230
By the middle 19th
century, tracts like this,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.970
The Biblical Defence of Slavery,

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.534
The Origin, History, and
Fortunes of the Negro Race,

00:21:22.534 --> 00:21:25.117
this is just one of many tracts

00:21:26.498 --> 00:21:29.498
that purport to use biblical sources

00:21:30.754 --> 00:21:34.171
to prove the inferiority of black people,

00:21:36.375 --> 00:21:40.632
especially darkly pigmented
people from Africa.

00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:45.072
So what we see, between
the middle of the 18th

00:21:45.072 --> 00:21:49.239
and the middle of the 19th
century is the imperfect storm

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.074
of forces, of economic, philosophical,

00:21:53.074 --> 00:21:56.612
and theological forces, and I
want to say quasi-theological

00:21:56.612 --> 00:21:59.252
forces, because there's
nothing in the Bible

00:21:59.252 --> 00:22:03.419
that talks about discrimination
according to color.

00:22:04.328 --> 00:22:08.495
Stories about the curse of Ham
are based on interpretations

00:22:09.481 --> 00:22:13.407
that are very much culturally
influenced interpretations

00:22:13.407 --> 00:22:15.157
of the Old Testament.

00:22:17.339 --> 00:22:18.922
So in this century,

00:22:19.792 --> 00:22:22.792
between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s,

00:22:24.266 --> 00:22:27.016
we have this maelstrom of forces,

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.900
not only demonstrating,
proving the existence of races,

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.672
proving the immutability of races,

00:22:35.672 --> 00:22:38.339
but also proving the inferiority

00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:41.852
of the so-called Negro race.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.444
And further, in some of these
biblical defenses of slavery,

00:22:45.444 --> 00:22:49.277
proving that Negros were
only fit for slavery,

00:22:50.938 --> 00:22:53.002
they were fit for serving others,

00:22:53.002 --> 00:22:56.085
and that their biology dictated this.

00:22:58.708 --> 00:23:00.799
This was a wild time.

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:03.966
And we can only recognize now how much

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.007
we were being manipulated.

00:23:08.772 --> 00:23:11.855
The boxes basically have text in them

00:23:13.829 --> 00:23:15.829
showing how the progress

00:23:17.138 --> 00:23:19.221
from this racial ideation

00:23:20.496 --> 00:23:24.011
to the creation of racial stereotypes

00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:26.261
to what I call color memes,

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:30.706
in the Richard Dawkins sense

00:23:31.844 --> 00:23:35.074
of a culturally transmitted
idea, that seems,

00:23:35.074 --> 00:23:37.657
that acts like a genetic trait.

00:23:39.688 --> 00:23:43.355
Color-coded race concepts
become color memes

00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:46.309
that are stereotypes.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.380
And this lays the clear psychosocial

00:23:51.884 --> 00:23:53.551
template for racism.

00:23:56.086 --> 00:23:58.336
So by the mid-19th century,

00:23:59.425 --> 00:24:01.592
we have color-based racism

00:24:02.977 --> 00:24:05.894
as the reality in the United States

00:24:06.896 --> 00:24:08.955
and in many other countries.

00:24:08.955 --> 00:24:12.658
This reality has been constructed in a way

00:24:12.658 --> 00:24:15.101
that is completely understandable,

00:24:15.101 --> 00:24:19.015
but in a way that most
people don't recognize.

00:24:19.015 --> 00:24:21.914
And certainly in a way
that most schoolchildren

00:24:21.914 --> 00:24:25.081
in the United States are taught about.

00:24:26.186 --> 00:24:28.269
When we look at the cost,

00:24:30.534 --> 00:24:33.739
the human cost of the slave trade,

00:24:33.739 --> 00:24:37.406
we begin to recognize
what is involved here.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.480
Nearly 13 million people

00:24:42.594 --> 00:24:44.204
involved in the slave trade,

00:24:44.204 --> 00:24:47.842
and from a social perspective, tremendous,

00:24:47.842 --> 00:24:52.445
tremendous disengagement
of uprooting of peoples

00:24:52.445 --> 00:24:55.448
from equatorial West Africa, primarily,

00:24:55.448 --> 00:24:58.524
into Europe, thence to the Caribbean,

00:24:58.524 --> 00:25:01.098
sometimes directly to South America,

00:25:01.098 --> 00:25:05.160
and then a smaller
fraction to North America.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.743
Nearly 13 million
people, and significantly

00:25:09.595 --> 00:25:13.058
involuntary migration, the
largest influx of people

00:25:13.058 --> 00:25:16.058
ever to come into the United States.

00:25:17.025 --> 00:25:21.994
And here we transit to our
biology and health considerations

00:25:21.994 --> 00:25:25.911
moving people from one
solar regime to another.

00:25:27.006 --> 00:25:30.116
In many cases, moving people
from a very, very sunny place

00:25:30.116 --> 00:25:31.949
to a less sunny place.

00:25:34.312 --> 00:25:37.508
What consequence is this
going to have for health?

00:25:37.508 --> 00:25:39.925
And further, what consequence

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:45.277
are other migrations going to have,

00:25:45.277 --> 00:25:48.479
voluntary migrations to this day,

00:25:48.479 --> 00:25:50.229
what are they having,

00:25:51.334 --> 00:25:54.012
what impact are they having on health.

00:25:54.012 --> 00:25:58.012
And further, what impact
is urbanization having?

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.188
As anthropologists, we tend to think

00:26:02.188 --> 00:26:06.355
that sort of the world stopped
maybe at the beginning,

00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:10.856
of the introduction of agriculture.

00:26:10.856 --> 00:26:14.542
That all sort of important
things in sort of human evolution

00:26:14.542 --> 00:26:16.596
stopped at that time.

00:26:16.596 --> 00:26:20.244
I would advance to you that
some of the most important

00:26:20.244 --> 00:26:22.911
biological changes started then.

00:26:24.434 --> 00:26:27.950
Because as a result of mass
migrations made possible

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.783
by rapid modes of movement,
ships then planes,

00:26:33.512 --> 00:26:37.746
people able to move dozens
of degrees of latitude

00:26:37.746 --> 00:26:41.329
in hours instead of
weeks, or in a few days

00:26:42.337 --> 00:26:46.521
instead of over many
generations or lifetimes,

00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:50.398
that this physical movement of people,

00:26:50.398 --> 00:26:54.206
as well as the concentration
of people in cities,

00:26:54.206 --> 00:26:58.959
from fairly modest cities,
seven and 8000 years ago,

00:26:58.959 --> 00:27:02.126
to the mega cities of the world today.

00:27:03.155 --> 00:27:06.322
And a prospect in 20 years of 70%

00:27:07.182 --> 00:27:10.144
of the world's population being in cities.

00:27:10.144 --> 00:27:13.978
This is such a dramatic
departure from anything

00:27:13.978 --> 00:27:16.877
previously in human evolution.

00:27:16.877 --> 00:27:20.267
And today I want to talk about
specifically the consequences

00:27:20.267 --> 00:27:23.100
for our relationship with the sun.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:26.073
Where are we today?

00:27:26.073 --> 00:27:30.693
We are in a very nice building,
far away from the sun.

00:27:30.693 --> 00:27:34.461
And most of us have spent most of today

00:27:34.461 --> 00:27:36.350
outside of the sun.

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:40.279
This is a great departure from
what even perhaps our parents

00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:43.185
or certainly our grandparents
or great-grandparents

00:27:43.185 --> 00:27:44.441
might have done.

00:27:44.441 --> 00:27:47.263
People who toiled in the
fields or worked out-of-doors

00:27:47.263 --> 00:27:49.742
or at least walked to and from work,

00:27:49.742 --> 00:27:51.835
if they lived in cities.

00:27:51.835 --> 00:27:56.256
These are enormous forces
of modern evolution

00:27:56.256 --> 00:27:58.339
acting on the human body.

00:28:00.835 --> 00:28:05.260
If we look at just some recent
human voluntary migration,

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.374
so we're not talking about the
mass involuntary migrations

00:28:08.374 --> 00:28:10.341
of the transatlantic slave trade,

00:28:10.341 --> 00:28:14.508
but rather just a sampling
of some of the more dramatic

00:28:16.298 --> 00:28:20.381
migrations, long distances
often involving people

00:28:21.407 --> 00:28:26.300
going from areas with very
low ultraviolet radiation

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.467
to high and vice versa, some
extremely long distance ones

00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:35.445
involving great shifts from high to low

00:28:35.445 --> 00:28:36.945
or low to high UV.

00:28:38.808 --> 00:28:40.883
We think we're very clever
that we can undertake

00:28:40.883 --> 00:28:42.633
these mass movements.

00:28:43.664 --> 00:28:47.164
It is fantastically technologically superb

00:28:48.155 --> 00:28:49.595
that we're able to undertake this,

00:28:49.595 --> 00:28:51.835
that people can move around
freely over the surface

00:28:51.835 --> 00:28:53.496
of the Earth's surface.

00:28:53.496 --> 00:28:57.206
And we have the hubris to
think that we can somehow

00:28:57.206 --> 00:29:00.283
overcome it or that it
doesn't really matter to us

00:29:00.283 --> 00:29:04.510
as biological organisms,
because we're so clever.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:06.388
Well, we're not.

00:29:06.388 --> 00:29:09.679
Because there are some considerations,

00:29:09.679 --> 00:29:12.620
some biological considerations
that we haven't given

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.037
full credence to.

00:29:16.414 --> 00:29:20.383
Recall that human behavior in prehistory

00:29:20.383 --> 00:29:21.701
was very different.

00:29:21.701 --> 00:29:25.868
We didn't travel very much
during individual lifetimes.

00:29:26.864 --> 00:29:30.394
Certainly people would, at various times,

00:29:30.394 --> 00:29:34.144
pursue prey, animals,
that would be migrating

00:29:35.058 --> 00:29:36.950
and they would go after them.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.702
But there were never
sort of long distance,

00:29:39.702 --> 00:29:42.647
or very few long distance
migrations of people.

00:29:42.647 --> 00:29:44.711
And people during their lives would move

00:29:44.711 --> 00:29:46.961
10 or 20 kilometers, maybe.

00:29:49.423 --> 00:29:51.895
And they spent most of their time outside

00:29:51.895 --> 00:29:53.667
and mostly without sewn clothing.

00:29:53.667 --> 00:29:57.583
Again, if we only have needles showing up

00:29:57.583 --> 00:30:00.603
in the archaeological
record, sewn clothing,

00:30:00.603 --> 00:30:03.203
tailored clothing that
can protect the body

00:30:03.203 --> 00:30:06.043
only in the last 20,000 years,

00:30:06.043 --> 00:30:07.410
what are we doing before that?

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:10.594
Yes, we are protecting
ourselves with animal skins

00:30:10.594 --> 00:30:12.475
and probably plant materials.

00:30:12.475 --> 00:30:15.058
But skin is our major interface

00:30:16.623 --> 00:30:18.812
during most of the major movements

00:30:18.812 --> 00:30:21.348
and dispersals of human populations,

00:30:21.348 --> 00:30:24.531
skin is our major interface
with the environment.

00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:26.948
And we, as outside organisms,

00:30:29.484 --> 00:30:32.651
are under varying ultraviolet regimes.

00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:34.904
If we're living at the Equator,

00:30:34.904 --> 00:30:37.462
the amount of variation is
less than if we're living

00:30:37.462 --> 00:30:41.598
at this latitude or even
closer to the poles.

00:30:41.598 --> 00:30:45.168
But variation in ultraviolet
radiation can be extreme.

00:30:45.168 --> 00:30:48.318
And variation in solar
radiation can be extreme.

00:30:48.318 --> 00:30:50.235
So our skin has adapted

00:30:52.573 --> 00:30:54.823
to these changing regimens.

00:30:55.678 --> 00:30:58.595
And we see biocultural adaptations.

00:30:59.664 --> 00:31:04.643
Not only genetically driven
adaptations in skin pigmentation

00:31:04.643 --> 00:31:07.995
but cultural adaptations,
modification of diet

00:31:07.995 --> 00:31:11.584
and ways of procuring food
so that we can compensate

00:31:11.584 --> 00:31:15.751
for difficulties posed by
the physical environment.

00:31:18.604 --> 00:31:21.134
But today, holy hell,

00:31:21.134 --> 00:31:25.989
not only are people dispersing,
but they take vacations.

00:31:25.989 --> 00:31:28.843
Who took vacations 500 years ago?

00:31:28.843 --> 00:31:29.676
Or 5000?

00:31:31.551 --> 00:31:34.507
The whole concept of a
vacation is something

00:31:34.507 --> 00:31:37.187
that our ancestors never entertained.

00:31:37.187 --> 00:31:39.143
But today we have all sorts of ways

00:31:39.143 --> 00:31:41.042
for getting people around.

00:31:41.042 --> 00:31:43.577
And one of the things
that they like to do,

00:31:43.577 --> 00:31:47.223
especially if they're in indoor jobs,

00:31:47.223 --> 00:31:51.036
is that they like to find sunny places.

00:31:51.036 --> 00:31:54.378
And so you have these
incredibly depigmented people

00:31:54.378 --> 00:31:56.378
seeking out sunny places

00:31:57.215 --> 00:32:00.298
for intense episodes of sun exposure.

00:32:02.732 --> 00:32:04.065
What a bad idea.

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:10.326
So if we just look at a sampling
of 21st century vacations,

00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:16.335
they are many and varied.

00:32:16.335 --> 00:32:19.064
And on a college campus you
that it is spring break.

00:32:19.064 --> 00:32:21.753
Kids are going all over the place.

00:32:21.753 --> 00:32:23.427
People go all over the place.

00:32:23.427 --> 00:32:27.546
And often in the wintertime,
they're seeking out sun.

00:32:27.546 --> 00:32:30.376
Or they're seeking out some
interesting cultural experience

00:32:30.376 --> 00:32:32.407
often in a sunny place.

00:32:32.407 --> 00:32:36.104
So we have humans that are
moving, not only migrating

00:32:36.104 --> 00:32:39.798
to live in a particular place,
we have them undertaking

00:32:39.798 --> 00:32:43.078
these short, episodic vacations

00:32:43.078 --> 00:32:45.643
so that they can enjoy leisure time

00:32:45.643 --> 00:32:48.056
in a different environment.

00:32:48.056 --> 00:32:51.048
And this is where we really begin to see

00:32:51.048 --> 00:32:55.131
some of the first untoward
aspects of modern life

00:32:56.265 --> 00:32:58.065
with respect to the skin.

00:32:58.065 --> 00:33:01.346
The rise of intense, episodic sun exposure

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:03.199
and the vacation effect.

00:33:03.199 --> 00:33:05.901
And not just solely sort
of going on vacation

00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:07.054
to a sunny place,

00:33:07.054 --> 00:33:11.706
but the rise in the use
of tanning facilities.

00:33:11.706 --> 00:33:14.768
Now I realize there aren't
that many tanning facilities

00:33:14.768 --> 00:33:17.168
in Berkeley, although I
did see one the other day

00:33:17.168 --> 00:33:19.037
as I was walking around.

00:33:19.037 --> 00:33:21.256
But where I live in Central Pennsylvania,

00:33:21.256 --> 00:33:22.634
they are common.

00:33:22.634 --> 00:33:24.677
And in many parts of this country,

00:33:24.677 --> 00:33:26.386
they are extremely common.

00:33:26.386 --> 00:33:28.954
People like to go there.

00:33:28.954 --> 00:33:32.704
It feels better to them
when they get, quote,

00:33:33.752 --> 00:33:37.034
sun on their bodies, UV on their bodies.

00:33:37.034 --> 00:33:40.534
So without going into excruciating detail,

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.819
suffice it to say that people pay.

00:33:44.819 --> 00:33:46.609
In the short term they
pay because they get

00:33:46.609 --> 00:33:49.664
an uncomfortable sunburn,
but in the long term they pay

00:33:49.664 --> 00:33:51.503
because of an increased susceptibility

00:33:51.503 --> 00:33:54.605
to a variety of skin cancers.

00:33:54.605 --> 00:33:59.385
And including if the
exposure is intense enough,

00:33:59.385 --> 00:34:02.549
and the genetic architecture
of the skin is such,

00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:07.044
episodic strong exposures
in childhood especially

00:34:07.044 --> 00:34:10.636
can lead to the most
deadly form of skin cancer,

00:34:10.636 --> 00:34:13.719
melanoma, which was almost unheard of

00:34:15.752 --> 00:34:17.585
in humans before 1950.

00:34:22.454 --> 00:34:26.454
So we have this interesting
pattern of morbidity

00:34:27.312 --> 00:34:32.214
and sun mortality due to too
much episodic sun exposure.

00:34:32.214 --> 00:34:35.308
But I want to spend
more time talking about

00:34:35.308 --> 00:34:38.405
what happens on the
other side of the coin.

00:34:38.405 --> 00:34:39.961
What happens in big cities,

00:34:39.961 --> 00:34:42.096
where we have like in New York City here,

00:34:42.096 --> 00:34:47.006
everybody, every color, every
shade of the sepia rainbow

00:34:47.006 --> 00:34:49.438
represented, every possible ethnicity,

00:34:49.438 --> 00:34:52.170
most people living indoors.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:53.768
What happens?

00:34:53.768 --> 00:34:56.895
Like in this Motorola plant in Texas

00:34:56.895 --> 00:34:59.805
where all of the workers,
from whatever background,

00:34:59.805 --> 00:35:02.286
spend all of their time indoors

00:35:02.286 --> 00:35:04.203
assembling cell phones.

00:35:06.286 --> 00:35:10.872
These individuals are
experiencing different rhythms

00:35:10.872 --> 00:35:13.711
of nature, a different quality of nature,

00:35:13.711 --> 00:35:15.347
a different kind of environment

00:35:15.347 --> 00:35:18.180
than humans have ever experienced.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.840
And we now are beginning to recognize

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.507
what health toll this is taking.

00:35:28.913 --> 00:35:30.633
Yesterday I introduced the concept

00:35:30.633 --> 00:35:33.223
of the vitamin D compromise,

00:35:33.223 --> 00:35:35.806
how people throughout evolution

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:41.122
have developed ways of
getting enough vitamin D.

00:35:41.122 --> 00:35:44.973
At the Equator, if you
are outdoors long enough,

00:35:44.973 --> 00:35:47.545
even if you have the most
darkly pigmented skin,

00:35:47.545 --> 00:35:49.900
you will be able to make ample vitamin D

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.558
to satisfy your physiological needs.

00:35:52.558 --> 00:35:56.504
But if you spend time indoors,
a lot of time indoors,

00:35:56.504 --> 00:35:58.672
that changes things.

00:35:58.672 --> 00:36:01.461
If you are a lightly pigmented person,

00:36:01.461 --> 00:36:04.800
even though you can get a
lot of vitamin D produced

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.679
in your skin in a relatively
short period of time,

00:36:07.679 --> 00:36:10.429
if it's in the sunlight outdoors,

00:36:12.018 --> 00:36:14.867
if you spend all of your time inside,

00:36:14.867 --> 00:36:18.700
you have no opportunity to
make vitamin D in the skin.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:22.537
So the vitamin D compromise,
as we have described it,

00:36:22.537 --> 00:36:25.767
is a compromise that has been worked out

00:36:25.767 --> 00:36:28.899
more or less by trial
and error by cultures

00:36:28.899 --> 00:36:31.346
in various places over thousands of years,

00:36:31.346 --> 00:36:34.027
whereby if you're not
getting a lot of vitamin D

00:36:34.027 --> 00:36:38.194
from solar sources, you are
getting it from dietary sources.

00:36:39.262 --> 00:36:43.130
And people living at
extreme high and extreme,

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:46.469
in both hemispheres, northern
and southern hemispheres,

00:36:46.469 --> 00:36:49.497
have cultures that
concentrate on the harvesting

00:36:49.497 --> 00:36:51.497
of vitamin D-rich foods.

00:36:52.671 --> 00:36:55.254
So what happens to folks today?

00:36:57.152 --> 00:37:01.237
The vitamin D compromise is mostly broken

00:37:01.237 --> 00:37:03.654
because we are living indoors

00:37:05.317 --> 00:37:07.691
in ways that I've described,

00:37:07.691 --> 00:37:10.351
going to school, going to work.

00:37:10.351 --> 00:37:13.150
When we do have outdoor sun exposure,

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.722
it may be in the very early morning

00:37:14.722 --> 00:37:17.518
or in the late afternoon
when there's very little

00:37:17.518 --> 00:37:20.759
in the way of ultraviolet
radiation in the sunlight.

00:37:20.759 --> 00:37:24.063
So we may feel some benefit
from being out-of-doors,

00:37:24.063 --> 00:37:26.896
but we're not deriving any benefit

00:37:27.866 --> 00:37:32.033
from the positive side of
ultraviolet radiation exposure.

00:37:34.126 --> 00:37:37.253
And with reduced time spent out-of-doors,

00:37:37.253 --> 00:37:39.849
the combination of being in a city,

00:37:39.849 --> 00:37:42.106
of having an indoor lifestyle, is,

00:37:42.106 --> 00:37:45.079
I wouldn't want to say
a deadly combination,

00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:47.818
but it's a combination that is inviting

00:37:47.818 --> 00:37:50.543
chronic sickness of various kinds,

00:37:50.543 --> 00:37:53.862
and I'm gonna talk about that.

00:37:53.862 --> 00:37:56.945
The levels of morbidity and mortality

00:37:58.728 --> 00:38:03.478
that can now be traced
to vitamin D deficiency,

00:38:03.478 --> 00:38:08.173
especially chronic vitamin D
deficiency, are prodigious.

00:38:08.173 --> 00:38:12.340
This is now a problem of
enormous and global proportions,

00:38:13.869 --> 00:38:16.842
a significant global health problem.

00:38:16.842 --> 00:38:20.078
It is, to some extent,
understated in this country,

00:38:20.078 --> 00:38:21.946
but it's certainly not being understated

00:38:21.946 --> 00:38:25.391
in many other countries,
especially in those where

00:38:25.391 --> 00:38:29.933
a nationalized health system
is picking up most of the cost

00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:33.766
for the vitamin D
deficiency-related diseases.

00:38:35.113 --> 00:38:38.696
Cities, in addition to
promoting sedentism,

00:38:41.225 --> 00:38:44.926
the atmosphere of some
cities filters out a lot

00:38:44.926 --> 00:38:48.783
of UV, especially the short wavelengths,

00:38:48.783 --> 00:38:51.387
ultraviolet B radiation.

00:38:51.387 --> 00:38:54.117
The canyons that we find in many cities

00:38:54.117 --> 00:38:58.284
effectively eliminates
sunlight from the ground level.

00:38:59.808 --> 00:39:03.641
Indoor environments,
again, fluorescent lights

00:39:04.938 --> 00:39:07.407
at best provide some illumination,

00:39:07.407 --> 00:39:10.022
but provide no other benefit,

00:39:10.022 --> 00:39:12.903
and sometimes can be, if they're too blue,

00:39:12.903 --> 00:39:16.700
can actually stimulate our
alertness centers too much,

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.056
so it ruins our sleep patterns.

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:23.278
And in a great departure
from whatever we did

00:39:23.278 --> 00:39:27.638
in prehistory, we now mostly
wear concealing clothing,

00:39:27.638 --> 00:39:30.212
sewn clothing, mass-marketed clothing,

00:39:30.212 --> 00:39:31.905
clothing that we change all the time

00:39:31.905 --> 00:39:33.786
and we make into fashion statements.

00:39:33.786 --> 00:39:36.085
Yeah, it's great, it's
part of human culture.

00:39:36.085 --> 00:39:39.275
But, it's changed our relationship

00:39:39.275 --> 00:39:42.224
to our physical environment completely.

00:39:42.224 --> 00:39:45.607
And in some culture,
where concealing clothing

00:39:45.607 --> 00:39:49.774
is religiously mandated,
the concealment is complete.

00:39:51.406 --> 00:39:53.708
And this changes the nature

00:39:53.708 --> 00:39:57.478
of the biological interface entirely.

00:39:57.478 --> 00:40:01.019
The vitamin D compromise
is now also broken

00:40:01.019 --> 00:40:05.483
because we have reduced consumption
of vitamin D-rich foods.

00:40:05.483 --> 00:40:09.508
In many parts of the
world, vitamin D-rich fish

00:40:09.508 --> 00:40:11.213
have been depleted from the sea.

00:40:11.213 --> 00:40:13.713
The codfish that the Scots ate

00:40:15.337 --> 00:40:16.670
in early history

00:40:18.112 --> 00:40:21.099
and into the 20th century,

00:40:21.099 --> 00:40:23.233
is now mostly depleted
from the North Atlantic

00:40:23.233 --> 00:40:25.178
and the North Sea.

00:40:25.178 --> 00:40:28.511
So, people are eating fish in this form,

00:40:30.325 --> 00:40:33.825
often whitefish, often other types of fish

00:40:34.909 --> 00:40:39.076
that have no or virtually
no vitamin D content at all.

00:40:40.825 --> 00:40:43.898
So you might feel a little
bit noble about eating

00:40:43.898 --> 00:40:46.675
something like this,
you know, as opposed to

00:40:46.675 --> 00:40:48.508
a basket of McNuggets.

00:40:50.063 --> 00:40:54.230
But there's very little virtue
involved in no vitamin D.

00:40:55.458 --> 00:40:58.125
And for darkly pigmented people,

00:41:00.841 --> 00:41:05.050
the vitamin D compromise,
especially in cities,

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.686
has been broken.

00:41:06.686 --> 00:41:11.097
Because dark pigmentation,
dark pigmentation being such

00:41:11.097 --> 00:41:15.180
a natural sunscreen, such
an excellent competitor

00:41:16.288 --> 00:41:19.954
with photons, it absorbs all the UVB

00:41:19.954 --> 00:41:24.121
that might have been used
to convert 70hc in your skin

00:41:25.738 --> 00:41:27.071
to previtamin D.

00:41:30.283 --> 00:41:34.766
Combine this with living
in low UV environments,

00:41:34.766 --> 00:41:38.799
think about people
living in London, Boston,

00:41:38.799 --> 00:41:41.929
or even just living
indoors most of the time,

00:41:41.929 --> 00:41:44.250
the combination of dark pigmentation

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:47.250
and low UVB environments is critical

00:41:48.835 --> 00:41:52.207
and has resulted in what we recognize now

00:41:52.207 --> 00:41:55.874
as truly an epidemic
of vitamin D deficiency

00:41:57.213 --> 00:41:59.600
in darkly pigmented people,

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.517
especially those of African origin.

00:42:04.806 --> 00:42:07.889
So when we look at our model of skin,

00:42:09.156 --> 00:42:13.399
here is, again, our epidermis
with dark pigmentation.

00:42:13.399 --> 00:42:15.995
Here's ultraviolet B and ultraviolet A

00:42:15.995 --> 00:42:17.533
coming from the sun.

00:42:17.533 --> 00:42:19.798
At the Equator, there's a lot of both.

00:42:19.798 --> 00:42:23.866
But UVB is being scattered and absorbed

00:42:23.866 --> 00:42:27.416
by the atmospheric oxygen and ozone.

00:42:27.416 --> 00:42:30.333
And here most UVB is being absorbed

00:42:31.468 --> 00:42:35.733
by the beautiful eumelanin
in the pigment here

00:42:35.733 --> 00:42:37.650
in the lower epidermis.

00:42:38.748 --> 00:42:43.300
And then, what is happening
is that some vitamin D

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.217
formation is occurring.

00:42:46.421 --> 00:42:49.388
So if someone is outdoors long enough,

00:42:49.388 --> 00:42:52.664
even with this beautiful
natural sun protection,

00:42:52.664 --> 00:42:55.504
ample vitamin D would form in the skin

00:42:55.504 --> 00:42:58.754
to adequately meet physiological needs.

00:43:02.136 --> 00:43:05.136
But as soon as UVB levels are lower,

00:43:06.581 --> 00:43:09.701
as a result of change of
lifestyle or change of location

00:43:09.701 --> 00:43:13.701
or both, all of a sudden
this dark pigmentation,

00:43:14.909 --> 00:43:19.136
which competes for
photons, for UVB photons,

00:43:19.136 --> 00:43:21.636
will entirely prohibit any UVB

00:43:23.272 --> 00:43:26.918
from penetrating into the layer here

00:43:26.918 --> 00:43:29.860
where vitamin D is formed.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:34.188
So this we looked at in
an evolutionary context

00:43:34.188 --> 00:43:38.089
was the reason that we see the evolution

00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:40.506
of depigmentation in lineages

00:43:42.287 --> 00:43:45.966
of Western Europeans and East Asians.

00:43:45.966 --> 00:43:49.301
But it is one of the
reasons today that we see

00:43:49.301 --> 00:43:53.275
vitamin D deficiency in
people of dark pigmentation,

00:43:53.275 --> 00:43:57.421
especially, because this
beautiful sunscreen layer

00:43:57.421 --> 00:44:00.921
is doing its job when we wish it wouldn't.

00:44:05.936 --> 00:44:08.568
So what happens to vitamin
D production in the skin

00:44:08.568 --> 00:44:11.616
when it's low or when people live inside?

00:44:11.616 --> 00:44:14.033
Basically, it doesn't happen.

00:44:15.795 --> 00:44:18.544
And we end up with people at best

00:44:18.544 --> 00:44:22.922
that have seasonal peaks
in vitamin D levels.

00:44:22.922 --> 00:44:24.582
In order to study this more fully,

00:44:24.582 --> 00:44:27.582
we took our study, a clinical study,

00:44:29.396 --> 00:44:32.292
to South Africa, a country
that I've been fascinated in

00:44:32.292 --> 00:44:36.455
for years, because it is
a country and a region

00:44:36.455 --> 00:44:38.955
that is one of the most lavish

00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:44.458
and deeply historical
melting pots in the world,

00:44:44.458 --> 00:44:48.625
where people through the
Bantu language expansions

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.947
of five to 3000 years ago have
moved into Southern Africa.

00:44:55.218 --> 00:44:59.385
We have indigenous people who
have been in South Africa,

00:45:00.549 --> 00:45:04.716
the sun, and Khoi peoples
for more than 70,000 years.

00:45:06.393 --> 00:45:10.908
We have Europeans coming
almost 500 years ago.

00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:15.075
And soon thereafter, waves
of immigrants and slaves

00:45:17.074 --> 00:45:20.407
coming from Madagascar, Java, and India,

00:45:21.467 --> 00:45:26.408
all converging on the western
cape of South Africa initially

00:45:26.408 --> 00:45:30.007
and then branching out into
the rest of South Africa.

00:45:30.007 --> 00:45:34.592
An incredible mixing pot
of cultures, languages,

00:45:34.592 --> 00:45:36.238
and skin colors.

00:45:36.238 --> 00:45:41.101
And I thought what better
place to look at the factors

00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:45.268
that influence vitamin D
production than to take some

00:45:46.709 --> 00:45:50.997
samples of healthy
young people and monitor

00:45:50.997 --> 00:45:54.580
their vitamin D levels
throughout the year.

00:45:55.626 --> 00:45:59.459
What we did also was we
measured levels of UVB

00:46:00.709 --> 00:46:01.700
in the atmosphere.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:05.644
So instead of relying on
indirect satellite measurements,

00:46:05.644 --> 00:46:09.803
we actually looked at on the ground UVB.

00:46:09.803 --> 00:46:12.274
And because our study was focused

00:46:12.274 --> 00:46:15.952
on what was happening in the
very extreme southwest corner

00:46:15.952 --> 00:46:20.560
occupied by Cape Town and
other polities nearby,

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.227
this area is particularly
bereft of sunlight

00:46:25.563 --> 00:46:27.128
in the austral winter,

00:46:27.128 --> 00:46:28.868
something that very few people appreciate.

00:46:28.868 --> 00:46:30.192
South Africa is a big country

00:46:30.192 --> 00:46:33.586
and there is a tremendous
gradient of ultraviolet radiation.

00:46:33.586 --> 00:46:37.059
But the southwest corner is very low,

00:46:37.059 --> 00:46:38.298
especially in the winter.

00:46:38.298 --> 00:46:39.888
So what happens?

00:46:39.888 --> 00:46:41.473
What happens to people's vitamin D levels

00:46:41.473 --> 00:46:43.997
when you've got all of these
different kinds and colors

00:46:43.997 --> 00:46:48.222
of people living in a
highly seasonal UVB regime?

00:46:48.222 --> 00:46:50.668
To make a long story short,

00:46:50.668 --> 00:46:54.751
they experienced seasonal
vitamin D deficiencies.

00:46:56.020 --> 00:47:00.107
So this vitamin D
formation in the wintertime

00:47:00.107 --> 00:47:02.438
disappears entirely.

00:47:02.438 --> 00:47:04.882
People aren't eating vitamin D-rich foods.

00:47:04.882 --> 00:47:06.761
They have very little access to them.

00:47:06.761 --> 00:47:08.360
There's no vitamin D supplements

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.995
that most people can afford.

00:47:09.995 --> 00:47:14.913
So they enter into these
troughs of vitamin D deficiency.

00:47:14.913 --> 00:47:16.669
What happens?

00:47:16.669 --> 00:47:19.581
When your doctor talks to you
about vitamin D deficiency,

00:47:19.581 --> 00:47:21.597
they sort of wag their finger and say,

00:47:21.597 --> 00:47:23.967
"Oh, you're going to be
susceptible to colds and flu,"

00:47:23.967 --> 00:47:25.943
and all sorts of things.

00:47:25.943 --> 00:47:28.543
In South Africa, that's also true.

00:47:28.543 --> 00:47:32.622
But in South Africa, where
there's high prevalence,

00:47:32.622 --> 00:47:36.789
still, of HIV-1 virus and high
prevalence of tuberculosis,

00:47:37.797 --> 00:47:41.880
the stakes of infectious
disease are much higher.

00:47:43.752 --> 00:47:46.095
So if your immune system is weakened

00:47:46.095 --> 00:47:48.084
because of vitamin D deficiency,

00:47:48.084 --> 00:47:50.015
you don't just get a sniffle.

00:47:50.015 --> 00:47:53.120
You might actually contract infection

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.685
from the tuberculosis bacillus.

00:47:55.685 --> 00:47:58.919
Or, if you're an HIV-1 carrier,

00:47:58.919 --> 00:48:03.197
you might convert into
an active AIDS patient.

00:48:03.197 --> 00:48:05.354
So vitamin D deficiency becomes

00:48:05.354 --> 00:48:07.771
a much higher stakes problem.

00:48:09.613 --> 00:48:13.780
Low winter UV leads to
extremely low vitamin D levels.

00:48:14.655 --> 00:48:18.106
And what we found, it wasn't just low UVB,

00:48:18.106 --> 00:48:21.598
but the fact that people stayed
indoors more in the winter.

00:48:21.598 --> 00:48:23.917
So regardless of what
their skin color was,

00:48:23.917 --> 00:48:26.400
the fact that they stayed indoors more

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.817
and didn't have access to the ambient UVB

00:48:31.123 --> 00:48:33.502
when it was available
made a big difference

00:48:33.502 --> 00:48:35.803
to their ultraviolet B exposure

00:48:35.803 --> 00:48:38.431
and their vitamin D production.

00:48:38.431 --> 00:48:40.878
And in a paper that we
published a few years ago

00:48:40.878 --> 00:48:43.361
in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences,

00:48:43.361 --> 00:48:45.889
without going through a lot here,

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:50.204
we were able to show that
actually when we were able

00:48:50.204 --> 00:48:52.204
to study the replication

00:48:54.518 --> 00:48:57.501
of HIV virus outside of the body,

00:48:57.501 --> 00:48:59.704
when we took blood samples from people,

00:48:59.704 --> 00:49:01.747
looked at their vitamin D levels,

00:49:01.747 --> 00:49:06.202
but also cultured their
blood to see what levels

00:49:06.202 --> 00:49:08.369
of virus could be cultured

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.105
under different vitamin D levels,

00:49:13.105 --> 00:49:17.831
what we found was that
HIV-1 virus proliferated

00:49:17.831 --> 00:49:21.452
under conditions of vitamin D deficiency.

00:49:21.452 --> 00:49:25.449
So low winter UV led to
not only extremely low

00:49:25.449 --> 00:49:29.163
winter vitamin D levels,
but increased susceptibility

00:49:29.163 --> 00:49:31.246
to HIV and TB infections.

00:49:36.595 --> 00:49:39.345
This is something now that we are

00:49:40.485 --> 00:49:42.281
continuing to work on.

00:49:42.281 --> 00:49:45.282
The problem of lack of
vitamin D production

00:49:45.282 --> 00:49:47.449
is now a problem, even if you don't have

00:49:47.449 --> 00:49:49.248
darkly pigmented skin.

00:49:49.248 --> 00:49:52.259
Lots of people with moderately
and lightly pigmented skin

00:49:52.259 --> 00:49:55.153
are vitamin D deficient, simply
because they're not getting

00:49:55.153 --> 00:49:58.514
outdoors very much, or
because they're very attentive

00:49:58.514 --> 00:50:01.054
in their use of sunscreen.

00:50:01.054 --> 00:50:02.766
These things are very important.

00:50:02.766 --> 00:50:06.419
Protecting your skin against
ultraviolet radiation

00:50:06.419 --> 00:50:07.322
is important.

00:50:07.322 --> 00:50:08.836
We are long-lived animals.

00:50:08.836 --> 00:50:11.375
We don't want our skin to deteriorate.

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:14.157
But we have to recognize
that if we're not getting

00:50:14.157 --> 00:50:16.349
our vitamin D from the
sun, we have to get it

00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:18.349
from some other sources.

00:50:21.642 --> 00:50:25.809
And vitamin D deficiency is
now a serious global problem.

00:50:28.986 --> 00:50:33.773
But what happens to this
other interesting molecule

00:50:33.773 --> 00:50:37.023
in the skin that is produced
and released in great abundance

00:50:37.023 --> 00:50:40.190
when the sun and ultraviolet radiation

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:45.387
impinges on the surface
of the skin, nitric oxide?

00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:49.911
Recall that nitric oxide is released

00:50:50.769 --> 00:50:54.019
in the skin by ultraviolet A radiation.

00:50:55.685 --> 00:50:57.826
The release of nitric oxide in the skin

00:50:57.826 --> 00:51:00.831
is made possible by our friend folate,

00:51:00.831 --> 00:51:01.998
the B vitamin.

00:51:03.269 --> 00:51:05.541
Nitric oxide is released in the skin

00:51:05.541 --> 00:51:09.541
and it allows the peripheral
arteries to dilate,

00:51:11.267 --> 00:51:14.874
thus providing fluid to
the eccrine sweat gland

00:51:14.874 --> 00:51:17.734
so that we can maintain
thermal regulation.

00:51:17.734 --> 00:51:20.901
And helping to control blood pressure.

00:51:22.038 --> 00:51:26.038
What happens if people
are indoors all the time?

00:51:27.809 --> 00:51:30.809
Nitric oxide isn't produced as much,

00:51:32.336 --> 00:51:35.434
and vasodilation does not occur.

00:51:35.434 --> 00:51:39.440
In fact, you can have
chronic vasoconstriction

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.754
under these circumstances.

00:51:41.754 --> 00:51:45.909
And whether you have darkly
or lightly pigmented skin,

00:51:45.909 --> 00:51:47.576
the problem is real.

00:51:49.342 --> 00:51:52.145
Peripheral vasoconstriction as a result

00:51:52.145 --> 00:51:54.145
of lack of sun exposure.

00:51:55.042 --> 00:51:57.705
My colleague Richard
Weller at the University

00:51:57.705 --> 00:52:01.199
of Edinborough, as well as
my colleague Larry Kenney

00:52:01.199 --> 00:52:05.366
at Penn State University are
involved in studies looking

00:52:06.211 --> 00:52:09.654
at the cardiovascular benefits of sunlight

00:52:09.654 --> 00:52:12.007
that are independent of vitamin D.

00:52:12.007 --> 00:52:14.346
And I am collaborating with
both of them very happily,

00:52:14.346 --> 00:52:17.678
because I'm trying to figure
out how this all worked out

00:52:17.678 --> 00:52:19.678
in evolutionary history,

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:23.633
and how it matters now to our health,

00:52:24.954 --> 00:52:27.656
and why we have to pay
attention to the evolutionary

00:52:27.656 --> 00:52:31.489
fundamentals in order
to lead healthier lives.

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:34.507
We evolved under the sun,

00:52:34.507 --> 00:52:36.793
and the changes in our lifestyle

00:52:36.793 --> 00:52:38.802
we have to think about very carefully.

00:52:38.802 --> 00:52:41.885
The skin is our primary
interface with the environment.

00:52:41.885 --> 00:52:44.302
It has been, it is no longer.

00:52:45.174 --> 00:52:47.567
We need to sort of renegotiate.

00:52:47.567 --> 00:52:49.867
We have to strike a new compromise

00:52:49.867 --> 00:52:53.050
between behavior, diet, and culture

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:56.212
to improve health and well-being.

00:52:56.212 --> 00:52:59.288
But do we go cry in our beer because,

00:52:59.288 --> 00:53:01.898
oh woe is me, we have social problems.

00:53:01.898 --> 00:53:04.731
We have color-based race problems.

00:53:06.084 --> 00:53:10.246
We have health problems
related to skin color.

00:53:10.246 --> 00:53:11.996
No, we don't despair,

00:53:13.194 --> 00:53:15.694
because we are thinking humans

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.247
who prize education.

00:53:20.177 --> 00:53:23.540
And one of the things I'm
involved in really happily

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:26.881
is the production of a
book that will be published

00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:29.404
by David Philip Publishers
in Cape Town in July

00:53:29.404 --> 00:53:32.627
about the evolution of skin pigmentation

00:53:32.627 --> 00:53:35.635
for school kids in South Africa.

00:53:35.635 --> 00:53:38.896
It will be initially be published in four

00:53:38.896 --> 00:53:40.529
of South Africa's languages.

00:53:40.529 --> 00:53:44.644
And by the end of the year
in the official 10 languages

00:53:44.644 --> 00:53:46.518
of the country.

00:53:46.518 --> 00:53:48.851
We can also, closer to home,

00:53:51.171 --> 00:53:53.421
teach kids about diversity,

00:53:54.906 --> 00:53:59.474
about human evolution, about
how all of this history

00:53:59.474 --> 00:54:03.418
has played out and brought
us to where we are today.

00:54:03.418 --> 00:54:05.623
This is possible.

00:54:05.623 --> 00:54:09.206
This is a view from
one of the summer camps

00:54:10.171 --> 00:54:13.353
that I have been running
with Henry Louis Gates, Jr

00:54:13.353 --> 00:54:17.508
in the last few years in
a project that we call

00:54:17.508 --> 00:54:19.881
the Finding Your Roots Project

00:54:19.881 --> 00:54:22.168
and the Finding Your Roots summer camps.

00:54:22.168 --> 00:54:24.943
We have brought together over 30 scholars

00:54:24.943 --> 00:54:28.891
from Penn State and other institutions

00:54:28.891 --> 00:54:33.104
into human geneticists,
education specialists,

00:54:33.104 --> 00:54:36.608
bioethicists, historians,
many different folks,

00:54:36.608 --> 00:54:39.941
to put together a curriculum, initially,

00:54:40.985 --> 00:54:43.987
in formal science education,

00:54:43.987 --> 00:54:46.154
middle school summer camps

00:54:47.289 --> 00:54:50.622
where kids come and discover themselves.

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:55.342
We talk in this country not
only about problems of race,

00:54:55.342 --> 00:54:58.509
but problems of inequity in education,

00:54:59.677 --> 00:55:02.427
of problems of young individuals,

00:55:03.541 --> 00:55:06.471
Latino, Native American, African American,

00:55:06.471 --> 00:55:10.081
not going into science,
mathematics, engineering.

00:55:10.081 --> 00:55:13.742
How can we improve these outcomes?

00:55:13.742 --> 00:55:16.058
People have been beating
their head against many

00:55:16.058 --> 00:55:18.020
good doors for years.

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:21.537
And we decided to try something
a little bit different.

00:55:21.537 --> 00:55:24.934
And through this Finding
Your Roots curriculum,

00:55:24.934 --> 00:55:28.948
as it now is funded by
the Robert Wood Johnson

00:55:28.948 --> 00:55:30.773
and Rockefeller Foundations,

00:55:30.773 --> 00:55:34.273
and also recently by private philanthropy,

00:55:35.134 --> 00:55:37.925
we have the beginnings, I think,

00:55:37.925 --> 00:55:39.592
of a mode of inquiry

00:55:40.892 --> 00:55:43.250
that we can introduce,
not into universities,

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:45.591
not into high schools,
but into middle schools.

00:55:45.591 --> 00:55:47.838
And just into informal contexts,

00:55:47.838 --> 00:55:49.838
but into our classrooms.

00:55:51.359 --> 00:55:52.923
This is exciting.

00:55:52.923 --> 00:55:55.633
We can teach kids about themselves.

00:55:55.633 --> 00:55:57.704
We can have them discover their own,

00:55:57.704 --> 00:56:00.209
the wonder of their own DNA,

00:56:00.209 --> 00:56:03.615
their unity to others by
looking at similarities

00:56:03.615 --> 00:56:05.032
in their genomes.

00:56:06.105 --> 00:56:09.514
Being with these kids is incredible.

00:56:09.514 --> 00:56:12.140
Having them discover
things about themselves,

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:15.640
having them discover things
about lumbriculus worms

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.093
under the microscope,

00:56:17.093 --> 00:56:20.770
about their ancestors
in the paleontology lab,

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:22.187
is very exciting.

00:56:23.256 --> 00:56:28.007
And we leave them to conduct
their own experiments.

00:56:28.007 --> 00:56:31.213
By the end of the summer
camp, they are scientists,

00:56:31.213 --> 00:56:34.132
testing hypotheses themselves.

00:56:34.132 --> 00:56:38.036
Having the confidence to investigate.

00:56:38.036 --> 00:56:42.205
They are scrutinizing data,
talking about variability,

00:56:42.205 --> 00:56:44.124
and yes in the United States,

00:56:44.124 --> 00:56:46.435
we have kids talking about race,

00:56:46.435 --> 00:56:49.276
and talking about why
people look differently,

00:56:49.276 --> 00:56:51.791
and how race is a social construction

00:56:51.791 --> 00:56:53.231
and what that means.

00:56:53.231 --> 00:56:56.065
And when kids are 10, 11, 12 years old,

00:56:56.065 --> 00:57:00.232
they aren't freighted with all
of the hangups of adulthood,

00:57:02.325 --> 00:57:04.686
and it is marvelous to behold.

00:57:04.686 --> 00:57:06.603
There is a lot of hope.

00:57:07.523 --> 00:57:11.690
We may not be able to vaccinate
people against ignorance,

00:57:12.603 --> 00:57:15.436
but we can use childhood education

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:22.853
as a form of vaccination
against antiquated views

00:57:22.853 --> 00:57:26.120
on human diversity, human evolution,

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.537
race, and health.

00:57:29.484 --> 00:57:31.317
There is lots of hope.

00:57:33.125 --> 00:57:35.867
I want to thank very much the organizers

00:57:35.867 --> 00:57:39.281
of this lecture series, for
this generous invitation,

00:57:39.281 --> 00:57:44.123
thank my husband and primarily
collaborator George Chaplin,

00:57:44.123 --> 00:57:45.843
who's in the audience today.

00:57:45.843 --> 00:57:49.421
My superb research assistant Tess Wilson

00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:51.950
for lots and lots of help.

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:55.291
Ellen Gobler who was
the logistic coordinator

00:57:55.291 --> 00:57:57.554
for this series, tremendously.

00:57:57.554 --> 00:58:01.427
Leslea Hlusko, tremendously
for the role that she played.

00:58:01.427 --> 00:58:04.906
And another person who isn't
on the credits list here,

00:58:04.906 --> 00:58:07.532
but Blake Edgar who is in the audience

00:58:07.532 --> 00:58:11.097
who is my editor at the
University of California Press

00:58:11.097 --> 00:58:15.804
who shepherded my two books,
popular books to press,

00:58:15.804 --> 00:58:19.971
and who continues to be a
great guide and inspiration.

00:58:21.011 --> 00:58:24.773
Many other people, many
foundations provide support for me.

00:58:24.773 --> 00:58:28.085
I would be happy to send
you, if you write to me,

00:58:28.085 --> 00:58:31.219
any number of publications, maps,

00:58:31.219 --> 00:58:33.252
and other things that might interest you.

00:58:33.252 --> 00:58:35.093
You might find some of them on my website.

00:58:35.093 --> 00:58:36.796
I am always available.

00:58:36.796 --> 00:58:38.595
Thank you very much for your attention.

00:58:38.595 --> 00:58:41.762
(audience applauding)

00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:47.243
- [Man] Dr. Jablonski,
that was really dynamic,

00:58:47.243 --> 00:58:49.468
thank you so much.

00:58:49.468 --> 00:58:52.355
As I mentioned yesterday,
my wife and I want to move

00:58:52.355 --> 00:58:55.833
to University Park and sneak
into some of your lectures

00:58:55.833 --> 00:58:58.146
so that we can hear more of you.

00:58:58.146 --> 00:59:00.146
But my question is this.

00:59:01.062 --> 00:59:04.897
As humanity continues to
move into urban areas,

00:59:04.897 --> 00:59:08.253
as we continue to cover
ourselves with clothing,

00:59:08.253 --> 00:59:11.003
not just our bodies but our head,

00:59:11.914 --> 00:59:14.414
is the evolution, well from a,

00:59:15.988 --> 00:59:20.155
natural selection perspective,
is our evolutionary

00:59:21.619 --> 00:59:24.286
result going to be lighter skin?

00:59:26.959 --> 00:59:28.802
- It's a very good question.

00:59:28.802 --> 00:59:33.491
And the answer is pretty
simple in that there is,

00:59:33.491 --> 00:59:37.567
we see no evidence of natural selection

00:59:37.567 --> 00:59:40.577
promoting depigmentation now,

00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:44.327
largely because there
is very little evidence

00:59:45.434 --> 00:59:47.101
of people losing out

00:59:48.575 --> 00:59:51.188
in the reproductive sweepstakes

00:59:51.188 --> 00:59:53.771
as a result of living in cities

00:59:54.889 --> 00:59:56.639
without sun exposure.

00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:00.271
So there might be some,

01:00:00.271 --> 01:00:03.913
if our epidemiological
studies were good enough,

01:00:03.913 --> 01:00:07.105
we may be able to detect some signal

01:00:07.105 --> 01:00:09.363
of sort of loss of fitness as a result

01:00:09.363 --> 01:00:14.036
of urban lifestyles, but not
enough to promote changes

01:00:14.036 --> 01:00:19.026
in gene frequency, leading
to changes in pigmentation.

01:00:19.026 --> 01:00:22.110
But what we do see in urban environments

01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:25.144
and this is one of the
beautiful parts of the Bay area,

01:00:25.144 --> 01:00:26.932
literally, physically beautiful,

01:00:26.932 --> 01:00:30.849
is that we see such lavish
admixture of people.

01:00:32.316 --> 01:00:35.209
People from all different
parts of the world

01:00:35.209 --> 01:00:39.292
come together, share
interesting cultural things,

01:00:40.391 --> 01:00:44.394
have children together, and
produce new genetic combinations

01:00:44.394 --> 01:00:45.977
and new phenotypes.

01:00:47.118 --> 01:00:50.737
And often these phenotypes are lighter

01:00:50.737 --> 01:00:52.821
than at least one of the parents.

01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:56.571
So we aren't seeing
natural selection produce

01:00:57.490 --> 01:00:59.112
loss of pigmentation.

01:00:59.112 --> 01:01:02.177
But we are seeing sort of a mingling

01:01:02.177 --> 01:01:06.333
and an increasing number of
pigmentation intermediates

01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:10.500
being produced in many
urban centers in the world.

01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:16.624
- [Man] I was fascinated
by your graph yesterday

01:01:16.624 --> 01:01:19.791
of decreasing hair in our hominid line

01:01:22.629 --> 01:01:26.379
in more recently thousand,
millions of years.

01:01:27.932 --> 01:01:31.583
And that raises two questions that I wish

01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:33.471
I had asked yesterday.

01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:36.804
One is that, as I follow your discussion

01:01:37.654 --> 01:01:40.916
of hairlessness and thermal regulation,

01:01:40.916 --> 01:01:44.141
I wonder if actually losing hair

01:01:44.141 --> 01:01:45.641
gave our ancestors

01:01:47.897 --> 01:01:51.922
a flexibility to exploit
a much wider range

01:01:51.922 --> 01:01:54.839
of environments than other primates

01:01:56.639 --> 01:01:58.045
who had more hair.

01:01:58.045 --> 01:02:00.562
In other words, a loss of
hair actually gave humans

01:02:00.562 --> 01:02:03.388
a lot of flexibility to go into a lot

01:02:03.388 --> 01:02:05.486
of very, very different environments.

01:02:05.486 --> 01:02:08.139
And my second question
about hair is one thing

01:02:08.139 --> 01:02:09.873
that we've noticed in nutrition

01:02:09.873 --> 01:02:12.846
that if you're feeding
an animal like a mouse

01:02:12.846 --> 01:02:14.859
or a rat that's full of hair,

01:02:14.859 --> 01:02:17.321
you have different requirements

01:02:17.321 --> 01:02:20.063
for sulfur-containing amino acids.

01:02:20.063 --> 01:02:22.065
And I was wondering if there was actually

01:02:22.065 --> 01:02:25.996
a nutritional component
in the loss of hair

01:02:25.996 --> 01:02:27.663
in our own ancestry.

01:02:29.511 --> 01:02:30.928
- Good questions.

01:02:32.322 --> 01:02:37.174
In answer to the first, I
think much of human versatility

01:02:37.174 --> 01:02:41.220
and our ability to disperse
and adapt to a wide range

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:45.815
of environments is due to
our incredible technology

01:02:45.815 --> 01:02:50.137
and behavioral flexibility and
our incredible inventiveness,

01:02:50.137 --> 01:02:54.225
which we have had since the
beginning of Homo sapiens

01:02:54.225 --> 01:02:56.641
and probably even further.

01:02:56.641 --> 01:02:59.596
When we look at the
cultural sophistication

01:02:59.596 --> 01:03:02.704
of Neanderthals and
ancestors of Neanderthals

01:03:02.704 --> 01:03:04.863
that were living over 200,000 years ago,

01:03:04.863 --> 01:03:08.711
and modern humans in Africa
and outside of Africa

01:03:08.711 --> 01:03:10.560
tens of thousands of years ago,

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.727
basically what you have
is a rich material culture

01:03:15.621 --> 01:03:19.704
and a rich culture of the
mind that allows people

01:03:20.635 --> 01:03:23.382
to live in places and under conditions

01:03:23.382 --> 01:03:27.950
and following lifestyles that
other mammals cannot achieve.

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:31.867
So I think skin has played
a role in that it is

01:03:37.212 --> 01:03:41.330
given us a different
mode of communication,

01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:46.207
cutaneous communication,
communication through arraignment

01:03:46.207 --> 01:03:48.379
as well as our body decoration,

01:03:48.379 --> 01:03:50.686
has given us greater versatility.

01:03:50.686 --> 01:03:52.836
We don't just have one outfit,

01:03:52.836 --> 01:03:55.816
like you know, a dog or
a cat or a cow might have

01:03:55.816 --> 01:03:57.566
just sort of one fur,

01:04:00.025 --> 01:04:01.168
we have many.

01:04:01.168 --> 01:04:04.751
So we're able to express
our individuality,

01:04:05.931 --> 01:04:10.098
our group identity, through
how we adorn our naked bodies.

01:04:11.088 --> 01:04:12.961
And I think that has
been part of the cultural

01:04:12.961 --> 01:04:16.036
adaptation to different environments.

01:04:16.036 --> 01:04:18.786
In connection with diet and hair,

01:04:20.792 --> 01:04:24.883
the biggest things that
we notice in humans,

01:04:24.883 --> 01:04:28.472
of course our gross protein deprivation

01:04:28.472 --> 01:04:32.472
and the effects on hair
leading to hair breakage

01:04:33.645 --> 01:04:37.554
and the conspicuous sort of red pigment

01:04:37.554 --> 01:04:41.721
that you see in infants and
children with kwashiorkor.

01:04:43.658 --> 01:04:45.825
Other nutritional benefits

01:04:47.964 --> 01:04:50.297
are not that well understood

01:04:51.205 --> 01:04:54.806
and there are all manners of diets

01:04:54.806 --> 01:04:57.795
that people now subscribe
to for better hair,

01:04:57.795 --> 01:05:01.462
making your hair more
luxurious, less kinky,

01:05:03.457 --> 01:05:07.763
more wavy, what have you,
by eating certain foods.

01:05:07.763 --> 01:05:11.730
The extent to which diet,
beyond providing basic

01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:14.970
amino acids, the extent
to which modifying diet

01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:18.889
is going to affect hair texture and curl

01:05:18.889 --> 01:05:21.215
is really unclear.

01:05:21.215 --> 01:05:24.631
So there's a lot of sort of
bad science and pseudoscience

01:05:24.631 --> 01:05:27.214
about this, but I hope largely,

01:05:28.989 --> 01:05:33.173
or partly through the work of
graduate students in my lab,

01:05:33.173 --> 01:05:37.310
that we may be able to
understand some of these factors

01:05:37.310 --> 01:05:40.477
a bit more in two to four years' time.

01:05:42.163 --> 01:05:45.772
- [Woman] Hi, I actually
have a burning question.

01:05:45.772 --> 01:05:47.146
- Please.
- If you could talk a little

01:05:47.146 --> 01:05:49.930
bit more about the
difference between vitamin D3

01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:51.958
and vitamin D2.

01:05:51.958 --> 01:05:55.188
Because I'm really
curious about two things.

01:05:55.188 --> 01:05:58.188
One is as we move to fortified milk,

01:05:59.921 --> 01:06:01.632
and I actually don't now
much about the history

01:06:01.632 --> 01:06:03.153
of when we did that and
what was the impetus

01:06:03.153 --> 01:06:05.580
for doing it, how much of a health benefit

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.277
has that conferred?

01:06:07.277 --> 01:06:11.244
And then also, is that
actually adequate to help

01:06:11.244 --> 01:06:15.747
circumvent some of the
deleterious health effects.

01:06:15.747 --> 01:06:17.548
- Really good questions.

01:06:17.548 --> 01:06:20.865
Vitamin D2 is a form of vitamin D

01:06:20.865 --> 01:06:24.608
that is produced primarily in plants.

01:06:24.608 --> 01:06:28.164
When we ingest it, we can use it,

01:06:28.164 --> 01:06:31.995
but it has to undergo and
additional hydroxylation step

01:06:31.995 --> 01:06:32.917
in the liver.

01:06:32.917 --> 01:06:37.084
So vitamin D3 is the more
common animal origin vitamin D,

01:06:38.679 --> 01:06:42.766
although there is some
vitamin D3 in some plants,

01:06:42.766 --> 01:06:44.721
but vitamin D2 is the more common.

01:06:44.721 --> 01:06:47.721
Both of them are potentially usable,

01:06:48.723 --> 01:06:51.284
but both of them when we ingest them

01:06:51.284 --> 01:06:55.225
as food or as supplements, have to undergo

01:06:55.225 --> 01:06:59.518
the rigorous conversion in
the liver, in the kidney,

01:06:59.518 --> 01:07:04.179
and that final step of chemical
conversion in the kidney

01:07:04.179 --> 01:07:06.757
to the active form of vitamin D,

01:07:06.757 --> 01:07:11.547
that can occur from a
vitamin D2 or D3 precursor,

01:07:11.547 --> 01:07:15.714
and that is the most
rate-controlled step in the body,

01:07:16.709 --> 01:07:21.315
so that you can produce
a lot of vitamin serum D3

01:07:21.315 --> 01:07:23.185
in its storage form,

01:07:23.185 --> 01:07:27.061
but then the activation
to active D3 that occurs

01:07:27.061 --> 01:07:29.952
in the kidney is extremely
highly controlled.

01:07:29.952 --> 01:07:33.952
But these days, most
supplements are vitamin D3.

01:07:35.534 --> 01:07:37.156
There are fewer of D2.

01:07:37.156 --> 01:07:41.930
In answer to your question
about fortification in milk,

01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:45.800
milk fortification was
introduced in this country,

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.300
widespread, after World War II

01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:53.918
when the importance of vitamin
D in preventing rickets

01:07:55.762 --> 01:07:58.908
in infants and children
was widely recognized.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:02.203
And it was a public health remediation

01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:05.036
that was initiated similar to that

01:08:06.741 --> 01:08:10.158
of fluoridated water for the public good.

01:08:12.823 --> 01:08:16.051
In this country, most milk that you buy

01:08:16.051 --> 01:08:17.914
is vitamin D fortified.

01:08:17.914 --> 01:08:21.927
But the amount of vitamin D
varies from one brand of milk

01:08:21.927 --> 01:08:24.909
and even from one batch
of milk to the other.

01:08:24.909 --> 01:08:27.548
The level of vitamin D fortification

01:08:27.548 --> 01:08:29.215
is enough to prevent

01:08:31.362 --> 01:08:34.362
the most severe level of deficiency,

01:08:35.482 --> 01:08:36.982
but not to provide

01:08:39.353 --> 01:08:43.270
physiological adequacy
for a child or an adult,

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.685
unless you drank
prodigious amounts of milk

01:08:48.685 --> 01:08:51.043
that would be dangerous
from the point of view

01:08:51.043 --> 01:08:52.538
of drinking too much calcium

01:08:52.538 --> 01:08:55.344
and putting you at a
risk for kidney stones.

01:08:55.344 --> 01:08:59.511
So the vitamin D3 fortification
in milk is very helpful

01:09:01.483 --> 01:09:04.652
and could be used as a
model for other countries.

01:09:04.652 --> 01:09:07.384
There are lots of places where milk is not

01:09:07.384 --> 01:09:09.903
vitamin D fortified and
where this would help

01:09:09.903 --> 01:09:14.787
to sort of lower the prevalence
of vitamin D deficiency

01:09:14.787 --> 01:09:18.004
in some very vulnerable populations.

01:09:18.004 --> 01:09:21.979
But that level of
fortification is not adequate

01:09:21.979 --> 01:09:24.438
to meet physiological needs.

01:09:24.438 --> 01:09:28.231
So one has to have other
vitamin D-rich foods,

01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:30.600
of which there aren't very many.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.913
Oily fish is the best source,

01:09:32.913 --> 01:09:36.011
but there are few
genuinely oily fish around,

01:09:36.011 --> 01:09:39.761
and so today, most people
really have to rely

01:09:41.145 --> 01:09:42.885
on vitamin D supplements

01:09:42.885 --> 01:09:45.885
and occasional prudent sun exposure.

01:09:50.727 --> 01:09:52.350
- [Man] You timed your visit well.

01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:55.186
You joined us in a sunny
interlude in an otherwise

01:09:55.186 --> 01:09:56.603
very dark winter.

01:09:57.652 --> 01:10:00.119
And that prompts my question.

01:10:00.119 --> 01:10:03.060
I notice a lightening of the
mood when the sun is out.

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:07.227
And I wonder whether that
mood sensitivity to sunlight

01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:11.073
could be related to a person's,

01:10:13.331 --> 01:10:17.748
the location of the
evolution of their genotype.

01:10:17.748 --> 01:10:21.859
- This is a great question,
and many people have been

01:10:21.859 --> 01:10:24.101
interested in this in trying to understand

01:10:24.101 --> 01:10:27.118
the biological basis and the genetic basis

01:10:27.118 --> 01:10:29.478
for seasonal affective disorder,

01:10:29.478 --> 01:10:33.118
and the role that vitamin D might play.

01:10:33.118 --> 01:10:37.219
This is a fascinating
and complicated answer.

01:10:37.219 --> 01:10:40.453
I'm gonna give you the short version.

01:10:40.453 --> 01:10:43.703
What we have in our retinas of our eyes

01:10:45.813 --> 01:10:49.092
are not only the three kinds of cones

01:10:49.092 --> 01:10:52.811
that allow us to see beautiful
trichromatic color vision,

01:10:52.811 --> 01:10:56.096
but we also have a
specialized subset of cones

01:10:56.096 --> 01:10:58.774
that are blue light receptors.

01:10:58.774 --> 01:11:01.922
So on a bright day like this,

01:11:01.922 --> 01:11:06.089
there is a lot of very short
wavelength visible light

01:11:07.894 --> 01:11:10.353
that stimulates the blue light receptors

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:12.973
that makes us more
alert, that communicates

01:11:12.973 --> 01:11:15.049
with our pineal gland that communicates

01:11:15.049 --> 01:11:17.049
with our pituitary gland

01:11:18.555 --> 01:11:22.722
that communicates, sort of
the global endocrine switches

01:11:24.209 --> 01:11:25.376
are turned on.

01:11:26.885 --> 01:11:30.552
And many of these lead
to elevation of mood.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.167
Beautiful work has been done comparing

01:11:38.499 --> 01:11:42.085
the prevalence of seasonal
affective disorder

01:11:42.085 --> 01:11:46.069
in places like Iceland versus Ecuador.

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:50.810
And what is found is that
there are real differences

01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:53.060
in the amount of blue light

01:11:55.004 --> 01:11:57.087
that stimulates the body,

01:11:58.258 --> 01:12:01.400
and that this seems to be
one of the most important

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.455
arbiters of mood.

01:12:03.455 --> 01:12:05.705
Vitamin D also contributes,

01:12:07.054 --> 01:12:09.833
but interestingly it is not probably

01:12:09.833 --> 01:12:13.593
the primary contributor to
seasonal affective disorder,

01:12:13.593 --> 01:12:16.050
or the sort of the high that you feel.

01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:20.217
Rather it's the stimulation
of your blue light receptors.

01:12:24.096 --> 01:12:27.128
- [Man] I think milk was
the wrong thing to fortify,

01:12:27.128 --> 01:12:30.906
because 50 million people in
the US are lactose intolerant,

01:12:30.906 --> 01:12:34.190
and most African-Americans
are lactose intolerant.

01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:38.992
So, we should figure out
what to put vitamin D in.

01:12:38.992 --> 01:12:41.275
Now, I've been converting lots of people

01:12:41.275 --> 01:12:43.432
to take vitamin D.

01:12:43.432 --> 01:12:44.677
And if they're deficient,

01:12:44.677 --> 01:12:47.728
they really feel terrific afterwards.

01:12:47.728 --> 01:12:50.395
So there is, whether it's Danes,

01:12:51.483 --> 01:12:55.126
I was in Denmark for a scientific meeting

01:12:55.126 --> 01:12:58.046
and Denmark has, Copenhagen
has about the worst climate

01:12:58.046 --> 01:13:02.246
in the world, at least
compared to Californians.

01:13:02.246 --> 01:13:05.770
And it was a sunny day and
the whole city stopped.

01:13:05.770 --> 01:13:09.364
Everybody had taken off
most of their clothes.

01:13:09.364 --> 01:13:10.959
I must say more clothes were taken off

01:13:10.959 --> 01:13:12.553
than an American would.

01:13:12.553 --> 01:13:14.381
And there were all of
these half-naked bodies

01:13:14.381 --> 01:13:16.749
all over the city all day.

01:13:16.749 --> 01:13:19.047
Everybody was just,
nobody was in the shops,

01:13:19.047 --> 01:13:21.649
nobody was doing anything but sunbathing.

01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:23.431
I asked a Danish scientist friend,

01:13:23.431 --> 01:13:25.092
"How come you do this?"

01:13:25.092 --> 01:13:28.404
He said, "Well, we
Scandinavians get so little sun,

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:31.950
"that whenever there's sun, we sunbathe,

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:34.403
"because we feel terrific afterwards."

01:13:34.403 --> 01:13:37.956
And I've had personal experience
with African-Americans

01:13:37.956 --> 01:13:40.499
who I've gotten to take vitamin D,

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:42.138
and they feel terrific.

01:13:42.138 --> 01:13:45.771
So I think that's something that'll help--

01:13:45.771 --> 01:13:49.938
- Yes, and you know, in connection
with both of your points,

01:13:51.017 --> 01:13:53.814
first of all, getting a vehicle

01:13:53.814 --> 01:13:56.109
other than milk is important.

01:13:56.109 --> 01:13:59.217
In South Africa there is fortification

01:13:59.217 --> 01:14:00.717
of some margarine.

01:14:01.641 --> 01:14:04.072
Unfortunately, you would
have to eat a huge amount

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:06.275
of margarine in order to benefit

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.653
from the vitamin D fortification.

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:11.720
One of the problems is that
vitamin D is oil-soluble,

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:15.887
so you can't easily sort of
put it into fortified cereals

01:14:17.624 --> 01:14:20.967
or orange juice, although
people do put it into

01:14:20.967 --> 01:14:23.384
the orange juice suspensions.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.733
But it's a difficult molecule to deliver

01:14:27.733 --> 01:14:30.733
in a fortification of a normal food.

01:14:32.061 --> 01:14:35.312
But your point about Denmark
is a very interesting one,

01:14:35.312 --> 01:14:40.027
because there they have
refused to fortify their milk.

01:14:40.027 --> 01:14:43.475
So there is no baseline
fortification of milk

01:14:43.475 --> 01:14:46.485
or any dairy products,
and people can only get

01:14:46.485 --> 01:14:49.005
their vitamin D either from fish

01:14:49.005 --> 01:14:51.758
or by taking off their clothes.

01:14:51.758 --> 01:14:55.203
And they really, you
know you have sort of,

01:14:55.203 --> 01:14:57.897
I don't want to impune the Danes at all,

01:14:57.897 --> 01:15:02.064
but people sort of going to
their paleolithic sort of

01:15:03.403 --> 01:15:06.153
past to expose themselves to sun.

01:15:07.225 --> 01:15:10.225
And I think what's interesting there

01:15:11.274 --> 01:15:15.568
is that when people are exposed to the sun

01:15:15.568 --> 01:15:18.739
that their ancestors were used to,

01:15:18.739 --> 01:15:22.885
you know if they gradually
sort of gain and lose

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:26.335
sun exposure or UV
exposure, their skin changes

01:15:26.335 --> 01:15:30.502
and they're able to maintain
UV or vitamin D adequacy.

01:15:31.451 --> 01:15:33.729
And in a country like Denmark,

01:15:33.729 --> 01:15:37.612
when people were outside most of the time,

01:15:37.612 --> 01:15:40.788
even though they had
vitamin D in their diet,

01:15:40.788 --> 01:15:44.272
they got a lot of their
physiologically important

01:15:44.272 --> 01:15:47.961
vitamin D throughout
the year from episodic,

01:15:47.961 --> 01:15:50.794
but regular episodic sun exposure.

01:15:52.119 --> 01:15:53.678
- [Man] They were also
eating a lot of fish.

01:15:53.678 --> 01:15:56.796
- Yes, yes, much of which
doesn't exist anymore,

01:15:56.796 --> 01:15:59.612
or is too expensive
for most people to buy.

01:15:59.612 --> 01:16:02.761
- [Man] Now, vitamin D
isn't that expensive.

01:16:02.761 --> 01:16:05.011
- Ah, it's here now, today,

01:16:07.132 --> 01:16:09.202
in the United States, vitamin D is cheap.

01:16:09.202 --> 01:16:11.537
You can go into any
supermarket, any health store,

01:16:11.537 --> 01:16:15.204
get these huge bottles
for 10 bucks or less.

01:16:16.883 --> 01:16:19.966
But go to Europe, go to South Africa,

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:22.414
and try to buy vitamin D.

01:16:22.414 --> 01:16:24.777
It's not bulk processed there,

01:16:24.777 --> 01:16:27.432
and a little bottle of 60 capsules

01:16:27.432 --> 01:16:29.589
will cost you $20.

01:16:29.589 --> 01:16:32.589
Or it'll cost you more
than that in South Africa

01:16:32.589 --> 01:16:35.218
because it's imported from
the United States or Europe

01:16:35.218 --> 01:16:38.367
and it's more than a week's wages.

01:16:38.367 --> 01:16:41.096
- [Man] But at least in fortification

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:44.460
and telling people here,
you can buy vitamin D,

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:46.024
it's not that expensive.

01:16:46.024 --> 01:16:49.191
- And I think, this is something where

01:16:50.268 --> 01:16:54.876
the medical establishment
is moving significantly

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:57.434
and importantly to
recognize the importance

01:16:57.434 --> 01:17:00.212
of vitamin D supplementation.

01:17:00.212 --> 01:17:02.109
It's not the be all and the end all.

01:17:02.109 --> 01:17:05.047
It's not a panacea by any means.

01:17:05.047 --> 01:17:09.051
But raising people off
of baseline deficiency

01:17:09.051 --> 01:17:11.434
will greatly improve health outcomes,

01:17:11.434 --> 01:17:13.596
not only in the ways that I've described,

01:17:13.596 --> 01:17:14.789
but in many others.

01:17:14.789 --> 01:17:17.046
- [Man] You know, I've been
digging into that for years now

01:17:17.046 --> 01:17:21.027
and there's a huge, I
think dark-skinned people

01:17:21.027 --> 01:17:23.840
are carrying a big weight on their back.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.199
And vitamin D is going to help.

01:17:26.199 --> 01:17:27.032
- Yes.

01:17:28.547 --> 01:17:30.041
- Well thank you, if you
have no more questions,

01:17:30.041 --> 01:17:32.039
if we could do a big round of applause

01:17:32.039 --> 01:17:33.275
and a thank you for Nina.

01:17:33.275 --> 01:17:36.442
(audience applauding)

01:17:36.442 --> 01:17:39.025
(upbeat music)
