00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.356
One afternoon, as she was walking around in downtown Udacity, Athena happened

00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:08.778
upon a soda machine. And it looked so enticing that she decided to grab a drink.

00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:13.489
All the drinks from the soda machine cost $1.00. She put a dollar in the machine

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:18.116
slot, pressed a button for which drink she wanted. And voila, out came a soda.

00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:22.463
She tasted her drink and since it was so delicious, she decided to buy one for

00:00:22.463 --> 00:00:26.799
her brother too, since she was about to stop by his house. So, she put another

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:30.965
dollar in the machine and she got a second can of soda for him. Now, since the

00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:35.689
price per soda has the set value, a constant, of $1. What are two variable that

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:39.905
we could very easily related to one another with an equation that uses this

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:44.538
constant? Please pick two of these five choices down here. Would you want to use

00:00:44.538 --> 00:00:49.126
level of thirstiness, amount of money Athena puts in the machine, how hard

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:53.936
Athena presses the button, how many brothers Athena has, or how many sodas the

00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:58.170
machine spits out? Which two of these belong together along with this constant

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.674
of $1.00?
