They call their first technique data layout transformation.

00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:06.910
So, by now, you're very familiar with the concept of global memory coalescing,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.686
where we achieve the best bandwidth to memory when adjacent threads access adjacent locations in memory.

00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:15.718
As a quick review, global memory coalescing is important

00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:20.398
because modern DRAM systems transfer large chunks of data per transaction,

00:00:20.398 --> 00:00:25.601
because modern DRAM systems transfer data in many small chunks, one per thread request,

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:29.895
or because modern GPUs have no on-chip caches in which to prefetch data,

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:34.673
meaning to hold data likely to be used by a thread but not yet actually requested by it?
