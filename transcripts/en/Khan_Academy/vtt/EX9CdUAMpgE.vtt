00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:05.305
- Let's compare the number
0.7 to the number 0.09.

00:00:05.914 --> 00:00:07.841
And there's a bunch of ways to do this,

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.396
but the way that I'm going to tackle it is

00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:12.160
I'm gonna start looking
at each of the digits,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.948
starting with the leftmost digit.

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:15.829
And so we can start right over here

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.606
in the ones place.

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:18.685
You always want to compare ones place

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.241
to ones place, so for example

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:21.913
if we compare these two numbers,

00:00:21.913 --> 00:00:23.561
they both have zero ones.

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:25.744
So the ones place doesn't tell us much.

00:00:25.744 --> 00:00:28.785
So now let's go one
place value to the right.

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:30.643
Let's go to the tenths place.

00:00:30.643 --> 00:00:32.895
This number has seven tenths,

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:35.287
while this number has zero tenths.

00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:39.188
That by itself tells us that
this is the larger number.

00:00:39.188 --> 00:00:41.579
We would put an inequality
symbol right over here.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.272
We wanna open it up to the larger number,

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:46.455
where it points to the smaller number.

00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:51.419
So this says 0.7 is greater than 0.09.

00:00:51.772 --> 00:00:53.189
Now you might be tempted
to say oh wait, wait.

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:55.952
Look, but if we went one
more digit to the right

00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:58.459
you have nine hundredths here,

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:00.294
and you have no hundredths over here.

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:01.965
We could write a zero over here,

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:03.196
and you'd say well look,

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.512
you have no hundredths over here.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.399
But the nine hundredths don't matter.

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.442
Remember, even if you had 10 hundredths,

00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:12.158
that's the same thing as one tenth.

00:01:12.158 --> 00:01:14.759
So it doesn't matter that nine is somehow

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:15.966
greater than seven.

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.335
What matters is it's in
a place to the right.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:21.191
Even if you increased by
another hundredth here

00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:23.188
you'd only get to one tenth.

00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:26.069
This thing over here has seven tenths.

00:01:26.214 --> 00:01:27.654
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:29.454 --> 00:01:31.276
Let's say we wanted to compare,

00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:33.133
let's say we wanted to compare

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:38.546
0.29,

00:01:40.462 --> 00:01:42.011
let's say I wanna compare that

00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:46.556
to 0.31.

00:01:47.746 --> 00:01:49.441
Now this one you might say is a little bit

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.927
more straightforward, depending on how

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:51.809
you think about it.

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:53.899
If you say hey, this is 29 hundredths,

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.733
this is 31 hundredths,

00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:58.310
we have more hundredths
on the right-hand side.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.026
So let me open my inequality
to the larger value

00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:04.881
and I would say 0.29, or 29 hundredths

00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:07.250
is less than 31 hundredths.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.922
Another way you could have done this

00:02:08.922 --> 00:02:12.010
is you could have looked
in the ones place,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.448
say okay, they both have zero ones,

00:02:14.448 --> 00:02:16.491
but then you look in the tenths place,

00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:18.256
say this only has two tenths,

00:02:18.256 --> 00:02:19.927
while this has three tenths.

00:02:19.927 --> 00:02:21.483
I shouldn't have to keep looking

00:02:21.483 --> 00:02:23.085
at the digits to the right of that.

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:24.455
I can just compare this two tenths

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:25.662
to the three tenths.

00:02:25.662 --> 00:02:28.472
Three tenths is larger, and so I would say

00:02:28.472 --> 00:02:33.472
that 29 hundredths is
less than 31 hundredths.

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.459
Let's do one more, just for fun.

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.796
Let's compare, let's compare

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:47.529
0.6 to, I'll do them in the same color.

00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:50.275
0.06.

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:53.798
Which of these is the larger number?

00:02:54.175 --> 00:02:56.126
Well we do the same thing
that we've been doing.

00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:58.587
You can first go to the ones place.

00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:01.350
Say okay, this has no
ones, this has no ones.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.883
Okay that doesn't tell us much.

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:04.020
Then the tenths place.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.899
This has six tenths, this has zero tenths.

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:09.500
So this number is going to be larger.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.568
It has more tenths.

00:03:10.568 --> 00:03:12.193
It doesn't matter who has more hundredths.

00:03:12.193 --> 00:03:13.772
Hundredths are much smaller than tenths.

00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:15.839
They're a tenth of the size of a tenth.

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.928
So this has six tenths,
this has zero tenths.

00:03:17.928 --> 00:03:20.134
So this number is larger.

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:24.267
0.6 is greater than 0.06.

00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:25.869
It's actually ten times greater

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:27.629
but we can talk about
that in other videos.
