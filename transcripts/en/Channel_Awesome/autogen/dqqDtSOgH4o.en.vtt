now I'm going to cut piece of dowel it's
going to be the inside of my handle and

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680
going to be the inside of my handle and
 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.590
going to be the inside of my handle and
then I made some lines down the center

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600
then I made some lines down the center
 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.450
then I made some lines down the center
of another piece of dowel and I'm going

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460
of another piece of dowel and I'm going
 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.779
of another piece of dowel and I'm going
to cut it down the middle and that's

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789
to cut it down the middle and that's
 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.270
to cut it down the middle and that's
going to be the top and bottom grip on

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280
going to be the top and bottom grip on
 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.350
going to be the top and bottom grip on
the top handle that we're going to cut

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360
the top handle that we're going to cut
 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.140
the top handle that we're going to cut
and Bend out of our flat bar and that's

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150
and Bend out of our flat bar and that's
 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:17.689
and Bend out of our flat bar and that's
going to go across the top of the castle

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699
 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:23.360
so I made some holes in the handles and

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370
so I made some holes in the handles and
 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.679
so I made some holes in the handles and
then my flat bar I just put in the vise

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:26.689
then my flat bar I just put in the vise
 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:37.409
then my flat bar I just put in the vise
and bent into the shape that I wanted

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419
 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.529
and that looks pretty good

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539
and that looks pretty good
 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.409
and that looks pretty good
kind of deciding how much I want to come

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419
kind of deciding how much I want to come
 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.910
kind of deciding how much I want to come
down I'm going to cut a piece off

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920
 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.120
I'm going to need some of that flat bar

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130
I'm going to need some of that flat bar
 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.200
I'm going to need some of that flat bar
to attach the inside handle that we have

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210
to attach the inside handle that we have
 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.280
to attach the inside handle that we have
something to grip inside of the chainsaw

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290
something to grip inside of the chainsaw
 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.470
something to grip inside of the chainsaw
so now I'm just cutting off my flat bar

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480
 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.710
looking pretty good I got my sheet metal

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720
looking pretty good I got my sheet metal
 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.150
looking pretty good I got my sheet metal
and was thin enough sheet melt where

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160
and was thin enough sheet melt where
 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.860
and was thin enough sheet melt where
actually I could cut it with a pair of

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870
actually I could cut it with a pair of
 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.910
actually I could cut it with a pair of
hobby shears which made it a little bit

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920
hobby shears which made it a little bit
 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.240
hobby shears which made it a little bit
easier to cut now I've got my little

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250
easier to cut now I've got my little
 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.480
easier to cut now I've got my little
brackets and I'm measuring where to make

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490
brackets and I'm measuring where to make
 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.180
brackets and I'm measuring where to make
my holes on the chainsaw and the

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190
my holes on the chainsaw and the
 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.120
my holes on the chainsaw and the
coupling the brackets themselves I had

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130
coupling the brackets themselves I had
 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.940
coupling the brackets themselves I had
to bend quite a bit to kind of fit the

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950
to bend quite a bit to kind of fit the
 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.280
to bend quite a bit to kind of fit the
contours of the chainsaw I also use some

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290
contours of the chainsaw I also use some
 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:42.050
contours of the chainsaw I also use some
aluminum strap

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060
 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.400
because it's a little easier to work

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410
because it's a little easier to work
 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:51.999
because it's a little easier to work
with easier to bend

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:52.009
 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.369
once I made my measurements my holes and

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:55.379
once I made my measurements my holes and
 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:57.980
once I made my measurements my holes and
drill them out with my drill on the

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990
drill them out with my drill on the
 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.210
drill them out with my drill on the
coupling

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220
 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.150
and then I attach my brackets just a

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160
and then I attach my brackets just a
 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.189
and then I attach my brackets just a
screw a nut and a lock washer in there

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199
screw a nut and a lock washer in there
 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.909
screw a nut and a lock washer in there
so sitting back out

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919
 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:17.000
screwie and snug

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.010
screwie and snug
 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.980
screwie and snug
and make sure that everything is lining

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990
and make sure that everything is lining
 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:24.870
and make sure that everything is lining
up still fold I attach everything

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880
 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.890
now I'm cutting another piece of dowel

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900
now I'm cutting another piece of dowel
 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.960
now I'm cutting another piece of dowel
it's going to be my pull chain sanding

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:28.970
it's going to be my pull chain sanding
 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.850
it's going to be my pull chain sanding
it down drill the hole through the

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860
it down drill the hole through the
 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.540
it down drill the hole through the
middle and using a piece of growth that

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.550
middle and using a piece of growth that
 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.210
middle and using a piece of growth that
head line around the shop feed it

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:37.220
head line around the shop feed it
 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.530
head line around the shop feed it
through the hole hole chain another

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:41.540
through the hole hole chain another
 

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.110
through the hole hole chain another
piece of dowel I screwed to that piece

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120
piece of dowel I screwed to that piece
 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.990
piece of dowel I screwed to that piece
of room and flat bar we had scrap and

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000
of room and flat bar we had scrap and
 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.700
of room and flat bar we had scrap and
that's going to attach the inside of my

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:48.710
that's going to attach the inside of my
 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.260
that's going to attach the inside of my
chainsaw so I have something to grab

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.270
chainsaw so I have something to grab
 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.840
chainsaw so I have something to grab
onto and you can attach the switch to

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:55.850
onto and you can attach the switch to
 

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.360

didn't need I removed

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:26.850
 

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.250
there was actually a switch already in

in from the inside so that the screws
 

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.189
in from the inside so that the screws
weren't digging into my wrists also

00:10:02.189 --> 00:10:02.199
