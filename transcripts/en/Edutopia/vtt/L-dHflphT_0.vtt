00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:09.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We wanted to
welcome you guys to our Books

00:00:09.996 --> 00:00:11.096
of Hope Exhibition for 2009.

00:00:11.096 --> 00:00:13.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: YES Prep North Central
is constantly looking for ways

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:16.086
to involve parents in
their child's education.

00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:22.326
Like this book fair, a combination
social service project, fundraiser,

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:24.426
and demonstration of student work.

00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:26.876
&gt;&gt;Allie: They've written books
to send to a school in Uganda

00:00:26.906 --> 00:00:31.406
and it looks like they've chosen
various topics to write about,

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.716
and looks like a really good project.

00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:35.236
They spent a good deal
of time researching,

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:37.356
a lot of the kids have their
rough drafts available,

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:40.056
so it's nice to see their
process that they went through.

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:41.476
&gt;&gt;Student: I did mine
on musical instruments.

00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:42.676
It's called, The String Family.

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:45.576
&gt;&gt;Allie: Knowing that my son is
here at YES Prep, it's excellent.

00:00:45.576 --> 00:00:49.006
There's rigor, and
everything is interrelated,

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:52.656
and it's a very small school,
it's very family oriented.

00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:54.536
&gt;&gt;Student: And this is
just like a mini-synopsis

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:55.456
on the history of guitars.

00:00:56.126 --> 00:00:57.476
&gt;&gt;Allie: I really feel
good and confident

00:00:57.476 --> 00:00:59.146
about the education
that he's getting here.

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:00.796
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So it was back there?

00:01:00.796 --> 00:01:01.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Parents get involved

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:05.066
with YES Prep even before their
kids enroll in the school.

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:08.766
During the summer, students and
staff members visit the homes

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:13.106
of prospective students to deliver a
contract that includes a commitment

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.296
on the part of the parents.

00:01:14.376 --> 00:01:15.516
&gt;&gt;Oh, come in, please, Sir.

00:01:15.986 --> 00:01:18.326
&gt;&gt;Bryan: I think the home
visit does a number of things.

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:21.636
At first, it's that direct personal
contact we can have with the parents,

00:01:22.106 --> 00:01:24.656
and I think it's a nice personal
touch that kind of sets the mood

00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:27.016
for the fact that we are
a family oriented school.

00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:29.486
We're not only willing to say
it, but we're willing to kind

00:01:29.486 --> 00:01:30.656
of put our money where our mouth is.

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.366
&gt;&gt;Under Student Commitments, can you
go one by one on those bullet points,

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:35.376
and read those out loud for me?

00:01:36.086 --> 00:01:39.846
&gt;&gt;The parents absolutely love it,
and to go to these home visits,

00:01:39.846 --> 00:01:42.176
it's a great reminder
of why we do what we do.

00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:46.476
I've done home visits before, where
parents have just wept, because,

00:01:46.476 --> 00:01:50.526
I mean, they truly feel like
they're lucky and they're blessed.

00:01:50.826 --> 00:01:53.156
&gt;&gt;Orianno, you know
the Parent Contract?

00:01:53.326 --> 00:01:56.286
&gt;&gt;Oh yes, Sir, I got my son, my
daughter already in the school.

00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:56.856
&gt;&gt;Bryan: You're a pro.

00:01:57.106 --> 00:01:57.496
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:01:58.026 --> 00:02:00.186
&gt;&gt;Chris: The contract, I
think is, it's symbolic,

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:01.996
but what we want parents
to understand is

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:03.406
that this has got to
be a team effort.

00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:05.146
You know, this is a
three legged stool.

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:08.676
It's us, it's your kid, and it's
you, and if we work together

00:02:08.676 --> 00:02:10.766
for the next seven years, your
kid is going to be able to go

00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:11.946
to any college they want to.

00:02:11.996 --> 00:02:13.936
&gt;&gt;Bryan: Sign under the
Student Signature, please?

00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:18.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The written commitment
of parents and students to the goal

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:20.826
of a college education,
comes in handy

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:22.896
when a student wanders off track.

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:25.266
&gt;&gt;Bryan: Because there's no
reason that you should be

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:26.386
in this position right now.

00:02:27.116 --> 00:02:28.206
&gt;&gt;Chris: We don't kick kids out,

00:02:28.206 --> 00:02:30.806
if the stuff on the
contract doesn't get done.

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:33.186
If stuff on the contract
doesn't get done,

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.726
it becomes a teaching opportunity
for the parent or the kid,

00:02:35.786 --> 00:02:37.166
to pull that thing
out, and say, look,

00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:39.186
this is what you said
you were going to do.

00:02:39.396 --> 00:02:41.596
And it's a great reminder, and
it's a great reference point,

00:02:41.596 --> 00:02:43.166
when we need to have
these conversations.

00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:48.536
&gt;&gt;Student: I don't know,
this year just hasn't--

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:49.266
I don't know where it went.

00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:50.876
&gt;&gt;Bryan: When you say that, you
make it sound like the wind.

00:02:50.876 --> 00:02:52.276
You are in control
of this year, right?

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:55.426
So it needs to be you,
a book, and this.

00:02:56.306 --> 00:02:59.276
&gt;&gt;Student: To start off, my
topic is Business In Fashion.

00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:02.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Most parent visits
to YES Prep involve presentations

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:06.176
of student accomplishments,
like this personal project.

00:03:06.176 --> 00:03:08.706
&gt;&gt;Student: My goal was
to design three pieces,

00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:12.076
and then get at least 50 percent of
the tenth grade to actually say, yes,

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:14.076
I would actually wear that.

00:03:14.076 --> 00:03:17.736
I got to actually make this,
and I showed it to them.

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:20.326
And they were-- they
thought it was short,

00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:21.286
but they were proud of my work.

00:03:21.286 --> 00:03:23.146
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What do you
think, Dad, too short?

00:03:23.146 --> 00:03:23.606
Definitely.

00:03:25.026 --> 00:03:25.336
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:29.836
&gt;&gt;Allie: So it looks like you have
lots of pictures and text features.

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:33.886
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the Seventh Grade
Exhibition, hard work pays off,

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:37.516
as the whole class gets to
shine in front of their parents.

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:40.286
&gt;&gt;Katie: We found that exhibitions
are a great way to get parents

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:42.836
to come and see their
child's work, and to be proud

00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:46.336
of their child's work, and to
see what we're doing as a school.

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:48.376
Often we try to invite
all of the parents,

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:51.536
just to make the kids feel like,
you know, this was important work

00:03:51.536 --> 00:03:54.586
that you did, and that, you know,
people are interested in seeing it.

00:03:54.716 --> 00:03:57.236
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: My title, I called
it Math, Easy As 1-2-3,

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:58.826
because it's really easy as 1-2-3.

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:01.036
&gt;&gt;Efrain: I don't see a
lot of commitment for us,

00:04:01.036 --> 00:04:02.046
although we're there for her,

00:04:02.046 --> 00:04:04.686
but it seems like she's
got it all wrapped up.

00:04:05.206 --> 00:04:07.586
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: This page is
dedicated to people in Uganda,

00:04:08.286 --> 00:04:12.026
and people that love math like I do.

00:04:12.026 --> 00:04:15.076
&gt;&gt;Efrain: She's learning it takes
a lot of hard work, not just 50,

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:17.446
60 percent, it takes
100 percent effort,

00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:20.436
and basically that's what it takes
for college, it takes a lot of work,

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:21.526
a lot of sleepless hours.

00:04:21.716 --> 00:04:27.696
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: If I want to see what is 6
times 8, I would look at this table,

00:04:27.696 --> 00:04:30.016
and see 6, and then
the 8, which is 48.

00:04:30.016 --> 00:04:30.716
See, so it's easyk, very easy.

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:33.106
&gt;&gt;Allie: I think that the
teachers here do an excellent job.

00:04:33.496 --> 00:04:36.786
They're always available for any
kind of questions that I might have,

00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:40.236
as a parent, and also any questions
that my son might have, as a student,

00:04:40.236 --> 00:04:41.256
and they're extremely patient.

00:04:41.436 --> 00:04:45.036
Yeah, they put this first,
above everything else,

00:04:45.036 --> 00:04:48.476
so it's a privilege to
be a YES Prep parent.

00:04:48.596 --> 00:04:52.666
&gt;&gt;Efrain: And what grade would be a
good idea to teach this type of math?

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:54.926
&gt;&gt;Bonnie: I would say
third grade, I--

00:04:54.926 --> 00:04:56.806
&gt;&gt;Efrain: Bonnie, we're
proud of you, and--

00:04:56.806 --> 00:04:57.966
&gt;&gt;Woman: We love the school.

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:00.666
&gt;&gt;Efrain: We love, YES, we
love, YES, definitely YES.

00:05:00.746 --> 00:05:05.976
When you go to college,
university, YES.

00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:06.766
