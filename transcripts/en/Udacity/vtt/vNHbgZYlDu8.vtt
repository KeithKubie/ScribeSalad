Hi, I'm here with Pete Koomen,
who's a cofounder of Optimizely.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.450
Pete, could you tell me a little
bit about what Optimizely does?

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we make it easy for
our customers to optimize and

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.470
personalize the experience they give
their customers on their web site or

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.710
mobile applications.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.530
&gt;&gt; Fantastic, and

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.200
what's one of your favorite memories
from early on at Optimizely?

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.600
&gt;&gt; There are a lot.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.590
I think probably the one I'm
most proud of is when we helped

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.900
the Clinton Bush Haiti campaign
raise a lot of money for

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.782
earthquake victims in 2010.

00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:36.220
So Dan, my co-founder, and I were coming
off the back of two startup failures,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.760
and we had just started
working on Optimizely, and

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.030
we were building an easier way to
run A/B tests on your website.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.375
And a few weeks into the project,
we got a call from somebody on a newly

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:53.150
set-up organization, the Clinton Bush
Haiti Fund that was created to try and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.150
raise money for the victims of
this horrible earthquake in Haiti.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.580
And they had one beleaguered IT guy
I think who built this website and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.580
was struggling to keep it up.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.380
And they were getting hundreds of
thousands of visitors every day.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.710
And they called us because they had
worked with Dan on the Obama campaign

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.350
in 2008 and
they wanted to improve the website.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.740
They wanted to earn more money for these
earthquake victims from the website.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.790
And so over the course of several days,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.230
we barely slept at all, we built
the beginnings of our platform and

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.230
then we ran a bunch of A/B
tests on their website.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.620
What I mean by that is that we
took a look at their website, and

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.618
came up with hypotheses of how
could we make this better.

00:01:32.618 --> 00:01:36.480
And maybe it's adding an image of
earthquake victims next to the credit

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.300
card form, or changing the layout,
or making the text more readable.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.220
And after a whole bunch of these
experiments, we were able to measure

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.130
that this particular change actually
improved the conversion rate.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.100
This one harmed it.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.350
This one improved it.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.570
And we were able to actually
raise their dollars per eyeball,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.680
essentially, by 10%.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.510
And so we actually helped them
raise an extra million dollars for

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.690
the victims of the earthquake.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.310
&gt;&gt; That's incredible.
