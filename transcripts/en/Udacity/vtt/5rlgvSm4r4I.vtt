00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.326
Figuring out a good way to divide a program into modules is one of the toughest

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:08.555
skills and biggest engineering challenges a programmer has. To get you started

00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:12.272
thinking about this, here's a quiz about the kinds of properties we want our

00:00:12.272 --> 00:00:15.863
modules to have, if they're going to help us Manage Complexity. Check all the

00:00:15.863 --> 00:00:19.751
answers that are correct. The choices are; All modules should be of similar

00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:24.224
size, No module should be larger than one programmer can understand, There

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:28.734
should be no dependency between modules. Modules should provide narrow, well

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:29.903
defined interfaces.
