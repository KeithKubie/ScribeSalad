Speaker 1:          00:00          Or the guys like Lucy Kay who selling out everywhere and doing great comedy. Like he can't, he could sell out fucking staple center right now multiple times in a row. What's crazy is he doesn't want to, doesn't want to just do in comedy clubs. Just working. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16          He could easily come back like tiger woods easily right now. He said that's so fucked up too because they asked me why I did it. He goes, I like to jerk off and I don't want to be alone. I like to jerk off and I don't like to be alone. Like oh and then you know he's great man. Yeah. I mean he always, he did some creepy shit. Definitely did, did some creepy shit. I definitely approve of it but he didn't molest anyone. I don't think we know exactly what happened either. I don't know. But I do know is he could sell out staples center. Yeah. Cause I think most guys and fans go, all right man. But the other thing that, and he's really good at comedy. Yeah. That's the other thing that we always have to think about whenever we talk about anything is that we're dudes.

Speaker 1:          01:02          And so when you ever to talking about someone jerking off in front of you, just imagine a woman jerking off front of us. Now you can't because that's not the same cause it was it the only reason why a girl could jerk off in front of you. And it's hilarious because she can't rape you. See if a guy is jerking off in front of you, most guys are bigger and stronger than most women. Obviously there's some variables there, but most guys are bigger and stronger and men make all the rape and women aren't out there raping dudes show, right? It's all men. So if a guy has his dick out and he's jerking off scary shit, that's why it's scary. It's scary. It's creepy to, if a girl, if you go over a girl's house and for whatever reason she goes, I want you to watch it sit down and fucking, you know, fucking fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:48          She starts fingering herself fucking, you know, like Whoa. Yeah, but you wouldn't laugh. You would laugh and you would come back to here and we would talk about it. Cause I know I can get out of in time. Yeah, right. We'd be crying laughing but it wouldn't be like you were in danger. But if a guy is with safety, you have a daughter and your daughter weighs 110 pounds different animals and she's with a guy and the guy in front of her. Yeah. And he asked to do it and she says yes cause she scared. Fuck. Then it's like what? What would actually happen? And see he hasn't really said anything other than the stories are true and you know

Speaker 2:          02:28          yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Does come from a guy that sounds like, you know, cause you have two daughters. Yeah. Well it's so you have to think like that. Well you have to think like that as a human being, right? Yeah. But I'm saying to you is probably the first thing you think of because you have two daughters. Right. But I don't think that's what he did. I think from, I can't say too much cause I don't know. But I think he did some regrettable things and I think he would admit that, but I don't think he did what a lot of people are claiming he did in terms of, that's what I've heard. How often he did it or he did or what the circumstances were, but it was either way. There's no defending when it was bad. No, it's not good. There's no deficiency. It's a terrible thing to do, but what's the punishment for that? You know how much I should punish them, do you not pay for it and lost all his jobs, lost all his TV deals, $35 million in a year of work and people still were say no, but he's still, he's fine. I've heard that argument that he's fine. Like what?

Speaker 1:          03:26          These are also, these are also things that he did like more than a decade ago. Right. What, when do you offer someone compassion? Like when do you, when do you let them explain themselves? When do you, when is it enough is enough or it should he have to do something like what would people like someone to do? Well, I think they're coming because something like this, there's only a year. And then he's back and killing it because he's so good at comedy. Cause like with tiger woods, right. People hated tiger. Well there was that, but there was also the material that got leaked when he came back. So people were upset at the jokes. The parkland joke. Yeah. Not the best. It's that shit falls in line with how he's always done jokes though. I told him whether he did this or not. He says the fucked up thing to say, it's part of what makes him really funny.

Speaker 1:          04:09          And he does that in real life too. It's not, it's a style of comedy man. I mean it's just like a Quentin Tarantino has a style of making movies. His style of comedy is to say fucked up things. So that compounded the fact that people were upset at him that a year ago, you know, he said he was going to take some time off, but it's, um, I don't, you know, I think it's really important to know that I don't know what happened and, and you know, he knows and they know and it's, it's never good when someone's upset that you jerked off in front of them. That's not a good time. It's is never good for anybody, but also him losing $35 million in only been out a year. I think people are upset. That was such a quick turnaround. Like Tj, is that a quick turnaround, man? I mean, not as a comic, but for, to the, to the, uh, normal person like a year. That ain't shit, dude. But as a comic, not to be able to do, let's imagine that he's going to live another 50 years,

Speaker 3:          05:06          right? A year, a year out of 50.

Speaker 1:          05:11          It's like 2%, right? Yeah. It's a lot. It's a lot and a lot of money. Yeah.
