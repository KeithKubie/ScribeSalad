00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.980
In this video we're going to show you how to take a scrap of wood a sheet of plastic and a little bit of hardware

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.170
To make a microscope that works with your cell phone

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.130
*Intro Plays*

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.219
The supplies for this project are simple and easy. We have a sheet of clear plastic,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.480
A scrap of wood board, a little bit of hardware, and a laser pointer, and a flashlight and of course since that's how this microscope

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.730
works
We're also going to need a cell phone with a camera.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.939
First grab your sheet of plastic. This one is an 8 by 10 sheet of acrylic from Lowe's that only cost a few bucks

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.950
These sheets of plastic usually come with protective layers on both sides. It's time to peel those off.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.809
Place your cell phone facedown on a surface that won't scratch the screen.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.018
Then take your plastic sheet and line it up on top of the phone leaving enough space on both sides

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:55.189
So you'll be able to add support points using a marker that will draw on the plastic mark a spot where your phone's camera is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.040
This model of phone has two cameras on the back

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.720
So I'm making sure to mark the one that's used for narrower shots

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.820
Not the wide-angle lens in a line with where you've marked your camera mark two spots on the sides where you can add your supports

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.750
You'll be drilling holes into the plastic about 1/4 of an inch wide so make sure you leave enough space add

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.109
One more support point down near the bottom of the phone as well

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.250
You should now have four spots marked out in your plastic where you're going to drill holes

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.050
But before you do any drilling you need to cut out a rectangle that completely contains those points

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.180
There are several ways to cut acrylic I find the easiest

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.020
For a sheet this thickness is to score the plastic with a sharp knife and then bend it over a hard corner

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.959
Don't throw away those pieces that you broke off because we are going to use them later the four holes

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.100
You marked in your plastic will be used for different things

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.840
the two on the outside at the top

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.370
And the one at the bottom will be used for the supports that hold up the entire plastic frame

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.940
This one in the middle

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.649
However is going to be used to hold a focusing lens that lets your phone camera see much much closer than normal

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.269
The three support poles need to be the right size to fit your hardware the ones

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.969
I'm using are one-quarter inch bolts that are five inches long

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.440
With your acrylic sheet cut you now want to cut your board to be just a little bit larger

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.059
Mark where you need to cut it so that there's plenty of space, but it's not too cumbersome

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.730
You'll want the holes in your plastic and the holes in the wood board to line up perfectly so take some strong tape and

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.759
Attach the acrylic sheet to the board temporarily

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.640
we now want to drill through our acrylic sheet and our first board with a scrap piece of wood behind it to make sure we

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.120
Don't drill into the workbench

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.929
drilling through acrylic can be tricky because it does have a tendency to crack if you try and drill too quickly so you use a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.930
Sharp drill bit and go slow

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.828
With those three holes drilled you can remove your tape and separate your plastic from the wood

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.420
The last hole that needs to be drilled into the acrylic doesn't

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.060
Necessarily need to be the same size as the three support posts

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:21.839
What it needs to be is the same size as the lens that we're going to fit into the plastic to measure that we first

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.329
Need to remove it from where it's hiding these little keychain laser pointers have been around for quite a while and while they may have

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.299
Been expensive in the past now you can get them for pretty cheap

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.599
I got this one at a pet store where it's sold as a cat

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.668
Exercising toy as the first step remove the batteries to eliminate any risk of shock

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.869
After removing the front tip you should be able to see a black housing

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.559
our lens is hidden down inside there with a pair of needle nose pliers look just grip and twist and

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.119
On this our lens just popped right out literally popped right out

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.539
Here is the little lens that we're going after in the laser is used to focus the beam into a tight point

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.500
You now want to drill a small

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.310
hole where you mark your

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.859
Camera's position on your cell phone the exact diameter of this lens that was removed from the laser pointer on this setup the quarter inch

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.978
Drill bit has made a hole that is almost the perfect size for our lens

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.169
So we're going to drill another hole that same size

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.598
And then try just rotating the drill bit a little bit to widen the hole enough that our lens can fit in

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.319
You should now have a hole that your lens can fit into but before you attach it permanently you need to verify that you're gonna

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.699
Have it facing the correct direction both directions will give you some magnification

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.039
But if you have your camera pointed in the wrong side you'll have a very narrow area

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.260
That's in focus more of the screen should be in focus if the cameras will be in the correct direction

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.180
These lenses have two sides to them

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.530
One side is completely flat and the other has a small ring going around a domed surface

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.029
You'll want your camera to be looking through the back of the flat side

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.809
So that the curved side is facing whatever you're trying to look at

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.990
with the

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.979
orientation of your tiny lens identified you now want to press it into the drilled hole in the acrylic so that the dome side is

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.620
Facing what you're looking at and the flat side is

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.669
Facing your phone's camera if you've drilled your hole out into the correct size the lens should pop in and hold itself in place easily

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.278
With the hole for your lens drilled in your plastic

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:35.500
Mark that circle on your board the three five inch bolts will work as support posts that hold your entire trilogy eat up

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:41.049
But you'll want a way to look at slides and other things that you're seeing through your microscope

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.329
So now it's time to cut and add another piece of your acrylic sheet that will rest below the large one

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.060
This one won't have to reach all three posts, but will work. Just fine if it's only attached to the two in front

00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:10.949
This piece will function as a shelf that we can put things on as we observe them through the microscope

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:18.268
Before we finish attaching all of the support hardware and the pieces that will hold our slide and main sheet of acrylic on top

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:20.699
We need to add a hole that will let us

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.249
Attach our light this little press button flashlight is from the hardware store and only cost about 4 bucks

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:30.899
I like the compact design and the fact that the base is almost a perfect cylinder

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:36.029
Let's remove the keyring and then drill a hole into the wood platform that this can fit in

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.088
This 3/4 inch Forstner bit should be just the right size

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:50.188
The fit seems like it might still be just a little bit snug, so let's try and use some sandpaper to open that up

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.159
Our flashlight now fits snugly into the hole

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:02.039
We just bored and we can still access the trigger on the bottom at this point your board should be ready for assembly

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.299
But just make it look a little bit nicer. Let's sand down all of the edges and give it a shot of black paint

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.969
Fit the three posts through the holes in the board and then add a washer and a nut to each one

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:23.369
Next take two wing nuts and attach those upside down onto the front tube post

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:26.909
these two posts will work for both raising and lowering and

00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:28.719
focusing our slide

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:33.539
Our larger plate will fit over the slide to support the cellphone above it

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:36.899
To make sure our slide moves up and down a little bit more smoothly

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:44.009
Let's add some small pieces of a spring in between our slide and the nuts that we'll add to attach our top sheet

00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:49.469
Fit your flashlight into place, and it should line up just right with your lens

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:57.778
As a final accessory grab one of the remaining pieces of your sheet of acrylic and break it in half to use as two slides

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:02.968
To hold things together in place under your lens at this point you should be able to turn on your phone's camera

00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:07.649
Line it up with the lens and see a very up-close view of what's beneath

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.549
We have a few different items that we want to try looking at as up close as possible

00:08:25.219 --> 00:08:28.389
Here's an extremely close-up view of part of a dollar bill

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.629
by George what big eyes you have

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.380
Let's see what happens if we sandwich a flower petal in between our two slides and turn on the light behind it

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.660
You can actually make out the individual plant cells that the flower petal is made of

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.100
You really see some pretty crazy details and get this close

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.220
Here we've got a little bit of whatever kind of plant is growing in the water feature in the backyard

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.059
With this penny we can see a lot of details not normally visible to the naked eye

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:28.259
For example the tiny statue of the Lincoln monument

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.519
Inside the building pictured on the back of the penny

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.290
This hands-on build is one that I found in an old issue of Make Magazine

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.480
And it's really easy to build now

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.159
You can use your cell phone to take extremely close-up pictures and video of things you can't normally even see

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.600
Hey guys. Thanks for watching if you're not a subscriber yet
