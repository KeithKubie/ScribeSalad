00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.400
Now if you got this right,
you may have used this as point one and

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.000
this as point two, or
you may have done the opposite.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.340
It turns out it doesn't matter.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.560
So I'm actually going to use
this as my x1 and my y1,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.040
and these as my x2 and my y2.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.383
In which case, y2-y1 would be 2-5, and

00:00:20.383 --> 00:00:27.096
x2-x1 would be 3-5,
which equals 2-5 is -3 and

00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:31.910
3-5 is -2, so I have -3 over -2.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.470
But the negative signs simplify and
this just equals three halves.
