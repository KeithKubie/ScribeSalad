00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:05.710
 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:12.090
yeah well they're triad of behaviors

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100
yeah well they're triad of behaviors
 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.410
yeah well they're triad of behaviors
that are the earmarks of autism include

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420
that are the earmarks of autism include
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.519
that are the earmarks of autism include
difficulty in social interactions delay

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529
difficulty in social interactions delay
 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.550
difficulty in social interactions delay
in the development of speech and

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560
in the development of speech and
 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.779
in the development of speech and
communication and those are

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789
communication and those are
 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.190
communication and those are
distinguishable and repetitive behaviors

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200
distinguishable and repetitive behaviors
 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.130
distinguishable and repetitive behaviors
almost obsessive like behaviors the

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140
almost obsessive like behaviors the
 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.440
almost obsessive like behaviors the
recognition of this triad as a condition

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450
recognition of this triad as a condition
 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.590
recognition of this triad as a condition
that we call autism began only in the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600
that we call autism began only in the
 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.810
that we call autism began only in the
late 30s and as the diagnostic criteria

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820
late 30s and as the diagnostic criteria
 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.910
late 30s and as the diagnostic criteria
began to be more widely applied more and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920
began to be more widely applied more and
 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.840
began to be more widely applied more and
more children were being called autistic

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850
more children were being called autistic
 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.410
more children were being called autistic
and the definition I think I mean people

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420
and the definition I think I mean people
 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.510
and the definition I think I mean people
now talk about autism spectrum disorders

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520
now talk about autism spectrum disorders
 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.660
now talk about autism spectrum disorders
where a child is it has varying degrees

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670
where a child is it has varying degrees
 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.500
where a child is it has varying degrees
of these abnormalities it is not in fact

of these abnormalities it is not in fact
 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.240
of these abnormalities it is not in fact
an extremely well-defined disorder it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250
an extremely well-defined disorder it
 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.010
an extremely well-defined disorder it
has sloppy boundaries to normal behavior

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020

we all know people that are awkward

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190
we all know people that are awkward
 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.170
we all know people that are awkward
socially there are many people who learn

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180
socially there are many people who learn
 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.120
socially there are many people who learn
language late in life and we may all may

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130
language late in life and we may all may
 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.950
language late in life and we may all may
know people that's that that have

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960
know people that's that that have
 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.800
know people that's that that have
stutters or have obsessive behaviors or

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810
stutters or have obsessive behaviors or
 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.890
stutters or have obsessive behaviors or
even hand-wringing so there is something

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900
even hand-wringing so there is something
 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.630
even hand-wringing so there is something
of a continuum in all three of these

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640
of a continuum in all three of these
 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.090
of a continuum in all three of these
things that's not a condition whose

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100
things that's not a condition whose
 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.180
things that's not a condition whose
boundaries are well defined yet if you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190
boundaries are well defined yet if you
 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.990
boundaries are well defined yet if you
meet a child with autism you can

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000
meet a child with autism you can
 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.789
meet a child with autism you can
generally say that this there's

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799
generally say that this there's
 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.920
generally say that this there's
something profoundly profoundly wrong

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930
something profoundly profoundly wrong
 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.380
something profoundly profoundly wrong
here but it's a it's a hard disorder to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390
here but it's a it's a hard disorder to
 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.560
here but it's a it's a hard disorder to
define better than that and probably the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570
define better than that and probably the
 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.330
define better than that and probably the
reason it's harder harder to find it

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340
reason it's harder harder to find it
 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.899
reason it's harder harder to find it
better than that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909
better than that
 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.210
better than that
is that the number of genes involved the

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220
is that the number of genes involved the
 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.850
is that the number of genes involved the
number of underlying causes that can

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860
number of underlying causes that can
 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.629
number of underlying causes that can
create this triad is very great for

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:15.639
create this triad is very great for
 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.500
create this triad is very great for
example

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510
 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.570
the syndrome itself is enormous ly

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
the syndrome itself is enormous ly
 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.510
the syndrome itself is enormous ly
varied and if you have listened to

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520
varied and if you have listened to
 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.370
varied and if you have listened to
somebody who studies autistic children

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380
somebody who studies autistic children
 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.950
somebody who studies autistic children
children with autism you'll frequently

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960
children with autism you'll frequently
 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.410
children with autism you'll frequently
hear them say that each child that they

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420
hear them say that each child that they
 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.200
hear them say that each child that they
see is different than the next it's not

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210
see is different than the next it's not
 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.330
see is different than the next it's not
really a syndrome in the way that Down

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
really a syndrome in the way that Down
 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.570
really a syndrome in the way that Down
syndrome is a syndrome there are a

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580
syndrome is a syndrome there are a
 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.460
syndrome is a syndrome there are a
variety of genetic disorders that are

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470
variety of genetic disorders that are
 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.590
variety of genetic disorders that are
frequently you could almost tell that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600
frequently you could almost tell that
 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.270
frequently you could almost tell that
the children who have these disorders

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280
the children who have these disorders
 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.310
the children who have these disorders
have the same underlying cause because

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320
have the same underlying cause because
 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.440
have the same underlying cause because
they'll actually look like it's not just

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450
they'll actually look like it's not just
 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.730
they'll actually look like it's not just
Down syndrome that has that property

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740
Down syndrome that has that property
 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.920
Down syndrome that has that property
progeria has that property there are a

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930
progeria has that property there are a
 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.080
progeria has that property there are a
number of childhood disorders where the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
number of childhood disorders where the
 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.010
number of childhood disorders where the
children that have these disorders

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020
children that have these disorders
 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.830
children that have these disorders
actually look alike that's not the case

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840
actually look alike that's not the case
 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.530
actually look alike that's not the case
in autism each child has sort of

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540
in autism each child has sort of
 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.820
in autism each child has sort of
wonderfully different than the next

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830
wonderfully different than the next
 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.400
wonderfully different than the next
child so there's a huge amount of

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410
child so there's a huge amount of
 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.650
child so there's a huge amount of
variability and I think this is this has

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660
variability and I think this is this has
 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.080
variability and I think this is this has
confounded the general public because it

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090
confounded the general public because it
 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.480
confounded the general public because it
appears that the rate of autism has been

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490
appears that the rate of autism has been
 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.090
appears that the rate of autism has been
going up so dramatically in fact I think

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100
going up so dramatically in fact I think
 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.220
going up so dramatically in fact I think
that's mainly due to increased diagnosis
