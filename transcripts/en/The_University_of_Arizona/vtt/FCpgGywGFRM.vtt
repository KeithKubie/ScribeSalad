00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.870
So my work is about
what you smell when

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.610
you walk into this rain forest.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.260
And that smell is
plant volatiles.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.660
In this rain forest
that's under glass,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.480
the volatiles are
trapped by the glass,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.610
and they're not destroyed by UV.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.130
So they can accumulate
such large amounts,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.410
they can burn your nose in here.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.200
I'm studying, particularly,
the volatiles that help plant

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.410
leaves to deal with stress,
like from high temperatures

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.240
and drought.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.140
These volatiles help plants
to deal with climatic change.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.010
But they also, in turn, feed
back to affect the climate.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.600
And they're stored as oil.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.780
But once you break them free,
then just like a perfume

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.460
that you would
spray on yourself,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.590
that oil gradually is released
into the air, becoming a gas.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.860
We used to go on
vacations to Costa Rica

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.490
whenever we could on Christmas
break when I was a kid.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.100
So I became fascinated with
tropical forests there.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.760
So once I decided to
get into sciences,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.750
then I set my track to get
back to the tropical forest,

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.010
kept working there, learned how
to identify plants, came here,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.100
and I've just kept
doing it since.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.640
Here, I can plug into AC power
while I'm working on the leaves

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.862
right out inside the
forest, which is amazing.

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:20.320
I know that it's
not going to rain,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.510
because the people
at the energy center

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.880
didn't hit the
button to say rain.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.400
If I want to see how
plants respond to drought,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.920
we just turn off the
rain for a while.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.450
You have
three-dimensional access

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.610
to any point inside the biome.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.370
Salad tongs for timing.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.210
You can climb up
the space frame.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.960
And you can drop
ropes to anywhere.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.710
And then you can repel
down to that point.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.840
You can haul instruments
up to yourself.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.980
That is still difficult,
hard, hot, grueling work.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.490
But it's easier than climbing
trees, which I've also

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.750
done in the real world.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.780
And yeah, that's much
harder, and more dangerous.
