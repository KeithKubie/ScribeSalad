00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
fusion as an energy source is very

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.759
attractive it would be a carbon-free

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.880
energy source that could power mankind

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.599
forever the challenges is making fusion

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.599
work

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:20.240
at the National Ignition facility what

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.880
we're trying to do is overcome a natural

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.420
barrier that nature has set up for atoms

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.420
to fuse together

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.010
the idea behind fusion is the two atoms

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.660
that you try to put together those cores

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.040
have the same charge and they repel one

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.480
another just like the two parts of a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.250
magnet 10 to repel each other one of our

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.280
main goals is to achieve thermonuclear

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.050
fusion to start a fusion fire in the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.720
laboratory like the process that's going

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.520
on in the sun in order to create those

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.960
conditions on earth we have to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.930
concentrate a tremendous amount of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.790
energy in a very tiny volume and so we

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.230
built the world's biggest laser so this

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.430
facility is the size of three football

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.339
fields

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.470
it's filled with lasers and we

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.840
concentrate all those lasers into a tiny

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.800
target you know about the size of tip of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.250
your pinky

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.660
so this is an if target where this is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.940
the thing we put at the center of the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.430
chamber in order to do an experiment and

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.280
all hundred and ninety two beams hit

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.220
this target so 96 beams coming from the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.350
top 96 beams come in from the bottom and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.289
all that energy ends up in this little

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.300
tiny target in order to start the fusion

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.930
reaction

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.640
if we do that in just the right way we

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.490
have calculations that say we should be

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.920
able to get more energy out then we put

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.140
into this implosion in light of fusion

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.070
fire that could actually power power

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.360
plants and put energy on the grid so

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.860
where we are today on the national

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.140
mission facility with regard to ignition

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.600
is we're creating a lot of fusion events

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.850
we take atoms and we force them together

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.500
and we see the energy released its kind

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.960
of like a sparking match being applied

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.640
to a bonfire you haven't yet caught the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.560
fuel on fire in such a way that the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.360
whole thing burns which are getting are

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.180
isolated events happening within the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.650
bonfire stack so we see the beginnings

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.640
of the sparks but we're not there yet

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.640
with the bonfire so we were successful

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.170
in showing fusion is feasible from my

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.540
point of view would be a defining moment

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.180
much like the demonstration flight with

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.610
the Wright brothers plane in a similar

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.040
way if we get ignition on if we now

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.020
harness the same processes that power

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.000
the Sun so we will have the opportunity

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.130
before us to move from the very first

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.860
beginnings of Fire where we hid stones

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.570
together to make sparks to harnessing

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.360
the power of the Sun that's an exciting

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:52.199
possibility for human coming

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.199
