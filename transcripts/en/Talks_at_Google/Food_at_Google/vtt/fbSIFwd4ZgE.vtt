ADAM ROBERTS: OK.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.430
Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.870
My name is Adam Roberts, and I
am a food blogger from the

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.740
website The Amateur Gourmet, and
I'm also the author of a

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.840
new cookbook that some of you
just purchased called Secrets

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.500
of the Best Chefs.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.080
Thank you so much for having
me here at Google.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.820
This has been really cool.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.600
I got to eat at the big--
what was it called?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.390
MALE SPEAKER: The big table.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.280
ADAM ROBERTS: It
was very good.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.980
I took pictures.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.320
I'm going to blog
it on Monday.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.700
So anyway, I'm going to tell you
all about myself and the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.220
story of how I started
my food blog and how

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.960
it led to this book.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.170
And actually, Google plays a
role that story, so this is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.610
like interactive storytelling.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.170
Anyway, so what happened was I
started my blog back in 2004.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.100
I was in law school at Emory in
Atlanta, and I came from a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.390
family where nobody cooked.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.720
My mother didn't cook, my
father didn't cook, my

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.460
grandparents didn't cook.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.970
And for some reason, going to
law school, I just got very

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.310
interested in cooking.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.560
And so I would watch the Food
Network and I would sort of

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.420
write down recipes.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.140
And then one day, I gave it a
try and I got behind the stove

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.340
and I made, I think, it was
Mario Batale's tomato sauce,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.100
and I was hooked.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.600
And I just started cooking
all the time, and it

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.520
was a lot of fun.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.390
So around that time,
like in 2004--

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.380
which was my third year
of law school--

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.670
two of my friends suggested
that I start a food blog.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.350
And back then, in 2004,
it wasn't like

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.990
an established thing.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.970
I'm sure all of you guys
read food blogs.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.700
Are you guys all big
food people?

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.760
Cooks and readers--

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.900
OK, yes, one person.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.620
So anyway, it wasn't like an
established thing back then.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.910
So I started my food blog in
January of 2004, and I called

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.580
it The Amateur Gourmet because I
was learning how to cook and

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.800
I didn't know anything and
I wasn't an authority.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.040
And the goal of the blog when
I started it was really just

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.695
to share all my disasters and
things that went wrong and

00:01:53.695 --> 00:01:54.720
things that went right
and what I was

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600
learning as I went along.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.330
So when I started my blog,
I had about five readers,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.620
including my parents
and my roommate and

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.580
maybe two other people.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.750
And this is where Google
enters the story.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.850
Around the end of January 2004,
Janet Jackson, you might

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.910
recall, showed her breast
at the Super Bowl.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.510
Do you guys remember that?

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.400
And I decided it would be funny
to make a Janet Jackson

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.870
breast cupcake.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.910
So I made a cupcake and I had
mocha frosting and a Hershey

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.210
kiss as the nipple.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.700
It had the nipple shield--
remember it had a shield

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.030
around her--?

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.900
Yeah, I did like white icing,
and I put that on my blog.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.200
And I went to school
the next day.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.000
And when I got home, my site
had had 70,000 hits.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.450
And it was linked all over and
CNN actually called me and

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.270
asked if they could come over
and do a story on the Janet

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.710
Jackson breast cupcake.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.340
And so Google enters the story
here, though, because that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.400
post became so popular and went
so viral that when people

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.700
were googling cupcake, that
would come up as a top result.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.100
And so I actually had a picture
of her breast at the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.640
top of that post, and I
got flagged for having

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.150
inappropriate conduct and I
actually got kicked off of

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.960
Google after that.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.380
So I had to the take off-- it
was a whole elaborate thing.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.260
Anyway, I got back on
and so that's my

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.200
Google related story.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.150
I hope you like that part
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.730
So anyway, after that I actually
grew an audience.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.020
I had a lot of readers of my
blog, and I sort of had to

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.750
make a choice of I wanted to
keep doing zany sort of

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.980
cupcakey pop culture things, or
if I really wanted to take

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.290
cooking seriously and really
start to become more of a

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.040
serious home cook, and that's
sort of what happened.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.740
So in 2005, I actually
sold my first book.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.050
It was a book of essays called
The Amateur Gourmet, and it

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.010
was about learning how to
cook from point zero.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.760
It was basically my story of
knowing absolutely nothing

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.040
about food and cooking and
getting to a point where I

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.580
could make dinner for a group
of-- at the end the book, I

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.690
would make a giant five first
course tasting menu dinner for

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.360
10 friends.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.580
So that first book was about
learning how to cook.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.870
And actually that book led--
the Food Network, it caught

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.390
the attention of the
Food Network.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.130
And they hired me to host a web
show for a year called The

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.200
FN Dish, which was sort
of their, like, Food

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.580
Network, F dot N dot.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.495
Then it was, like,
effing dish.

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:14.430
What was funny was they really
wanted to create these viral

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.529
web videos that would set the
world on fire, but it was hard

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.310
because they didn't want to make
fun of any of the Food

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.610
Network people and it
had to be very PC.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.160
So actually it was funny.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.930
I got to interview Rachael
Ray for that.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.090
And when I sat down to interview
her, the director

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.770
said, don't ask her
any questions yet.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.000
We're going to start rolling
tape and we'll

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.870
tell you when to start.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.950
So she sat down and I sat down
and I said hi, I'm Adam, and

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.460
she said hi.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.070
We just sat there in stony
silence for 23 seconds.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.260
And I was fidgeting and really
nervous and she was just sort

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.020
of sitting there.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.690
And then they said OK go,
you can ask questions.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.190
And I started the interview
and she perked

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.180
up and it was great.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.310
But when it was over, I said to
my director if you want a

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.315
viral video, you have to put
those 23 awkward seconds with

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:00.920
Rachael Ray on the Web.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.730
And actually, if you Google
that, you'll see there is a

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.230
video called 23 Awkward Seconds
with Rachael Ray.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.990
And that's basically my crowning
achievement in my

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.260
year at the Food Network.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.480
And not shockingly, they didn't
really keep me on very

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.220
long after that.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.020
So I had a year at
the Food Network.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.920
The other sort of controversial
thing that I did

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.040
there was Anthony Bourdain is a
famous Food Network critic.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.110
He really doesn't like
the Food Network.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.060
So when I was at the South Beach
Food and Wine Festival,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.490
we stumbled upon him and he was
in a kitchen somewhere.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.810
And we said to him, you can do
an interview with me and rant

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.510
about the Food Network.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.810
You can say whatever you want
and we'll put it on the Food

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.660
Network website, because again,
the goal was to create

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.220
these viral videos.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.950
And so he did.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.560
You can find that if you want.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.310
He just rails against
the Food Network.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.750
And actually, they put in
on the home page of

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.230
foodnetwork.com.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.850
And apparently, a lot of the
Food Network stars called up

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.640
the president of the Food
Network and were like, why do

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.490
you have this video of Anthony
Bourdain trashing the Food

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.020
Network on the Food
Network home page?

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.630
And they said well, we're
trying to go viral.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.420
So again, I lost that
job after a year--

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.220
not shocking.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.120
But I'm telling you all this and
giving you my trajectory

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.910
because that all led to this
book that is for sale in the

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.970
back at a very reasonable $10.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.580
It's called Secrets
of the Best Chefs.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.600
So essentially around the time
that I finished the Food

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.560
Network show, I realized
that I wanted to

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.400
go to the next level.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.250
I wanted to--

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.730
if I was an amateur home cook
and if I was self-taught, I

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.010
wanted to now sort of go
forward a little bit.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.060
And so the idea came to what
would it be like to travel the

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.870
country and cook with 50 world
class chefs and home cooks and

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.550
to really to cook with them side
by side and to absorb as

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.530
much as I could in
the process?

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.620
And a lot of chef
cookbooks don't

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.390
really adapt their recipes.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.540
Chefs don't really have the
mindset of home cooks.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.180
They're thinking about
how to feed large

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.130
quantities of people.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.030
They're thinking of how to
dazzle you with inventiveness

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.880
and things that don't
really apply when

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.990
you're cooking at home.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.970
So I felt like I was in a really
good position to be an

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.780
advocate for the home cook while
cooking in the kitchens

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.160
of great chefs, and
that's sort of how

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.660
this book came about.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.190
So in 2010, I sold the book
to Artisan Books.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.820
And they do the French Laundry
cookbook, they do all of

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.460
Thomas Keller's cookbooks,
so they're a really great

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.510
publisher, and so I felt really
excited that I was

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.850
going to get to do this
hardcover 400 page multicolor

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.186
pictures, because in the last
book-- the first book that I

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:35.600
wrote was just a book of essays,
so I was ready to go

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.750
on to the next thing.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.230
So the concept, again, was that
I was going to travel the

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.060
country, cook with 50 chefs and
home cooks, and then each

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.960
of them were going to teach
me three dishes.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.880
And I was going to go
home and adapt the

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.410
dishes for home cooks.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.780
And that's pretty much
how it worked.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.000
So I started in New York.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.150
Melissa Clark is a recipe writer
for the New York Times

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.710
and she's a cookbook author.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.230
And so I started with her and I
said to her, I want to learn

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.980
how do you come up with original
recipes that you can

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.140
published in the New York
Times on a weekly basis?

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.090
Like, how do you even think
of like these recipes?

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.540
And so she took me the Union
Square farmers' market in the

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.860
middle of Union Square,
New York.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.100
And we went food shopping,
and she just

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.920
started grabbing radishes--

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.780
beautiful radishes--

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.720
and she put them in a bag, and
then she got sugar snap peas

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.480
and filled the bag.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.090
And she saw sheep's milk ricotta
and bought that and

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.990
she saw this beautiful loaf of
bread and she bought that.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.540
And so she started buying
all these ingredients.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.460
And we went back to her
house in Brooklyn.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.740
She just started-- it was like
the Tasmanian devil.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.539
She just started-- she took the
bread and she sliced and

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:38.840
she put it in a toaster.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.580
Then she took the sheep's milk
ricotta and put it in a bowl

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.650
and stirred it around and then
she sliced the radishes and

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.210
she sliced the sugar
snap peas.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.215
And she stirred the sugar snap
peas and radishes in a bowl

00:08:46.215 --> 00:08:49.130
with olive oil and lemon juice
and garlic and anchovies.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.790
And when the toast came out of
the toaster, she put the

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.470
ricotta on top and then she put
that whole mixture of the

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.480
sugar snap peas and radishes
on top and she

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.770
said, that's crustini.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.140
That's the first recipe.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.540
And I said wait, how
did you did that?

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.420
I don't know, she goes.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.530
That's how I do it.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:03.770
So it's just sort of watching
that process.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.250
And what I learned from her is
that it's all about momentum.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.190
It was just her energy
of just grabbing

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.300
things and trying things.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.740
She said, if you fail at
it, just call it recipe

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.780
developing, which is great.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.220
And she also said that if you
don't like the way something

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.600
comes out, just rename
the dish.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.195
And she actually wrote about
this recently in

00:09:20.195 --> 00:09:21.240
the New York Times.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.720
She says she wants to make this
eggplant salad that was

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.970
supposed to be like the
traditional eggplant salad,

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.770
but the eggplant was
really bitter.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.030
So she just named the dish
bitter eggplant salad, and

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.600
there it was.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.060
So I started with her, and I
kind of think of this book as

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.170
sort of a mural or something
where I started in this part

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.970
and I sort of grew outwards
and outwards and

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.090
outwards and outwards.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.570
So I thought, OK, I have her.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.020
Who do I want to
cook with next?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.920
And actually, Rebecca Charles
is the chef of the Pearl

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.860
Oyster Bar in New York, which
is a really well known

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.040
restaurant there.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.210
And from her, I learned how to
cook [FRENCH], which is to

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.390
cook in the moment, to actually
cook hot restaurant

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.180
dishes on order.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.000
She taught me how to take two
pans and a pair of tongs and

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.830
to make a beautiful place of
restaurant quality food.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.050
So she got these two pans, she
put them on the stone, she

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.990
turned on the heat.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.650
In the first pan, she added a
splash of oil and the second

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.160
pan she added butter.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.470
And in the first pan,
she took fish--

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.060
I think it was trout,
or no, it was cod.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.480
She put cod in the first pan
and started searing it.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.850
In the second pan, she put sugar
snap peas and corn and

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.400
heirloom tomatoes
with the butter.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.500
So she had these two pans going
and she used the tongs

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.090
to stir around the vegetables
and she used the tongs to flip

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.920
over the fish.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.190
And all of this is
going on at once.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.550
And by the time she was done,
she poured the vegetables onto

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.890
a plate, she lifted the
fish on top, and it

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:39.950
was the most gorgeous--

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.770
you can see it in the book.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.830
I mean, it's the most beautiful
plate of restaurant

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:46.520
food and she used were two
pans and a pair of tongs.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.940
That lesson of just sort of
seeing how with the most

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.640
simple equipment you can make
really gorgeous restaurant

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.160
quality food was really
instructive to me, that it's

00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.720
not so much about what fancy
equipment you have at home.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.630
It's really just about the
rhythm of it and really

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.910
understanding how to interact
with food as you make it.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.500
And so that's how the book
started to grow.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.040
And I went to 11 different
cities.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.950
I went to Chicago, San
Francisco, LA, Portland,

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.540
Seattle, New York, DC, Athens,
Georgia, Atlanta, Georgia.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.740
And so I was really trying to
create a portrait of American

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.160
cooking and to try to get as
many different cuisines and

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.860
cultures and chefs, both high
and low, and older chefs and

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.260
younger chefs.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.430
We have a 24 year old
chef who was on Top

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.770
Chef, and we have a--

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.810
sorry, I knocked that
microphone-- like 60 something

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:33.560
year old chef.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.910
I really wanted to get
a panorama of chefs.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.180
And the hardest part of writing
the book was not the

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.980
cooking and it wasn't the
adaptation of the recipes,

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.340
which I'll talk about
in a second--

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.980
it was just booking chefs.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.020
Chefs are difficult--

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.510
to nail them down, to convince
them to do this book.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.420
I mean, because really what I
was asking was for access to

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.080
their kitchens.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.330
I was saying, let me into your
kitchen and then show me what

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.380
you do here and there's going
to a photographer.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.666
And a lot of chefs are like, no
way, we're not going to let

00:11:58.666 --> 00:11:59.260
you do that.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.220
But this chefs did let
me in, actually--

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.590
I think what the reason that
they let me in was that I feel

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.870
like the more confident you
are as a chef, the less

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.590
threatened you are by somebody
stealing your ideas because

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.850
it's not so much about the
ideas, it's more about the

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.170
philosophy of how you
approach food.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.750
So as you read through this
book, you'll see that each

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:22.110
chef has a different attitude
about food and it sort of

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.540
reflects their own personalities
and their own

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.140
personas through their food, and
it has very little to do

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.240
with a secret formula
or a guarded recipe.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.350
It has much more to do with--

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.450
Daniel Patterson, the chef at
Qua here in San Francisco is a

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.740
great example of that, because
he's all about the very best

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.410
ingredients.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.730
He goes foraging for ingredients
everywhere.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.850
And so for him it's not about
the secret formula of a recipe

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.000
that he has to keep guarded to
himself, it's more about

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.390
getting these gorgeous radishes
delivered to him by a

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.830
farmer and then going foraging
for strange herbs and weeds

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.090
that he then puts
into the salad.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.310
It's not something that somebody
can steal, it's more

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.490
just a way of teaching.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.030
So that was sort of how the
book came together.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.340
Actually at the front of the
book, in the front matter--

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.740
this is the book again--

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.750
I have the 10 lessons that I
learned from cooking with 50

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.380
of the country's best chefs.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.350
And so I thought I would go
through those and talk about

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:22.600
them a little bit.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.860
So these are the 10 essential
rules for cooking like a chef.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.670
And the first one is actually
probably the most cliche.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.500
You've heard it before, but I
kind of want to articulate my

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.760
own slant on it, which is
to taste as you go.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.640
Now tasting as you go,
you hear that a lot.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.490
You'll watch the Food Network
and they'll say taste as you

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.830
go, taste as you go.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:44.380
Well, for me what that ended up
being about was about not

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.340
just tasting for salt and not
just tasting for whatever else

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.030
you're tasting for.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.340
What you're really trying to
do as a great chef and what

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.450
these great chefs did is in
their mind they had a vision

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.740
of what this dish should taste
like and then they were

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.690
getting it to taste that way,
which is something that a lot

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:01.980
of home cooks don't
think about it.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.720
Most home cooks, I
think, are pretty

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.440
strict recipe followers.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.970
Most of my friends who cook for
me or have people over for

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.430
dinner they follow a recipe
like it's the Bible.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.110
It's like if it says a quarter
teaspoon of paprika and they

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.860
only have an eighth of a
teaspoon, they'll throw

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.880
everything out and start--

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.470
I used to do that
when I started.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.840
If I didn't have exactly what
I needed to make a recipe, I

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.700
wouldn't do it.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.190
And chefs never do that.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.250
Chefs just adapt.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.640
They engage with their food.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.180
And the real key is
understanding the tools

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.240
available to you to make
your food taste great.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.860
And so for me-- and you'll see
this in the first lesson about

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.010
taste as you go--

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:41.600
those tools are fat, and when
I say fat I mean olive oil,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.440
cream, butter.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.720
If you want to enrich a dish,
every chef-- and this won't

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.980
come as a shock to you--

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.330
was generous with fat.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.365
I mean, they would take butter
and pop it into a pan, or they

00:14:52.365 --> 00:14:54.120
would take cream and
pour it all.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.830
And you don't have to do that
at home because you're not

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.460
trying to kill your family, but
just to understand that

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.340
that's a tool available to
you, that that's a way to

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.650
enrich your food to make it
taste a little better.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:09.510
But if you're making eggs and
they're not coming out as

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.390
creamy as you want them and you
add a little more butter

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.190
at the end or you add
some cream to the--

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.920
it's a tool that you can use
to make food taste better.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.980
And then the second tool,
of course, being salt.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.280
Taste as you go is generally
about salt,

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.830
salting your food properly.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.630
But what's really interesting
about chefs if they taste for

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.310
salt at every stage
of cooking.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.890
They're not just tasting it at
the end and adding salt to

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.160
make sure it tastes good.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.390
Michel Richard is a famous
French chef that's in this

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.370
book, and he was making
a mixture that had

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:37.870
raw chicken in it.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.610
That's like the worst thing you
could do in the world is

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.480
to eat raw chicken, but it sort
of showed his mettle as a

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.520
chef that he just sort ate a
spoonful of ground up raw

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.470
chicken to see if it was
salty enough, and

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.960
he added more salt.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.740
But that's what chefs do-- they
taste it at every stage.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.210
And the final thing that a lot
of home cooks don't know about

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:58.420
in terms of tasting as you go
is acid, how to use acid to

00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.450
make your food taste better.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.520
And when I say acid, I mean
vinegar, I mean lemon juice,

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.410
any kind of citrus,
lime juice.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:08.720
Chefs use acidic elements all
the time, and it's such a

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.150
remarkable thing how
much better it'll

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.430
make your food taste.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.720
If you make something as simple
as a chicken breast and

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.090
you roast it in the oven and
you take it out and you

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.210
squeeze a lemon over it, I think
that will enhance it

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.730
immeasurably, because it perks
up-- it makes the taste pop in

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:23.440
your mouth.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.800
And chefs use acid all the
time-- they use balsamic

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.420
vinegar, they use cider vinegar,
they use lemon juice,

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.210
all that kind of stuff.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.630
So I think tasting as you go is
so essential, that that's

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.690
why I talked so long
about it just now.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:40.650
The second essential rule that
I learned cooking with the

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.410
chefs was to put ingredients
on display.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.340
That sounds like
a strange one.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.670
But so many of these homes--

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.160
I got to cook with Alice
Waters in Berkeley.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.100
And when I went into her home,
she had these basketballs of

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.430
beautiful ingredients, like
just really unusual

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.580
ingredients that she'd gotten
from the farmer's market like

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.840
watermelon radishes and things
I'd never even seen before.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.230
There are so many chefs that I
cooked with who literally had

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.970
the exact same thing.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.460
Their kitchens were full of
beautiful ingredients that

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.710
they put on display.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.270
In fact, actually, one of the
chefs that I cooked with,

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.700
Anthony Martin, who's the chef
at TRU in Chicago, had worked

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.410
for Joel Robuchan, who's a
legendary French chef.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.930
And he said Joel Robuchan's
kitchens always had

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:23.150
ingredients displayed in the
kitchen to inspire cooks.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.589
And so when I was in the middle
of writing this book, I

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:27.480
bought a basket--

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.470
I just went to a store and
I bought a basket.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.550
And I put it on my counter and I
made myself go at least once

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.420
a week to a farmer's market.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.130
I made myself buy things that I
had no idea what I was going

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:39.400
to do with them and I would
bring them home and I just put

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.220
them in the basket.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.990
And it was amazing, because
having it on display and just

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.790
seeing it there was a trigger to
get me to use it and to get

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.510
me to cook more often, because
I would come home after

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.490
working all day.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.480
And usually what happens--

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.100
I don't if you guys relate-- is
you get home from work and

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.865
the last thing you want to
do is go food shopping.

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:57.250
It's like you don't want to then
get back into your car

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.140
and drive to the store
go food shopping.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.120
So if you have your ingredients
displayed out

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.740
there and you just have
beautiful things and you have

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.940
a box of pasta and let's say
you have broccoli rabe out

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.126
there, or whatever you buy, and
then you make your pasta

00:18:07.126 --> 00:18:09.265
with a fresh ingredient, you're
much more likely to

00:18:09.265 --> 00:18:11.260
cook if you have ingredients
on display.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.750
And also it's just sort of
the color and the actual

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.680
liveliness of it, just sort of
seeing this beautiful food in

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.900
your kitchen just creates an
environment in your kitchen

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.020
that makes you want
to cook in there.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.670
I think these little
psychological triggers that

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.150
you don't think a lot about
that actually don't seem

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:25.770
important--

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.630
it probably seems like the least
important thing in the

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.930
world to put ingredients on
display-- actually can be the

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.290
difference between ordering
Chinese food

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.280
and actually cooking.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.140
So to me, that was actually
an important one.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.200
The third one is sort
of tied up in that.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.730
If it looks good before you cook
it, it will taste good

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.590
after you cook it.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.360
So many times with the chefs
in this book, they would be

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.950
prepping something that was
not-- it should not have

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.480
looked appetizing at that stage,
but it still looked

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.290
beautiful and made me
want to eat it.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.290
Like Charles Phan, the chef at
The Slanted Door here in San

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.230
Francisco--

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.700
I cooked with him.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.100
And he taught me how make this
steamed chicken dish where it

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.760
was a clay bowl and he put raw
chicken that he cut up into it

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.770
and he put slivered ginger and
garlic and fermented black

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.230
beans and scallions.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.240
And it was raw chicken with all
those things and he was

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.590
about to place it a steamer.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.100
But just looking at it, the
raw chicken with all that

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.740
stuff, I just knew it was going
to taste good, because

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.330
something about the visual of
how that looked-- and I think

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.300
that that's really important for
home cooks to understand.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.060
If you're making something and
it's just not doing it for

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.890
you-- like, if you're making a
dish that sort of looks gray

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:32.390
or brown and all you need to do
is add green herbs or red

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.930
chilies to make the color pop,
that actually will make it

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:35.580
taste better too.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.430
I think the visual ties in
to how things taste.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.480
So if it looks good before you
cook it, it will taste good

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.270
after you cook it.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.520
And it was really true
throughout the book.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.320
And number four is an
interesting one.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.750
It's use your internal timer.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.800
So it was funny, I cooked
with Gary Danko--

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.890
I keep referencing all these
San Francisco chefs.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:56.090
So Gary Danko-- it was funny,
he taught me how to make a

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.670
blueberry crostata.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.020
And he made the dough, he rolled
it out, he put the

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.170
blueberry filling, he folded it
up, and then he put it in

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.660
the oven, and he walked away
to do something else.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.090
And I said, wait, aren't you
going to set a timer?

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.990
And he looked at me like I was
totally crazy-- like, a timer?

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.160
And chefs never set timers.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.420
I never once in writing this
book with over 150 recipes and

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.580
50 chefs did I ever see
a chef set the timer.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.440
And I started to ask myself,
well, why is that?

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.560
And I think it ties into what
I was saying earlier about

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.360
home cooks being slaves to
recipes, that where you feel

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.720
you have to cook it for exactly
50 minutes or bake the

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.710
lasagna for 47 minutes
and 32 seconds.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.410
That's not how cooking works.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.510
And cooks are engaged with
what's happening in the

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.910
kitchen at every stage, and
that includes how long

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.510
something is going
to cook for.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.080
So with the crostata, what
he was looking for--

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.250
it's actually not even
just looking, it's

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.330
listening and smelling.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:50.270
So he smelled it when
it was ready.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.540
And he looked at it,
and it was golden

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.940
brown on the outside.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.710
But what he was looking for--
he was just looking for a

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.730
visual clue as a very
simple thing--

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.030
he was looking to see if
blueberries in the middle of

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.120
the crostata were at a boil,
if the liquid was boiling,

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.410
because there was corn starch
as a thickener in the

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.330
blueberries.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.100
And the corn starch doesn't
dissolve until

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.230
it reaches a boil.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.540
So that's all he was looking for
was for the liquid to be

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.840
boiling at the center, and then
he took it out the oven,

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.000
and it was delicious.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.480
But I think what's important
about using an internal timer

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.310
is to be engaged with food in
your kitchen as you're making

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.000
it, that idea of engagement.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.630
So I think people, when they
follow recipes are sort of

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.340
disengaged.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.370
It's like, I'm going to follow
this rule, I'm going to follow

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.800
this rule, I'm going to follow
this rule, and that will yield

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.630
this result, sort of a
mathematical way of cooking.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.190
And chefs are not like that.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.300
Chefs are totally, absolutely
100% immersed in their kitchen

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.470
and totally aware of everything
that's happening

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.440
all at once and reacting to
it as it's happening.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.100
And similar to that is
number five which is

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.210
to control the heat.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.500
A lot of chefs--

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.810
or a lot of recipes will say to
you, put it on high heat,

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.440
walk away, and come back in 30
minutes, or put it at a simmer

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.720
and walk away and come back.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.350
And again, chefs would
never do that.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:01.000
Chefs are always noodling with
the dial on the stove so that

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.560
if something is boiling too
rapidly, they lower the heat.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.750
If something is at too
low of a simmer,

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.730
they'll raise the heat.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.000
But it's, again, being really
engaged with food as it's

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.510
happening and coming back and
lowering and raising it-- and

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:17.190
so, that whole experience of
being engaged with your food.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:18.870
The heat is kind of funny, too,
though, and this is sort

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.000
of tangential thing, which is
that a lot of people ask me

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.450
what did I learn overall?

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.580
How has my cooking
changed at home?

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.820
And the biggest thing I say is
actually the boldness, that

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.270
I'm much bolder when it
comes to cooking now.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.540
And the story I like to tell
is Susan Feniger, who's the

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.930
chef from Street in Los Angeles
and who's also on Top

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.070
Chef Masters.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.770
You might know her.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.260
She had a show on the Food
Network called Two Hot

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.200
Tamales, which was on
a long time ago.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.955
But when I cooked with her,
she got a pan, she

00:22:44.955 --> 00:22:45.990
put it on the heat--

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.680
she put on high heat--

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.150
and then she started talking
to me, and we were just

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.575
talking and talking and talking
and talking, chatting

00:22:52.575 --> 00:22:53.220
and chatting.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.550
The pan was getting hotter and
hotter and hotter and hotter

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.430
and hotter, and at some point,
she's like, well, this is how

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.260
I make my black peppered
clams.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.660
And she just added all these
clams to this pan that had oil

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.750
and it just burst into flames.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.470
It was like Mount Vesuvius
erupted in flames and she did

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:08.990
not flinch at all.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.475
It as if room had just exploded,
but she was like,

00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:13.540
mhmm, mhmm.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.650
I was like, whoa.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.800
And so actually the way that I
wrote this book that all the

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.740
chefs that when I cooked them,
I took frantic notes.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.330
I was writing things down
at every second.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.330
I was writing, writing,
writing.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.620
What I didn't want to do is I
didn't want the chefs to give

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.590
a recipe and then to photocopy
that recipe into the book,

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.030
because I thought that would
be totally useless

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:30.730
for the home cook.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.170
I wanted to write it
down, what I saw--

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.280
I wanted to write down what I
saw happening in the kitchen,

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.870
and then I wanted to
replicate that.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.560
So my method was to take
notes, write out my own

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.150
recipe, go home, cook it based
on what I saw and what I

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:45.360
wrote, and then if it didn't
come out right, to email the

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.950
chef and say hey,
when I made it I

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:47.970
didn't come out correctly.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.750
So with that recipe, which was
a black pepper clam recipe,

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.970
when I was testing it at home,
I invited my friend Rob over,

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.450
and I was like, I'm going to
make this dish tonight that

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.120
Susan Feniger taught me.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.410
When she made it, she got the
pan really hot and there was

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.000
this big flame ball, but I'm
not going to do that.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.610
I'm a little scared, so I'm just
going to get it pretty

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.320
hot and it will be hot enough,
but it's not going to

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.360
be flame ball hot.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.110
It will just be moderately
hot.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.380
He's like, OK, whatever.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.460
And so I started
heating my pan.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.710
20 seconds went by, and I'm
like it has to get hotter.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.670
And a minute went
by, I was like--

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.050
I just sort of started playing
with, do I want to do it now?

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.260
I was holding the clams
and I had the oil.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.220
I was like, am I going to do
it, am I going to do it?

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.960
And at some point, I was like,
OK, here we go, and

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.410
I threw them in.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.870
And I had the exact
same thing.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.230
It was a flame ball.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.340
And the difference was when
she did it, it was, again,

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.130
like nothing happened.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.440
When I did it, I was shaking.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.620
I poured into a bowl and
I was giving it to Rob.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.240
I was like, here you go.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:34.900
He's like, what's wrong?

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.560
I was like, nothing.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.270
But just that experience
of how chefs are bold,

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.940
they're just bold.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.390
It's like that whole thing of
having scars on your arms and

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.610
knife cuts and burns, it's
like they're just bold.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.780
And so I tie that into that
thing of controlling the heat,

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.220
which is that they get
their pans hot.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.760
They're not scared to get their
pans hot, they're not

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.510
scared of fire, they're
not scared of death.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:01.700
You just have to just be
bold, be a bold cook.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.500
And they're bold at everything
else, too, I should say, too.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.390
Like salt--

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:05.220
there's another story.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.500
I keep going on tangents,
but why not?

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.540
One of the chefs in the book was
Harold Dieterle, who won

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.260
season one of Top Chef, if you
guys watched Top Chef.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.950
He taught me how to make his
creamed corn, which is one of

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.400
his famous dishes at Perilla
in New York.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.900
And so all it is is fresh corn
that cook with cream, you

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.570
blend up half of it, and then
you stir it in with more fresh

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.090
corn, and that's his
creamed corn.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.790
And at the end he said, OK,
Adam, why don't you season it?

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.710
So I took the salt shaker and
I put it on the little

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.816
sprinkle holes and I sprinkled
some salt and I stirred it

00:25:35.816 --> 00:25:37.050
around and I tasted it.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:37.950
And he's like, what
do you think?

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:38.610
I was like, I think it's good.

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:39.510
Why don't you taste it?

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.580
So then he took a spoon and
he tasted and said, mhmm.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.170
And he took the dial and turned
it to the hole at the

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:48.920
top, he turned the salt thing
upside down, and a stream of

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.410
salt went pouring in.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.590
He turned it back up and turned
it around and was like,

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.950
now taste it.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:53.910
I was like, whoa.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.750
It was like the difference
between a

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.320
candle and a firework.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.040
It was explosively flavorful.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.390
And chefs just add tons of salt,
they add tons of butter,

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:05.820
they get their pans
really hot.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.190
They're bold, chefs are bold.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.200
OK, enough tangents.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.590
Number six is use your ears,
which is tied into the whole

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.630
being engaged in the kitchen,
to engage with

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:15.460
food as you make it.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.070
And so one of the chefs, who I
actually just did a dinner

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.920
with here in San Francisco
at Tartine after hours.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.930
Her name is Samin Nosrat
and she's amazing.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:23.830
She's sort of a home cook.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.270
She's done some things in
restaurants in San Francisco.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.100
Anyway, she taught me how to
make her buttermilk marinated

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.200
chicken, where you take a whole
chicken, you marinate it

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.990
in buttermilk, and then
you roast it.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:34.960
So we were in the other room
while the chicken was being

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.360
roasted, and she heard
a loud sizzle.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.010
And she said, the chicken's
talking to me.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.740
I have to go, I'll
be right back.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.410
And she went into the kitchen
and she lowered the

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.730
temperature in the oven.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.850
And I said, so you just heard
that and you knew?

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:48.120
She goes, yeah, it sizzled
so I knew it's too hot.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.610
I had to lower the
temperature.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:53.590
And again, that sort of tied
into not using a timer, being

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.690
engaged, reacting to food
as it's cooking.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.420
That's what chefs do.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.840
Number seven is a pretty good
rule, which is just don't use

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.260
pepper the way that
you use salt.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.370
Salt and pepper are
not always--

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.310
they don't always go together.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:11.530
And in fact, 95% of the time
chefs did not use pepper when

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.450
they seasoned something.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.030
They season it with salt,
and they use all

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.100
different kinds of salt.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.680
They use sea salt, they use
kosher salt, they use

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.800
Himalayan rock salt, they use
all different kinds of salt.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.590
But pepper is only used when
they want to add that very

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.860
specific peppery flavor
to something.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.860
And I think a lot of people
think that they're just going

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.750
to add salt, add pepper, add
salt, add pepper, and that's

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.660
not how chefs do it.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.880
Chefs add pepper only if
they want that flavor.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.670
So that's something
to think about.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.050
Number eight I think
you guys like,

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:40.360
which is use the internet.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.850
A lot of chefs are actually
very humble about the fact

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:44.830
that they don't know everything
and they want to

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.610
learn things, and that if they
don't know something, they're

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.930
not afraid to go on the internet
and look it up.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.690
So Naomi Pomeroy, who's the
chef at Beast in Portland,

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.960
which is an amazing restaurant,
she told me she

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.480
uses the internet all the time
to learn new techniques and to

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:56.910
learn things.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.390
And I think that that's
important, because I think a

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.420
lot of people at home feel like
they have to either be an

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.510
authority when they make food,
they have to know everything.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:08.380
And it's like to open yourself
up and to be open to learning

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.420
and bringing new things
into it what you

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.010
do already is important.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.620
I think a lot of chefs
were open to that.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.330
Number nine--

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.670
I think this is the most
important rule, because I

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.650
think this is the difference
between actually cooking and

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.820
not cooking, which is
clean with fluidity.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.150
So when I started my blog and I
started cooking, I would do

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.570
would probably a lot of you do,
which is I would cook a

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:33.410
dish or I'd make dinner, I would
pile dishes in the sink,

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.000
I would go watch TV, go watch
something on Netflix, go to

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.150
sleep, check my email the
next day, do my work.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.950
And those dishes would sit, and
they would kind of crust

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.840
over and a whole family of
bacteria would grow in it.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.860
Chefs never do that.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.740
Chefs are always cleaning
while they're cooking.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.470
It's a fluid process.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.860
So what they would do, as I've
said, they're sauteing

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.710
something in a pan, they would
pour whatever's in the pan

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.880
into a bowl, they take that pan,
they put it in the sink,

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.610
they run water.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.340
They stir around the bowl, they
put that into another

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.900
pan, they take that bowl,
they put it in the

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:02.820
sink, they run water.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.170
They put it in the oven, they
clean those two bowls.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.170
They wipe down the counter.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:08.270
The thing comes out of the oven,
they pop it onto a cake

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.130
stand, they clean that thing.

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:10.910
And so they're are always
cleaning while they're

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.830
cooking, which makes tons of
sense, because when you're

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.010
done you have a beautiful plated
dish and you have a

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.970
clean kitchen.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.020
It's wonderful and it
makes you cook more.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.560
Because when I have dinner
parties now, I do that.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.400
If I have a dinner party,
I'll make the dessert--

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.770
so I'll make a cake and then
I'll clean all the baking

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.740
stuff that I used to
make the cake.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.530
Then I'll make the next dish
and so when I'm done, when

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.520
people come over to eat
dinner, the kitchen is

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.360
spotless, the food is prepared,
and all I have to

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.890
clean the dishes, the plates,
that people ate off of.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.100
And it makes a huge difference
for people.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.270
I think a lot of people don't
like to do dishes.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:46.440
And if you clean fluidity, if
you clean while you go, you'll

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.490
cook a lot more.

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:52.090
Finally, number 10 is remember
everyone makes mistakes.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.720
There's a funny little anecdote
from the book, which

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.820
is Elizabeth Faulkner, who was
the pastry chef here at

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.910
Citizen Cake in Orson,
although now

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:00.540
she's moved to Brooklyn.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.460
I don't if you guys know that.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.780
I think Citizen Cake closed.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:03.780
Do you guys know if it closed?

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.600
That's so sad.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.810
Anyway, so I was cooking
with her.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.460
And she was teaching me how to
candy bacon for a salad.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.140
So she had the pan on the stove,
she had the bacon, she

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.055
had maple syrup in it, she was
candying it, and her back was

00:30:15.055 --> 00:30:15.610
to the stove.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.030
She was talking to me and I was
asking about her life and

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.910
why she got interested
in cooking.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:23.130
And as we were talking, the pan
burst into flames while

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.032
she was in the middle of an
emotional story, and I was

00:30:25.032 --> 00:30:26.750
like, mhmm, and was watching.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.930
I was like, I'm sorry, is that
pan supposed to be on fire?

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.000
And she's like, oh!

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.600
And so she grabbed the
pan-- and this is

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.400
the important part--

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.110
she put the flames out, she put
it in the sink, she ran

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.160
some water, got another pan, put
it on the stove, put some

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.890
bacon in it, put some maple
syrup in it, turn on the heat.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:44.750
And before I could even blink,
the other pan was clean, the

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:46.710
bacon was candied,
and that was it.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.050
She'd just recovered so quickly
from that mistake that

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.710
it was as if it never
happened.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:54.090
And I think for home cooks--
when a mistake happens for me,

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.750
if I make a mistake in the
kitchen, it's like I need

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.700
weeks of therapy afterwards
to want to cook again.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.590
And I think that seeing how
chefs recover when they screw

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:06.270
up was actually really
important, because you realize

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.770
that it's not about the mistake,
it's about the

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.495
recovery, it's about picking
yourself up and moving on and

00:31:11.495 --> 00:31:13.390
just getting back on your feet
and getting going again.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:17.560
So that's the tenth of my 10
essential rules for learning

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.480
how to cook.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.870
And so I think at this point
if you guys have questions

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:25.820
about this book I'd love to
answer them, or I can keep

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.110
talking more if you'd like.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.844
There's a microphone there,
so don't be shy.

00:31:30.844 --> 00:31:32.990
FEMALE SPEAKER: So as everyone
here knows, we have a lot of

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.550
health problems in America and a
lot of people attribute that

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:37.970
to the lost art of
home cooking.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:39.660
So you had this great experience
when you were in

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.380
school where you cooked for
the first time and had a

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.390
breakthrough moment and
became a serial cook.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.910
How can we get other people to
have that experience and

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.800
really learn to love home
cooking and get that initial

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.640
experience and then
holding onto it?

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.850
ADAM ROBERTS: That's a
really good question.

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.440
Thanks for that.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.020
I think the key is not to think
of cooking as a chore

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.980
and to think of cooking
as a treat.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.330
And I think the way that you do
that is you don't make it

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.370
punishing to start.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:08.510
So if you want to make the most
decadent chocolate cake

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:11.420
in the world or you want to make
doughnuts at home or you

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.310
want to make something really
bad for you but you want to do

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.890
it from scratch, I think it's a
great way to start, because

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:19.350
people don't want to learn how
to cook and learn how to make

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.470
some healthy dietetic dish
that's just sort of sad and

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:23.750
depressing.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:26.010
I actually think that the more
you start by just being

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.370
indulgent and decadent at the
beginning as a cook and just

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.590
making the food that sounds so
delicious you can't even

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:32.460
imagine something tasting
better, so that's it's a

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.680
treat, so that it's something
you really

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.950
look forward to you.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.110
Then you can kind of cut back
and scale back and start

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.370
making food that's more
realistic and healthy.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:41.900
And I think the mistake so many
people make when they

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.650
start cooking at home is that
they punish themselves.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.260
They make food that they don't
get excited about.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.430
I think you have to get excited
about the dish that

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.350
you're making.

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:52.300
That's, to me, the key.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.250
And the other thing, of
course, is just--

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.780
I actually think it's
psychological.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:02.230
I think some people just aren't

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:03.340
into the idea of cooking.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.850
It's like you can't really make
somebody a cook if they

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.880
don't really have
that interest.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.550
My mom doesn't have that
interest at all.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:13.530
I've been doing this for years
and it's not like she's

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.620
reading my blog-- which she
does-- and is inspired

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.700
to cook with it.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.050
She's never going to
want to do it.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:19.740
So unfortunately, I think
some people just

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.750
don't have that interest.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.310
But I do think for those that
do have the interest to just

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.030
kind of be--

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:27.730
just treat yourself
the beginning,

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:28.670
and then scale back.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:29.860
I think that's a good
way to get started.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.540
MALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.960
So you said the hardest part
of writing the book was

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.000
convincing all the 50 chefs
to work with you on this.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.490
How did you actually do that
and were there times when

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.900
people said no, absolutely not
and you were able to convince

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.040
them to do it?

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.290
ADAM ROBERTS: A lot of
it was psychological.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:49.570
Really, to be very honest, it
was like getting names, like

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.000
recognizable names, in the book,
and then calling up a

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.930
chef and saying, hey, I have so
and so and so and so who's

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:56.950
done it, why don't you do it?

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:57.820
It was a little bit like that.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:58.670
It was funny.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:00.770
I'm not going to name names, but
there was a city I went to

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:04.030
for the book where there are
two very famous chefs.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.320
And I called the first chef--

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.460
when I say called the chef, it's
never the chef, it's the

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.639
PR team, it's the people
handling the chef.

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:14.750
And I said the PR team for
this famous chef, hi, I'm

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.880
coming to your city, I'd love
to cook with your chef.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.710
And they were like, sorry,
he's very busy.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.679
No, this is not a project
he'll want to do.

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:22.870
So then I called the other chef
and I was like, I'd like

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:23.620
to cook with you.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.250
I'm coming to your city.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.290
And they said, yeah, we'd
love to do it, so great.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.120
So then I called back the first
team, the first chef,

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.130
and I was like, well, I just
want to let you guys know that

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.080
I'm cooking with this other chef
and this other chef is

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.110
sort of going to represent your
city and I just want to

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:38.610
make sure that's OK, because
your chef is really not to be

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:40.989
in the book and it's going to
look like this other chef is

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:42.050
the star chef of this city.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.360
And they're like, oh, actually,
he does have some

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.690
time in the morning.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.409
It was all the little games.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:50.650
Also on that front, there were
chefs who I scheduled to cook

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:54.989
with who at the very last second
would cancel and it

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:58.250
would really throw us
into a turmoil.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.270
I had a photographer that
took all the snapshot

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:01.350
pictures in the book.

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:02.960
So she would take a day
off work, and I

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.340
would buy the travel.

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.780
It was one chef I'm
thinking about.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.100
We bought train tickets, we were
all ready to go, and then

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.910
they just called and canceled.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:11.020
So there's a lot of that.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.890
It was a lot of dealing with
chefs who changed their mind

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:16.630
of the last minute.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.310
What was great about the book,
though-- the reason I'm so

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:20.000
proud of it and the reason I
actually think it's a great

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.630
book is that all of the chefs
who ended up doing it really

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:26.210
were engaged with it and they
really were excited to teach.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:29.280
It was like a chance for them
to share what they know with

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.770
somebody who really wanted
to learn it.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.980
All the chefs who said no, I'm
glad that they're not in the

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.040
book, because if they had a
hesitation to do the book then

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.500
I wouldn't want to have
them in the book.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.570
So for the most part the
chefs that did the book

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:41.720
were eager to do it.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.020
There are a couple of chefs--

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.580
Naomi Pomeroy at Beast in
Portland was really funny.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.730
You'll see in her chapter,
there's a recipe for her

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.780
lentils, which I called
Lentilpalooza because there's

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.740
so much in it.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.110
And so she was kind of
a little bit guarded.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:57.420
So shed be making these lentils
and I would say, what

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.090
did you just put in there?

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.230
She was like, sun dried
tomatoes, and I'd be writing

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.560
down sun dried tomatoes.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.130
And then she would add
three other things.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.510
I was like, what was that?

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:05.820
And every time I turned
my back she would

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.830
be adding more things.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.630
So it was a little bit like I
had to drag some things out of

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.610
certain chefs.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:12.300
But overall they were
eager to share.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.650
It was really great.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:15.220
Thanks for your question.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.440
So the question is how do you
shop at farmer's markets and

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.430
not get overwhelmed?

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:21.550
I still get overwhelmed,
it's true.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:24.870
I think the key is
to go on a day--

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:28.810
my routine, mostly I'm living in
LA these days, is to go on

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:30.170
Monday to the farmer's market.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:33.180
Monday is important that it's
Monday-- it's not Thursday,

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:36.850
it's not Saturday, it's Monday,
which means that I'm

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:38.670
buying stuff for the week.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.150
Sunday and Monday--

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.510
it changes how you shop.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:44.326
Because I think when I was going
on Friday or going if I

00:36:44.326 --> 00:36:47.440
went on Saturday, it's like I'm
just shopping for a meal,

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.970
so I need to just buy something
for a meal.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:49.510
What am I going to make?

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.020
I don't even know.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.300
I'm so overwhelmed.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.410
Whereas you go on a Monday, you
just grab things and you

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:57.060
don't even have to think about
what you're going to make.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.380
You just have to give yourself
a license to buy stuff,

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.540
because I think that's
the key.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.740
For me, I wouldn't give myself
permission to spend money on

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.610
those heirloom tomatoes because
I wasn't sure how I

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:06.640
was going to use them.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.450
But when I changed my attitude
about it and I was like, no,

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:10.010
I'm just going to buy them, they
look beautiful, I'm going

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:12.310
to bring them home and I
will figure something

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:13.230
out when I get home.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.100
And I think that's the key.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.820
So you just buy--

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.330
a good strategy for me is that
I'll take a $20 bill out of my

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.910
wallet, I'll put in my pocket,
and that's what I'm spending

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:21.770
today at the farmer's market.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:24.590
I'm going to spend $20, and I'll
just walk around and I'll

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:25.830
just buy things.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.565
I take the change, put
it in my pocket, and

00:37:27.565 --> 00:37:28.160
just buy, buy, buy.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.910
Sometimes I just buy fruit.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.140
I don't just buy fruit, but
I'll buy fruit to snack on

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.270
just so I have that
in the house.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:36.130
So that's something to buy at
the farmer's market that will

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:37.340
always taste better
than something

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.480
at the grocery store.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.250
And then other times, though,
I'll try to make myself buy

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.220
something I don't know what
it is or how to use

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.000
it, and I'll learn.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.900
Like, garlic scapes are
a good example.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.280
Garlic scapes are these crazy
looking things that grow on

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.020
top of garlic.

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.680
And so I bought those once.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.800
I had no idea what they were.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.510
I brought them home and
I looked up a recipe.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.270
There's actually one in the book
for garlic scape pesto,

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:59.770
where you just blend it up with
olive oil and some nuts

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:01.470
and you can make a delicious
pasta sauce.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:05.010
So, $20 in your pocket, give
yourself license to just buy

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.290
anything and everything.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:08.920
Bring it home, put it on
display, and then make

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.490
yourself cook from that during
the week and use the internet.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.320
Does that answer
your question?

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.310
OK, good.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.170
MALE SPEAKER: Do you think you
can share on seafood and

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.121
barbecuing?

00:38:19.121 --> 00:38:20.410
ADAM ROBERTS: A specific,
I mean--?

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.840
MALE SPEAKER: Any anecdotes,
stories of chefs--

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.820
kind of that kind
of combination.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.940
Those are the things I'm
very interested in.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.670
ADAM ROBERTS: Seafood is
interesting, because I didn't

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:30.780
cook a lot of seafood before I
wrote this book, because I

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.760
found it difficult-- because
I think seafood, more than

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.720
anything else, matters to
get it really fresh.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.360
And so I would go to the grocery
store near where I

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.090
lived, and it would always
be wrapped in plastic.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.440
I didn't have the energy to go
drive to the really nice fish

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.550
place all the time.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.900
But one of chefs in the book
is Jonathan Waxman, who's a

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.800
chef at Barbuto in
New York, and he

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.070
was on Top Chef masters.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.870
And they called him Obi-Wan,
because he's

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.350
sort of a Zen master.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:57.530
When I was cooking with him, he
had a fishermen that came

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:00.010
in with this giant swordfish.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.320
It looked like that, like a
wheel Parmesan cheese, but it

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.500
was a swordfish.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.910
What was really fascinating
was he

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.680
improvised this fish stew--

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.130
it's in the front
of the book--

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.870
where he sliced big fillet
off the fish,

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:14.620
he cut it into cubes.

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.220
Actually, he had me do all this,
because that was what

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.310
was great about him, is he's a
great teacher, so he had me do

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.140
all the cutting, all
the cooking.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.870
And so into a pot, we cook some
garlic and some fennel

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:27.390
and some onions, then we added
the fish and we added in some

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:31.440
mussels and clams and some white
wine, put the lid on.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.180
And he made it seem so casual,
as if it was just the easiest

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.010
thing in the world.

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.290
The key to it, the key step--

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:40.580
this might be useful-- is just
to just cook it just enough.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.060
Whenever I made seafood before,
I tended to overcook

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:46.060
the seafood, and overcooked
seafood is terrible.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.320
So the key is just to cook it
just enough that it's just

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.610
cooked and you take it out.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:53.440
So I think with fish especially,
what I sort of

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.680
learned is it goes from
translucent to opaque.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.120
So you look at the color and if
you could see through it,

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:58.530
it's not done--

00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.600
so using the color.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.800
So he basically-- we poured that
out into a bowl, and it

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.350
was the most beautiful,
fragrant,

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:05.110
delicious, seafood stew.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.070
And it was really all about
having that wonderful fresh

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:10.790
fish and using it in a really
simple way and cooking it just

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:12.590
the right amount to make
something delicious.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:14.960
So maybe that's helpful
to you, I don't know.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.260
But really, getting the best
fish you can get and cooking

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.500
it just enough is sort
of the best advice I

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.900
can give about seafood.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.690
To me, the thing that makes
the book great or what I'm

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:27.300
proudest of about the book is
really trying to capture these

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.700
people's lives, these chefs'
lives, who they are, and how

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.720
that ties into the food
that they taught me.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.590
And to me the most moving or
probably the most emotional

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:39.250
was Gina DePalma, who's the
pastry chef at Babbo in New

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.430
York, which is Mario Batale's
restaurant.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:43.700
And when I cooked with her, she
was recovering from stage

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.440
four ovarian cancer.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.270
And she was in remission,
and she was

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:48.120
going through all that.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.770
And so her mother had been
making her this lentil soup to

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:57.445
feed her during her recovery,
and that was the soup that she

00:40:57.445 --> 00:41:00.950
ate as got better from cancer.

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:03.440
And so basically that was the
dish that she taught me how to

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.300
make when I was in
her kitchen.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.095
And even though it's a lentil
soup, whenever people ask me

00:41:08.095 --> 00:41:10.220
what my favorite recipe in the
book is and I say lentil soup,

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.970
they kind of give me a look--
like, lentil soup?

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.410
But to me--

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.040
first of all, it's a
delicious recipe.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.175
It has garlic oil that you
drizzle on at the end and it

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:19.910
has sausage and it has
kale, it has lots of

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:20.800
great stuff in it.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.700
But much more importantly,
was the emotional--

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.280
how meaningful this
recipe was to her.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.700
It made it very meaningful
for me.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.290
So it wasn't the pyrotechnics of
a handful of flames, it was

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:36.950
more this really meaningful
recipe that

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:38.220
somebody shared with me.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.170
And the fact that she opened up
her life and story to me--

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.395
that's the dedication at the
front of the book, is to all

00:41:43.395 --> 00:41:46.230
the chefs who let m me into
their kitchens and let me into

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.750
their lives, because that's
what they did.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.450
They really opened their doors
and I got to meet them and

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:53.490
meet their families and really
hear their stories.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:55.292
That's probably how I'd
answer that question.

00:41:55.292 --> 00:41:57.780
MALE SPEAKER: One of the big
differences I've seen between

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:01.050
a lot of restaurant cookbooks
and cookbooks that are more

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:04.610
meant for home cooks is a lot
of the restaurants will make

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:08.430
up large batches of individual
components that are finished

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.930
in some way and then
mix and match them.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:16.790
Have you find any good ways of
adapting that for home use, or

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:20.325
have you tried to go towards
things that don't have as many

00:42:20.325 --> 00:42:20.770
ingredients?

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:22.910
ADAM ROBERTS: Yeah, I'm
more of a one pot guy.

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:24.760
Like when I have people over for
dinner, I love to make a

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.580
braised dish, where you can
cook, like, short ribs or some

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.610
kind of fatty meat for a long
time so it breaks down.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.710
And you just have that pot
simmering on the stove when

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.630
people show up and you can
just spoon it out.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:38.550
Because that other kind of
cooking, which is very

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:40.080
restaurant driven-- and I
think there are a lot of

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:44.390
people at home who like the
challenge of making that kind

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.840
of food, which is why books
like Eleven Madison Park

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:50.740
Cookbook or Alinea cookbook or
the El Bulli cookbook, all

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:54.040
those books do well, because I
think there are fanatics who

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.270
will make all crazy
components.

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:59.580
So one of the chefs in the book
is Curtis Duffy, who is a

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.550
Michelin starred chef.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:02.700
He had restaurant called Avenues
in Chicago and now

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.930
he's opening up a different
restaurant called Grace.

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:07.740
So when I came to cook with him,
he sort of got nervous,

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.270
because he's like, Adam, I have
to tell you, these dishes

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.340
that I make at this restaurant,
you're never going

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.050
to be able to adapt them
for the home cook.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:15.040
I was like, what are
you talking about?

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:15.980
I can adapt anything.

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.220
He was like, this
is my corn soup.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:22.310
And this corn soup has a dome
made with liquid nitrogen

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:26.400
that's made with coconut milk
and burnt corn husk oil that

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.730
you dip on the back of a ladle
and dip into liquid nitrogen

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:30.580
and you put the dome on top of
the corn soup and then you

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.520
shatter the dome
into the soup.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.710
You're never going to
be able to do that.

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:35.640
And I was like, how do
you make the soup?

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:39.210
He's like, the soup is corn that
you blend up and then you

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:43.210
strain it and then you cook it
and you blend it with sugar

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:44.030
and olive oil.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:45.020
I was like, teach me that.

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.940
So he taught me just how to make
the corn soup, and it's

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.800
absolutely the best corn
soup I've ever had

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.640
in my entire life.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.170
So in the book when you
see the corn soup,

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:53.160
it's just corn soup.

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.490
But it's a great corn soup, and
it's a corn soup that you

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:57.520
can make for your family, you
can make for a dinner party,

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.960
and it doesn't ask you to buy
liquid nitrogen, it doesn't

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.330
ask you to make burnt
corn husk oil.

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:06.190
And so those are things that
I'm not interested in.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:09.310
The book is sort of
my point of view--

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:10.770
taking these recipes and
filtering them through my

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:11.540
point of view.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.790
And my point of view is to
cook more crowd pleasing,

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:18.760
comforting sort of realistic
dishes, not the dishes that

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.190
have 30 components on them.

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:21.740
So that's a great question.

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.090
And yeah, it's not my cup of tea
to do that, but I really

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:26.394
admire those who do.

00:44:26.394 --> 00:44:28.010
Thanks.

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:30.000
Well, thank you guys so much
for having me here today.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.670
I really enjoyed
talking to you.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:34.860
And I'll be signing the book
afterward, so go buy a copy

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.110
and thanks again.
