00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 in this capsule we will see the sentry box 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.299
 nearest neighbor we are ready 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.940
 to see our first to scream 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.290
 learning is the deco algorithm 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.420
 closest neighbors we'll see in 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.830
 the context the classification so we're going 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.379
 talk about a york classic at most 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.539
 close neighbor it is probably 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.840
 accept the simplest learning 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.029
 to do the classification and we will 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.619
 describes the idea here so 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.180
 imagine that we have new entries 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.869
 x and we want to try to predict 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.009
 what is his class to associate with it 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.010
 will do is we will find the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.540
 causes in very excited among the examples 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.430
 of learning so the entries in 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.610
 our training center which are the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.010
 closer to the new x entry 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.450
 so we will have to define later 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.430
 what do we mean by close 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.320
 will have to define a notion of distance 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.820
 between examples but for now 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.079
 let's suppose we have young people 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.879
 distance between the examples and that 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.460
 can identify find the causes 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.590
 nearest entries and country 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.410
 exist closest to our 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.260
 new entry x then when one in 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.510
 France and we will vote each 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.460
 each of the x telecom inputs plus 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.450
 close neighbors for their class 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.590
 associated yt and finally the class 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.390
 we are going to return 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.180
 classification that we will do for our 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.710
 x100 input to be to return the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.540
 majority class the class that has 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.509
 garnered the most votes among 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.250
 xt entries that were closest 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.360
 and if we have equalities all that 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.220
 that can be done if they go back and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.100
 randomly a choice among the entries 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.390
 classes with their the most votes 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.479
 ok so the success of this algorithm is going 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.490
 depend on two factors the first 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.570
 what is the amount of data 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.860
 training that we have 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.030
 how big is our ensemble 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.130
 drive so the number 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.250
 example learning sets 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.659
 learning that we have for among 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.170
 which one will find our nearest 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.360
 neighbor and more there will be but we 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.130
 is going to be the gold performance that's it 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.780
 something that is true for all 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.390
 examples all the algorithms 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.540
 learning etc goes among other things so 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.860
 for the nearest neighbor's decorative grid 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.750
 the other factor that will influence success 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.280
 of the gatehouse it's going to be the quality of 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.890
 the distance measure that we will use 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.110
 to identify more pro body 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.660
 3 and specifically we will see a 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.700
 distance measurement that is going to be such that 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.040
 if two entries are similar 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.950
 then belong to the same class 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.940
 yes we do not saw a distance so basis 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.570
 basis of the policy there belong to 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.080
 at the same class 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.260
 we're going to want it to be high it exists 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.240
 a lot of research work on 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.670
 tried to learn good measures 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.140
 from distance but in practice in the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.760
 nearby nearby Coptic grid in 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.500
 this simplest version we are going 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.300
 just use the distance or 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.090
 Christian between intrigues 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.860
 so if we at the input x1 we want to see 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.370
 how far is it from the x2 input 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.370
 we will just make the difference 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.850
 element by element between elements 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.440
 of the x1 vector and the x2 sector we are going 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.230
 take the bus and sums offered the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.580
 sum then we'll do we'll calculate the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.860
 square root so and to get 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.190
 useful distance and noticed again a 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.650
 times dating I use bold 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.970
 savoye correspond to vectors 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.500
 tiny letters by engraving 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.239
 typically correspond to vectors 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.000
 and then it's in Italy that it's going to be 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.530
 rather a scaler ok so that's 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.360
 the deco algorithm more likely let's see 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.880
 example imagine we want to do 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.200
 of character recognition and 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.519
 for simplicity we will do the 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.280
 character knowledge with two 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.910
 characters possible so be that our 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.440
 vote to be one or a beauf he imagine 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.769
 we are the training set 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.430
 next where we have all our examples of the 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.750
 class e 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.560
 so here full of character image 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.750
 manuscripts right now and we all have our 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.180
 examples of the class or here so are there 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.840
 handwritten characters that 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.840
 match dice 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.569
 so if we had a new entry 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.450
 here that would match their bone x that we 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.860
 had in the description previously 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.840
 keep it as closest neighbor for 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.669
 try to predict the class associated with 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.739
 this entry there which would make think 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.419
 that they would find the closest 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.060
 neighbors so we made an example here or 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.650
 what is equal to 3 so we find the 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.350
 three closest neighbors in time 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.550
 seems to drive so among the 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.169
 training examples actually it's getting 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.350
 find that the first neighbor is the one 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.199
 the 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.690
 the second is the third one 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:41.639
 this is the one there is so these are the 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.350
 neighbors because the distance between these 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.900
 pictures there and this picture succeeded that 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.789
 our new hold is the most 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.000
 small so the three smallest among 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:55.720
 all training examples among 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.160
 the waters and the and the detention of 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.990
 rockets the Euclidean distance so we have 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.440
 makes the difference between what this one 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.330
 and prick that one to the curry plus the 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.850
 distance the difference between pixels there 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.700
 and under pixels there and so on 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.840
 we do the sum would include singer 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.130
 so we are even closer neighbor 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.490
 we look at what are the classes 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.800
 associate the three find waters 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.900
 and so the majority vote for number 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.389
 of them it's going to be to say that it 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.010
 belongs to the class at and in this case 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.800
 if indeed we did have Qatar 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.960
 or so we have a good prediction 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.789
 we make no mistake for this new 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:36.520
 entrance there but in our example where the 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.539
 our new x entry is to be 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.610
 a 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.650
 and there it turns out that the three more 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.470
 nearest neighbor nearest neighbor 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.000
 it is well and truly had but both 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.669
 following is to be waters and 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.379
 no no and the sound makes the vote 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.449
 majority in fact what we get 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.560
 it is a prediction of a bone since 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.520
 are two waters which is more than one 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.020
 so when an example here where 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.159
 unfortunately the copy strike 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.819
 close neighbor makes a bad 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.819
 prediction 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.889
 now let's imagine we add two 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.199
 years 200 example per class so at 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.509
 departure we had only saint jean 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.830
 we condemn adds 200 hours so for 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.389
 each class means we have 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:21.789
 found someone who generated 200 th 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:24.849
 handwritten since 200 to writings to 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:27.340
 the hand and then to identify what 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.780
 which handwritten image of a character 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.800
 correspond to which 1 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.080
 correspond to waters 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.759
 ok so get ready one person 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.259
 or it could be a set of 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.370
 people 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.919
 obviously so we have human beings 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.060
 who added two hundred examples 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.130
 by class in our camp 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.150
 drive 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.770
 there we actually notice we are more 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:49.120
 close neighbors they actually changed 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:51.909
 there was who added here so if we 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.580
 make the difference before actually 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:58.000
 Forgiveness is the added xxx so we have 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.169
 found a better first closer 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.699
 neighbour 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.169
 so whoever was the best neighbor 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.900
 wind is made second and then the 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.550
 third is the second high before 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.190
 when we only had 100 examples 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:12.340
 learning by class and thanks to that 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.449
 we have now managed to predict the 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.430
 good class to know 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:17.319
 so that's an illustration of the fact 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.000
 that if we add data 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:20.469
 drive 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.669
 so we add examples long 

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:25.240
 training center is expected to 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:26.860
 that performance improves for 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.930
 examples maybe a little more difficult 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.319
 to be able to do a good 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.319
 prediction 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.680
 now we will make the link with the 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.880
 definitions we saw earlier 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.540
 we saw that mathematically 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.340
 learning is watering that 

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.440
 corresponds to take our center 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.570
 called training is 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.920
 past be a function to who will be 

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.410
 our learning grid 

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:55.700
 so we will take the entrance of evaux 

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:57.320
 predict a function h that is going to be 

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.580
 will call model louis pautex so 

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:03.280
 it's the function that will make 

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.280
 predictions on new entries x 

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:10.670
 and in this case a calf match 

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.620
 so it's going to be a program a 

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.020
 algorithm that will itself produce a 

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:18.440
 program that will be the h function 

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.490
 our model if this model there so what 

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.250
 program there that he will do the 

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.080
 prediction with the decorating procedure more 

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.960
 close neighbors that we described then 

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.540
 we have seen an example previously so 

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:33.320
 h he came out of our mouth to 

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.650
 given our set of what they 

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.810
 want 

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.860
 the operation of this program this 

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:39.110
 h model 

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:42.590
 it's going to be to have the copies voted 

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:45.050
 close neighbors such as find in 

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:48.100
 our set for an entry 

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:50.180
 data and hdx is so the result 

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:53.480
 to run our program when we 

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:57.200
 provides as input our entry our 

00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:00.140
 new entry x the function f in this 

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.930
 case which is the function that generated 

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.600
 our training data 

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:06.890
 if we take the example of the 

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.060
 character recognition does that 

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.830
 would be the human being where beings 

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:13.340
 humans who will have labeled our images 

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.600
 of character and generally the 

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.220
 heals neighboring copies on 

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.550
 can demonstrate that the more our whole 

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:22.970
 workouts and big meyer will be our 

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:25.760
 function h our model as being 

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:28.010
 proclamation of the dre function is so 

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.920
 the real behavior we're trying to 

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:33.140
 mobilize and intuition is that if we 

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.940
 increase the size of the room 

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.280
 Eco drive closer 

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:40.190
 neighbors can not be closer 

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.830
 so more similar to the input x so 

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:45.190
 the input that is given to our model 

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.900
 so is 6 then to give 

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.790
 more entries will be similar on 

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.890
 must then expect that our 

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.330
 prediction by making your majority 

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.850
 among neighboring copies are 

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.060
 better and better if we increase the 

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:59.800
 size of our training center 

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.360
 so that's for the algorithm of 

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.630
 classification with the nearby Copts 

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.630
 neighbors
