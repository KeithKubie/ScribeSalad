00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.850
What you know about Tycho, Brahe?

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.370
Hello brohemians, Julian here for Dnews.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.000
People who have been following this show for
a while know that we like science.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.560
But there would be no science without scientists
and some of them have been truly remarkable

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.560
characters.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.070
Today I’d like to profile a personal favorite
of mine.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.060
A man with a larger-than-life personality
whose work changed how we view the heavens,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.739
and yet you’ve probably never heard of him.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.550
A man named Tycho Brahe.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.649
Brahe lived a remarkable life and is remembered
as one of the early pioneers of astronomy.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.750
He observed the stars in the finest detail
possible before the invention of the telescope

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.699
and invented his own instruments to measure
the movement of celestial bodies, making his

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.920
measurements accurate to as much as one 120th
of a degree when his contemporaries were at

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.999
best within a quarter of a degree.

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:53.879
His accounts of a particular supernova were
so detailed we now call it Tycho’s supernova.

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.010
His observations debunked the idea that the
stars were unchanging, and his later study

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.609
of a comet quashed the notion that planets
were stuck on heavenly spheres.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.320
Brahe dedicated himself to the stars and studied
them every night…

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.890
When he wasn’t partying in more epic fashion
than you could hope to duplicate.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.159
But I’m getting ahead of myself, let’s
start at the beginning.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.220
Born to Danish nobility in 1546, Tycho — or
Tee-Ko — Brahe — or Bra-HEE — was raised

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.930
by his uncle Jørgen Brahe after Jørgen straight
up stole a two year old Tycho.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.149
Jørgen died after saving King Frederick II
of Denmark from drowning, because nothing

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.880
about this family is average.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.439
He left some of his substantial wealth to
his adopted/kidnapped son, who by this point

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.680
was 18 and had developed an interest in the
sciences.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.619
Actually interest probably isn’t a strong
enough word.

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.430
He was so passionate that at the age of 20,
Brahe actually lost a chunk of his nose in

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.619
a duel… over math.

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.659
This was before the peer review process after
all, but even so I don’t think scientists

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.829
typically settled disagreements with swords.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.890
The carved-up Brahe wore a brass nose prostheses
the rest of his life, and he may have had

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.250
gold and silver ones for special parties.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.540
And he would have plenty of occasions to use
them.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.900
Brahe threw parties that were the stuff of
legend.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.140
On a private island.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.250
In his observatory/castle.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.050
At these parties you might meet his court
jester or his prized pet elk — although

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.590
some say it was a moose.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.860
Everybody was probably too drunk to tell,
including the elk/moose, which got drunk on

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.190
beer one night, fell down a flight of stairs,
and died.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.620
Talk about a party animal.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.970
Also please don’t make your animals party.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.840
In the end Brahe’s fondness of drink would
be his undoing too.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.741
After Frederick II’s death Brahe regularly
clashed with the new King of Denmark, eventually

00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:34.290
leaving his island home to party and couch
surf nobility style all over Europe.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.900
He ended up in Prague for his last few years
in the employ of King Rudolph II, before falling

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.760
ill at a party and dying 11 days later at
the age of 54.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.770
One rumor has it that he was poisoned by none
other than the King of Denmark, who was enraged

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.920
that Brahe had an affair with his mother.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.120
Some even believe the story gave Shakespeare
his inspiration for Hamlet.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.530
The truth has less political intrigue, but
is no less epic.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.870
Scientists have exhumed Brahe’s body twice
and in 2012 the University of Rostock, Brahe’s

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.590
alma mater, concluded that there was not enough
mercury in Brahe’s 411 year old beard to

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.320
suggest he was poisoned.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.460
Instead Brahe, seen here as this heap, may
have simply partied too hard.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.530
While at a fancy dinner party, he had a lot
to drink.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.150
He had to relieve himself but didn’t want
to be rude and excuse himself from the table,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.650
so he held it until his bladder burst.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.390
The resulting infection was the end of him,
though his work would live on.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.780
After his death the question of who would
inherit his notes was up in the air, as he

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.580
had married a commoner and his children were
not eligible to receive them.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.340
Eventually the notes were acquired somewhat
dubiously by his former assistant, German

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.080
astronomer Johannes Kepler.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.360
Thanks in part to Brahe’s detailed measurements,
Kepler showed that the planets moved in elliptical

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.920
orbits around the sun and established his
three laws of planetary motion that we still

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.550
teach to this day.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.140
The history of science is chock full of fascinating
people you may have never heard of, like Ada

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.140
Lovelace.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.200
Trace has the story of the first computer
geek here.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.300
Do you have a favorite scientist you’d like
us to profile?

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.100
We want to do a whole series on them.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.560
