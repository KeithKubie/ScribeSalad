00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:01.887
- [Instructor] Let's say
that we wanted to take

00:00:01.887 --> 00:00:05.007
the indefinite integral of X squared

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.257
times three X minus one DX.

00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:11.720
Pause this video and see
if you can evaluate this.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.231
So, you might be saying oh,
what kind of fancy technique

00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:16.383
could I use?

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.679
But you will see sometimes the fanciest

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.079
or maybe the least fancy
but the best technique

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.915
is to just simplify this algebraically.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:25.775
So, in this situation what would happens

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:29.251
if we distribute this X squared?

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:32.285
Well, then we're going
to get a polynomial here

00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:33.640
within the integral,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.719
so this is going to be
equal to the integral

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.886
of X squared times three X

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:40.806
is three X to the third

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.127
and then negative one times
X squared is minus X squared

00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:49.960
and then that times DX

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:54.541
and now this is pretty
straightforward to evaluate.

00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:58.538
This is going to be equal
to the anti-derivative

00:00:58.538 --> 00:01:02.363
of X to the third is X
to the fourth over four

00:01:02.363 --> 00:01:06.781
so this is going to be
three times X to the fourth

00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:09.057
over four, I could write it that way

00:01:09.057 --> 00:01:13.134
or let me just write it
X to the fourth over four

00:01:13.134 --> 00:01:16.023
and then the anti-derivative of X squared

00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:18.136
is X to the third over three,

00:01:18.136 --> 00:01:21.223
so minus X to the third over three

00:01:21.223 --> 00:01:22.472
and this is an indefinite integral,

00:01:22.472 --> 00:01:24.454
there might be a constant there,

00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:27.225
so let me write that down and we're done.

00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:29.024
The big takeaway is you just have to do

00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:32.347
a little bit of distribution to get a form

00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:36.043
where it's easier to
evaluate the anti-derivative.

00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:37.847
Let's do another example.

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.481
Let's say that we want to take

00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:41.954
the indefinite integral of,

00:01:41.954 --> 00:01:43.865
this is gonna be a hairy expression,

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:48.032
so X to the third plus
three X squared minus five,

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.501
all of that over X squared DX.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:55.551
What would this be?

00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:56.432
Pause the video again

00:01:56.432 --> 00:01:59.232
and see if you can figure it out.

00:01:59.232 --> 00:02:01.302
So, once again your brain
might want to try to do

00:02:01.302 --> 00:02:03.577
some fancy tricks or whatever else

00:02:03.577 --> 00:02:06.080
but the main insight here

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.608
is to realize that you could
just simplify it algebraically.

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:11.158
What happens if you just
divide each of these terms

00:02:11.158 --> 00:02:12.348
by X squared?

00:02:12.348 --> 00:02:15.287
Well, then this thing
is going to be equal to,

00:02:15.287 --> 00:02:16.543
that's in parentheses here,

00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:19.364
X to the third divided by X squared

00:02:19.364 --> 00:02:21.358
is just going to be X.

00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:24.109
Three X squared divided by X squared

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.593
is just three

00:02:25.593 --> 00:02:28.768
and then negative five
divided by X squared,

00:02:28.768 --> 00:02:30.761
you could just write that as negative five

00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:33.842
times X to the negative two power.

00:02:33.842 --> 00:02:36.719
And so, once again we just need to use

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.792
the reverse power rule here

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:40.894
to take the anti-derivative.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:41.779
This is going to be,

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:43.206
let's see the anti-derivative of X

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:45.049
is X squared over two,

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.037
X squared over two plus the
anti-derivative of three

00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:51.909
would just be three X.

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.646
The anti-derivative of negative five X

00:02:54.646 --> 00:02:56.157
to the negative two.

00:02:56.157 --> 00:02:58.907
So, we would increment
the exponent by one,

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:01.918
positive one and then
divide by that value.

00:03:01.918 --> 00:03:06.085
So, it would be negative
five X to the negative one,

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.364
we're adding one to the negative one,

00:03:10.364 --> 00:03:13.251
all of that divided by negative one

00:03:13.251 --> 00:03:14.084
which is the same,

00:03:14.084 --> 00:03:15.463
we could write it like that.

00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:17.060
Well, these two would just,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.212
you would have minus

00:03:18.212 --> 00:03:19.937
and then you're dividing by negative one,

00:03:19.937 --> 00:03:21.192
so it's really just going,

00:03:21.192 --> 00:03:23.925
we can rewrite it like this
plus five X to the negative one

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:25.084
and you could take the derivative of this

00:03:25.084 --> 00:03:27.794
to verify that it would
indeed give you that

00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:30.485
and of course we can't forget our plus C,

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:31.482
never forget that

00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:34.425
if you're taking an indefinite integral.

00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:38.077
Alright, let's just do
one more for good measure.

00:03:38.077 --> 00:03:40.468
Let's say we're taking
the indefinite integral

00:03:40.468 --> 00:03:43.635
of the cube root of X to the fifth DX.

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:51.183
Pause the video and see
if you can evaluate this.

00:03:51.183 --> 00:03:52.883
Try to write it a little bit neater.

00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:54.909
X to the fifth DX.

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.449
Pause the video and try to figure it out.

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.080
So, here the realization is well,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.744
if you just rewrite all
this as one exponent,

00:04:01.744 --> 00:04:04.858
so this is equal to
the indefinite integral

00:04:04.858 --> 00:04:07.775
of X to the fifth to the one third,

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.004
I just rewrote the cube root

00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:13.609
as the one third power DX,

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.429
which is the same thing as the integral

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:18.143
of X to the, if I raise
something to a power

00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:19.151
and then raise that to a power

00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:20.906
I can multiply those two exponents,

00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:22.572
that's just exponent properties,

00:04:22.572 --> 00:04:24.542
X to the five thirds DX,

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:27.283
many of you might have just
gone straight to this step

00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:28.325
right over here

00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:29.325
and then once again,

00:04:29.325 --> 00:04:31.997
we just have to use
the reverse power rule.

00:04:31.997 --> 00:04:34.954
This is going to be X to the,

00:04:34.954 --> 00:04:37.539
we increment this five thirds by one

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.637
or we can add three thirds to it,

00:04:39.637 --> 00:04:41.965
so it's X to the eight thirds

00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:43.557
and then we divide by eight thirds

00:04:43.557 --> 00:04:45.122
or multiply by its reciprocal

00:04:45.122 --> 00:04:47.943
so we could just say three eighths

00:04:47.943 --> 00:04:49.751
times X to the eight thirds

00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:52.143
and of course, we have our
plus C and verify this.

00:04:52.143 --> 00:04:53.405
If you use the power rule here

00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:55.048
you'd have eight thirds
times the three eights,

00:04:55.048 --> 00:04:57.060
will just give you a coefficient of one

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.881
and then you decrement this
by three thirds or one,

00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:01.105
you get to five thirds

00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:04.012
which is exactly what we originally had.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:06.647
So, the big takeaway of this video,

00:05:06.647 --> 00:05:10.002
many times the most powerful
integration technique

00:05:10.002 --> 00:05:14.169
is literally just algebraic
simplification first.
