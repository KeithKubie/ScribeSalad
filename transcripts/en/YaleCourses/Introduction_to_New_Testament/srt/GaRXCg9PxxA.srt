1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,180
So King App,
Gar over in the east Syria region,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,240
rights to Jesus saying, I've heard
these great stuff about you. I've got,

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,220
I'm a little sick.
Can you come hear me?

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,490
I'll provide you know the the
people in Jerusalem don't like you.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,240
You'll find a nice peaceful home here.
Jesus wrote back,

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,643
apparently

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,310
bless it,
are you for believing in me?

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,780
Although you have not seen me
for it as written concerning me,

9
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:32,640
that those who have seen
me will not believe me and
that those who have not seen

10
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:35,010
me,
they will believe and be saved.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,000
But concerning what you wrote to me,
namely to come to you.

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,630
It is necessary for me to complete here
all for which I was sent and after the

13
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:48,060
completion to be received
up to him that sent me.

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,460
But when I am received up,

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,050
I shall send one of my disciples to you
to heal your affliction and to impart

16
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:57,450
life to you and your people.

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,140
There you have it.
Okay,

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,900
let her from king ad guarded Jesus
led her to Jesus. Back to King Ahab.

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,310
Guard you believe it

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,010
kind of go like this or like
this. Come on, take a stand,

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,170
go out on a limb,

22
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,000
decide you're just going to do something
wildly crazy and have an opinion.

23
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,640
All right. Do you believe that
those letters are authentic? No.

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,430
Does anybody believe they're authentic?
If so,

25
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:31,810
I've got some land I want to sell you.

26
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:38,130
Nobody believes that the letters from
King Ab Guard to Jesus are authentic

27
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,600
letters and nobody believes that. The
letter from Jesus to add Gar is authentic.

28
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,150
We believe they are a pig.
Graphy remember we did this before.

29
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:54,670
What's the meaning of an anonymity?
Which letters?

30
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,050
Which documents? They me a document in
the new testament that is anonymous.

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,100
Yeah,

32
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,090
the gospels. Exactly. The names and the
gospels were added by later scribes.

33
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,100
They weren't part of the original doctors,

34
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:09,140
so they're not suit on him us because
the gospel of Matthew actually doesn't

35
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:13,610
claim itself to be buying Matthew. It
just is out there. So there are anonymous.

36
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,770
The letter to the Hebrews is anonymous.

37
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,220
It doesn't even claim to be by Paul
or by anybody else that we know of.

38
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,990
It's just a letter
that's there in the text.

39
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,850
I mean the text is just there by itself,

40
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,170
namely a document we've talked
about that is pseudonymous.

41
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Anybody
what

42
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,191
first? Second, Third John.

43
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:38,750
Actually they don't claim to be by John
that that's again anonymous letters.

44
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,450
We will get to them today.
Pseudonym.

45
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,820
Anonymity means it claims to be
by someone who is not by who?

46
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:47,650
We just don't believe it's by.
So the letters of Edgar,

47
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,920
the letter of APP to Jesus.

48
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:51,830
And if Jesus to Ab Gar scholars
call that pseudonymous.

49
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,500
They're written in their names but we
don't believe they actually wrote them.

50
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,740
Now what? Why do you say you don't
believe those letters? Authentic.

51
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,750
I mean obviously the tone of my voice,
I was messing with them.

52
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,130
So that could have tipped you off
and you may think, well you know,

53
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:12,700
I've just never heard that there was an
actual letter of Jesus of Nazareth that

54
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:13,534
survives.

55
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,290
So you would think that you would have
heard about that in the New York Times if

56
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,120
there actually was one that was authentic.

57
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,750
But what else about the letters that
you heard might tip you off that there

58
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:27,730
pseudonomas yes sir.

59
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,150
[inaudible]

60
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,190
exactly. The letters are written in Greek.
So if the letters are written in Greek,

61
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:38,880
well we don't really have any evidence
that Jesus spoke Greek and if he did,

62
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,490
if he did speak Greek,

63
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:44,560
he probably didn't write Greek at the
literary level that those letters are

64
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,121
obviously written.

65
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:48,000
I mean I don't know if you noticed but
there's a certain stylistic next to them

66
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,300
even in the English translation that
sounds like these are written by educated

67
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:55,950
people. They know how to write
a good letter forms. So Jesus,

68
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,990
we don't know anything
about Chemo Ag Gar much,

69
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:01,080
but we can certainly say that most
of us don't believe Jesus had kind of

70
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:03,810
education that he could have
written a great letter like that.

71
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,780
So that's one indication.
Anything else? Yes sir.

72
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,710
Sounds like the gospel of John. It
sounds like the gospel of John. Exactly.

73
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,450
Remember the line that said, some
people have seen me and not believe me,

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,550
but it's just almost like a
quotation from the gospel of John.

75
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,990
So you kind of think this sounds like
something that some Christian scribe would

76
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:27,620
write long after the life of
Jesus and why not? I mean,

77
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,080
if you're a Christian scribe
living in the third century,

78
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,150
some scholars date these letters to
around two 50 year or two 50 or so.

79
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:37,610
It's a guest. But, um, and if you
were to describe living in the,

80
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:42,500
around the year two 50 and to you Jesus
is the son of God. He's divine. You know,

81
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,960
he, he, he's this, he's powerful.
He's a miracle. He's the,

82
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,090
he's the emperor of the cosmos,
the world.

83
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,740
And so you kind of think in your popular
mindset, well, why wouldn't other king,

84
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:54,530
why wouldn't kings who lived during the
time of Jesus have heard about them and

85
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:55,790
know about him?
What he did,

86
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,420
all these miraculous deeds wouldn't
have been world famous. In fact,

87
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:02,450
a lot of modern people have the
same idea. They, they, they,

88
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,840
they're very surprised when they
realize that Jesus, actually,

89
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,140
nobody knew anything about him in
his lifetime. And they said, well,

90
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:11,590
but he did all these miracles
and they're the gospel. Somebody,

91
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,490
these crowds that followed
him in these kinds of things.

92
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,080
Wouldn't that really have made that the
headlines of the time? And you say, well,

93
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,340
there actually were a lot of miracle
workers running around the ancient world.

94
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,370
There are a lot of profits.

95
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:24,080
There were a lot of people
claiming to raise the dead.

96
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,390
It wasn't that unusual thing.
So no,

97
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:28,970
Jesus wasn't famous Jersey
during his own lifetime.

98
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:30,470
But you can imagine how a scribe,

99
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:34,280
a Christian scribe in the middle of the
third century would naturally think that

100
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,800
this person, he worships as
Lord, must've been famous.

101
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,440
And therefore it's entirely
believable that there could have been

102
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:43,730
correspondences between Jesus and,
and kings around the world.

103
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,650
And so these letters get made up as
part of just basic Christian piety.

104
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,240
You know, if the letters didn't exist,
they ought to exist. So we'll write them.

105
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,010
We have other examples of
pseudonymity we have for, um,

106
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,900
letters between Paul and
the philosopher Seneca,

107
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,660
which nobody believes they're authentic.

108
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,050
Nobody believes it's the philosopher
Seneca, who was the aid. If you recall,

109
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:10,190
to the Emperor Nero,

110
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,510
he was an advisor to Nero until he fell
out of favor and neuro kicked him out

111
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,220
and all that sort of thing.
But Seneca,

112
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,520
it was one of the most famous
first century stoic philosophers.

113
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,780
And so there's somebody wrote letters
years later that which Sinica rights to

114
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:27,410
Paul and says, you know, you are
such a great philosopher, Paul.

115
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,390
I wonder if we could get
together and have little coffee.

116
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,260
Klatch and Paul writes back and says,
I'm really busy right now, but you know,

117
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,070
we've got some. So they write letters back
and forth. We have all kinds of things.

118
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,790
Now you have to, there are also,
these are not just Christian letters.

119
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,710
There are a whole bunch of letters written
under the names of very famous cynic

120
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:48,680
philosophers. Now, the
word cynic in this context,

121
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:50,510
it doesn't mean just the adjective,

122
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,220
someone who is cynical and comes from
the Greek word for dog Kunos and certain,

123
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,530
there's a certain philosophical movement,
uh,

124
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:00,560
in the ancient world in which certain men,
and in a few cases,

125
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:04,880
women act tried to teach that you should
live completely according to nature.

126
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,230
So for example, if it's natural to, to
eat and have sex, then you shouldn't.

127
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,490
There's nothing shameful about eating
or having sex even in public. Um,

128
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,490
if it's natural for people to follow
their desires and usually just follow your

129
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:20,240
desires. And so the cynics got called
doggies philosophers by other people,

130
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:24,050
cause they did the kinds of stuff that
humans don't do in public but dogs do in

131
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:28,460
public or are they also got the
nickname for several other reasons.

132
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,870
But somebody in late antiquity decided
that they wanted a series of letters that

133
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:35,630
talk about the philosophy of cynicism.

134
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,250
And so they have letters back and forth
under the names of famous philosophers,

135
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,570
of the cynic movement,

136
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,560
which talk about the morality
of the civic movement or debate,

137
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:47,090
different issues about
the Senate movement.

138
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,490
So there are all kinds
of letters of Plato.

139
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:54,491
We have a big difficulty trying to figure
out are all the letters that exist in

140
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,490
ancient Greek manuscripts that claimed
to be letters of the philosopher Plato.

141
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,530
Are they really by Plato? And almost no
scholar believes. They all are by Plato.

142
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,940
There's uh,
some,

143
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,760
many scholars believe that at least some
of the letters that have been passed

144
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:10,520
down of a tradition, that being
by Plato may really be by Plato,

145
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,720
but certainly not all of them.

146
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,340
So that that phenomenon of
pseudoprogression suit epigraphy,

147
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:18,470
sue typography,
sue topography,

148
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,310
that his writings under
a false name was very,

149
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:26,240
very popular in the ancient world.
And we have all kinds of evidences for it.

150
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,040
But now you have to imagine how would
this work? How would, for example,

151
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,720
um, these letters be produced? Well,

152
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:37,670
I've said Christians might do
it because it's a work of piety.

153
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:40,640
They think that these, these letters
ought to exist. But then you have to say,

154
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:44,330
well, how would they have been published?
Remember, we don't have printing presses,

155
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,430
so you can't just send something off
anonymously or a suit honestly to a

156
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:52,400
publisher and just try to get it
published with the printing press,

157
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,890
everything's done.
One copy by one by hand.

158
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,120
Everything in the ancient world has to
be copied by hand. One letter at a time.

159
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,930
And in fact, they did copy one
letter at a time. This, they, they,

160
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,310
you could tell by reading manuscripts,

161
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,660
they're almost all capital letters and
they're kind of block capital letters and

162
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:11,070
they don't have spaces between words.

163
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:13,890
Most of the time they don't have spaces
all between sentences. And so they,

164
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,040
you can tell these scribes copying
one letter at a time often.

165
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,340
And that's why we get so many mistakes.
And our new testament manuscripts,

166
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:24,480
we have thousands of new
testament manuscripts and
there's not two of them that

167
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:29,130
are alike. Exactly. There's,
we have more mistakes in new,

168
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,740
in the Greek copies of the New Testament.

169
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,250
Then we even have manuscripts of the
Greek copies in the new testament and

170
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:36,600
that's in the thousands.

171
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,380
Nobody knows how many mistakes we have
in the Greek new testament in different

172
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:41,400
manuscripts.
There are so many,

173
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:44,460
nobody's ever named account them and
it'd be almost impossible to count them.

174
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,690
But the reason we have this,

175
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:49,050
because it all had to be done
one letter by one letter,

176
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,560
one PR scribe with one scribe
and that's why you haven't,

177
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:57,190
but you have to imagine then if you want
to publish a letter from King Ad Guard

178
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,030
to Jesus and then a letter from Jesus
back to King Ahab. [inaudible] well,

179
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,350
how do you do it?
Well,

180
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,280
you know you're a scribe so you write up
these letters and then maybe you write

181
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:08,310
up a few copies and send them around
to people or show them that people are,

182
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,180
or you might claim that you found this
in a library of amount monastery where

183
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:16,380
you work or you might just send it to a
book's a book seller and get the books

184
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,520
seller to notice it or you might put
it in a page of another manuscript.

185
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:23,490
Say you're compiling a,
a manuscript,

186
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,840
a book that has the different
gospels and you decide, you know,

187
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:31,050
I'm going to put this on the back fly
leaf of this book that I'm copying,

188
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,090
so sued epigraphic letters
were distributed and recopied
and passed around the

189
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:39,870
world and it's not a Christian phenomenon
is not just a Jewish phenomenon.

190
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,880
Everybody was doing it.
Today we get to the first two letters.

191
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:46,830
We're going to talk about
other Pauline corpus.

192
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,190
Last time we've talked about the
seven undisputed letters of Paul.

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,030
Now we're going to get to the time when
we talk about the disputed letters of

194
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:56,220
Paul.
Remember I've talked about the,

195
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,750
Paul's letters can be divided up into
three camps, the undisputed seven letters,

196
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,480
which are listed. I've only listened
for me, I'm not gonna do it now.

197
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:04,470
They're also in your textbook.

198
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,550
And then there's the letters
that almost all scholars,

199
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:11,280
critical scholars believe are
pseudopod suit epigraphic,

200
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,710
which is first and
second Timothy and Titus.

201
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,600
And then there's the disputed letters
that some scholars will accept as being by

202
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:21,150
Paul and other scholars doubt or by Paul.

203
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,540
And the two that are the most debated
probably now are Colombians and Ephesians

204
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,900
and some people like me say that
they're not written by Paul,

205
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,840
but there's sort of pig suit epigraphic
and some people say they are written by

206
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:37,980
Paul. Yes sir. The churches,

207
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,920
which are the Roman Catholic Church,

208
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,300
the Roman Catholic Church traditionally
would've said there's no such thing as

209
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:49,230
sue topography in the Bible.
But that's changed in the 20th century,

210
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,650
especially with Vatican too,
which happens in the 60s. Uh,

211
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,680
the Roman Catholic Council of Vatican too
said that historical criticism as it's

212
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:03,010
practiced in the 20th century is perfectly
legitimate to practice on the new

213
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:03,970
testament documents.

214
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,120
So you will even find good faithful Roman
Catholic scholars who will also either

215
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,970
accept or reject the Pauline
authorship of this. So, uh,

216
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,590
the Roman Catholic Church has no official
doctrinal position on the authorship

217
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,120
of the different pieces of the Bible.

218
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,990
They may have at one time just
assumed that everything was written.

219
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,190
Everything that says it's written by
Paul was written by Paul. But, uh,

220
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,540
especially since Vatican two,

221
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,260
Roman Catholic scholars are completely
free to make their own decision about

222
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:35,770
this based purely on the kinds
of historical and linguistic, uh,

223
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,950
criteria that Protestant scholars use.
Also,

224
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,530
any other questions for I move
on. Okay. Listen to why do we,

225
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,910
why do I say that Cola
collages in Ephesians were
not written by Paul but by a

226
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:53,860
disciple of Paul later. The main reason
I want to give his writing style,

227
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,400
just like if you turn in a paper to
your teaching fellow and say you're the

228
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:02,470
first paper that you turned
in early in the semester,

229
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,400
a was written in a certain kind of style
and then you turn in the second paper

230
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,490
and it's in a very different style.
Say it has very elaborate sentences.

231
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:12,280
Where's your first paper had started?
Straightforward, simple sentences.

232
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,960
It uses lots of dependent clauses where
with whereas your first paper didn't use

233
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:21,520
so many dependent clauses. Your first
paper used rather simply simple language.

234
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,970
Your second paper uses all this
kind of language and you know, you,

235
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:29,200
you either have all of a sudden gotten a
real, uh, a different kind of education.

236
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,860
Are you went thesaurus crazy
or something so you're,

237
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:34,360
you're teaching fellow might say,

238
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,020
I'm getting suspicious that this letter
doesn't look like it's written by the

239
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:40,510
same person.
We can tell things by writing style.

240
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,280
Now you've read seven letters that we
most almost all scholars believe Paul

241
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:48,190
actually wrote.
Here's the way Colassians starts out.

242
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,660
This is Collagen's one, three through
eight. If that, get your bibles out.

243
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,990
Follow along with me because what is
our motto for the semester's course?

244
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,830
They omnivorous Doobie,
tandem doubt, everything.

245
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,350
And why do you bring your bibles to class?

246
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,310
Because I'll lie to you exactly.

247
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,360
I'm going to read my own translation
of Collagen's one three through eight.

248
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,640
So notice this is a good five verses.

249
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,950
I Read my translation because you will
notice in your translation that the

250
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,160
editors have have broken
up this one sentence.

251
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,170
This is all one sentence in Greek.

252
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,260
The editors had broken it up into several
different sentences because it just

253
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:36,460
doesn't read like an English sentence.
So here's what it is. In Greek,

254
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,970
we give thanks to God the
father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,040
always for you when we pray,

256
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,720
hearing of your faithfulness in Christ
Jesus and the love which you have toward

257
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,920
all the holy ones,

258
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,460
that is the saints because of the hope
laid in store for you in the heavens,

259
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,960
which hope you heard about before in
the word of the truth of the Gospel that

260
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:00,410
came to you just as
also in all the cosmos.

261
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,440
It is bearing fruit and growing just as
also among you from which day you heard

262
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:10,310
and recognized the grace of God in truth,
just as you learned from EPA for us,

263
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,720
our beloved coast slave who is your
trustworthy servant of Christ and who also

264
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:18,650
made clear to us your love in the spirit.
One sentence.

265
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,960
Notice how yours was chopped
up into several other closets
and smaller sentences.

266
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,920
I kept using relative pronouns,
like who did this,

267
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:32,921
which this and using a ing
words participle because
that's what you use and the

268
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:36,470
Greek to string along clause
after clause after clause.

269
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,720
Now if you turn in a sentence like this,

270
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,370
expect to get a c on your paper because
this is not good American English

271
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:48,080
writing style, right? You
recognize that now, didn't
you? Right? Nod your head. Yes,

272
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:51,320
we recognize that's not good English
riding style in Contemporary America,

273
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,040
but it actually was pretty good
writing style in the 19th century.

274
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,210
Sometimes and you eat older English and
they educated writers will often write

275
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:02,810
with these complex sentences with
dependent clause, independent clause,

276
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,000
independent clause,
all nestled together.

277
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,880
That's called periodic style a period.

278
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,670
Is this a looping Greek or Latin sentence
that loops around on itself and then

279
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,540
comes into this nice big hole. Um, now
that was a good writing style in Latin.

280
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,910
It was a good writing style
in ancient classical Greek.

281
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,970
And so this writer is actually
riding in a fine style.

282
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:26,150
There's nothing bad just because our
styles have changed and it's no longer

283
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,730
considered good writing
style in modern English,

284
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,500
but it was good writing
style and in Greek.

285
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:34,070
And you can recognize it when you read
it in the original Greek in a way that

286
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:37,580
you can't recognize it so much when you
read it in your English translation.

287
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,630
Now here's the first sentence,
not the first sentence, but uh,

288
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,480
Ephesians one three through 14.

289
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,610
So Ephesians one three through
14, again, one sentence.

290
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,970
Now if you thought that Collagen's
sentence was long, listen to this one.

291
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,760
Blessed be the God and father of our Lord
Jesus Christ who blessed us with every

292
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:01,220
spiritual blessing in
the heavenlies in Christ,

293
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,180
just as he chose us in him before
the foundation of the cosmos,

294
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,680
that we might be holy and blameless
in his presence and love having fore

295
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:10,640
ordained for us,

296
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:15,140
the sun ship or the adoption through
Jesus Christ for himself according to the

297
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:18,440
pleasure of his will,
for the praise of the glory of His grace,

298
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,450
which he granted us in the one he loves,

299
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:23,270
in whom we have the
washing through his blood,

300
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:27,140
the forgiveness of transgressions
according to the riches of His grace,

301
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,820
which he lavished on us in all wisdom
and prudence making known to us the

302
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:34,070
mystery of his will
according to his pleasure,

303
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:38,120
which he set forth previously in him
until the building up of the fullness of

304
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:41,270
the Times recapitulating
everything in Christ,

305
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,250
things in the heavens
and on the earth in him,

306
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,570
in whom also we have become heirs for
ordained according to the plant or the one

307
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,870
who accomplishes everything according
to the plan of his will so that we might

308
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,470
exist for the praise of his Glory.
We who were the first to hope in Christ,

309
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:59,670
in whom also you hearing the word of
truth, the announcement of your salvation,

310
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,300
and in whom also you believed you were
sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,

311
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:07,290
which is the seal of our inheritance
for the washing of the possession,

312
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,970
for the praise of his glory.
Thank you very much.

313
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,150
Thank you. It sounds like, um,

314
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,970
who the comedian George Carlin,
doesn't it?

315
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,690
It sounds like something George Carlin
would come with come up with and this

316
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:23,610
stringing together all
this stuff together.

317
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,370
That's actually one sentence in Greek.

318
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:30,870
It's 201 words by my last count.
Um,

319
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,660
or incidentally,
when I translate this into English,

320
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,440
it actually comes out to be 250
words in the English translation.

321
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:39,850
So that's a long sentence.
Now the,

322
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,130
that I do all that just to say this is
a good lesson. You should learn Greek.

323
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,240
You should learn Greek because it's
actually fun to fic to read some of these

324
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:55,251
texts in the original language because
the English translations change it enough

325
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:58,920
that you don't get the feel of it. You
can get the feel of it even in English.

326
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:01,140
If you sit there and read those,

327
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,350
that all those verses in first and
the first chapter of Ephesians,

328
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,030
just in your own English translation,

329
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,660
you'll notice you'll get some of that
rhythm because they try to maintain a

330
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:12,870
little bit of that long kind of feeling,
but you can't.

331
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,050
It's only a Greek that you figured
out that this is one sentence.

332
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,830
Now Paul is capable of writing
a complex sentence like that,

333
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,730
but he just doesn't.

334
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,930
You can search all the way through the
seven authentic letters of Paul and you

335
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:32,340
just tell, especially the Ephesians
passage, it just doesn't sound like Paul.

336
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,860
Paul writes fairly
straightforward sentences.

337
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,520
Sometimes they have grammatical problems.
Sometimes he kind of starts and stops.

338
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:40,560
Sometimes it's hard to figure out exactly,

339
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:43,530
you know grammatically how and
syntactically house in his words together,

340
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,040
but Paul's capable of writing
perfectly fine Greek sentences,

341
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,670
but Paul writes his letters almost more
the way you would expect somebody to

342
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:53,130
talk not like this,

343
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,800
which is very elaborate
and its construction. This,

344
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,830
this authors obviously working to make
an elaborate introductory sentence.

345
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,240
That's the first thing that's heard in
this congregation who's hearing this

346
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,290
letter read out loud.

347
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,270
So one of the first things that I would
say is I just don't think these letters

348
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:13,980
are by public because they
don't sound like Paul.

349
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,200
They don't sound like his style.
They're very,

350
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:19,080
very different as far as just the
style of the writing and the Greek.

351
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,940
Other people would say,
well there's also the vocabulary.

352
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:25,140
The vocabulary is quite a bit
different in collages and infusions.

353
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,400
Now there are some proof if you
noticed the collage sentence was long,

354
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,420
but it was not nearly as elaborate
as that Ephesians sentence. Right.

355
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,380
But if you notice they sounded similar
in places they both talk about the

356
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:40,260
heavenlies. It's kind of,
it's the plural for heaven.

357
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,730
So the heavens are the heavenly
places is this Greek word.

358
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,410
They both use that kind of
language as we'll go through.

359
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:50,050
They both [inaudible] look a lot alike,

360
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,090
both in their theology
and in their style and,

361
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,320
and even the structure of the two letters.

362
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,850
So were they written by the same person?
Some people think so.

363
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,020
Uh, some people say they think it's
more likely that Paul May have written

364
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:09,370
Colassians because it at least is not
so different from some of his other

365
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:13,540
letters. And then they'll say, but a
pseudonymous writer wrote Ephesians.

366
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,710
What I think is that collages were
written by one disciple of Paul.

367
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,250
He knew Pauline theology.
I think that he knew Paul CLG pretty well.

368
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's just that it's not
what he ends up teaching.

369
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:28,870
And Collagen's is not exactly
Paul's theology as I'll show today.

370
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,060
I think though that Ephesians was,

371
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:35,590
Kane came along and was written by
somebody else using Collagen's as a model.

372
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,220
And that's why I think if you get a
Fijian, she had this long, long, long,

373
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:43,200
long sentence that is longer than
the similar sentence and collages,

374
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,400
but seems to borrow some from it.

375
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,550
So I think a different
disciple came around knew that,

376
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,080
knew about the literal two collisions,

377
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:55,000
use collagenase is a model and then wrote
the letter to the Ephesians as another

378
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,460
on pseudonymous this letter.
So the way I'm going to teach this,

379
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,400
and this is something that some scholars
want to agree with me about obviously,

380
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,380
but I'm going to take the seven undisputed
letters of Paul as being by Paul

381
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,180
Collagen's. I teach is written by
one disciple of Paul using his, uh,

382
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,050
ideas, but elaborating them differently
and using a very different writing style.

383
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,550
And Ephesians was written by another
disciple of Paul using Colombians and

384
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:22,990
Paul's letters as models.
So what is the issue?

385
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:24,010
Let's start with Collagen's now.

386
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,560
What is the issue in Colombians
first I'll stop there.

387
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:30,790
Any questions or are a outburst
about what we've done so far?

388
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,673
Yes,
sir.

389
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:40,781
Okay.

390
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:44,280
The question is what says that the seven
that I've called the undisputed theirs

391
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,790
are actually Paul and the others are
not Paul. Uh, in other words, you, uh,

392
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,930
basically what it is is that you've got
to have something that you're willing to

393
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:53,830
say is Paul.

394
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,160
If you're ever going to say something
else is not Paul and the undisputed

395
00:22:57,161 --> 00:23:00,790
letters, we just say that's the historical
Paul. There's just, if there's anything.

396
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,200
Now, of course there's a joke in
scholarship that basically says, well,

397
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,220
the seven letters that are the undisputed
is appalled by some called by that by

398
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,410
some scholars.
They weren't really written by Paul.

399
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:15,600
They were written by another
guy named Paul. You know, and

400
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,750
at some point you just have to say,
well,

401
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:24,400
we're going to pause it that there was
a historical Paul and if anything in the

402
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:27,340
Bible was written by that guy that we're
going to assume was a historical Paul,

403
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,340
it's those seven letters. They
have enough of the style, the same.

404
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,860
They cohere well together,
all seven of them.

405
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,670
Now that there are scholars who will
doubt some of those seven also one of more

406
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:38,680
than seven,
but it's sort of like somebody else said,

407
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,710
well I don't believe Romans and Galatians
were by Paul. Then I kind of say,

408
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:46,400
well then they're written by another
apostle who was named Paul and had the

409
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:48,410
exact same ideas and
the same writing style.

410
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:51,380
I mean I at some point you just have
to throw up your hands. But yes,

411
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:54,020
it's a good question.
Basically scholars just start off saying,

412
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,730
if there is a historical Paul,

413
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,360
then what are the letters that look enough
alight to form one body of literature

414
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,370
and those are those seven letters.
Any other questions? Okay,

415
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:07,910
let's look at Colossians now
and go through it and talk
about what's at issue in

416
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:10,310
collections and what does
this letter actually about.

417
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,150
Now I asked you to read
Collagen's before a fusions,

418
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,490
although it comes after in the Canon
Canon because I think Collagen's predates

419
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:23,250
Ephesians and instead of,
I mean you get basically had a choice.

420
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:26,940
These are similar enough in their style
and content that you sort of have to say

421
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,300
either the same person wrote both of them
and that's why they're so much alike.

422
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,580
Or if you say like I did that
different people wrote them,

423
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,140
one of them use the other as a model.

424
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,190
So I argue that Collagen's was first
and use the model by Ephesians because I

425
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:42,090
think it's more collages,
more elaborated in the Ephesians document.

426
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,420
But of course what Collagen's doesn't
come before Ephesians even though I'm

427
00:24:45,421 --> 00:24:48,420
saying it was written before it. And why
does Collagen's come after Ephesians?

428
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:53,160
In the Canon. You should be able
to guess this now if you haven't,

429
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,060
we haven't already talked about it.

430
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:55,470
I think we talked about it
earlier in the semester.

431
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,380
Why does collages come after
Ephesians in the Canon?

432
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,570
Why does first Corinthians
come after Romans in the Canon?

433
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,140
Yeah,

434
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,050
you bet.
I want to make a guess.

435
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,520
How are the letters of Paul arranged
in the Canon by order? Sorry,

436
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,510
somebody said it. Length.
Exactly. That's right.

437
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,900
The longer letters are first
and they get shorter as you go.

438
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:25,220
So collagen's is shorter than Ephesians
and therefore it comes after a fusions

439
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,610
in the Canon, but that's just the
way the cannon got to be formed.

440
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,150
So let's look and see what's going on
here. And for this, what is the issue?

441
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:34,220
Let's look at the collage is two 16

442
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,450
yeah.

443
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:36,841
Therefore,

444
00:25:36,841 --> 00:25:40,740
do not let anyone condemn you in matters
of food and drink or of observing

445
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:45,720
festivals. New Moons are sabbaths. These
are only a shadow of what is to come,

446
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:49,170
but the substance belongs to Christ.
Do not let anyone disqualify you.

447
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:52,860
Insisting on self-abasement and
worship of angels dwelling on visions,

448
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,880
puffed up without cars by a human way
of thinking and not holding fast to the

449
00:25:56,881 --> 00:26:00,330
head from whom the whole body nourished
and held together by its ligaments and

450
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:04,120
sinews grows with the
growth that is from God a.

451
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,350
If with Christ you died to the
elemental spirits of the universe.

452
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:11,220
Remember those were those story chaos
we talked about in Galatians though the

453
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,870
elemental spirits of the universe.

454
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,563
Okay,

455
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,630
you died to the elemental
spirits of the universe.

456
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,420
Why do you live as if you
still belong to the world?

457
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:33,610
Why do you submit to regulations? Do
not handle, do not touch, do not taste,

458
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,630
do not touch. All these regulations
refer to things that parish with use.

459
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,910
They are simply human
commands and teachings.

460
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,820
These have indeed an appearance
of wisdom in self imposed piety,

461
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,370
humility and severe treatment of the body.

462
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,960
But they are of no value in checking
self indulgence. So what's going on here?

463
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,460
This is basically some form of asceticism.
The control of the body.

464
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,990
Asceticism comes from the
Greek word for exercise.

465
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,700
And ascetic is someone
who disciplines the body.

466
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,960
So asceticism refers to usually the
avoidance of something like food or

467
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:17,400
luxurious foods or sex or anything
that has desire. Passion is part of it.

468
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:22,020
So apparently this author's writing
to a community that's been bothered by

469
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:26,400
people who are teaching certain forms of
self control and discipline of the body,

470
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,810
the worship of angels.

471
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:31,320
Now there's a debate about whether this
refers to people worshiping angels or

472
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:34,860
whether it refers to people who think
they're joining with angels in the worship

473
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,694
of God.

474
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,420
I think it must refer to
people who believe they're
worshiping angels and cause

475
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,080
this all this all does linked that
to steroid chaos of the universe.

476
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,200
I think what the author is doing is
something that Paul sort of did too,

477
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,220
which is somehow equate in a sense these
store Kayah of the universe with an

478
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:54,810
angels who try to manipulate
things on the earth and below us.

479
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,033
So I think that there's,

480
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,220
I'll just probably referring to is that
somebody come along and is teaching.

481
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,750
Some churches have Paul Paul's churches
to do some elaborate sort of ascetic

482
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:07,650
practices to gain some kind
of great spiritual status.

483
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,770
Maybe these people are teaching
you live on the earth now,

484
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:14,250
but if you want to fly up through the
different regions of the heavens member,

485
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:17,190
there are several different layers
of heavens and ancient cosmology.

486
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,470
If you want to fly up through
the different layers of heavens,

487
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,520
then you have to stop eating meat.
You have to stop having sex.

488
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,830
You need to enjoy it in this
worship of the angels. Why?

489
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,360
Because angels control there,

490
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,000
the gateways to all these
different layers of heaven.

491
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:35,040
So what's going on is some aspect of
asceticism is being talked to these people

492
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,940
and some of them seem to be getting
into it. What is the answer?

493
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,960
This author gives one 19 four in him
that is in Christ is collages one 19 all

494
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:49,890
the fullness of God was pleased to
dwell and through him God was pleased to

495
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:53,130
reconcile to himself all things,
whether on earth or in heaven,

496
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:58,310
by making peace through the blood of
his cross and look at three one through

497
00:28:58,381 --> 00:28:59,610
four. So, in other words,

498
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:03,840
what's the author says is you don't
need all these ascetic practices.

499
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,300
Because if you are in Christ,

500
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,500
you already possess everything
that the heavens have to offer.

501
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,080
You don't need these extra practices.

502
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,260
So he says in chapter three verse one
if you have been raised with Christ,

503
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,280
oh,
that's interesting.

504
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,350
He's basically attributing
the resurrection already
to these people's current

505
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:28,110
state.
Now maybe he's talking about baptism.

506
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:31,260
Maybe the idea is that in your baptism,
when you go down to the water,

507
00:29:31,261 --> 00:29:34,920
I remember in ancient baptism, they all
dunked him like good baptist these days,

508
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,260
not a little sprinkling and stuff.
They dunked him in the water.

509
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,960
So if you go down in the water,
like you're being buried,

510
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,870
you come up out of water and that's
like you're being raised from the grave.

511
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,140
So he may be talking about
if you've been baptized,

512
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,740
you had been raised with Christ already.
If you've been raised with Christ,

513
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:55,770
seek the things that are above where
Christ is seated at the right hand of God.

514
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,000
Set your minds on things that are above,

515
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,090
not on things that are on
earth for you have died.

516
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,500
He's talking about these people is that
they've already experienced death and

517
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:09,730
your life is hidden with Christ in God.
When Christ who is your life is revealed,

518
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,250
then you also will be
revealed with him in glory.

519
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,900
So this author basically saying,

520
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:18,520
you don't need these different practices
because you already perhaps in your

521
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:22,210
baptism have experienced
death and resurrection.

522
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,540
The only thing these people haven't
experienced that they will experience in

523
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:29,710
heaven according this author is simply
the revelation of their glory. Yeah,

524
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:33,640
they're still leather workers
and waitresses and you know,

525
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,120
working in the query. So it, they
don't look like kings. Right now,

526
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:40,660
their skin doesn't glow,
but when Christ is revealed,

527
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:44,110
then their skin will glow and all
their neighbors will go, oh my God,

528
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,190
I thought you were just a waiter.

529
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,890
Now I see that you're
living in glory in heaven.

530
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,450
So that's the only thing they have.

531
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,610
All all that you would
possess in the heavens.

532
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,360
This author says you already possess.
Now compare this with Paul.

533
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,530
Keep your finger and Colombians
and go back to Romans six

534
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,310
what then are we to say?
And I remember in Romans,

535
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,080
Paul is defending himself against charges
that he has been antinomian. No law,

536
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:21,560
just anything goes, do anything
you want to do. What are we to say?

537
00:31:21,561 --> 00:31:25,940
Should we continue in sin in order
that Grace May abound? By no means.

538
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,820
How can we who died to
sin go on living in it.

539
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:33,530
Do you not know that all of us who have
been baptized into Christ Jesus were

540
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:35,870
baptized into his death?

541
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,160
So Paul is Christians have
also been bad ties into death.

542
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,600
Therefore we have been buried
with him by baptism into death.

543
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,440
So that just as Christ was raised from
the dead by the glory of the father.

544
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,650
So we also have been raised from death.

545
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,583
Huh?

546
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,600
Oh, I like sheep. No, that's not
what it says. I'm lying to you.

547
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,640
That's why I want you
to read along with me.

548
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,210
That's the way most modern
Christians read that passage though.

549
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:10,390
They take the Collagen's
account that has the,

550
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,590
the author kind of acts like they've
been not only buried in baptism but also

551
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:18,591
risen in baptism and they take that
clot and read it back into Roman six but

552
00:32:19,141 --> 00:32:23,100
that's not what Paul says in Romans six
he doesn't say they have been raised yet.

553
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,040
Christians have been buried,
but then he says,

554
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:30,630
so we too might walk in newness of life.

555
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,470
That's not happened yet called Paul.

556
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,060
If we have been United with
him in a death like his,

557
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,610
we will certainly be United
with him in a like his for Paul,

558
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:43,280
the resurrection of Christians
hasn't happened yet.

559
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,660
Christians were Paul or living in this,
in between state,

560
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,140
haven't been bad ties him to death,
but not having been raised yet.

561
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,880
We know that our old self was crucified
with him so that the body of sin might

562
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:59,240
be destroyed and we might no longer be
enslaved to him for whoever has died is

563
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:02,000
freed from sin. So there are
some of these things like that.

564
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,810
But basically for Paul in Baptism,

565
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,380
you participate in the death
and burial Christ, but it's all,

566
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:10,970
you don't yet participant
in the resurrection.

567
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,610
Notice that's quite different
from what you find a Colombians.

568
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:18,611
Colombians pulls the resurrection that
for is still in the future and he puts it

569
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,530
into presence in the present.

570
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,820
This is called by scholars
realized eschatology.

571
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,040
What's eschatology?

572
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,990
Somebody say it.
Sorry.

573
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,650
The end of the world doctrine about
the end of the world document.

574
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:45,040
The last things Eschaton is the
Greek word for the end or the last.

575
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,220
So eschatology is what do you
believe about the last things,

576
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,210
how things are going to end up realized.

577
00:33:52,211 --> 00:33:54,540
Eschatology basically is
the term we scholars good.

578
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:57,160
This is not Paul's term or the
other, uh, any other ancient writer.

579
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,660
The idea that the eschatological
expectations that Paul
expected to happen at

580
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:04,090
the end of this world is,

581
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,970
has already been realized
in the lives of the church.

582
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,970
So what Paul has is not realized as
Catala g because the resurrection and all

583
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:18,160
the benefits that you get from being a
saved by Christ are still in the future.

584
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,920
So let's just call that reserved

585
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,253
eschatology

586
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,530
Torres in Paul's letters,

587
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,400
it's very important for Paul's theology
that the end hasn't happened yet.

588
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,760
The resurrection hasn't happened yet.
The resurrection of Christ has happened.

589
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:39,761
But member Paul says he's just the first
fruits of those who sleep the first

590
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,770
fruit. He's the first apple on the
tree. That's Christ's resurrection.

591
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:48,010
But all the rest of us are just a little
apple blossoms are a little immature

592
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:50,110
apples.
We haven't gotten to maturity yet.

593
00:34:50,111 --> 00:34:53,870
We have to wait until either Jesus comes
back in the pair of Sia or we die and

594
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:55,790
resurrect our resurrected at the end.

595
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,100
So collagen's has a realized eschatology
and Paul has a reserved eschatology,

596
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,330
and this is one of the major theological
difference between the Paul's

597
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:09,560
undisputed letters and Collagen's that
some of us scholars grasp onto to say

598
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:11,750
it's not palling. Now, other
people would say, no, no, no.

599
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,980
Paul just was emphasizing different
things when he wrote collages because the

600
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:16,940
situation was different.

601
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,690
He changed his writing style a bit because
he was writing to a different group

602
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:24,370
and you wanted to have a more elevated
style. He changed his eschatology a bit,

603
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,700
emphasized current enjoyment of these
things because of the different situation.

604
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,570
That's one way to read this. So some
people say either Paul's views changed.

605
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,960
Are apologists, emphasize different
aspects of theology. If you want to say,

606
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:40,620
Paul wrote Collagen's and there
are many scholars who do I say, no,

607
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:44,490
this is good evidence that we're talking
about a different author who has a

608
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:46,960
slightly different theology.
Uh,

609
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:52,010
that would be in some
ways pretty fundamentally
different like Paul was doing

610
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:52,800
though.

611
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,600
Notice how like these these people are
doing what Paul's people in Galatians did

612
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,200
their trip.

613
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,100
They're looking for something else to
add onto the requirements of faith that

614
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:07,101
will somehow guarantee their possession
of the blessings of salvation.

615
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,220
This author though provides a
different answer. Paul's answer.

616
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:15,120
What was Paul's answer to
people in Galatians who
wanted to add on circumcision

617
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:18,720
and kosher? He basically said,
no, you are actually nullifying.

618
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:20,040
The faithfulness of God.

619
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,300
Justification for Paul in
Romans has always been by faith.

620
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,530
Even Abraham was justified by faith,
not by circumcision.

621
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,450
And so Paul makes a big argument saying,
justification has always been by faith,

622
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,540
therefore nothing else
can be added on to it.

623
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,090
And this is part important
for Paul because that Jay,

624
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,060
that's God's faithfulness for Paul.

625
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:45,000
The most important thing is if God
wasn't always justifying people by faith,

626
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:49,560
that would mean God changed his mind
and what God was not faithful to the

627
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:54,330
original covenant to Abraham. So no
for Paul, God justified by faith.

628
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,450
He always has justified by faith
even all the way back to Abraham,

629
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,360
the Collagen's rider doesn't
it a bit differently.

630
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,980
He also talks about faith that's
important to him, but basically he says,

631
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,460
you don't need all these additions
because you already possess them.

632
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,250
You've already experienced
the resurrection of Jesus.

633
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,430
You already sit in the heavenly places
and therefore you don't need these other

634
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:15,840
things.
Now,

635
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:20,841
Ephesians uses [inaudible] as a model
and then just build on it even more.

636
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,190
So let's look over to Ephesians.

637
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,610
Yeah.

638
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,170
And Look at Ephesians one 20

639
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:36,730
God put this power to work in Christ when
he raised him from the dead and seated

640
00:37:36,731 --> 00:37:39,760
him at his right hand
in the heavenly places,

641
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,930
far above all rule and authority and
power and dominion and above every name

642
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:47,170
that is named not only in this
age but also in the age to come.

643
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,400
He has put all things under his feet and
made him the head over all things for

644
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:55,510
the church, which is his body, the
fullness of him who fills all in all.

645
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,500
So Christ is already now
seated in the heavenly places,

646
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,480
which he is for Paul Theology too.

647
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,610
But what's makes it different is
look at two six chapter two verse six

648
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,570
and raised us up with him.
So again,

649
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:13,180
the resurrection is something the
Ephesians rider says they've already

650
00:38:13,181 --> 00:38:17,830
experienced and seated us with him in
the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.

651
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,310
So that in the ages to come he might
show the immeasurable richness,

652
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,730
riches of his grace and kindness
toward us in Christ Jesus.

653
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:30,270
So already now notice verse eight of
Chapter Two for by grace you have been

654
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:36,730
saved through faith. And this is your
own doing. It is the gift of God.

655
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,590
Now that's something that
you might not notice,

656
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,890
but scholars like to pick on little
things like that and most scholars would

657
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:45,490
point out that if you look,
just pause seven undisputed letters.

658
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,480
Salvation is something that
for Paul exists in the future.

659
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,020
Justification is something that
you've experienced in the past.

660
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:56,230
So Paul can say you have been justified,

661
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,630
but Paul almost never acts like
Christians have been saved.

662
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,930
So for example, when someone knocks
on your door and someone says,

663
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,440
have you been saved? You can say, well no,

664
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,120
because the apostle Paul reserves
salvation for the end time.

665
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,360
I've been justified but I haven't
been saved. That's good. Paul.

666
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:21,730
Line theology, the people who
talk about have you been saved?

667
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,030
They're using theology from
Ephesians perhaps or from Colassians,

668
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,030
but it doesn't really fit Paul's
theology for PR per policy.

669
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:30,310
Ology justification is
something you've experienced,

670
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:34,060
but salvation is something you still
have to wait on. For Ephesians though,

671
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,680
salvation is something you have
experienced through faith. Notice it.

672
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:42,370
Ephesians therefore actually looks
like it's using collage as an example.

673
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:44,650
It has some of the same themes,
some of the same styles,

674
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,090
but Ephesians is actually looks even
more like a treatise and not like a real

675
00:39:49,091 --> 00:39:53,440
letter. If you outline Ephesians,
you get the first three chapters,

676
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,560
which are very elaborate
doctrinal teachings about
what Christ has accomplished,

677
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,110
what you, if you're a follower
of Christ, have experienced.

678
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,040
And one of the main focuses of
Ephesians is that gentiles and Jews,

679
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:09,880
the whole world has been joined into
one humanity in the body of Christ.

680
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,140
So the dividing wall of hostility
between Jews and gentiles,

681
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,790
we represent probably the law in this
guy's thinking has been broken down and

682
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,250
all followers of Christ
have experienced this.

683
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,080
But the first three letters do that.

684
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:25,630
And then chapters four
through six in Ephesians,

685
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,710
look more like a section on ethics.
Or as scholars will often say,

686
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,150
para nieces.

687
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,740
This is just a fancy ankus
ization of a Greek word,

688
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,570
which means instruction
or moral instruction. It's
shock when your mom says,

689
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:48,040
do this. Don't do that. Behave yourself.
Don't pick your nose at the table,

690
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,980
you know, say, excuse me, when you burp.

691
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,300
So there's a lot of Christian material
that are seen as sort of do this,

692
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:59,800
don't do that ethics and that's what the
last half of Ephesians looks more like.

693
00:40:59,801 --> 00:41:03,450
So scholars often say Ephesians
looks like a very nice treatise,

694
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,930
a very well organized outline of
Christian doctrine and teaching.

695
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:12,310
The first half of it being doctrine
and the second half of it being ethics,

696
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,870
but now there's, I won't go into
this much, but why do I say that?

697
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:20,170
The fetus was written by a different
author and not simply the same author and

698
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:25,150
there's really just one reason and this
was argued by a young man, Jeremy Holton,

699
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,860
who teaches in the divinity school here
and he did a phd here at Yale several

700
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:34,760
years ago. The Phd was mainly on
foul language in early Christianity.

701
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,650
What counts as cousin,

702
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:42,550
what counts is dirty language and why
both co the Ephesians and Colossians talks

703
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:48,050
about don't use the Turman Greek as
I scroll a Ghia, shameful speech.

704
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,340
Well Jeremy kind of sat there and
thought, well nick, when I was a kid,

705
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:56,840
my mom won't let us say, darn, we were
really strict. You certainly couldn't say,

706
00:41:56,841 --> 00:42:01,790
Dang, that was worse than darn and
dam was worse than any of them.

707
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,890
So don't get caught saying,
damn,

708
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,220
now I've actually caught my mother
saying it a few times lately.

709
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:09,110
But things change.

710
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:15,050
But what makes you know damn
bad for some people in darn.

711
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:19,430
Okay, well these are cultural differences,
right? Why is it that in some cultures,

712
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:20,151
body parts,

713
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:23,930
certain body parts or excrement is
considered a foul word that you're not

714
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:24,950
suppose to say in polite company.

715
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:30,020
Why is it that some cultures have curse
words and some of those curse words are

716
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:31,760
related to sacred things?

717
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,050
Like why in some cultures is considered
bad language and offensive offensive

718
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:39,950
language to say Jesus Christ,
especially when you say Jesus h Christ.

719
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,900
Whereas in other cultures,

720
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,780
calling on the name of a god or a
goddess wouldn't be considered shameful

721
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:48,650
language at all. So Jeremy said, what
these people mean by shameful language.

722
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,990
How do you know shameful language when
you see it in the ancient world and what

723
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:53,660
were they talking about?
So his dissertation is on that.

724
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,950
But one thing he points out is that
although both the writer of Collagen's and

725
00:42:57,951 --> 00:43:00,680
Ephesians tell people not
to use shameful language,

726
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,790
the writer of Colombians actually
tells people in his church to use witty

727
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,370
language. He says, if your
translation, it may say something like,

728
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:09,380
let your speech be seasoned with salt.

729
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:14,330
And Jeremy pointed out that this is
where it ever hurts to Wiki language,

730
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,770
to language of wit.

731
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,720
The writer to the Collegians Ephesians
condemns that kind of language.

732
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,340
So he just noticed that these two
writers are very similar in some ways,

733
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:28,490
but when it comes down to what
counts is shameful speech.

734
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,930
The writer to the Ephesians considered
shameful speech even to include

735
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:37,370
witticisms making jokes that also
was considered shameful speech.

736
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,620
Whereas the rider to the Colombians
doesn't include that in tech.

737
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:45,140
He tells people to use wit
in their language. So that's,

738
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,320
that's just, uh, one of the reasons
before that I kind of thought, well,

739
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:50,370
probably the same person
wrote both these uh,

740
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,660
letters and they were just
different in some ways.

741
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:56,240
But he convinced me that quite probably
they were written by two different,

742
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,081
very similar,

743
00:43:57,081 --> 00:44:02,081
but two different followers of Jesus
with the collage as being the earlier

744
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:06,740
letter and the Ephesians writer using
collage as a model and then capitalizing

745
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:10,880
on. Another interesting thing is we don't
really know whether the letter to the

746
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,650
Ephesians was written to the Ephesians.

747
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,980
There's an interesting problem
in the Greek manuscripts.

748
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,550
A lot of Greek manuscripts
don't have to the Ephesians.

749
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,860
Some of them have
another place name there,

750
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,450
and some of them seem
to have just a blank.

751
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:29,140
This has led some scholars to say maybe
Ephesians was written as a circular

752
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:30,980
letter. In fact, some
people have even said,

753
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,100
maybe Ephesians was written
when a collection of Paul's
letters we've made and

754
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:37,620
some scriber editor decided,
well,

755
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:41,130
I'm going to write an introductory
letter that will be kind of encapsulate

756
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:45,150
Paul's Gospel and Paul's message, and
I'm gonna do it in a very elevated style,

757
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,680
and we'll put that at the beginning
of the collection to sort of be a,

758
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,780
an introductory letter for all
the collection of Paul's letters.

759
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,170
But one of the things is we think that
Ephesians may have been a circular letter

760
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:58,980
because of this idea that not all the
Greek manuscripts have Ephesians and some

761
00:44:58,981 --> 00:44:59,670
have other things.

762
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:02,790
So the idea is that the guy may have
written a letter with the idea that you

763
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:07,110
would leave to the blank and then
fill it in with different place names

764
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,810
according to where you're going to send
the letter or that you would send it one

765
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:11,180
place and then they can
fill in another lang,

766
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,050
let name and send it to other places.

767
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:17,880
So Ephesians by in many of our reckoning
is may have been written as a circular

768
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,210
letter intended to be circulated
around different churches,

769
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,350
maybe even as sort of an introductory
letter to a collection of Paul's other

770
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:28,680
letters. What though are the
other developments, and here's,

771
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:30,480
I'm going to close with
just a few minutes here.

772
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,470
What makes these letters different
from Pauline Christianity?

773
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:38,730
And there are a few things. Number
one, I sought collage in Ephesians.

774
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:42,540
Both have realized eschatology.
Paul has reserved as [inaudible].

775
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,610
In other words,
for Paul,

776
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,850
all the enjoyments that Christians
would have experienced are still in the

777
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:49,650
future.
It's like for Paul,

778
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,080
the blessings of the eschatology.
Eschatology is still horizontal.

779
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,120
We're here, we're going there,
we're on earth, will be in heaven.

780
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,190
We've experienced death.

781
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:05,490
We will experience resurrection
for a theme than Collagen's.

782
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,040
They've taken this axis
and turn it like this,

783
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:14,040
so that the things that there's the
cosmos and there's the heavenlies,

784
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,720
but they all still exist right now.

785
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,300
So the rest of the world
is down here on earth.

786
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,130
But followers of Jesus had been translated
already right now into the heavenly

787
00:46:23,131 --> 00:46:25,140
places and they already
enjoy these benefits.

788
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,810
So it's almost as if the
eschatological timeline,

789
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:31,860
the axis in Paul's letters have been
just flipped up like this and collages in

790
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:34,140
Ephesians.
So that's one major difference.

791
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,920
Another major difference is colossus
in Ephesians have a slightly higher

792
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:42,190
Christology. The collages
writer, very famous,

793
00:46:42,191 --> 00:46:46,650
he says in Christ, the entire
fullness of God was pleased to dwell.

794
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:50,730
Paul never says anything quite like that.
In fact,

795
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:55,731
Paul's letters are kind of problematic
from a good Orthodox theological point of

796
00:46:55,741 --> 00:47:00,741
view because Paul seems to assume what
we would later call a subordinationism

797
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,440
Christology. Subordination,
his Christology,

798
00:47:04,441 --> 00:47:08,280
which was declared heretical by the
time you get to the creeds in the fourth

799
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:13,281
century says that Jesus is another person
separate from God the father and Jesus

800
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:19,200
is inferior to God the father.
So Jesus is subordinate to God the father.

801
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,330
And there are several
passages in Paul's letters.

802
00:47:21,331 --> 00:47:24,480
One of them in First Corinthians 15 that
we've talked about in red in this class

803
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:28,680
already, where policy seems to still
believe that God, the father is here,

804
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:29,710
Christ is here.

805
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,130
I know it was his first Corinthians 11
where Paul Paul talks about man is the

806
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:37,540
head of woman. Christ is the head of
man and God is the head of Christ.

807
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,650
Well, that's a hierarchy.
God Christ, man, woman.

808
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,120
So Paul seems to hold
what we would call us up.

809
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,830
Almost a subordination
is form of Christology,

810
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,930
whereas the collage and in Ephesians
tend to have Christ as more fully God.

811
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,230
Then another the changes,
and I won't go into this too much,

812
00:47:56,231 --> 00:47:57,790
but if you look at the household codes,

813
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,580
we'll get to this later when we talk
about Christianity and the family

814
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:07,560
in collage in f Collagen's
three 18 through 41 and
Ephesians five 21 through six

815
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:13,151
nine you have an elaborate set of
rules for the head of the household,

816
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,480
the wife, the children, the slaves,

817
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,770
everybody has their job to do in collages.
In Ephesians,

818
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,640
there is clearly a patriarchal
household structure that's hierarchical.

819
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:29,230
The wives and the children submit to
the husband, the father, the slave,

820
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:30,220
submit to the master.

821
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:34,920
This is much more hierarchical impro
household than what you get empowered

822
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,070
authentic letters. Paul is perfectly
willing to kind of be have women and men,

823
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,360
husbands, wives, more mutual,

824
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:44,230
which he says in First Corinthians seven
the husband controls the wife's body,

825
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,420
but the wife also controls
the husband's body.

826
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,500
They beat you have authority over each
other's body. That's not the way it is.

827
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:53,290
And collages in Ephesians where
it's much more hierarchical,

828
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,980
much more patriarchal.
So there are some kinds of differences,

829
00:48:56,981 --> 00:49:00,100
but what does it say about
Paul already by these letters?

830
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,160
Then by these pseudonymous letters we
have Paul being thought of now as a figure

831
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:10,411
in the past whose reputation can not be
built on to advance a slightly different

832
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:14,650
version of the Christian
Gospel and Christian message.

833
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,030
Then you got in Paul's letters,

834
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:21,210
Paul is already starting to recede into
the past now and it will as we'll see as

835
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:22,990
the semester goes on,

836
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:28,000
we'll read other texts that have Paul
even further in the past and then he can

837
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:32,800
be drawn on to justify or promote
another form of early Christianity.

838
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:34,960
Any questions about that?

839
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:41,490
Next time what we'll do is we'll look
at the letter of James in which we have

840
00:49:42,971 --> 00:49:47,800
someone who may indeed be actually
opposing Paul's Gospel and Paul's message

841
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,620
rather than just building on it.
See you next time.
