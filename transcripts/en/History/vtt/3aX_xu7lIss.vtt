00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.030
- You're always riding in style,
man.

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.730
BOBBY GREEN: Thanks.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.800
Although, I don't know.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.230
I've thought about
selling this, because--

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.900
- Really?
- --I have too many projects.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.370
You're going to sell this?

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.330
I might.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.470
I might.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.270
What's the I might price?

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.100
Um, I've got--

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.230
I mean, I've got a lot into it.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.300
MIKE WOLF: I bet.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.600
You know, um, but
I'd to get $40 for it.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.330
$40K.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.570
Yeah.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.230
Just because it's got
all the bells and whistles.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.730
It's turnkey, ready to go.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.330
MIKE WOLF: Throwing that
truck in front of me

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.400
is like throwing a piece
of meat in front of a dog.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.270
BOBBY GREEN: Look at that.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.230
Yeah.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.370
MIKE WOLF: That is smoking.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.870
We're hanging out with
my buddy, Bobby Green.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.230
He just showed us one
of the baddest looking

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.130
Ford trucks I've ever seen.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.370
Look at that, Frank.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.530
BOBBY GREEN: Oh, the
interior is my favorite part.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.570
FRANK FRITZ: Oh, yeah.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.700
BOBBY GREEN: It's
all vintage leather.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.630
And it even has a brand
in it, like the boss.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.330
MIKE WOLF: So you have,
Frank-- the hide's branded.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.130
FRANK FRITZ: I know.
I see that.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.300
I like the way it's stitched.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.470
BOBBY GREEN: And
it smells so good.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.300
It smells like--

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.570
Smells good.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.730
It's got the '54
Dodge baby hemi,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.830
the Chevy 12 bolt rear-end.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.230
The paint's got the right
amount of stank on it.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.700
The leather inside is amazing.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.430
This build is exactly
what I would do.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.600
- So you like this truck?
- Yeah.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.800
I love the truck.
- Oh.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.470
$40K, I mean--

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.770
believe me, I'm not
discounting that at all.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.170
I've been there.
I've built stuff.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.870
It's like--

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.170
FRANK FRITZ: It costs.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.600
--I know every inch of this
is-- it's perfection, man.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.430
Yeah.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.900
Well, I owe you $30.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.270
And I'd rather not pay you.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.930
Right.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.130
So you're talking--

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.770
We could do a trade
on the bike if you want.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.330
Then I owe you $10K.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.700
- Yeah.
- Man.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.270
I don't know.
Let me think about that.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.730
Yeah, don't think
too hard about it.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.200
You should drive it, because
you'll either love it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.200
or you'll hate it.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.270
- Can we hop in and drive it?
- Yeah.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.100
You can drive it.
Sure.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.430
Go around back a few times.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.900
All right.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.870
[music playing]

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.730
MIKE WOLF: Woo Yeah.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.530
You can tell it's got
some horses underneath.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.970
FRANK FRITZ: He said
take it around the block

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.230
a couple times on the--

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.430
MIKE WOLF: He didn't say
take it around the block.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.470
FRANK FRITZ: I thought he did.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.300
MIKE WOLF: He said
take it for a drive.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.600
This truck is built to drive.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.670
It's not built to
hot rod around town.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.600
It doesn't have a great
big huge motor in it.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.700
We get out on the
interstate, no problem

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.630
keeping up with traffic.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.000
[bang]

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.870
- Gah.
- Oh.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.570
Whoa.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.800
That was a biggie.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.200
MIKE WOLF: Break us in half.
You like it?

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.630
I was kind of
counting on that $30--

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.100
- It's got of a--
- $30 grand.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.400
[horn]

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.070
BOBBY GREEN: What, did
you guys drive to Vermont?

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.500
MIKE WOLF: We had
to shake it down.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.430
I know that everything
on this truck

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.970
has been done the way
it should be done.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.830
So you're at-- you're
at $10 more on that.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.370
If I give $10 more on
that, then we're good.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.330
Yeah.
I would have to.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.600
And that's really less than
probably what I have into it.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.070
The way I'm kind
of looking at it is--

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.330
FRANK FRITZ: Plus,
we have to ship it.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.100
He's style cramping me,
telling me how much money

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.200
I'm going to spend in shipping.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200
FRANK FRITZ: No he's
just trying to-- he's

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.770
trying to put in perspective.
- Yeah.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.030
Yeah.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.300
The last time I had a
vehicle shipped from the coast,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.900
I had it shipped from Oregon.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.830
It was $1,700.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.630
- Yeah, that's actually good.
- Is it?

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.400
Yeah.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.100
Usually it's about $2,200.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.830
So you think it's $2,200
to ship that from here?

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.330
- It could be.
- To like say Nashville?

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.530
- Why don't you drive it home?
- That's an in--

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.600
- Drive it home?
- Drive it home.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.200
- You think it would make it.
- Yeah.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.230
FRANK FRITZ: A lot
of guys are into--

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.000
MIKE WOLF: What do
you think, Frankie?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.800
What did you think of it?

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.730
I thought it a great truck.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.470
I know you can't
build it for $40.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.400
BOBBY GREEN: No.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.100
I mean, you know,
I mean, it's--

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.300
I really built that track just
as a keeper for life, you know.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.970
Build it as good as I can
and make it super reliable.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.270
I mean, look.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.070
I have never-- I have not
put the truck on the market.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.070
I haven't even
thought about selling

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.870
it until just a few days ago.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.800
So I don't know.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800
Life's all about timing.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.000
Yeah.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.030
MIKE WOLF: In a business
that's driven by passion,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.500
and if that passion goes away,
then my business goes away.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.130
It's a nice truck.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.330
FRANK FRITZ: It's nice.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.700
MIKE WOLF: I can't believe
you're going to sell it.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.400
BOBBY GREEN: Tomorrow
I might change my mind.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.200
I might not want to sell it.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.500
MIKE WOLF: Is it a good decision
to trade the Indian four

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.930
cylinder that I was
going to make $30K on

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.730
and then owe him
$10 for the truck?

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.930
It is right now.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.970
You going to do it?

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.900
Doing it.
I'm doing it.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.030
- All right.
- Woo.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.300
- You got yourself a good truck.
- I'm doing it.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.430
Oh, my gosh.
I'm doing it.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.900
MIKE WOLF: Aah.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.430
On this deal, all I'm
doing is moving money.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.800
All of these things,
we're caretakers

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.800
of for a short amount of time.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.470
Right now, it's my turn.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.730
Woo.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.570
BOBBY GREEN: The truck
leaving is going to be tough.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.300
I'm probably going to get
hit with regret tomorrow.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.930
But I think what
I'll do is I'll just

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.870
sit on this motorcycle
for a couple of hours

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.870
and then I'll forget about it.
