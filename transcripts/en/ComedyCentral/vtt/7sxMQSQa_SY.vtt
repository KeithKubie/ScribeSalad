00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:03.636
(upbeat music)

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.374
(rewind sound)

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.876
(wind chimes)

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:12.612
(man throws up)

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:14.214 align:start size:94% position:6%
- (Screams) aah!
- God, are you kidding me?

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.415
- Ew!

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:16.750
- You know, we love the
movie Sliding Doors.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.618
I mean, that's a
90s movie, right?

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:20.520
Like the wind chimes,
it's just so cheesy.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.788
- Cheesy as hell, dog.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.023 align:start size:81% position:19%
So cheesy.
- But it's such an

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.125 align:start size:84% position:16%
interesting thing,
it's about the idea of

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.595 align:start size:97% position:3%
what if a little teeny
thing happened in your life

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.564 align:start size:97% position:3%
that could completely change
the course of your life.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:32.899
- I'm Abbi.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.200
- I'm Ilana.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.336
- We originally wrote a
version of this episode

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:37.670
in season one.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.939
- Because we didn't know
that we were definitely

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.642
gonna get a second
season, no less four,

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.010 align:start size:84% position:16%
and so we were like,
we wanna make it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.879
feel like a series finale.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.448
- Amy Poehler, who
is an EP on the show,

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.884
felt very strongly that
it was too soon. (laughs)

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.385
- We were pissed!

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.422 align:start size:97% position:3%
- 'Cause when you watch a
show, you have to be invested

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.458 align:start size:88% position:13%
in the characters to
care about how they met.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.759
And it would've been so--

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:01.694
- But she was right,
it was really really

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.797
good to push it.
- It was too soon.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.098
(scissors snipping noise)

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:06.032
- Ha ha!

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:07.300
- What, no!

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.134
Oh my God.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:08.968
- What happened?

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.203
- He took my pony!

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.038
- That wig is unbelievable.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:13.907
It felt like a wig to me.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.608 align:start size:97% position:3%
But people didn't--
- But it looked like her hair.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.043
- I had to walk around all day

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.244 align:start size:97% position:3%
in that wig on lunch--
- Everybody was Instagramming

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.212
you being like, you
got bangs again?

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:20.613 align:start size:72% position:28%
- I know.
- New bangs!

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.215
- The clothes were disgusting.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.883
- We wanted to capture like
how you don't know how to

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:26.553 align:start size:97% position:3%
dress your body in your
early twenties or whatever.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:28.888 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I was always like
belting stuff like that.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.858
- Belting, and your
flats were horrible.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:34.160
- It's just exactly how
I dressed at that time.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.361
- What was my shoes?

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:36.830
Oh my God, my shoes.
- Yours was disgusting,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.665 align:start size:88% position:13%
even though I had them.
- Huaraches?

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.767
Me too! I had them too.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.068
- I think they had
them like last year,

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:43.236 align:start size:84% position:16%
still I wasn't
really wearing them

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.304
they were just in my closet.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:45.138
- Go go go go!

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:45.972
(glass breaks)

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.006
(siren wailing)

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:47.707
- Oh my God!
- Go, go go!

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:48.508
The pizza!

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:49.342
- Leave it!

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:50.176
(siren wailing)

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.010
(horn honking)

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.179
(crash sound)

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.914
- At one point when
we were rewriting it,

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:57.183
we were like, what
are we even saying?

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.119 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know, in Sliding
Doors it's like,

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.987 align:start size:94% position:6%
if you see the truth
it's better, but you die?

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.622 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What are we even saying?
- I forget how the movie ends.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:03.823
- I love that though.
- But we were like,

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:04.924
we're friends either way.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.192
- A new friend.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:12.165 align:start size:97% position:3%
- The version where we're
apart, it is an upsetting day,

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.434
for both of us, it's like
what are their lives like

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.935
without each other?

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.270
- Yeah, their lives would
suck without each other.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.706 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We added some stuff.
- Yeah.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.208
- Hey.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.210
- What we were trying to
say is that inevitably

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.513 align:start size:97% position:3%
these two would've found each
other and become friends.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.648
- Some people you're
just destined to meet

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:29.883
and fall in love with.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.552
(both laughing)

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:37.257
(upbeat music)
