00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, object B did move further, but from the information we gave you,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we actually can't tell which one moved faster.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If it took object B 10 years to move over here and object A only took 10 seconds to move over here,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
well, clearly object A must have been moving quite a bit faster than object B.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So this notion of the years, seconds seems to be playing into motion a lot.

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We should change our definition. Let's call it changing position over time.
