00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.220
Did you know that you are made of trillions of cells

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.720
but only around 200 different types?

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.420
For example, the cells inside your cheek

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.240
are made up of stratified

00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:10.885
squamous

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:12.815
epithelium cells

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.120
designed to handle constant abrasion.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.020
These type of cells are not only in your cheeks, but also in your vagina and

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.320
anus as well.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.080
Hey guys, I'm Christine Sydelko and I'm here with ASAP Science and we're talking about why your body is amazing

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.140
and mine is amazinger.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.060
When you are an embryo, the first opening that developed was

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.885
your anus.

00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:35.225
That's right, you were once just a butthole.

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:37.600
That means you are a Deuterostome

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.400
and so is a sea urchin.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.440
Christine how much gas do you think exist in your anus in one day

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.280
Science says that today about half a liter of gas exist in your anus

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.960
and I say that too, I just said it

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.620
 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.660
 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.520
If it feels like too much, don't worry as your brain already

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.615
does a pretty good job of censoring content. Like your nose

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.455
Your nose is

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.700
 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.720
The region that is blocked by the one eye is visible

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:08.380
for the other eye, and the brain constructs a

00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:11.085
unified image and therefore you ignore your nose

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:14.065
but your nose is so powerful. In fact

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:17.065
if you convert your nose receptor neurones into binary code

00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:19.945
it's the equivalent of 46 petabytes

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:21.805
that's more information than every movie

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:24.735
ever made after 2017. Convert all the cells in

00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:27.155
your body and will add up to

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:29.855
91.44 zettabytes

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:32.785
or 10^21 bytes. Scientist hypothesized that during

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:35.145
pregnancy you gave some cells to your mum

00:01:35.935 --> 00:01:37.595
I just gave gratitude

00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:41.315
This process is called Fetal Maternal...

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.295
Microchimerism. I think I

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.320
I got it. This process is called Fetal Maternal Micro...

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.295
micro...michimisism

00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:52.825
Microchimerism. Microsoft

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:56.175
Scientists has found fetal cells and various maternal tissues

00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:58.985
that can persist for decades. The reason for this is unclear

00:01:59.235 --> 00:02:01.875
but one hypothesis is that the baby is trying to increase

00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:04.935
its chance of survival. When your heart stops, your brain actually

00:02:04.935 --> 00:02:07.635
knows that you're dead. A study that investigated

00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:10.535
 

00:02:10.535 --> 00:02:13.405
