00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.240
&gt;&gt; Have you ever wanted to improve your community?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.400
Or help your local government become more
connected?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.069
With the power of the Google places API you
can.

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:19.190
&gt;&gt; PARSONS: Hi, I'm Ed Parsons, Google Geospatial
Technologist.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.170
And I'm pleased to announce the Google Places
API developed challenge.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.670
We're encouraging developers around the world
to use the power of the Places API combined

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.800
with municipal data set to create the next
generation of cool and critical applications

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.510
that will address some of the challenges faced
by our communities.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.839
&gt;&gt; We're inviting developers, designer, and
other tech savvy individuals, to enter our

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.850
Google Places API developer challenge.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.239
And build an app to make something better.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.909
&gt;&gt; NATH: For cities like San Francisco, the
Google Places API challenge is a tremendous

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.110
opportunity to work with talented developers.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.649
Those community assets can be things like
shelters, they can be places like where the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.060
nearest post office is or places where there's
wreck centers, parks.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.320
Using Google Places API is a great way to
really use the power of the web to extend

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.970
the assets that we have to our--to our community.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.550
&gt;&gt; STERNE: We're always looking for new ways
that developers can use data and integrate

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.110
with platforms and API such as Google Places
API to help people get more out of New York

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.110
City.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.840
And this could be anything from finding the
location of Green Market and Farmer's Market

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.180
that are close to where you live, to being
able to enjoy more public art that's throughout

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.530
the city of this place.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.700
&gt;&gt; COLLINGE: London's greatest data challenge
I think still has be around transport.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.550
I'm really looking forward to this next stage
in opening up data to those who want to come

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.910
in and enjoy it, extract value from it and
make London a better place to live as a result

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.910
of that.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.110
So thank you to Google for doing so.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.250
&gt;&gt; TOLVA: There's so much of our data, the
vast majority of it is spatial, it's place

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.250
based.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.340
What I would love to see is a truly holistic
multi-modal, sort of transportation or how

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.459
do I get from point A to point B and what
are all my options.

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.079
You know, using the Google Places API, you
could note things like the status of street

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.370
being clean and so inaccessible.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.490
Something that's real time, that's hyper local
to where you are, but is aware of the status

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.609
of all the places and spaces that you plan
to go.

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.290
&gt;&gt; PARSONS: Now that you've heard from some
of the cities working with us on the Places

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.290
API developer challenge.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.850
I hope you feel inspired to use the Places
API.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.829
Check out the data sets we linked to from
the challenge website and start building the

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.280
[INDISTINCT] spatial applications.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.049
That will address an interesting digital challenge
in an innovative way.

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.969
Thanks for your participation, and we can't
wait to see you around.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.280
