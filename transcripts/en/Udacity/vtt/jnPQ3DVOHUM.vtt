00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, depending on how you look at this, this is either a very humbling

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
or very awe-inspiring moment.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
One one hand, the laws that govern the chaos and disorder and confusion

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that people see on earth are the same that govern the motions of the heavens.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But looking at it another way, the laws that govern the perfection of the motion of the heavens

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
are the same that control the chaos and disorder on earth.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's either very scary or very beautiful depending on how you look at it,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but either way it must have been a very exciting time in physics.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now that we've examined gravity a little bit,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
we can start to think more about motion.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now we're accepting gravity as a law of nature.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
All objects are mutually attracted to one another.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And so when we think of a falling apple, we can draw an arrow

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which represents the force of gravity, and I've used the subscript g is indicate

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that this force is due to gravity.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
From Galileo, we know exactly how this object will move.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's going to accelerate downwards at 10 m/sÂ².

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What's really fascinating, though, is that eventually

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
this apple will hit the ground and come to rest.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So, let's think about this apple, this motionless apple at rest and think

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
about what does it mean for an object to be motionless?
