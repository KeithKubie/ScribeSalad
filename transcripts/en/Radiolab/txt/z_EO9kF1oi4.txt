Speaker 1:          00:00          Uh, okay. Ready? Okay. This is radio lab. Oh, okay. Yeah. You start saying, okay, this is radio lab today we're talking about loops. I remember Krulwich Gentleman Ron. This is Radiolab. It's all about loops. Yep. I'm Jad and I'm in Robert, you're listening to radio lab today. We're talking about Luke. I'm Robert. I'm jet and it's all about Lou gifts. I'm Jan, I'm Robert Talking about loops and speaking of things that happen over and over and over again here on this show here. Hello. Here he is again. Hi. Jad. Hey Steve. Steven Strogatz. How are you? Mathematician Cornell University. How's it going? I'm good. And uh, Steve told us a story about a mathematical loop. The through mathematicians all over the world for a loop story starts way back with a guy named got lob. Frager got lob. Frigo, how do you spell that? It's not, it's not Gottlieb. It's, it seems to be lob at the end, unless it's a Typo in every book I've ever seen.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Now just set this up very quickly. God Club. The frago was a map petition back in the 1870s and eighties and he had a dream that mathematics could unlock the secrets of the universe, that you could maybe even build a machine, beat it, some basic mathematical rules, and it would just start churning out discovery. Wouldn't even need a human being. That's how powerful he thought math could be. But that led him to a question, if math is the most fundamental thing in the universe, what is the most fundamental part of math? What's at the foundation? Is it numbers? Is it, you know, one, two, three. Well, that's what you would think, but God lab, he said, no, there's a deeper thing than numbers. The deepest thing of all is, is what today we call sets the set of things, you know, so that, yeah, so like what's a set, you know, you could, Steve explained it to us using the wall things.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Sesame Street, really old episode as far as just to set it up here, it's two people working at the furry arms hotel. There's Humphrey who's got a green nose and a pink face and his girlfriend or bike. I don't actually know what she is. She might be his wife, Ingrid. And so there are hotel keepers and Ernie is in the background and so Ingrid and Humphrey are taking an order room service order from a room full of penguins. You know, Humphrey says, I'll take your order. Mr Penguin, sir, would you lie? Oh, fish, fish, fish, fish, fish, fish, fish, fish. Dan Humphrey says, let me check if I got that right. Fish, fish, fish, fish, fish, fish. You got it. And then he calls over to Ingrid who's going to call it into the kitchen. So he tells Ingrid Fish, fish, fish, fish, fish, fish. Ingrid says fish, fish, fish, fish, fish.

Speaker 1:          02:33          No number. Good. No, that's not right because she only says a five times. But then Ernie explained, oh, excuse me, Ingrid and Humphrey, I have a better way for you to do this. I better where you count the fish fish one [inaudible] two [inaudible] and six fish. They both realize Ingrid and Humphrey, how powerful this is. And they say, does work for say cinnamon rolls? Spark plugs. Absolutely. Wow. That's the point that what? Cinnamon buns and spark plugs and fish. The sets have in common is that there are six in each. I mean if you try to say what is six really mean, it's the thing that those sets have in common. According to Steve. It's not so much the number six that's important to hear. Yeah. That's just the label for this characteristic that all these piles seem to share. It's the pile itself, the set that is the most basic thing.

Speaker 1:          03:30          So afraid to said, well this is it. Sets are the bedrock that I've been looking for. Yeah. We can build the rest of math on top of it. Yeah. And then I can make my math machine that'll solve the universe. And I think he published a book sort of showing how this might work except that Russell Bertrand Muscle, the mathematician then found a devastating paradox that ended up, well annihilating what Reagan had tried to do. Russell's paradox has now become known as the barber paradox. It's a little thought experiment. So in this case, the set is a town. Yep. A town with people. Yep. One barber with the following rules in this town. The Barber shaves. Everyone who doesn't shave himself, the barber sounds reasonable, right? Everyone who doesn't shave himself. So some people shave themselves, some people go to the barber. That's the universe. We're in a town where everyone who doesn't shave himself as shave and by this barber.

Speaker 1:          04:23          And now the question is who shaves the barber? Who shaves? Remember the barber? The Barber has the property that he shaves. Everyone who doesn't shave himself, so he can't shave himself, but on the other hand, until he doesn't shave himself, then he's one of those people who doesn't shave himself and is therefore shaven by the Barbeau. Maybe the barber. Here's two solutions for you guys. The Barbara could not shave, couldn't he just not shave? No. Or maybe town shave. Maybe he could set up some sort of mechanical device. It's sort of like one of those cold card things that you can't change your answers sensibly. What happens to the barber and no one has, there's nothing to say. He either does or doesn't shave himself by ordinary Aristotelian logic because the barber can't shave himself and he can't not shave himself. So, so there's something still it ruined. That's what ruined them. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:19          good ruin in the afternoon and you're going to be late or you're going to have to wait for a couple of hours like after lunch, before you go swimming. But I can't see that like overthrowing all, all life's work. It does. It does. It turns out to be very, very problematic for the foundations of math because what this Barbara paradox, the reason it was so annoying to mathematicians was that math is supposed to be this logical thing, right? Logic is the lifeblood of math. And yet here you had this little bit of math. There was bilogical a self predicting that set. But Bertrand Russell, the guy who came up with all this, he didn't lose faith. He felt, well, this is just a problem with Cynthia. So then spent a long time trying to make, um, a theory, I think he called it a theory of types instead of sets.

Speaker 1:          06:03          And these, he had certain admission rules that he thought would prevent paradoxes from happening. And for awhile it was looking pretty good under Berkshire and Russell System. There was no logical problems, no paradox until describing a little German guy comes along and you say his name girdle. I hear it. I hear it often pronounced double. I don't speak German, but mathematicians often say it like the woman's piece of clothing, you know from the old days it sounded like a good good Yaddo. There's, it is a kind of er or this is Janna down 11 she has written a book about goodwill and I am a professor of physics and astronomy at Burnett College. And she says the point at which could enters our story, it's 1930s Vienna. Austria. Yeah. Just recently finished his, what would be equivalent to like a doctoral degree, a phd. Smart Dude, kind of a rising star.

Speaker 1:          06:54          It was no question that people around him understood that, but he was also maybe a little bit off. He had real breaks with, you know, reality. He was in the biographies, they'd call him a paranoid schizophrenia, but he seemed more a kind of obsessive depressive, I don't know, it was my say my age. Armchair psychology terms are accurate, but, but he was in and out of Sanatoria and, and um, and he had real difficulties being sure. What was your real, the only reality he really trusted was math circles, shapes, prime numbers, formulas, axioms. Right? And as a certain point, he got into paradoxes. Perhaps it was the barber paradox that learned them in, we don't know. But he began to think about and actually experiment with some of these paradoxical loops. So he took something like the paradox of the liar, the paradox of the liar says, um, this statement is a lie.

Speaker 1:          07:41          This statement is a lie, right? Huh? If it's true, then it's false. And if it's false, then it's true. This statement is a lie. If you think about that too much, you might blow it, right? So Google was interested in that phrase and for various reasons he took it, tweaked it a little bit to come up with the following statement. This statement is unprovable. This statement is unprovable, which is very important to notice. If it's, if it's provable, then it's unprovable. Obviously a little bit of a word game at Google thought, forget words. What would happen if I converted this statement into math? Because in math things are either provable or unprovable. They cannot be both at the same time. It's either true or false. And if it's true, we'll then damn it. You should be able to prove it. Yeah. So he said, I'm going to assign a special number, a unique number to make that a purely mathematical statement by coding it in a very clever way into arithmetic.

Speaker 1:          08:38          So to be honest, we don't completely get this part very, very clever. Once he did his mathy stuff, he had a rigorous mathematical statement right there on the page. He looked at it and he realized that what he just said in math is it the following statement? This statement is unprovable is, it's true because it's actually unprovable meaning in math, this statement actually is unprovable because it is true. The logic of math will not let you prove that it is true. So it might be true. We'll just never know. Nothing like that is supposed to happen in math. Things are supposed to be true or not true and you're supposed to be able to prove every true things as Steve, so if there's something true that you can't prove, that means that the math is strangely ruefully incomplete. It's always called is incompleteness theorem. That's the phrase, the girdle incompleteness Theorem is that if you have a system of axioms that are consistent, meaning they don't contradict themselves, they're necessarily incomplete, that is there a certain statements you can make within that system that you can't prove or disprove and all of math has this character.

Speaker 1:          09:50          This is the big shock that this is not just about word games, about logic puzzles with barbers. This is as as devastating for even just counting for one, two, three, four. In other words, math is shot through and through with these kinds of statements that you can't either prove or disprove seriously. The deep thinkers at the time were amazed at this. It was recognized as one of the great ideas of the, of the 20th century for sure. It may be of all time.

Speaker 1:          10:21          I mean, maybe I should make it more concrete there. There's a question that as far as I know is still not solved. Steve gave us this example of a problem, something called gold box conjecture. It kind of gives you a sense of what incomplete is, feels like. So gold box conjecture says that you can always write any even number as a sum of two prime numbers. So let me give you some examples of that. Like say 12 yeah, remember first of all, prime number means you can divide it by one and by itself, like seven is a prime number. You could divide by one and seven, but nothing else. Okay. All right, so 12 which is an even number is seven plus five those those are both prime numbers. All right, let's try another one. How about a 24 that's 11 plus 13 right? Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:07          Or I'm 36 19 plus 17 hmm. Any even number. Now, this has been checked out to, I don't know what, billions, trillions, maybe hundreds of trillion soap. No one has ever found a counterexample to gold box conjecture. And here's the thing. You might think that either it's true or it's false. It might be that this statement, every even number is the sum of two primes. It might be neither true nor false, but what we today call undecidable undecidable is a term that comes from girdle and decide, oh yeah. I mean, suppose in some ethereal or transcendental sense like that is suppose that there's God and God knows that is true. Then you know what about us here among the world of human beings, all we can do is check each even number and every time we check it's true. Would that that would never constitute a proof because we'd never run out of numbers. If you then say that to understand everything, you either have to defer to God who does understand everything. If you believe in God, but if you don't believe in God, you then have to live with mystery and not knowing

Speaker 2:          12:23          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          12:24          Yeah, that's all you can say. I'm going to say yes. I'm say, Oh huh. Well, I think you've encapsulated it perfectly and I think that girdle himself was, I think a believer in all kinds of mystical things. Like for him, this was very freeing and liberating because it meant that there were, that we couldn't be mechanized. There was profound mystery forever. Hold, hold on.

Speaker 2:          12:50          I'm on your team here, but let me just point out something. Google, when he died, he was not exactly liberated. He was a paranoid, like he thought people were trying to poison him. He starved himself to death. He wasn't exactly liberated, but I choose to be,

Speaker 1:          13:03          I believe it's somewhere in his tortured mind, and I guess his mind was pretty tortured. There was a little fellow humming a song, a song,

Speaker 3:          13:10          because liberation, this problem themselves, this problems [inaudible] problems, unsolvable problems and solvable problems.

Speaker 2:          13:24          Thanks to Steve Strogatz. He's currently working on a new book, which he calls the joy of x, not sex, just text. We don't even know what he's experiencing. The joy of, and Jen 11, her book about Google is called a mad man. Dreams of touring machines.

Speaker 3:          13:39          Oh No, it's probably solvable problems.

Speaker 2:          13:44          And finally our last, a loopy piece. This one, uh, like the last one involves things feeding back on themselves. Hm. Kind of a like your classic positive feedback loop, which is what exactly? Well, it's like when you can do it with audio. You take a speaker and a mic, you put the, you feed the sound from the speaker into the mic and the backend of the speaker into the mic. The multiplies and multiplies and then then you get something like payables with horrible, definitely the painful, but that kind of feedback loop like in the case of our next story can also take the pain away. Comes to us from this lady. I'm Melanie thernstrom. She's a writer, author of a book on pain called the pain chronicles, which is a book that began as a chronicling of her own pain, which has been suffering from every day for the last 15 years.

Speaker 2:          14:31          And what sort of pain? Oh, pain in my neck and right shoulder and right side of my head. And you're all at once? Yeah, yeah. It's all mine. Did it start with something? Did you hit it, hit it there, or how did it start? It didn't start with an injury of any kind, but it did start at a discreet time. Goes back to 1997 she was New York at a country house on a date. It was our first date and I wanted to impress him, so I swam across a pond about a mile across. Um, was this your idea or was this his idea? It was my idea. Wow. That's a different kind of first day. And you made it all the way there and back. Yes. And nothing happened, but that night, what'd you got in the bed? I was kept awake by this strange burning sensation in my shoulder and neck.

Speaker 2:          15:19          Um, I didn't get the, the head pain for like four more years. Um, and that particular pain never went away and got worse over time. Um, so it was like a nerve. A nerve was being, yeah. I mean, eventually I got an MRI a couple of years later and there was nerve impingement in my spine. And so there was, over the years, she says she's tried everything. She tried drugs and she's tried physical therapy. She's tried distraction. Like I'll go to a matinee and if it's a scary movie, I just don't stay focused on that pain. So distraction can work. But then she says as soon as she gets out of the movie, it's back and it's angry for being ignored. And sometimes I'd have the sensation like that. That right side of my head was like dying. Like the nerves were dying dead tree. And that image would kind of frightened me and that thought she'd find that that thought would make the pain worse and making the pain worse will inspire further negative fantasies, which will make it anymore until make the pain worse. Which one spire morphing? Yes, it's out of the loop. Positive feedback loop. Yeah. In a negative sort of way. Right. And eventually Melanie's decided, okay, I'm going to write a book about this. You do some research. So I was reading a lot about self inflicted pain and religious rights

Speaker 4:          16:52          and I actually went to witness a Hindi Festival type who Sam in Kuala Lumpar and when she saw it really changed your mind about things. And you can see video of this festival on Youtube. What you see is a dense crowd of folks. Even the middle of the crowd, they write these moms doing insane acts of devotion. They literally like thread needles through their tongues, poke skewers, do their cheeks weighted fished, hugs dangled from their backs. And yet she says when she would look in their faces, they seemed relaxed. Like their eyes, guys

Speaker 2:          17:28          don't tear up, they don't gasp for breath. Like really relaxed. Wasn't just that they were tolerating the paint. It's actually seemed like they weren't in pain at all. And I would think, okay, fifth person here has a skewer in his mouth. I'm [inaudible] pain. But that stick, you know, when you can't become a religious Hindi in order to experience this analgesics benefits. I, that's cheating. But I did feel like, okay, so one way to describe it, um, is faith, but for every way that you can describe and religious terms. There's also a way you can describe things in, in scientific terms. Yeah. And the reality is all of our pain is in our head, which brings us to this guy. This is Sean Mackey, chief of the Stanford Pain Management Division. And he will tell you that one of the most basic facts about pain is that it is not purely physical. We've got signals coming up from the body that are sending us a message. Like if you whack a toe, the signal shoots up some nerves in your leg into your spine, and those signals can

Speaker 5:          18:33          virgin our brain. And before you even feel a thing, there are a multitude of what I refer to as little amplifiers throughout our brain that turn up and turn down the overall pain experience. And these amplifiers are things like your mood, anxiety, depression, attention, expectations, all of these things feed back onto that signal coming up from the body and make an either boosted,

Speaker 2:          18:55          but bubba past a certain point where you get a sensation of pain or

Speaker 5:          19:01          they can deaden it down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down to, or you don't feel anything at all. Huh?

Speaker 2:          19:07          Point is pain is a conversation between the brain and the body. And Sean thought, what would happen if I actually let people see that conversation? Could they, you know, take control of it? Yeah. So we did a study in Melanie signed up. So describe what happens in this experiment. So you put in this MRI machine, we put somebody into a scanner, a brain scanner, and you have a screen in front of you. And what you see on this screen is something that normally only the researchers would see. You see your own brain in real time. Yeah. Well you're not seeing the whole thing. You're just seeing one p called the anterior singular cortex. There are many parts of the brain that respond to pain, but that's the one that, it's an area that has been shown to be involved with pain perception, turning pain up and down.

Speaker 2:          19:52          It's thought to give pain. It's emotional valence, it's negativity. And do you actually see an image of this little piece of your brain right there in front of you on the screen and we'd, you actually are, you're looking at your brain. No, no. That's confusing to everybody. So instead we give a, a visual metaphor. He see an image of, um, fire claims in an ice cave. I mean, it is kind of a cartoon flying, but it looks realistic. So you're flickering flame do the leap into this. Do the leap. They leave. And the more activation there is in that region,

Speaker 6:          20:25          the higher the plane go.

Speaker 2:          20:28          So Melanie is lying in the scanner watching her own pain, flames. And Sean gives her a set of instructions. We say, okay, we want you to imagine that you're sitting in a nice warm, soothing Jacuzzi.

Speaker 6:          20:40          You know, this branding is a warm bath. This burning is very relaxing. I'm relaxing into it. Yeah. But pretty soon it was like

Speaker 2:          20:49          hot, Kinda hot. Skeldon me how I get to get out. And before she knew it, the flames were rallying. So Sean said, okay. Okay. So how about you're lying on a beautiful beach?

Speaker 7:          21:01          Yes. You know, this breathing is a pleasant Suntan and the sand is nice and warm and pleasant. Um, I'm gonna look so good in my new bathing suit if I just keep getting burnt like this

Speaker 2:          21:14          sunburn. Alright. And then the flames would kind of go crazy. Her thoughts kept slipping out of her control. You know, if every time she would see those flames rise, she would think, oh no, the flames are rising. Which would make them rise even more. And then more and more until she had this bonfire on the screen, you're immediately struck by the, they look like the flames, where you're going to the flames, where you're burned at the stake. I've been reading a lot of lives or saints at that point. But then Melanie had an idea, she said, why don't I take this, this negative image and flip it? And then I started trying to move into the idea of being a saint or a martyr and

Speaker 7:          21:54          that I, you know, believe that I would have no cane and that I was protected by my faith

Speaker 2:          22:01          in his. Melanie started thinking about this. She could see the flames dying down just a little bit, which is fine cause I, this isn't, you know, you don't know me, but this isn't actually like part of my fantasy life. But she thought, okay, I'll try this. Let me keep going in that kind of feeling.

Speaker 7:          22:19          So I was trying to pick one of the few prayers I knew. I knew. Um, I mean I didn't, I'm half Jewish, half Christian, I was three. I'm not settled in onto what kind of martyr I was. You know, I started thinking she's not really be a Jewish martyr since you know, if you're half Jewish mothers, Jews, it's the right side. Really. I'm Jewish more than Christian. And then I started thinking about Jewish martyrs and like what prayers do they say? And, and as she added and right

Speaker 2:          22:50          advise details that continued to make the flames go down, okay, I'm in the right brain state. Let me do more of that. So Melanie finally decided, okay, I'm going to be this one particular Jewish martyrs names Akiva, Ben Joseph. He was burned at the stake by the Romans for teaching the Torah. And there's a particular legend that just as the executioner's about to set fire to the logs right underneath his feet. Akiva stared the execution or in the eyes and smiled and the execution was like, why are you smiling? You're about to be burned alive and keep us said all my life when I said those words, you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul. I was sad because I thought, when shall I be able to fulfill that command and now that I'm giving my life and my resolution remains firm, why shouldn't I smile?

Speaker 7:          23:47          By the time Melanie had this fantasy built up in her mind, she looked over at the flames and she noticed they were almost gone. Zero, zero pain for the first time. She'd taken control of it. I felt like, wow, I am watching my brain thinking my thoughts and I am changing my thoughts by thinking and watching myself do that. So you are looking at yourself, looking at yourself, looking at yourself, looking at yourself. Yes.

Speaker 8:          24:21          Peering inside and seeing the ghost in the machine.

Speaker 7:          24:23          I felt, you know, like someone taking their first step on the moon. Like I am watching my brain thinking my thoughts and I am thinking my thoughts, changing my thought by thinking and watching my thoughts, watching my brain, changing my thoughts by thinking and lodging myself do this

Speaker 2:          24:49          well. I needed to establish, I need to establish this, that once you were, did your two sessions and you're in between exercises without this, all these Gizmos, could you, could you address your pain? Yeah. Better? No. Like you think, well, okay, can't you just get the feedback from your own body, but somehow this sensation isn't quite direct enough that I think that you could do it without the visual feedback. Before that moment in that machine, it was, um, power.

Speaker 7:          25:27          [inaudible] my name is [inaudible]. I am changing my last five words

Speaker 8:          25:38          before we go. A very special thanks to our singers who joined us this hour from the New Music Ensemble at LaGuardia High School. They are Kelly FMU, Julian Sodo. You like Greenho, Juliet, Eagan, Ruby from those guys wrote and performed all the music between the pieces you guys rock and thanks to the guy who teaches them and who organize this. Mr Robert [inaudible].
