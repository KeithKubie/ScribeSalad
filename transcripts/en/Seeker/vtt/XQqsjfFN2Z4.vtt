00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.560
THIS IS THE ACCOMPLISHED LONG-DISTANCE SWIMMER, BEN LECOMTE,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.040
JUST A FEW DAYS INTO THE MOST GRUELING 
AND EXCITING SWIM OF HIS LIFE.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.780
FOR EIGHT HOURS A DAY, BEN IS CHIPPING AWAY AT
MORE THAN 5,000 MILES OF PACIFIC OCEAN

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.840
THAT LIE AHEAD OF HIM.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.920
HIS TRANS-PACIFIC SWIM IS NOT ONLY 
MOTIVATED BY ADVENTURE

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.780
BUT ALSO BY A DESIRE TO RESEARCH
AND PRESERVE THE OCEAN.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.440
Paul: What’s very specific with our situation,
with our expedition, is the scope of it.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.040
It has never been done to have that much data
from one end of the ocean to the other.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.680
JOINING BEN IS HIS NEPHEW AND EXPEDITION PROJECT MANAGER, PAUL LECOMTE.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.320
Paul: All good, Ben?

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.620
PAUL IS PART OF THE 8-PERSON CREW 
ONBOARD THE 20-METER SHIP, SEEKER.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.540
AND THIS IS WHERE BEN AND THE CREW ARE LIVING
AND WORKING FOR THE NEXT 6-8 MONTHS.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.460
WHILE ASSISTING BEN IN HIS SWIM, THEY WILL
ALSO BE COLLECTING DATA THAT WILL PROVIDE

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.260
AN IMPORTANT DEPICTION OF OCEAN HEALTH,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.320
BY TRACKING MICROPLASTICS, 
MONITORING PLANKTON,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.579
AND EVEN COLLECTING AUDIO.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.200
Paul: The purpose of the hydrophone is to
record all the life around us during the crossing

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.480
and to create the first soundscape
of the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.840
[dolphin clicks]
Maria: 25 meters.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.820
[dolphin clicks]
Paul: Oh, yeah, the clicking.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.800
Maria: Yeah?!
Paul: Insane!

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.480
BEN IS ALSO THE SUBJECT OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH,
WITH DATA BEING COLLECTED

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.880
ON HIS GUT MICROBIOME, HIS HEART, AND HIS MENTAL HEALTH.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.120
BEN: The fact that I'm exercising so many
hours per day in a low-gravity environment...

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.880
What type of impact it will have on my
heart and my body, also the pressure of my eyes?

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.040
So anybody can use it as a way
to learn more about their field... the more the better.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.740
PREPARATION BEGAN SEVEN YEARS AGO, AS BASELINE MEDICAL TESTS, INCLUDING MRIS,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.560
BONE DENSITY SCANS, AND ECHOCARDIOGRAMS WERE CONDUCTED ON BEN AND STUDIED.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.920
MEDICS ONBOARD, INCLUDING MAKS ROMEIJIN, WILL
OVERSEE BEN'S CARE AND ANY TESTING.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.880
Maks: We have an onshore team of doctors who
advises us and who are accessible 24/7 for us.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.180
So everything, what we do as a medic, is
a combination of us with them.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.569
Maks: You can hear him screaming through his
snorkel, it's because the pain of his shoulder,

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.250
there's a lot of wetsuit rash and it's getting
sore, and it's open because it's salt water.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.520
TO PROTECT BOTH HIS BODY AND MIND DURING THIS
SUPERHUMAN FEAT, A ROUTINE WAS DEVELOPED

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.060
WITH HIS CREW AND OUTSIDE PROFESSIONALS.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.420
Maks: Good luck.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.220
Paul: We've been talking to astronauts, we've been talking to people that were in this kind of environment

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.320
solitary, for a long time, and they told us 
that routine is everything.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.100
So, we have a very precise planning 
of the day.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:55.720
Ben wakes up, he has two hours of preparation, wetsuit, eating, doing all the medical checks.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.600
We put Ben in the water
and we start the swim.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.960
Every half hour, we have a check with the
swimmer, wants to drink, he wants to eat.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.140
We have a check between the boat and the dinghy

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.420
Ty: Disco, this is Seeker.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.940
...and at the same time, on the boat, we have

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.900
all the science protocols 
happening for the 8 hours.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.480
BEN HAS COMPLETED LONG-DISTANCE SWIMS THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.700
INCLUDING THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN 1998.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.380
THAT TIME, BEN WAS SWIMMING FOR 
CANCER AWARENESS AND RESEARCH.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.400
THIS TIME, HE’S HOPING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
CHANGE — SO THAT WE CAN PRESERVE OUR OCEAN

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.120
FOR THE FUTURE.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.700
Ben: It has a bigger purpose.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.240
It's, for me, much more important to do The Swim and bring attention to the ocean

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.099
than just doing a swim because I love swimming
and I'm passionate about it.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.019
Right now it's being carried on for other
generations, and for my kids.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.020
I look at them very closely every time, because
I know that it's going to be

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.020
very important to them.
