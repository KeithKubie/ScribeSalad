00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.520
We've already been exposed
to points and lines.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.990
Now let's think about planes.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.230
And you can view planes as
really a flat surface that

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.590
exists in three dimensions, that
goes off in every direction.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.440
So for example, if I have
a flat surface like this,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.260
and it's not curved,
and it just keeps

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.540
going on and on and
on in every direction.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.579
Now the question is, how
do you specify a plane?

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.120
Well, you might say,
well, let's see.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.536
Let's think about
it a little bit.

00:00:30.536 --> 00:00:35.120
Could I specify a plane with
a one point, right over here?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.560
Let's call that point,
A. Would that, alone,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.170
be able to specify a plane?

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.940
Well, there's an
infinite number of planes

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.630
that could go
through that point.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.250
I could have a plane that
goes like this, where

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.140
that point, A,
sits on that plane.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.200
I could have a plane like that.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.100
Or, I could have
a plane like this.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.330
I could have a plane
like this where

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.370
point A sits on it, as well.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.210
So I could have a
plane like that.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.560
And I could just keep
rotating around A.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.070
So one point by
itself does not seem

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.600
to be sufficient
to define a plane.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.460
Well, what about two points?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.770
Let's say I had a point,
B, right over here.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.010
Well, notice the way I
drew this, point A and B,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.330
they would define a line.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.520
For example, they would define
this line right over here.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.010
So they would define,
they could define,

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.260
this line right over here.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.300
But both of these points and
in fact, this entire line,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.880
exists on both of these
planes that I just drew.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.650
And I could keep
rotating these planes.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.120
I could have a plane
that looks like this.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.010
I could have a plane
that looks like this,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.760
that both of these
points actually sit on.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.330
I'm essentially just
rotating around this line

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.560
that is defined by
both of these points.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.740
So two points does not
seem to be sufficient.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.170
Let's try three.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.540
So there's no way
that I could put--

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.920
Well, let's be careful here.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.150
So I could put a third
point right over here,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.870
point C. And C
sits on that line,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.380
and C sits on all
of these planes.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.500
So it doesn't seem like
just a random third point

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.210
is sufficient to define, to pick
out any one of these planes.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.830
But what if we
make the constraint

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.840
that the three points are
not all on the same line.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.820
Obviously, two points
will always define a line.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.880
But what if the three
points are not collinear.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.030
So instead of
picking C as a point,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.560
what if we pick--
Is there any way

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.880
to pick a point, D, that
is not on this line, that

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.501
is on more than one
of these planes?

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:34.000
We'll, no.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.083
If I say, well, let's see,
the point D-- Let's say

00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:38.182
point D is right over here.

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:39.890
So it sits on this
plane right over here,

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.730
one of the first
ones that I drew.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.040
So point D sits on that plane.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.190
Between point D, A, and
B, there's only one plane

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.780
that all three of
those points sit on.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.820
So a plane is defined by
three non-colinear points.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.050
So D, A, and B, you see, do
not sit on the same line.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.760
A and B can sit
on the same line.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.290
D and A can sit
on the same line.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.520
D and B can sit
on the same line.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.510
But A, B, and D does not sit
on-- They are non-colinear.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.720
So for example, right
over here in this diagram,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.990
we have a plane.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.190
This plane is labeled, S.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.990
But another way that we
can specify plane S is we

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.580
could say, plane--
And we just have

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.170
to find three non-collinear
points on that plane.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.030
So we could call this plane AJB.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.178
We could call it plane JBW.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.352
We could call it plane-- and I
could keep going-- plane WJA.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.330
But I could not specify
this plane, uniquely,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.864
by saying plane ABW.

00:03:56.864 --> 00:03:58.280
And the reason why
I can't do this

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.080
is because ABW are
all on the same line.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.420
And this line sits on an
infinite number of planes.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.280
I could keep rotating around the
line, just as we did over here.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.669
It does not specify
only one plane.
