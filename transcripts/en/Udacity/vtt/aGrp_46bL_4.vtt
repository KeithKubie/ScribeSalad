00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.969
For the first one, no.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.351
While CSS can act a little
strangely sometimes,

00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:11.051
the situation you see here is not one
that would be caused by quirks in

00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:13.872
the way different browsers handle CSS.

00:00:13.872 --> 00:00:15.938
For the second one, yes.

00:00:15.938 --> 00:00:20.240
Different device pixel ratios can
definitely change the size of content on

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.450
the page,
if you don't handle it correctly.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.810
For the third one, nope.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.630
Initial scale isn't going to cause the
inconsistent zooming that you see here.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.380
And for the fourth one, yeah.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.690
This could be a reason.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.340
Without defining the viewport,
you're leaving it up to the browser to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.600
determine the viewport size, which could
cause a disparity that you see here.
