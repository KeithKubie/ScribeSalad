Hey guys welcome to the yard where today

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.080
We're going to be learning about how to do some homemade custom wood burning without a branding iron not long ago

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.170
I saw a video by youtuber Laura Kampf who showed how you can use a simple chemical process to burn wood

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.440
And I thought it was just the coolest thing ever I started doing some research on it

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.609
I found articles and crafting magazines going back seven or eight years talking about this process

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.609
And it is

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:28.649
Really cool and super simple to do really the only two ingredients we need for this are water and ammonium chloride in her video Laura

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.689
Kampf says you can buy ammonium chloride in a pharmacy and while that may be true where she is in Germany

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.680
It doesn't seem to be the case here in the United States, and you're best off buying it online

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.979
There are two forms that it comes in you can buy bags of the powdered ammonium chloride or you can buy it as a block

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.750
Of what's called Sal ammoniac? It's the exact same thing just compressed into a brick form

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.949
I already have some left over because this is the same chemical we used in our negative X experiments to start will one about

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.299
1/2 cup of water and 1 teaspoon of our powdered ammonium chloride

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.470
To get this into a powder form I'm just gonna start shaving bits of it off this brick

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.499
And if any of it is in chunks that are too big, I'll just crush those up

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.750
Those are the ingredients you need at this point we have the solution that works to chemically burn our wood

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.968
There are several methods. We can use to apply this on to our wood. Let's start by trying out a paint brush

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.288
We'll take the ammonium chloride solution, and we'll draw whatever design

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.629
We want to on the wood and we'll then hit it with a heat gun

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.729
The heat will activate the ammonium chloride and burn our design into the wood permanently

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.819
I'm just gonna go for a vine and leaf design

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.529
That's a pretty simple design, let's see how it takes when we hit it with our heat

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.909
This is something you'll need to be a little bit patient with it doesn't activate

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.019
immediately, it really has to get pretty hot before the burning starts happening I

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.018
Can see the design starting to appear? Right now it just looks like sort of a pale yellow

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.869
And now we can see that we have successfully burned our design into the wood

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.450
I may have been a little bit hasty in some spots if you concentrate the heat gun on one place too long

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.350
You're likely to start burning the wood itself everywhere that the heat gun is hitting rather than just where you painted the ammonium chloride

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.619
So you do want to be careful about how you apply to heat?

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.289
One of the cool things about using this liquid to make your designs in the wood is that there are a lot of different ways

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.300
You can apply it. I was using a paint brush

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.189
I also have this paint brush style pen which you can fill with whatever liquid you want

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.310
I'll try pouring some of our ammonium chloride into this pen

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.039
And then I should be able to just write with the tip of the brush

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.050
My handwriting is pretty much garbage

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.800
So this isn't gonna look very good

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.880
But conceptually you can just use your own handwriting to write something out and then burn it into a piece of wood really fun

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.390
Let's try a few other things

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.070
I've got a small piece of towel that I've soaked in our ammonium chloride solution

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.379
And I'm gonna try using a stamp and see if I can get a stamp to print onto the wood and then burn that in

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.790
Another great method is a three-step process that involves using stickers as a form of mask

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.330
You can use commercially available stickers if you've got them in the right shape or if you've got

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.320
Access to a vinyl cutter to cut custom shapes you can do that as well

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.469
Let's try taking some of these large alphabet stickers and using them as a mask to make a large welcome sign on this board

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:16.549
Our sticker has worked as a mask against the clear paint and will now apply our ammonium chloride

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.559
Mixture over the lettering we should only get the burning effect where we had the stickers

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.479
The ammonium chloride solution is relatively safe

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.999
But if you are going to be using this trick on anything that's going to be in contact with food make sure you wash it

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.320
Well first one thing

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.109
I really like about this technique is how easy it is to apply to curved surfaces as well as flat lines a

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.139
Real branding iron may have some advantages over this technique, but it would also have a fairly hard time

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.719
Burning evenly onto a curved surface

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.579
There's one more thing that I want to try and that's using a piece of sticker paper to cut out my own

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.289
Stencil and use that as a mask instead of using the pre-bought stickers that I've had before

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.529
The ammonium chloride and water solution is super easy to make and easy to apply in a variety of different methods

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:57.409
So you can completely choose the design you want to burn into wood

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.628
