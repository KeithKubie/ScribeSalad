00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.360
yeah the Islamic world agrees you know
so that I think it's a very what I'm

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:29.370
so that I think it's a very what I'm
 

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.550
so that I think it's a very what I'm
trying to say almost impossible to

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560
trying to say almost impossible to
 

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.930
trying to say almost impossible to
handle I don't think anybody could have

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940
handle I don't think anybody could have
 

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.910
handle I don't think anybody could have
done it right yeah any better really

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920
done it right yeah any better really
 

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.160
done it right yeah any better really
yeah and the lesson is that persecution

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:37.170
yeah and the lesson is that persecution
 

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.850
yeah and the lesson is that persecution
doesn't make people say sensible things

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:39.860
doesn't make people say sensible things
 

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:45.980
doesn't make people say sensible things
very often yeah but but they don't you

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:45.990
very often yeah but but they don't you
 

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.300
very often yeah but but they don't you
know here's my thought and and I'd

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:49.310
know here's my thought and and I'd
 

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:55.070
know here's my thought and and I'd
really like to know how let's explore

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:55.080
really like to know how let's explore
 

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.570
really like to know how let's explore
this for a moment

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:56.580
this for a moment
 

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.910
this for a moment
you see it's absolutely right there's no

00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920
you see it's absolutely right there's no
 

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.920
you see it's absolutely right there's no
gainsaying that the fact that there are

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:02.930
gainsaying that the fact that there are
 

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:06.200
gainsaying that the fact that there are
fundamentalist elements in Islam all

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:06.210
fundamentalist elements in Islam all
 

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:09.020

over Iran us here and in the Middle East
in South Asia and so on and Bradford but

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:16.110
in South Asia and so on and Bradford but
 

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.980
in South Asia and so on and Bradford but
I think it's sort of ubiquitously true

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:18.990
I think it's sort of ubiquitously true
 

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.980
I think it's sort of ubiquitously true
nevertheless that most people most

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:21.990
nevertheless that most people most
 

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.150
nevertheless that most people most
Muslims are not like that

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160

one of the pressing questions for

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:40.580
one of the pressing questions for
 

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.190
one of the pressing questions for
somebody who's so deeply interested in
