to the new world empires you know they

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560
to the new world empires you know they
 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.430
to the new world empires you know they
got their their butts kicked by those

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440
got their their butts kicked by those
 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.560
got their their butts kicked by those
Europeans all thirteen or fourteen of

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570
Europeans all thirteen or fourteen of
 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.180
Europeans all thirteen or fourteen of
them and so they get conquered we do not

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190
them and so they get conquered we do not
 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.230
them and so they get conquered we do not
deal with the aftermath of that conquest

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240
deal with the aftermath of that conquest
 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.920
deal with the aftermath of that conquest
except to talk about what the Europeans

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930
except to talk about what the Europeans
 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.190
except to talk about what the Europeans
do after that

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200
do after that
 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.460
do after that
now structurally speaking the Europeans

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470
now structurally speaking the Europeans
 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.510
now structurally speaking the Europeans
are the barbarians attacking these

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520
are the barbarians attacking these
 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.790
are the barbarians attacking these
empires

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800
 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.219
when historians say Rome is a Empire and

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229
when historians say Rome is a Empire and
 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.089
when historians say Rome is a Empire and
civilization and it is assaulted by

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.099
civilization and it is assaulted by
 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:35.330
civilization and it is assaulted by
barbarians we think of those barbarians

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340
barbarians we think of those barbarians
 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.140
barbarians we think of those barbarians
of the Vikings Li mad jars and so forth

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150
of the Vikings Li mad jars and so forth
 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:45.369
of the Vikings Li mad jars and so forth
as being less civilized when it comes to

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:45.379
as being less civilized when it comes to
 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:49.369
as being less civilized when it comes to
the Aztecs and the Incas their empires

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:49.379
the Aztecs and the Incas their empires
 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:52.399
the Aztecs and the Incas their empires
as described are described as the

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:52.409
as described are described as the
 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:55.040
as described are described as the
empires of savages that they're the

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050
empires of savages that they're the
 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.620
empires of savages that they're the
barbarians and the Europeans are clearly

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630
barbarians and the Europeans are clearly
 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:05.499
barbarians and the Europeans are clearly
the the conquerors and somehow the the

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:05.509
the the conquerors and somehow the the
 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.200
the the conquerors and somehow the the
greatness has been transferred from the

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210
greatness has been transferred from the
 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:18.020
greatness has been transferred from the
empire to the conquerors ah now I think

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.030
empire to the conquerors ah now I think
 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:27.700
empire to the conquerors ah now I think
this is a very distorted and basically

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.710
this is a very distorted and basically
 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:33.950
this is a very distorted and basically
Eurocentric way of approaching this but

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960
Eurocentric way of approaching this but
 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.510
Eurocentric way of approaching this but
it fits into the idea that the story of

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520
it fits into the idea that the story of
 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.649
it fits into the idea that the story of
world history since 1500 is at bottom

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:42.659
world history since 1500 is at bottom
 

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:44.990
world history since 1500 is at bottom
the story of the world that the

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000
the story of the world that the
 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.600
the story of the world that the
Europeans make and therefore those

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.610
Europeans make and therefore those
 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.219
Europeans make and therefore those
people who do not contribute to the

00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:52.229
people who do not contribute to the
 

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:56.019
people who do not contribute to the
story will gradually fall by the wayside

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:56.029
story will gradually fall by the wayside
 

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:58.879
story will gradually fall by the wayside
so the Aztecs and the Incas fall by the

00:07:58.879 --> 00:07:58.889
so the Aztecs and the Incas fall by the
 

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:00.610
so the Aztecs and the Incas fall by the
wayside

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:00.620
wayside
 

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.850
wayside
eventually the the Indians and the

eventually the the Indians and the
 

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.200
eventually the the Indians and the
Chinese and others will fall by the

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:06.210
Chinese and others will fall by the
 

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.439
Chinese and others will fall by the
wayside until we simply have you know

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:09.449
wayside until we simply have you know
 

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:16.340
wayside until we simply have you know
what the West has has created

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.540
but in a period in the era of

globalization it's not you know
necessarily clear that the

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:25.449
necessarily clear that the
 

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:27.629
necessarily clear that the

end of this story in a number of years
ago I compiled a book called the

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:36.580
ago I compiled a book called the
 

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.190
ago I compiled a book called the
Colombia history of the 20th century and

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200
Colombia history of the 20th century and
 

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.610
Colombia history of the 20th century and
it was a thematic history there were

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:44.620
it was a thematic history there were
 

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.510
it was a thematic history there were
twenty chapters on different things that

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:48.520
twenty chapters on different things that
 

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.019
twenty chapters on different things that
had made the 20th century distinctive

had made the 20th century distinctive
 

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:53.220
had made the 20th century distinctive
but they were all themed attic things

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:53.230
but they were all themed attic things
 

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.019
but they were all themed attic things
for example there was a chapter on

00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:55.029
for example there was a chapter on
 

00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:56.900
for example there was a chapter on
socialism there was a chapter on

there was no chapter on World War one

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:10.300
there was no chapter on World War one
 

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.390

and World War two or the Great
Depression or the Cold War because those

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:17.650
Depression or the Cold War because those
 

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:23.460
Depression or the Cold War because those
were episodes that are that happened in

were episodes that are that happened in
 

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.650
were episodes that are that happened in
the 20th century but in terms of

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:25.660
the 20th century but in terms of
 

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.930

fundamentally altering the way people
 

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.880
fundamentally altering the way people
live I felt that these themes were more

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:31.890
live I felt that these themes were more
 

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:37.199
live I felt that these themes were more
or more pertinent so I got a whole bunch

00:09:37.199 --> 00:09:37.209
or more pertinent so I got a whole bunch
 

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:39.210
or more pertinent so I got a whole bunch
of people to write chapters and some of

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:39.220
of people to write chapters and some of
 

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.920
of people to write chapters and some of
them were pretty good and some of them

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:40.930
them were pretty good and some of them
 

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.620
them were pretty good and some of them
were not so good I wrote the

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:43.630
were not so good I wrote the
 

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.510
were not so good I wrote the
introduction and I wrote the conclusion

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:45.520
introduction and I wrote the conclusion
 

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.230
introduction and I wrote the conclusion
and the conclusion I said you know what

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240
and the conclusion I said you know what
 

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.699

now in 1999 will be completely rethought

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:58.150
now in 1999 will be completely rethought
 

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:03.300
now in 1999 will be completely rethought
in 2099 in the same way that people who

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:03.310
in 2099 in the same way that people who
 

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:11.130
in 2099 in the same way that people who
wrote about the 19th century in 1900 saw

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.140
wrote about the 19th century in 1900 saw
 

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.079
wrote about the 19th century in 1900 saw
the 19th century completely differently

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:13.089
the 19th century completely differently
 

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:16.070
the 19th century completely differently
than we see it now they didn't see it as

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.080
than we see it now they didn't see it as
 

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.240
than we see it now they didn't see it as
this period of you know racist

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.250
this period of you know racist
 

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:26.400
this period of you know racist
imperialist imposition of European

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:26.410
imperialist imposition of European

arrogance upon the whole globe
 

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.990
arrogance upon the whole globe
they saw it as a period of great

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.000
they saw it as a period of great
 

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
they saw it as a period of great
progress in which Europe had risen to

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.010
progress in which Europe had risen to
 

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.610
progress in which Europe had risen to
the pinnacle of civilization and offered

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:35.620
the pinnacle of civilization and offered
 

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.579
the pinnacle of civilization and offered
its gifts to the world whether they

00:10:38.579 --> 00:10:38.589
its gifts to the world whether they
 

00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:39.329
its gifts to the world whether they
wanted it or not

00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:39.339
wanted it or not
 

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:41.790
wanted it or not
but now a hundred years later we looking

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:41.800
but now a hundred years later we looking
 

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.220
but now a hundred years later we looking
back back to the 19th century and we

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:44.230
back back to the 19th century and we
 

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.470
back back to the 19th century and we
talk about what was so terrible about

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480
talk about what was so terrible about
 

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.380
talk about what was so terrible about
things the 19th century so my assumption

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:49.390
things the 19th century so my assumption
 

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.400
things the 19th century so my assumption
was that in at the beginning of the 22nd

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:53.410
was that in at the beginning of the 22nd
 

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.560
was that in at the beginning of the 22nd
century people will look back at the

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:55.570
century people will look back at the
 

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.980
century people will look back at the
20th century and see it very differently

00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:58.990
20th century and see it very differently
 

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.650
20th century and see it very differently
so what I had in the conclusion of the

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660
so what I had in the conclusion of the
 

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:10.730
so what I had in the conclusion of the
of the book was half dozen book

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:10.740
of the book was half dozen book
 

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:18.590
of the book was half dozen book

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:08.460
wheel of a small diameter then you can
pivot the front axle and the wheel will

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:08.470
pivot the front axle and the wheel will
 

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:11.210
pivot the front axle and the wheel will
go underneath the bed of the wagon and

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:11.220
go underneath the bed of the wagon and
 

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:14.190
go underneath the bed of the wagon and
so one of the clear things that you look

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200
so one of the clear things that you look
 

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.880
so one of the clear things that you look
at in images of will transport from the

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:17.890
at in images of will transport from the
 

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:21.810
at in images of will transport from the
14th century onward is what is the

00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:21.820
14th century onward is what is the
 

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:24.030
14th century onward is what is the
relative size of the back wheels and the

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.040
relative size of the back wheels and the
 

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.540
relative size of the back wheels and the
front wheels the front wheels are

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:26.550
front wheels the front wheels are
 

00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:29.580
front wheels the front wheels are
noticeably smaller it means that their

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:29.590
noticeably smaller it means that their
 

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:32.820
noticeably smaller it means that their
steering the thing whereas if the wheels

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:32.830
steering the thing whereas if the wheels
 

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:35.880
steering the thing whereas if the wheels
are of exactly the same size and clearly

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:35.890
are of exactly the same size and clearly
 

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:38.790
are of exactly the same size and clearly
interfering with the bed of the of the

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:38.800
interfering with the bed of the of the
 

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.530
interfering with the bed of the of the
four-wheel vehicle that it means that

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:40.540
four-wheel vehicle that it means that
 

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.100
four-wheel vehicle that it means that
they don't have a steering so

00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:42.110
they don't have a steering so
 

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:44.130
they don't have a steering so
which means it can't use it in a city

00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:44.140
which means it can't use it in a city
 

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:46.620
which means it can't use it in a city
because if you can't steer it a

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:46.630
because if you can't steer it a
 

00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:48.700
because if you can't steer it a
four-wheel vehicle you know it's sort of

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:48.710
four-wheel vehicle you know it's sort of
 

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:51.190
four-wheel vehicle you know it's sort of
like those shopping carts that have one

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200
like those shopping carts that have one
 

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.350
like those shopping carts that have one
or two frozen wheels you're trying to

00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:53.360
or two frozen wheels you're trying to
 

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.750
or two frozen wheels you're trying to
turn it and you just can't do it fine

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760
turn it and you just can't do it fine
 

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:58.240
turn it and you just can't do it fine
you pick them thing up and shove it over

00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:58.250
you pick them thing up and shove it over
 

00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:00.880
you pick them thing up and shove it over
because turning a four-wheel vehicle if

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:00.890
because turning a four-wheel vehicle if
 

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:04.120
because turning a four-wheel vehicle if
the way if you can't steer it is just

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:04.130
the way if you can't steer it is just
 

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:07.750
the way if you can't steer it is just
extremely slow you wear it in a very

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760
extremely slow you wear it in a very
 

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:11.410
extremely slow you wear it in a very
very large turning radius

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:11.420
very large turning radius
 

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:16.570
very large turning radius
so prior to steering you couldn't have a

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:16.580
so prior to steering you couldn't have a
 

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.930
so prior to steering you couldn't have a
carriage in town because you couldn't

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:19.940
carriage in town because you couldn't
 

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:22.180
carriage in town because you couldn't
turn it barn out a carriage you're going

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:22.190
turn it barn out a carriage you're going
 

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:24.340
turn it barn out a carriage you're going
to have a four wheeled passenger vehicle

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:24.350
to have a four wheeled passenger vehicle
 

00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:26.500
to have a four wheeled passenger vehicle
in town because you couldn't turn it the

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:26.510
in town because you couldn't turn it the
 

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.930
in town because you couldn't turn it the
towns were not big enough to have space

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:28.940
towns were not big enough to have space
 

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:31.780
towns were not big enough to have space
to turn the vehicle and you couldn't

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:31.790
to turn the vehicle and you couldn't
 

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:33.010
to turn the vehicle and you couldn't
really have it in the country very well

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:33.020
really have it in the country very well
 

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:35.520
really have it in the country very well
because there were no paved roads and

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:35.530
because there were no paved roads and
 

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:39.940
because there were no paved roads and
that becomes a problem here the smaller

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:39.950
that becomes a problem here the smaller
 

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:43.480
that becomes a problem here the smaller
the diameter of the wheel the smoother

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:43.490
the diameter of the wheel the smoother
 

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:47.590
the diameter of the wheel the smoother
the road has to be because the ability

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:47.600
the road has to be because the ability
 

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:52.080
the road has to be because the ability
of the wheel to simply go over a rough

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.090
of the wheel to simply go over a rough
 

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:57.220
of the wheel to simply go over a rough
surface is proportional to the size of

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:57.230
surface is proportional to the size of
 

00:55:57.230 --> 00:56:00.930
surface is proportional to the size of
the pail it's like you know

rollerblading on a brick street or a
 

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:06.490
rollerblading on a brick street or a
cross-country through a forest is

00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:06.500
cross-country through a forest is
 

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.530
cross-country through a forest is
something you don't usually do because

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:08.540
something you don't usually do because
 

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.680
something you don't usually do because
the wheels are too small and yet you

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:11.690
the wheels are too small and yet you
 

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:14.950
the wheels are too small and yet you
could have a mountain bike and go across

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960
could have a mountain bike and go across
 

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.660
could have a mountain bike and go across
country because the wheel is so much

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:16.670
country because the wheel is so much
 

00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:20.460
country because the wheel is so much
bigger so when they start to steer it

00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:20.470
bigger so when they start to steer it
 

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:23.560
bigger so when they start to steer it
then they reduce the size of the front

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:23.570
then they reduce the size of the front
 

00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:25.810
then they reduce the size of the front
wheel and then they have to improve the

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:25.820
wheel and then they have to improve the
 

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:29.860
wheel and then they have to improve the
surface of the of the road that the

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:29.870
surface of the of the road that the

places and you say well this is really
 

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:02.570
places and you say well this is really
kind of open country studded with ruins

a city needs to have a layout of streets
 

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:18.730
a city needs to have a layout of streets
because there are vehicles that have to

that have to pass through those streets
 

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:26.330
that have to pass through those streets
and so you have to consider what is

00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:26.340
and so you have to consider what is
 

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:31.640
and so you have to consider what is
paving now how do you pay the street in

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:31.650

preparing for the seminar I've learned
 

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:44.510
preparing for the seminar I've learned
more about the detailed history of

it is very important because your your

00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:57.300
it is very important because your your
 

00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.330
it is very important because your your
vehicle technology and you're paving

00:57:59.330 --> 00:57:59.340
vehicle technology and you're paving
 

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:03.230

pavement so now you're beginning to have

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:15.930
pavement so now you're beginning to have
 

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:18.670
pavement so now you're beginning to have
a substantially greater separation

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.680
a substantially greater separation
 

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.950

right down to let's say the middle of
the nineteenth century I think that at

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220
the birth of the nation-state
 

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.339
the birth of the nation-state
the idea that instead of having a kind

01:04:20.339 --> 01:04:20.349
the idea that instead of having a kind
 

01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:25.220
the idea that instead of having a kind
of vague and poorly defined frontier

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:25.230
of vague and poorly defined frontier
 

01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:29.849
of vague and poorly defined frontier
between two different political entities

01:04:29.849 --> 01:04:29.859
between two different political entities
 

01:04:29.859 --> 01:04:33.030
between two different political entities
that are radiating out from some capital

01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:33.040
that are radiating out from some capital
 

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.460
that are radiating out from some capital
city or some palace you get the idea

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:35.470
city or some palace you get the idea
 

01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:37.560
city or some palace you get the idea
that the states will border one another

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:37.570
that the states will border one another
 

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:40.670
that the states will border one another
in a specifically defined fashion with

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680
in a specifically defined fashion with
 

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.490
in a specifically defined fashion with
border posts and guards and so forth and

01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:44.500
border posts and guards and so forth and
 

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.349
border posts and guards and so forth and
you will go from one state to another at

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.359
you will go from one state to another at
 

01:04:46.359 --> 01:04:52.770
you will go from one state to another at
a crossing point and that makes a great

01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:52.780
a crossing point and that makes a great
 

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:55.050
a crossing point and that makes a great
deal of sense political science as a as

01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:55.060
deal of sense political science as a as
 

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.310
deal of sense political science as a as
a great turning point in world history

01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:56.320
a great turning point in world history
 

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:59.310
a great turning point in world history
but but it also of course has great

01:04:59.310 --> 01:04:59.320
but but it also of course has great
 

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.410
but but it also of course has great
implications for for something like

01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:01.420
implications for for something like
 

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:04.920
implications for for something like
transportation once you decide that you

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:04.930
transportation once you decide that you
 

01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:06.990
transportation once you decide that you
have a state then how do you build your

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000
have a state then how do you build your
 

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.810
have a state then how do you build your
roads do you connect them across the

01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:09.820
roads do you connect them across the
 

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:11.339
roads do you connect them across the
border where you keep them within your

01:05:11.339 --> 01:05:11.349
border where you keep them within your
 

01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:14.010
border where you keep them within your
country

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:14.020
 

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:20.140
do you use your road system to make your

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:20.150
do you use your road system to make your
 

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:23.560
do you use your road system to make your
provincial outlying areas more easily

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:23.570
provincial outlying areas more easily
 

01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:28.000
provincial outlying areas more easily
contacted by the capital or do you use

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:28.010
contacted by the capital or do you use
 

01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:30.610
contacted by the capital or do you use
them for some other purpose this is not

01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:30.620
them for some other purpose this is not
 

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:33.940
them for some other purpose this is not
happening yet by the 1600s but it

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:33.950
happening yet by the 1600s but it
 

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:36.220
happening yet by the 1600s but it
eventually happens that the the road

nation-state one thing I should point

01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:51.260
nation-state one thing I should point
 

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:54.940
nation-state one thing I should point
out here is that these four wheeled

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:54.950
out here is that these four wheeled
 

01:05:54.950 --> 01:06:00.220
out here is that these four wheeled
vehicles the carriages that were

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:00.230
vehicles the carriages that were
 

01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:06.340
vehicles the carriages that were
primitive in design before 1400 but

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:06.350
primitive in design before 1400 but
 

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:09.370
primitive in design before 1400 but
become more and more sophisticated until

01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:09.380
become more and more sophisticated until
 

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:12.370
become more and more sophisticated until
they become suitable for elite private

01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:12.380
they become suitable for elite private
 

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:20.310
they become suitable for elite private
use use these four wheeled vehicles

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:20.320
 

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.420
don't exist anywhere else in the world

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:22.430
don't exist anywhere else in the world
 

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:25.810
don't exist anywhere else in the world
at that time there are no four-wheel

01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:25.820
at that time there are no four-wheel
 

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:27.010
at that time there are no four-wheel
vehicles in China

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:27.020
vehicles in China
 

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:30.310
vehicles in China
no four-wheel vehicles in India no

01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:30.320
no four-wheel vehicles in India no
 

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.700
no four-wheel vehicles in India no
four-wheel vehicles in Japan no vehicles

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:33.710
four-wheel vehicles in Japan no vehicles
 

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:37.150
four-wheel vehicles in Japan no vehicles
at all in the Middle East and in most of

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:37.160
at all in the Middle East and in most of
 

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.460
at all in the Middle East and in most of
the provincial of most of the areas that

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:39.470
the provincial of most of the areas that
 

01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:41.200
the provincial of most of the areas that
become part of the European colonial

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:41.210
become part of the European colonial
 

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:44.140
become part of the European colonial
world for example Latin America you

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:44.150
world for example Latin America you
 

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:47.440
world for example Latin America you
don't have any four-wheel vehicles the

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:47.450
don't have any four-wheel vehicles the
 

01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:49.360
don't have any four-wheel vehicles the
reason for this is because for wheeled

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:49.370
reason for this is because for wheeled
 

01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:54.730
reason for this is because for wheeled
vehicles don't make much sense you can't

01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:54.740
vehicles don't make much sense you can't
 

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:58.230
vehicles don't make much sense you can't
steer them without a lot of technical

01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240
steer them without a lot of technical
 

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:04.420
steer them without a lot of technical
complication but even more if you every

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:04.430
complication but even more if you every
 

01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:08.170
complication but even more if you every
axle you add multiplies the amount of

01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:08.180
axle you add multiplies the amount of
 

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:11.200
axle you add multiplies the amount of
friction you have so the more wheels you

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:11.210
friction you have so the more wheels you
 

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:15.000
friction you have so the more wheels you
have the harder it is to pull

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:15.010
have the harder it is to pull
 

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:18.730
have the harder it is to pull
so that's your most of history if you

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:18.740
so that's your most of history if you
 

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:22.240
so that's your most of history if you
had a fixed source of power such as a

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:22.250
had a fixed source of power such as a
 

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:26.760
had a fixed source of power such as a
pair of oxen or a pair of horses

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:26.770
 

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:29.560
if they were pulling a four-wheel

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:29.570
if they were pulling a four-wheel
 

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:33.880
if they were pulling a four-wheel
vehicles they would be able to pull less

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:33.890
vehicles they would be able to pull less
 

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:36.010
vehicles they would be able to pull less
weight than if they were pulling a

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:36.020
weight than if they were pulling a
 

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:39.100
weight than if they were pulling a
two-wheeled vehicle so other parts of

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:39.110
two-wheeled vehicle so other parts of
 

01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:41.050
two-wheeled vehicle so other parts of
the world do about four wheeled vehicles

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:41.060
the world do about four wheeled vehicles
 

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:45.670
the world do about four wheeled vehicles
and said we don't need them we want two

01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680
and said we don't need them we want two
 

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.990
and said we don't need them we want two
wheeled vehicles now if it was a

01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000
wheeled vehicles now if it was a
 

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.170
wheeled vehicles now if it was a
ceremonial vehicle at something else for

01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:50.180
ceremonial vehicle at something else for
 

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:54.100
ceremonial vehicle at something else for
example the great movable temple in

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:54.110
example the great movable temple in
 

01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:57.240
example the great movable temple in
eastern India known as the juggernaut

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:57.250
eastern India known as the juggernaut
 

01:07:57.250 --> 01:08:00.490
eastern India known as the juggernaut
which was before the Marvel Comics

01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:00.500
which was before the Marvel Comics
 

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.900
which was before the Marvel Comics
invented a character named juggernaut

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:03.910
invented a character named juggernaut
 

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:12.720
invented a character named juggernaut
the juggernaut is was a huge mammoth

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:12.730
the juggernaut is was a huge mammoth
 

01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:16.809
the juggernaut is was a huge mammoth
temple on wheels that could could only

01:08:16.809 --> 01:08:16.819
temple on wheels that could could only
 

01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:19.480
temple on wheels that could could only
go straight it couldn't be turned and if

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:19.490
go straight it couldn't be turned and if
 

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:20.980
go straight it couldn't be turned and if
you fell in front of it or if you read a

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:20.990
you fell in front of it or if you read a
 

01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:22.090
you fell in front of it or if you read a
bowtie and you're three years old in

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:22.100
bowtie and you're three years old in
 

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.010
bowtie and you're three years old in
front of it you would be crushed by the

01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:24.020
front of it you would be crushed by the
 

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:28.750
front of it you would be crushed by the
juggernaut the only image I've been able

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:28.760
juggernaut the only image I've been able
 

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:32.680
juggernaut the only image I've been able
to find of the of the wheel assembly of

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:32.690
to find of the of the wheel assembly of
 

01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:35.559
to find of the of the wheel assembly of
a juggernaut was interesting it had 18

01:08:35.559 --> 01:08:35.569
a juggernaut was interesting it had 18
 

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:39.280
a juggernaut was interesting it had 18
wheels no two of them on the same axle

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:39.290
wheels no two of them on the same axle
 

01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:45.130
wheels no two of them on the same axle
each one on a separate axle and so you

01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:45.140
each one on a separate axle and so you
 

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.930
each one on a separate axle and so you
do get ceremonial vehicles that will be

01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:46.940
do get ceremonial vehicles that will be
 

01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:48.880
do get ceremonial vehicles that will be
more than carts with any kind of

developments trade 1,400 and 1,600 that

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:58.010
developments trade 1,400 and 1,600 that
 

01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:01.630
developments trade 1,400 and 1,600 that
develop steering brakes suspension and

01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:01.640
develop steering brakes suspension and
 

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.349
develop steering brakes suspension and
things like that now the reason this is

01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359
things like that now the reason this is
 

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:09.970
things like that now the reason this is
important is that all modern Motor

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:09.980
important is that all modern Motor
 

01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:17.500
important is that all modern Motor
