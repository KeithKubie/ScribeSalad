ARUN NAGARAJAN: Hello, and
welcome to Google Developers

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.870
Live.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.300
My names is Arun
Nagarajan, and I'm

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.216
with the Google Apps
developer relations team.

00:00:14.216 --> 00:00:15.800
We have a special GDL today.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.310
We have Letter Feed, who is a
great partner of ours, that's

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.930
joined in here in the studio.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.800
And they're talk about
the great Google Docs

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.070
add-on that they've built.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.696
And we'll actually take
a look at the add-on

00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:27.070
itself, but more
importantly have

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.160
a good conversation
about how they built it,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.050
and some of the challenges
and opportunities

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.060
that they have faced.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.090
So before we dive
into all the details,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.980
let's actually let them
introduce themselves.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.105
CHRIS HAN: Yeah, I'm Chris.

00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:39.650
I'm Chris Han, and I'm
the co-founder and CEO

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.590
of Letter Feed.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.810
KARTIK AYYAR: Hi, I'm Kartik.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.220
I'm the co-founder and
CTO of Letter Feed.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.720
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.386
And for the folks
that are not familiar,

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:47.490
what does Letter Feed do?

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.085
What's the product about?

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:51.060
What are you doing?

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.380
What are you building?

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.046
CHRIS HAN: Sure.

00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:54.290
Letter Feed makes
collaboration tools for work.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.950
And we're really
excited to talk today

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.070
about Letter Feet Sidebar,
which is a Google add-on.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.110
And it's a single place for
you to see, and discuss changes

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.910
to your document.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.118
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:01:04.118 --> 00:01:05.970
And who is a typical
user of Letter Feed?

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.595
CHRIS HAN: Our typical
users are people

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:10.600
who really depend on Google
Apps to run their business.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.867
They're really heavy users
of Google Docs and Sheets.

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:14.700
And they use it in a
very collaborative way.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.250
So it's oftentimes a lot of
people editing, and viewing,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.772
and just making changes to
these Google Docs and Sheets.

00:01:21.772 --> 00:01:22.980
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.670
So actually, why don't we take
a look at the add-on itself?

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.210
I think that'll set
the stage really

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.610
well for some of the
other conversations.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.760
CHRIS HAN: Sure.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.210
Sounds great.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.750
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Let's
take a look at it

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.624
here in the computer.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.820
CHRIS HAN: Great, so we
can switch to the demo.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.010
So Letter Feed, again,
is a single place for you

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.010
to see and discuss
changes to your documents.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.770
And so it lives right
alongside your document.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.230
So that in a single glance,
you can quickly see and see

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.700
what people have been changing
and editing, including

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.430
who's been changing
them, and when.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.890
So additions are shown in green,
and deletions are shown in red.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.760
And it's also a great
place just to have

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.930
any sort of document-related
conversation.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.710
So if I'm making a few
edits here, I can say, hey,

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.730
does this look OK?

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.180
So you'll be able to quickly
see and discuss any changes.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.039
And any message
that you send will

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.980
appear right alongside the
sidebar for all document

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.270
editors to be able to see.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.760
Of course, not everyone is
editing at the exact same time,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.490
so we actually will send out
email if they're offline.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.930
So it will actually detect
presence, and send an email

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.180
if it's applicable.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.260
So in this case, we're
going to switch over

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.970
to our other user
here, who got an email.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.920
And he's able to actually reply.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.740
And say, hey, I'll check it
out in a sec, and hit Send.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.136
And this message will actually
get posted back to the sidebar.

00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:45.260
We wanted to make the email
experience really great

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.460
because editing in
a team is almost

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.040
always an asynchronous
experience.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.310
So we're going to actually
go into the document now.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.455
It's Kartik.

00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:55.310
And you can see that
his message is actually

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.096
posted on the left-hand side.

00:02:58.096 --> 00:02:59.846
KARTIK AYYAR: And an
update also happened.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.762
CHRIS HAN: Yeah, and the
update also happened.

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.810
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So
now you're showing

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.400
the add-on for two
different users

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.620
simultaneously on
the same screen?

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.940
CHRIS HAN: Yep.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.120
So on the left, is Chris.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.078
On the right is Kartik.

00:03:11.078 --> 00:03:14.640
And so Kartik is able to see
that his message has already

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.530
been seen.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.770
So we actually show you
anytime someone has actually

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.484
read your message
or your change.

00:03:20.484 --> 00:03:22.650
So you'll never have to
wonder if someone's actually

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.490
read your document.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.340
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.923
CHRIS HAN: And Kartik
is going to post

00:03:25.923 --> 00:03:27.870
a message, which
includes a link.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.149
And any link is
highlighted and actually

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:31.690
intelligently
previewed, whether it's

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.330
an article, a link to
a Google Drive file,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.510
or in this case, a photo
of some really cute cats.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.340
And so we wanted to provide
a really rich experience,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.960
so you'd have those
discussions you

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.290
need to put together
your document.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.330
So we've also enabled the
ability to just copy and paste,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.650
by dragging and dropping
content from the sidebar.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.130
So any text or photos
that you're discussing

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.127
can automatically be
added immediately.

00:03:57.127 --> 00:03:58.335
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:03:58.335 --> 00:04:00.516
Yeah, and I've been myself,
using it a little bit

00:04:00.516 --> 00:04:01.140
here and there.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.130
And I've kind of enjoyed
the constant history

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.630
that it tracks, and the
nice way that it provides

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.570
the summary of the changes,
not just the snapshots.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.089
Right?

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:11.630
So I think that's
a really cool thing

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.710
that you guys are offering.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.630
So tell me a little bit about
some of the technical details

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.850
behind the add-on, what
some of the selling

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.145
points of integration
were, and if you

00:04:19.145 --> 00:04:20.519
can give some
background on that.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.560
KARTIK AYYAR: Sure, sure.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.700
So I think fundamentally
Letter Feed

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.750
is like a multi-client service.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.390
Right?

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.240
We started off as a
standalone website.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.280
And since then, we of course,
introduced the sidebar.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.510
And so as a result of building
this multi-client service,

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.330
we really tried our
best to seamlessly blend

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.370
the best of having Apps
Script, plus having

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.600
our own service that is
really doing the lifts.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.430
As a result, we are using both
Apps Script APIs, as well as

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.470
the [INAUDIBLE] APIs seamlessly.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.475
And to the user, it's
completely transparent.

00:04:58.475 --> 00:05:00.020
I think the biggest
thing to keep

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.670
in mind is that when you're
trying to actually build

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.490
an add-on, test early and
test often with any libraries

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.680
that you want to use in
the [INAUDIBLE] sandbox.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.700
And so that way you
can like pretty early

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.410
on figure out what is
going to work for you.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.910
Right?

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.502
And that will also make
your software development

00:05:18.502 --> 00:05:19.460
a lot more predictable.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.150
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.580
What are some of the
interesting metrics

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.450
that you'll be tracking
once this launches?

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.190
CHRIS HAN: We're going
to be looking really

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.750
closely at retention
and engagement.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.900
So on the retention
side, we're going

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.941
to be looking at day-one
retention for new users,

00:05:28.941 --> 00:05:31.140
to make sure they stick
around, and weekly return

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.350
rates for current users.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.266
On the engagement side,
we'll be looking a lot

00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:35.660
at frequency of use per day.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.360
Are they getting a lot of use
on it on multiple documents?

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.665
And also send side metrics.

00:05:39.665 --> 00:05:41.290
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Let's
take a quick look

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.820
at the multi-client design
that you talked about.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.120
That's on the computer here,
and of course, you kind of

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.320
talked to some of the key
things you've done here.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.946
KARTIK AYYAR: Sure.

00:05:50.946 --> 00:05:52.945
ARUN NAGARAJAN: With that,
I mean this is great.

00:05:52.945 --> 00:05:54.870
I really enjoyed
using the add-on.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.890
I urge you all to go try it on.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.800
It'll be on the
add-ons marketplace.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.751
And good luck with
the launch, and thank

00:06:00.751 --> 00:06:02.750
you very much for being
here the studio with us,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.030
introducing the add-on.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.280
CHRIS HAN: Thanks for have us.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.558
KARTIK AYYAR: Thanks.
