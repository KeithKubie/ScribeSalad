00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.121
Now that you know that every integer is a
rational number. That means we should be

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:09.039
able to write every single integer in the
form of a rational number. Which remember

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:17.996
is a/b, where a and b are both integers,
and b is not = 0. So how could you express

00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:24.337
-17 in this form? Please enter values for
a and b to make a fraction equivalent to

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.020
-17 in the slots below. There are a ton of
different ways you can do this, so just

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:34.166
pick one combination of a and b that you
think will work and try it out.
