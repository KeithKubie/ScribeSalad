00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.400
Confession:

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.680
I've accidentally used your toothbrush a few times.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.900
I can never remember what color I am,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.020
Except at your place where, obviously, I'm the pink one.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.920
"I didn't get it cuz you're a girl," you said.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.020
But now...

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.320
I know exactly which is yours.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.300
I pick up the green one, next to my blue,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.700
clutch it in my hands like a Bible over an open fire.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.940
Knowing, if I let go

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.660
I'm admitting

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.040
There is no God.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.240
That turning our backs on this temple does nothing.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.500
No more of your silly Egyptian dance by the sink,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.360
Hips knocking together, bones locking in tune,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.200
Open mouths laughing... minty kisses collecting the sound.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.780
Everything we hold sacred

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.380
turns to sin.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.940
Wrapping your long arms around me from behind.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.120
Wiggling your eyebrows at our naked form in the mirror.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.020
Singing hymns into my hair...

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.780
The quirks that make up our church.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.160
I close my eyes and try to feel you out there

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.260
across the concrete river between us, in your basement sanctuary

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.240
Maybe you're holding my pink toothbrush in your hand too

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.040
wondering what to do.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.660
I don't feel you.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.270
I used to feel you out there.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.220
Always.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.720
Even when you were half a world away.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.520
But believing in us

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.320
is blasphemy

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.700
if you don't believe

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.780
in me.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.960
With a silent prayer,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.880
I let the toothbrush fall from my fingers

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.900
into the trash.
