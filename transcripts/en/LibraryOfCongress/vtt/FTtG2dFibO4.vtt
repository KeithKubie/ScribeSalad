00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.450
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Welcome to
the Whittall Pavilion.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.750
My name is John Fenn.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.050
I'm the head of research
and programs

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.500
at the American Folk Life
Center, the Library of Congress,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.600
and I'd like to welcome you
to the latest presentation

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.480
in our ongoing Benjamin
A. Botkin lecture series.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.160
The Botkin series allows
us to highlight the work

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.490
of leading scholars in the
disciplines of folklore,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.520
ethnomusicology, oral history,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.960
and cultural heritage while
enhancing the collections here

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.200
at the American Folk Life Center
and the Library of Congress.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.820
For the center and
for the library,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.710
the Botkin lectures
form an important facet

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.240
of our acquisition activities.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.300
Each lecture is video-recorded
and becomes part

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.100
of the permanent
collections of the library.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.820
In addition, the Botkin lectures
are later posted as webcasts

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.840
on the library's website, where
they are available for viewing

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.720
to internet patrons throughout
the world, and reminder here:

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.420
If you haven't already done so,
please turn off your cell phone

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.730
or put it on airplane mode.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.080
It tends to interfere with
the sound in the lectern.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.130
Although the AFC is one of the
smaller divisions of the Library

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.430
of Congress, the
size and breadth

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.770
of the center's archival
holdings are extensive.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.790
In fact, all on its own, the
AFC is the world's largest

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.090
ethnographic archive.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.160
It contains over 3,000 field
work collections and boasts more

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.670
than 5 million items
documenting hundreds

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.540
of traditional cultures
throughout the world.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.470
Our holdings include
documentation on music, dance,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.050
narrative tales, oral
history, and all other aspects

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.280
of traditional knowledge
and cultural expressions.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.800
Our public programming
activities are equally

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.100
as broad-based.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.380
Last week, we presented a
Botkin speaker on Syriac chants

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.680
in Aramaic Christianity.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.660
Next well, we'll
host a talk on Cajun

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.110
and Creole culture in Louisiana.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.980
And today, we are
especially delighted

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.390
to present a Botkin lecture
by our esteemed friend

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.000
and colleague Andrea Graham,
who is a prominent expert

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.300
on the folklore, folk life,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.900
and traditional culture
of the American West.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.140
Andrea has worked as a public
folklorist for over 35 years,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.070
and 30 of those have been spent
in the inter-mountain West.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.460
Currently the folk
life specialist

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.640
at the American Studies
Department of the University

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.860
of Wyoming, Andrea
received undergraduate

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.780
and graduate training at the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.700
Although originally
from the east coast,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.000
she has spent the majority

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.260
of her career documenting
the inter-mountain West.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.190
Before moving to
Laramie in 2009,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.130
she worked as a public
sector folklorist

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.210
and undertook field work
and programming projects

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.130
in California, Idaho,
Iowa, Montana,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.170
Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.650
From 1990, to 2000, she served

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.180
as the folk life
program coordinator

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.960
for the Nevada Arts Council
and has also worked for state

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.160
and regional folk arts
programs in Virginia,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.730
Tennessee, and Florida.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.230
Now working as a folklorist,
educator, and researcher

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.920
at the Wyoming -- at the
University of Wyoming

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.340
in Laramie, which is located

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.470
on the very exotic-sounding
high Laramie Plains,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.490
Andrea is widely admired
throughout the field

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.790
for the breadth, creativity,
and excellence of her research,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.690
scholarship, and programming.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.260
Today, Andrea will be speaking

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.820
about her recent field work
project for Art of the Hunt,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.380
which explored and documented
hunting and fishing lore

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.000
and related traditions
in contemporary America.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.140
The project highlighted
the many crafts, skills,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.050
occupational traditions,
and narrative stories

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.750
that are an important part of
Wyoming's rich hunting culture

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.620
and continue to shape Wyoming's
sense of cultural identity

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.020
and regional uniqueness.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.740
The Art of the Hunt,
which culminated in 2014

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.190
with a year-long exhibit at
the Wyoming State Museum,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.900
was a landmark event, and we
are dedicated to welcoming --

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.100
we are delighted to welcoming
Andrea to the Library

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.500
of Congress to talk about her
research and her findings.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.510
Please join me in welcoming her.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.880
[ Applause ]

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.180
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: All right.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.000
It's a treat to be here and see
some of my friends out there

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.810
and some Wyoming folks.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.390
I talked to several
Wyoming folks.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.430
Anyone else from Wyoming
or lived in Wyoming?

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.460
Okay. It's a small contingent.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:00.820
So how many of you are
hunters or have ever hunted?

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.120
We got a few.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.540
Okay. Or fished?

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.840
A lot more people have fished.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.670
Okay. It's much easier or less
gear-intensive to go fishing.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.450
In Wyoming, in a room like
this, probably at least half

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.800
of the people would
put their hands up

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.080
and say they were hunters,
maybe three quarters.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.220
In some towns, it
would be everybody.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.910
It's an enormous part of
the culture in Wyoming.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.470
It's a big state, lots

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.850
of wide-open spaces,
lots of public land.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.500
About 50% of the land is public,
and with a more recent history

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.930
of non-native settlement.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.230
Laramie, where I live,

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.720
is celebrating its 150th
anniversary this year,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.680
so that's pretty recent
compared to the east coast.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.570
So all over Wyoming, you
will see things like this,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.050
collections of photos.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.440
Let me get that arrow
out of there.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.760
People's hunting photos
that they will post,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.160
and this is a little store
in a town called Aladdin.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.380
You'll see them in
cafes, in motels.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.510
The tire shop where
I got my tire changed

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.000
in Laramie has a whole
wall of hunting photos.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.300
It's just what people do

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.930
and what they show off
to their community.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.280
I myself am not from a hunting
background or hunting family.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.630
As John said, I'm originally
from the east coast.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.940
We weren't hunters.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.330
It just wasn't part
of my environment.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.220
So the first I really
remember being aware

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.880
of how important hunting was --

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.970
my first job out of grad school
was in rural southwest Virginia,

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.250
and I learned that schools
were closed on the first day

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.840
of hunting season in the fall

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.750
because half the kids
wouldn't have shown up.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.750
They were -- that
was more important.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.390
That didn't happen in suburban
Philadelphia, but it does happen

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.690
in Rock Springs, Wyoming.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.350
I saw this sign in the
cable company stores.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.650
Like, "We're going hunting.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.950
We don't care.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.780
It's more important
than your business."

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.670
[Laughter] So that's the nature

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:04.060
of how important hunting
is in these communities.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.190
So I was a total
outsider to this world

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.490
of hunting and fishing.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.780
I fished a little
bit, but never hunted.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.500
Not really interested
in hunting myself.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.160
I don't mind if other
people do it.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.090
So there's advantages and
disadvantages to being that much

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.460
of an outsider when
you're doing field work.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.820
You can kind of go in and
say, "I don't know anything,"

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.120
and you'll get a
lot of really --

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.790
you can ask really
dumb questions

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.570
and sometimes get really
good answers that someone

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.810
who did know the culture maybe
wouldn't even think to ask,

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.810
so that can be an advantage.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.770
You know, when I think the fact
-- and I was very up-front.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.360
I said, "I know nothing
about this.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.520
Explain it to me," and the fact

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.410
that it was a woman
I think also helped.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.190
People didn't expect me to
know anything about hunting,

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.820
although there are a
lot of women hunters,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.740
and there's an increasing
number of women hunters,

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.890
but people were very polite
and answered my questions,

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.490
and who knows what
they said after I left.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.790
Like, "Who was that?"

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.630
[Laughter] So a little bit
of background on Wyoming,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.260
for those of you who don't know.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.520
It's one of those big,
square states out west.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.700
It's the tenth largest
state in size.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.650
It is the least populous state.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.430
There are fewer than
600,000 people.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.980
That's fewer than live in DC,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.590
and that number's
actually dropping

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.800
because there's a big bust
in the energy industry,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.260
and people are leaving.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.100
It's the second least densely
populated after Alaska.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.260
So there's tons of open space.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.770
Original inhabitants in the
north were the Crow Indians

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.750
on the Montana border, the
Lakota into South Dakota,

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.200
but their territory
included eastern Wyoming,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.760
and then the eastern Shoshone

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.080
and the northern Arapaho
were tribes there,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.560
so I think you can
see kind of in the --

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.260
just west of center is the
Wind River Reservation.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.600
That's Shoshone and
Arapaho territory today.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.740
Grand Teton National -- or
Yellowstone National Park is

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.640
in the far northwest corner.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.060
Grand Teton is just south of
it and the town of Jackson.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.380
The capital is Cheyenne, which
is in the opposite, southeast,

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.680
corner, almost into Colorado.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.820
Laramie is 50 miles
west of that.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.100
That's where I live,
at the university.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:22.090
It's the only four-year
university in the state.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.630
Then Casper used to
be the biggest town.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.210
It was a big oil town.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.620
In the center of the
state, you can kind

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.910
of see the Rocky Mountains run
diagonally through the state.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.760
In the north central part,
the Bighorn Mountains.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.480
The area between there

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.560
and Yellowstone is
called the Bighorn Basin,

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.690
where the town of Cody is.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.240
I did a bunch of
field work there,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.610
so I'll be referring
to the Bighorn Basin.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.460
Green River and Rock
Springs are in the southeast.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.450
So those are sort of some
of the key locations,

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.050
and I'm just going to
sort of take you along

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.770
on my field work travels, which
started in the northeast corner

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.950
in Crook County,
the town of Hulett,

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.480
which is the closest
town to Devil's Tower.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.580
It's up in that corner.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.650
So I was hired in 2007 by
the Wyoming Arts Council

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.160
to do just a field work
survey in that county,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.520
and I have to credit Annie
Hatch, who was the folklorist

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.400
with the Wyoming Arts Council.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.730
This project really is her idea.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.500
She came up with it, and she and
I worked very closely together.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.390
This whole project
was a joint project

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.790
between the arts council
and the university.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.950
So I wish she could
be here, too.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.430
It's definitely her baby.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.960
So she just hired me to do
just a field survey up there,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.930
so I was driving down
Hulett's main street,

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.410
the one-block main street,
and saw a little building

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.680
with a sign that said
Deer Creek Taxidermy.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.160
So well, that would
be interesting.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.070
That sounds kind of folk.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:57.520
So I walked in and saw these
sort of ghostly animal forms.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.150
These are called mannequins.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.460
They're the foundation
for taxidermy

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.040
that you put the skin over.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.410
They come in all different kinds
of animals and shapes and sizes,

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.090
but it was kind of a spooky
thing to walk in and see these,

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:15.710
and then I met J. R. Butler,
who was the proprietor,

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.900
the taxidermist, and I
was introducing myself,

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.840
and when I -- as soon as I said
I was from the arts council,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.050
he just lit up, like oh.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.420
Usually, when I'm doing
field work and I say I'm

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.590
with an arts organization,
if I'm maybe in a quilt shop,

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.720
asking about quilters, if I
say I'm from an arts council,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.070
they immediately
try and send you

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.770
to the painter up the street.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.070
Like, "Well, that's the artist."

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.540
They don't think of themselves
as artists, and you have

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.840
to convince them that no,

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.830
I really am interested
in your quilt.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.970
But J. R. said, "Oh, I'm so
glad the Arts Council recognizes

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.670
taxidermy is an art form.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.020
It's creative.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.390
You want to bring
the animals to life."

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.630
He was just all over that.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:00.580
So he was thrilled to be
interviewed by the Arts Council.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:07.090
So he likes to -- you know,
the poses of an animal, this --

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.570
what's called habitat that
he really likes to use,

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.350
these pieces of wood
and rocks and plants

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.490
to make a setting
for the animal.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.890
All of that is creative to him.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.350
So he was a great person to
interview, and he's been --

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.850
he has three sons, and he's
been teaching his kids.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.000
This is one of his kids,
Austin, who was in the shop.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.690
He's now in high school
or college, probably,

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.600
but he was totally
into taxidermy.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.560
He would help his
dad with the skins.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.450
He had done some small
pieces and won awards.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.740
He was like a spokesman
for this shop,

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.170
and he knew all the terminology,
and he was just a blast,

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.200
so I had to get this picture
of him with the horns.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.950
So it looks like this
tradition is going to be passed

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.420
on in the family,
which is great.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:02.450
So J. R. does a lot of work
for out-of-state hunters,

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:07.480
and out-of-state hunters are
an enormous economic impact

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.960
in the state.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.960
There are a lot of them.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.260
They spend a lot of money.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.670
They have to pay extra
for hunting licenses,

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.180
for out-of-state
hunting licenses.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.960
They have to hire
guides and outfitters.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.600
In certain areas,
they're required.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.990
They stay in motels.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.290
They eat food.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.040
They pay taxidermists
to do their taxidermy.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.000
So it's a huge economic impact,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.170
and so they will leave
their trophy with J. R.,

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.380
and the food -- there's a
program, I think through Game

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.790
and Fish, where they can
donate the meat to food banks,

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.990
because wasting meat
is a big no-no.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.630
I mean if somebody goes
out and kills an animal

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.730
and just takes the head
and leaves the meat,

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.660
Game and Fish will
track them down.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.460
They're not -- that's wasting.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.830
You're not supposed to do that.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.320
So anyway, just from this
first visit with J. R.,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.860
when I wasn't even looking for
hunting stuff, I learned a lot

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.600
about the importance of
family hunting traditions.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.900
He hunts with his kids.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.450
They hunt with their
grandparents.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.410
A deep understanding of animals

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.720
and their environment is
required to be a hunter

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.020
as well as a taxidermist.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.680
You have to think like the
animal to be able to know

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.270
where they're going to go
and what they're going to do,

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.570
and then the economic --

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:19.870
I mean the cultural as well

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.940
as the economic importance
of hunting.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:28.070
So just from this one visit,
I learned all kinds of stuff.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.760
Two years later, I was hired
again by the Arts Council --

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.160
and I was still living
in Idaho --

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.100
to do a survey in that
Bighorn Basin that I mentioned,

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.380
the area around Cody, and
this time, it really --

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.710
it was specifically looking
for hunting traditions,

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.540
because Annie had pulled
together a committee

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.390
of folklorists, and they wanted
to come up with a project

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.910
that they could do, a statewide
research project, and they came

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:54.160
up with hunting as a topic,
largely from John Dorst,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.670
who's a folklorist who has
taught at the university

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.910
for over 30 years and has
been doing a lot of research

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.540
on taxidermy, about
people's images of animals,

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.980
animals in art, of
course hunting.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.010
So they kind of jointly
came up with this idea

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.370
of hunting traditions.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:11.670
It's obvious.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.090
It's everywhere in the state.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.840
So that's how this
project came about.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.690
They wanted to look at the
craft associated with hunting,

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.100
the gear that people make,

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.080
but also the cultural knowledge
that's required to participate

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.960
in this, and they sort
of narrowed their focus

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.750
to really big game
hunting and fishing,

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.170
and there are all
kinds of other hunting.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.920
There are birds and wild fowl,
and there's hunting with dogs

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.750
and hunting of predators, which
is a hot-button issue right now,

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.010
and just do not have the time to
do that, so the focus really was

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:51.080
on big game and fishing,
and hunting brings up a lot

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.050
of issues about the wild,
the domestic, humans going

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.260
into the wild, the
idea of fair chase,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.780
that hunting is an
equal competition,

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.800
that the animals have a chance.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:09.010
It's there's no guarantee,
and that, you know, the rules,

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:13.230
the hunting rules, make sure
that it's an even match.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.000
So humans may have these fancy
rifles with, you know, sights,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.650
and they can shoot
for hundreds of yards,

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:20.950
but you have to be on foot.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.470
You can't chase animals on ATVs.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.140
You can't.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.090
The new rule is you can't
use a drone to go scouting

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:29.520
where the animals are.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.510
They have to put in new rules
to account for new technology,

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.060
so those restrictions -- you
can't shoot from your vehicle,

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.860
you can't shoot from the road
-- to make it fair chase,

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.660
that it's an even match
between humans and animals.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.220
So that's the concept
of hunting.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.120
If you go to an elk farm

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.890
and just shoot an elk
that's standing there,

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.480
that's not hunting.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.840
There's no -- you know,
there's no challenge.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:05.230
So okay. So the other thing that
hunters are very aware of is

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:09.440
that they are taking a
life to benefit their life,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.360
and it's part -- it's been
part of human culture forever.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.330
Humans are carnivores.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.240
But I found this.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.620
I still see hunting
stuff all the time.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.060
I'm just tuned into it now.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.190
But there was an article in
The New York Times Magazine

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.840
with a quote that really
summarizes how most

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.370
hunters feel.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:33.270
He says, "There is a sadness
that only hunters know,

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.810
a moment when lament overshadows
any desire for celebration.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.580
Life is sustained by
death, and though going

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.720
to the field is an act of
taking responsibility for that,

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.880
the killing is not
easy, nor should it be,"

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.490
and most hunters
understand that,

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.980
certainly in Native
American tradition,

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.460
the idea of an animal giving
itself to support people.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.590
So that's a big concept.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:04.510
So I went to Cody to
do this field work.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.830
Annie had given me some leads,

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.390
and there's a folklorist
named Mary Ann Andreas who,

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.660
at the time, was working at the
Buffalo Bill Center of the West,

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.480
which is in Cody,
fabulous museum in Cody,

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.120
and she had told me
about this business,

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.040
this Wyoming Outdoor Outfitters,
that had just closed,

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.060
unfortunately, but
their sign was still up,

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:29.320
this horse really packed,
with panniers and a diamond --

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.690
double diamond hitch in the
harness, and he's ready to go

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:33.990
out packing and hunting.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.860
So I thought this boded well for
my field work that this was here

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.010
on the skyline of Cody.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.680
So a couple of the artists
that I found up there.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.390
A man named Rich Wormington,
who makes bows, wooden longbows

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:53.180
and recurve bows, which are
traditional hunting bows.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.030
Just made them in his
garage in his spare time.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.620
He didn't want it
to be a business,

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:04.870
although he did have a website,
and most bowhunters will start

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.750
out using these fancy new
compound bows that are made

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.560
of high-tech materials, and
they have gears and pulleys

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.860
and sights, and it
makes it easier.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.160
You don't have to be as strong.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.480
They can shoot further.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.300
And Rich was sort of very
careful not to say anything

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.710
against those kind of bows,

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.790
because that's how people
get started in bowhunting,

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.220
and the bowhunting
community is much smaller

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.490
than the gun hunting community,
so he felt like they had

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.690
to stick together, but he feels
like hunting with these kind

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.210
of bows is real hunting.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.120
It takes much more
skill, more strength.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.150
You have to be closer to an
animal, so you have to be better

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.230
at tracking to use them,
and some people who start

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.070
with compound bows eventually
want to learn these kind

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.570
of bows, because it's
more of a challenge.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.620
So he makes -- I
asked him how to --

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.120
just walk me through
the process,

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.710
how do you make these bows,
because I was clueless.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.720
So he has different
kinds of wood

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.020
that have different properties.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.320
Some are more flexible.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.620
Some are stronger.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.920
He combines them.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.260
He laminates them to get the
right qualities that he wants,

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.120
and then he heats them
so they're flexible

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.290
and then puts them in these
molds that he's designed

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:17.750
to put them in shape of the bow,
and then once they're taken out,

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:22.460
they have to be sanded and
finished and tested and gotten

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.220
to the right strength.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.180
I don't understand bow --
they have to do with pounds

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.800
and length, like how
many pounds it takes

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.480
to pull it back, two
feet to shoot it.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.110
Anyway, so he has
all these equipment

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:42.380
that he can get the bows
to exactly the quality

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.550
that he wants, and
they're just beautiful.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:50.960
The first one that he was
holding had snake skin

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.600
on it for decoration.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.630
Okay. Then I was referred to --

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.430
actually, I was talking
to Mary Ann

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.040
and a colleague at the museum.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.370
And her colleague said, "That
guy who goes to our church

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.980
who makes those camp stoves."

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.610
I said, "Camp stoves?"

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.310
I never would have
thought to ask about that.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:14.310
I didn't know people actually
made camp stoves, but this guy,

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.690
Brian Robertson, lives outside
of Cody and was a farmer

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:21.040
and then started repairing farm
machinery to make more money

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.810
and so knew how to work with
metal, and he was a hunter

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.990
and liked to go back
and set up hunting camp.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.710
So he designed this little camp
stove that you can pack up,

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:34.150
pack on a horse, pack
into hunting camp.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.430
So now he sells them
as a business.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:42.840
He also makes bear-proof
food storage containers

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.810
and trash cans that are
used in campgrounds,

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.450
Forest Service campgrounds,
and they have

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.070
to be certified bear-proof.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:54.420
So how do you certify
that's something bear-proof?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.200
You throw it to the bears
and have them test it.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.050
So they take it to -- there's a
bear and wolf discovery center

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.930
in west Yellowstone, so if
he designs a new food storage

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.490
thing, they take it, and I
think they put smelly food in it

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.270
and throw it in with the
bears and let them jump on it

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:12.740
and pound on it, and if
they can't break into it

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.020
in a set amount of time,
it's certified as bear proof.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.330
I just thought that was great.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:20.630
So he has a business.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.540
He sells these, you know,
to the Forest Service.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.210
If he changes his design,
they have to be retested,

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.940
so he doesn't change
the design very often.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.510
He also designed this
cool little camp kitchen

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.810
that packs in.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.890
It's two panniers that you pack
in on a horse, and you pull

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.190
out the legs and the top,

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:41.000
and you have this nice little
kitchen to set up in your camp,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.960
and he told us -- he said, "It's
not necessary to go to the hills

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.420
and be uncomfortable."

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.730
[Laughter] He goes camping.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.030
He has his tent.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.330
He has his cots.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.630
He has his stoves.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.470
He has his nice little
kitchen, you know.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.640
So then he sells these
as a side business.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.160
Then we heard about this guy
named Von Ringler who's a

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.880
leather worker.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.300
Used to -- he learned,
originally,

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.670
from a kit that his wife got
him and then really got into it,

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.330
and there are a lot of
leather workers in Cody.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:14.220
So he learned from them, and
he used to have a storefront,

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.920
and he said there was too much
wasted time, people coming in

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.070
and taking him away from
his work, so now he lives

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.500
about 30 miles north in a
little place called Clark

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:27.400
and has his own shop, and
he specializes in holsters

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:32.730
and gun-related, like cartridge
belts and rifle scabbards,

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.260
and you'd think that would be a
pretty specialized thing to do

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.530
in leather work, but he
makes a living at it.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.560
He actually has a couple
people who work for him.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.860
He has a website.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.480
He'll do custom orders.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.780
People have special guns.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.740
He has a whole collection
of wooden dummy guns

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.530
of different kinds
that he can use

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.840
as models for these holsters.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.160
He invented something he calls
the Wyoming combination holster.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.270
You can wear it either over
your shoulder or on your hip,

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.340
depending on what you're doing.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.120
He sold a thousand of
these, over a thousand,

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.030
because he had his number
1,000 that he had numbered.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:13.370
And so I asked him, you know,
"Where do you sell these?

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:14.670
Do you sell them around town?"

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.910
He said, "Oh, yeah, there's a,
you know, outdoor store in Cody

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.660
that has a bunch of stuff," and
I said, "I was in that store

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.720
and asked the clerk, you know,

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.040
do you have any locally
made gear, and he goes, 'No,

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.810
I don't think so,'
and Von just laughed.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.280
He says, "I have a whole wall of
stuff in there," you know sort

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.900
of standard holsters
and cartridge cases,

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.510
and I think he had some
cell phone holsters.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.630
So I started around the store,

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.110
trying to find some
more local stuff,

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.780
since the clerk obviously
didn't know,

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.660
and came across these
ice fishing jigs,

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.060
which is something else I
wouldn't have thought about,

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.400
but ice fishing is very
popular in Wyoming.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.860
We have lots of winter,
and people don't want

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.530
to stop fishing in the
winter, so they ice fish.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:57.990
So this was a local couple

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.980
that just had this
business making jigs,

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.690
and they're based on lead.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.680
They had molds where
they did the --

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.380
formed the lead pieces
that are sort of the base,

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.180
because you need the -- it
needs to sit down there,

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.870
under the ice, and then they
decorate them with deer hair

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.420
and fluorescent colors.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.110
And so we, Annie and
I, went back later

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.450
and interviewed this --

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.970
these guys that made
these ice fishing jigs.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:28.020
Then I was down in Thermopolis,
which is in the southern part

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.350
of Bighorn Basin, and
walked into this farm

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.750
and ranch supply store and
saw these pack saddles,

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.300
which are pretty
snazzy for pack saddles.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.600
Usually, they're pretty basic.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.250
They're just the bars
that go on the horse

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.560
and the things at the top.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.780
Especially the one on the
left that's all leather.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.570
So I found the store owner
and said, "Who made those?"

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.940
and he gave me the name of
the people who had made them,

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.960
but then he also said -- he
said, "My wife, Cindy Denton,

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.260
does leather work, too.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.300
She's in the back of the
store doing some stuff.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.180
Do you want to go see her?"

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.950
"Yes, of course I do."

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:07.120
So I went back there, and
she just does small projects,

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.960
things like belts and chaps,
and she was working on --

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.040
these are saddle pockets.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.450
They go on the back of a saddle
to just carry your little gear

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.100
in when you're hunting
or whatever,

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.250
and of course it
has an elk on it.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.080
So these are used for hunting.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.540
So that was fun, to see her
very small-scale leather work,

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:33.830
and then I went down to
see Tex and Dale Frasier,

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:39.420
who make those pack saddles
in this little, tiny shop.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.450
Tex grew up -- his family was
outfitters outside of Jackson,

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:46.920
so he grew up packing and
understood how pack saddles work

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.950
and had made some improvements,
where the buckles --

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.130
he moved the buckles so
they weren't under the load,

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.460
so if you had adjust, you didn't
have to unpack your whole load.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.760
Things like that.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.350
So he was making saddles, and
they did lots of repair work

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:07.610
on old saddles and leather
goods in this eensy shop,

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:14.500
and Dale makes panniers out of
nylon and that kind of stuff.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.800
So here's a couple.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.420
There is usually what
pack saddles look like.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.240
He said the fancy leather one he
had made for the Forest Service

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.780
or someone with the
Forest Service,

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.250
but these are the two
basic kind of pack saddles.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.430
The lower one is the crossbuck,
which is sort of the standard,

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.670
just two crosspieces of wood
that you can hang stuff off of.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.720
Sorry. I keep hitting this.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.280
And the other one is
called a decker saddle,

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.500
and those aluminum
parts are manufactured,

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.830
so you have to buy them and
then put them on the bar.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:48.660
Some people prefer one or the
other for the way they pack.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:54.670
So that was my adventures
in the Bighorn Basin.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:58.460
I found lots more people
who make hunting gear,

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.570
talked to another
pack saddle maker,

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:05.500
a couple of leather workers,
saddle makers, some outfitters.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.850
There's lot of that
activity in that area.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:13.870
And then that fall, fall of
2009, is when I started working

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:17.230
at the university,
mainly as a researcher.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.970
Do a little bit of teaching,
but I knew that this Art

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:24.370
of the Hunt was going to be my
project for the next five years.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:29.510
So early on, Annie
had a teenage son

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:33.060
who had taken the hunter safety
course, and she took it with him

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.860
as research, and she
suggested that I do that, too,

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.440
and it was really
interesting to take this.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.300
It's a free course that Fish
and Game offers that everyone

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.570
who gets a hunting license
has to take this course

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:48.260
so they know the regulations
and how to safely carry a gun,

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.580
especially when you're
in a group of people.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.880
Don't shoot toward something

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.380
where you don't know what's
behind it, the laws about --

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.970
you know, you can't
shoot from a vehicle.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:03.360
You can't shoot from a road,
and they really emphasized sort

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.880
of upholding the image of
hunters as conscientious

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.950
and safe and not
these wild, crazy,

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.670
drunk people shooting off guns.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:17.040
They really want to promote
hunting as a family sport,

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.590
as a way to get outside,
you know,

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.290
as a part of Wyoming's
way of life.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.340
They really emphasize that.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.240
So I passed the course
and got this little badge,

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:34.790
and here is a guy talking about
a hunt and sort of what it means

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:40.810
to do a good, ethical hunt.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.110
Whoops.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.090
&gt;&gt; Last fall, I had an animal
hunt, just between Shoshone

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:55.170
and Casper with my son and
my wife, and we went down,

00:28:55.170 --> 00:29:03.390
and we split up, and I went with
my son, and I think, you know,

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:08.040
something that you could be
proud of is this ethical,

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:13.420
those successful hunts, but
where you did everything right.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:21.930
&gt;&gt; You know, we'd been out
sighting in the right formation,

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.480
and with each new bird he shot,

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.000
making sure we were prepared
and had our licenses.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.790
&gt;&gt; And we had our
hunter safety cards.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:36.390
We had our hunter orange so
that we were visible and safe,

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:41.190
you know, and we went down
and we glassed the antelope,

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.380
and we used the binoculars
to view and try and figure

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.850
out which one we wanted to go
after, and we made a choice,

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.150
and we started stalking
him, and actually,

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.450
we bumped into a couple
different groups of antelope,

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:48.930
and which we got a little
sidetracked on, but my son said,

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.230
'No, I really want to
go for that one we saw,"

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.530
and we laid in wait for him.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:52.830
He was out too far, and we
laid there, and we talked,

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.130
and finally, they started
moving our way, and they --

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.430
and moved up, and then in
one shot, he had it down.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:56.730
You know, he had a split-second
opportunity to make the shot,

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:58.030
and he was prepared,
and he did it.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:59.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.630
&gt;&gt; And it went right
down, and it was clean.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:01.930
It was ethical, --

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.530
&gt;&gt; -- and tasty at the
end of the day [laughter].

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:05.830
It was really, really good, and
actually, we don't have a lot

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.130
of mounted wildlife in this
house, but we have his antelope.

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:09.730
&gt;&gt; On the way out, he can look
up on the wall and see it,

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.030
and it's the memory
of that hunt, --

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:13.630
&gt;&gt; -- that it was clean.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:14.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.230
&gt;&gt; It was the way it
was supposed to be done.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.530
You can do it, and that's what
makes it even sweeter than,

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:18.830
you know, rolling down
the window on the highway

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:20.130
and shooting a great, big buck.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.430
That might go into the book.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:22.730
It might be some kind of record.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:24.030
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.330
&gt;&gt; But that's not
much of a memory.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:27.930
&gt;&gt; And it's not --
that's not a fair chase.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:29.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.530
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: So that really
encapsulates what the state is

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.920
trying to promote and
what the vast majority

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.920
of hunters -- how they hunt.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.410
This guy was a singer,
and we had sent one

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:40.710
of our grad students

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.440
out to interview several
singer-songwriters

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.900
if they had written songs
about hunting or fishing.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.520
So the student took along
another student, Peter Gibbons,

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.240
to take photographs,
and Peter -- we came --

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.100
he came back with
these wonderful photos,

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.940
and we realized that Peter
was a fabulous photographer.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.820
So we later recruited
him the next summer,

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.430
gave him an internship with
the Arts Council to go out

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.360
and take portraits of the
artists that we were going

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.720
to include in our exhibit,

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.000
and so all of the really
nice pictures you see

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.300
in this are his.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.600
They're not mine.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.060
He's -- like this one
portrait he made of Audra

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.930
and Mike Draper, who
are knife makers.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.650
Audra studied with a
master knife maker,

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.620
and she actually has master
knife maker certification.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.530
It's this whole process,

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.970
and she's been teaching
her husband Mike

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.270
to make these knives.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.860
So they start with
just plain steel

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.090
and forge them down
and make knives.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:39.280
This is one of hers --
Damascus steel, which is layers

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.990
of different kinds of steel
that are hammered together

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:43.600
and re-layered and
layered and layered,

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.690
and then when you cut them, they
make these beautiful designs.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.420
They look like topographic maps.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.720
Really beautiful stuff.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.120
So this is one of
Audra's knives.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.220
This is Al Darlington,
who's a fish taxidermist,

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.150
which is pretty specialized,

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.760
but he has a full-time
business doing this.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.420
He studied art at the university
and sort of fell into a job

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.930
with a taxidermist and
eventually took over, but fish,

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.370
when they're dead,
they lose their color.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:13.920
The colors fade, so you
have to repaint them

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.320
if you taxiderm [phonetic] them.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.170
So that's his art
background comes in handy,

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.050
being a fish taxidermist,
plus he's a great guy.

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.920
Charles McCall is
someone from Cheyenne.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.040
Used to work for Fish and Game.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.550
He helped us very early on.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.450
He's hunted all his life and
fished, especially fishing.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:34.800
He loves fishing.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.100
He makes flies.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.710
He's taught fly tying.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:40.700
He likes to use natural
materials like feathers

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.970
and deer hair, and he took us

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:47.310
out ice fishing,
which was great.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.930
I had never been ice
fishing, and I wanted

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.850
to see what it was about, and
we had a videographer with us.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.190
We'd been shooting little
sort of video portraits

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.430
of these artists that we had
hoped to use in our exhibit.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.820
We ended up not being able to,
because it was too expensive,

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.560
but we have these videos.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.510
So let me see if this will play.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:08.040
[ Music ]

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.540
&gt;&gt; We're in Crystal
Reservoir right now,

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:14.350
and we're getting ready to
unload our gear and go down

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.170
and see if we can catch a fish.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:22.820
I'll grab the auger and
I'll go out about ten feet,

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.690
and then I'll drill
a hole and will check

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.510
to see how thick the ice is.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:34.870
[ Auger Sounds ]

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:36.900
This one is called
a deezit [phonetic],

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:44.430
and you put it on your hook.

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:48.390
It has the little tentacles,
too, and they have --

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:53.210
they make them in various
colors, but that really looks

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.900
like a fish to me, and
that's what we're going

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.670
to try here in a minute.

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.470
When we were to Evanston
ice fishing,

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:07.240
I had one of those little
red jigs, red-headed jigs

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.460
with the little white
legs on it,

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.330
and it was early in the morning.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:17.590
We were fishing, and my buddy
was in the other ice hut.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:19.140
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.840
Are you getting this?

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.140
[Laughter]

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:23.570
&gt;&gt; And I hooked onto this
big fish and had him hooked,

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:28.090
and I fought him for, oh,
I don't know, maybe --

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:31.420
it seemed like a half-hour,
but it really wasn't.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.720
It was maybe five minutes.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you got him, Bill.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:41.070
Let him wear out, because
I think he's a pretty

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.430
good-sized one.

00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:51.610
&gt;&gt; And when I got him straight
up and down, he just went

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:54.600
like that and knocked
that -- busted my line.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:59.660
&gt;&gt; Well, we'll see
if we get him out.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:05.610
&gt;&gt; You could hear some language
coming from that ice hut

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:09.300
for a little while [laughter].

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.730
Later on in the day, there
was another guy fishing

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:20.890
over by the dam, and he caught a
big fish and won the tournament.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:24.560
We happened to know that guy,
and we were talking to him

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.080
when he was up getting
his prize.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.380
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.680
&gt;&gt; This is a nice fish.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.980
He really is.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.550
He's a nice one.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:36.940
He said, "You know, there
was a big fish with this fish

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.380
that had a jig in its
mouth," and I said, "Well,

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.850
what kind of a jig was that
and what color was it?"

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.470
and he said, "Well, it was kind
of a lead head with a red head

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:46.770
on it with the long,
white tentacles on it."

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.070
&gt;&gt; Oh!

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.370
&gt;&gt; Guess whose fish
that was [laughter].

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.670
And once in a while,
this is what happens.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.970
You get lucky.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:53.270
I would say this fish
probably goes about,

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.570
oh, maybe four pounds.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:55.870
Well, it's been a lot of fun.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:57.170
Met a lot of nice
people, and we've got

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:58.470
to see a nice, big fish caught.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:59.770
&gt;&gt; Okay, here he goes.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:01.070
&gt;&gt; Change the song, then.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.370
&gt;&gt; We've got a family wager
that the first fish is a dollar,

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:03.670
the most fish is another dollar,

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:04.970
and the biggest fish
is another dollar,

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:06.270
so if you catch the
biggest fish right off,

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:07.570
you at least got three
dollars [laughter].

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:08.870
Is that funny?

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:10.170
[ Music ]

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.470
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: So
that was a lot of fun.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.590
Ice fishing is mostly sitting
and waiting, and it's --

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:17.180
we were really lucky that he
caught that fish on camera,

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.840
[laughter] and he has a great
"the one that got away" story,

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.640
too, that goes with it.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.340
So here are a couple of other
artists that we worked with.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.220
This is Jim Blair,
who's an engraver.

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:31.670
Works with both gunsmiths
and knife makers

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:34.250
to engrave their pieces.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:36.520
Just incredible detail.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.800
Beautiful work.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.440
Carla Snook lives
back up in Hulett.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.110
When I was doing
that first project,

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.910
I had seen all these
metal signs.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:49.530
There are lots of -- like ranch
gates will have a metal sign

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:53.710
across the top of people
roping or whatever.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:55.760
You'll come into a town,
and there will be a sign

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.240
for the town that will be
this cut-out metal design,

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.490
and I saw lots of them all over
this county, and I kept asking

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:03.830
who made these signs,
because they were really nice,

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:06.610
nicer than the usual
ones, and finally,

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.280
the last day I was
there, I found --

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.040
somebody told me
it's Carla Snook,

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.780
and she's the art
teacher at the school.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:16.800
So I didn't have time to talk
to her, but I found her mailbox,

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.950
so I knew this was the
right person, and we had --

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.350
Annie and I had always wanted
one of those entry gates

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.220
for this exhibit, so when
-- I went back later,

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.960
when we were designing the
exhibit, and we commissioned her

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.580
to make the metal part.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.550
So here's one of the pieces,

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.850
and you'll see the
full gate later on.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.150
She grew up on this ranch.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.510
She still lives there.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:41.460
She learned to do these metal
signs just as a sideline

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.910
and just does all her own
designs and cuts them by hand,

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.240
and some people have
these computerized things

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.140
that will print out metal signs,

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:54.470
but hers are all
individually done.

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:57.320
This is John Jones, who
makes bamboo fly rods.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.110
We found a couple of
people who made these.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.740
It's a very meticulous process.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.480
They're made out of
bamboo that only comes

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.830
from one particular
region of China.

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:10.160
They're hexagonal, so you
have to make six little splits

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.330
and then shape them and put
them together, glue them.

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:18.650
He worked as a machinist in
the coal mines near Gillette,

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.960
so he has made a lot
of his own equipment.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.490
This one jig sort of -- once
it's glued, it's wrapped

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:26.580
with string to hold it together
and then put in this oven

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.830
and then baked so the glue
sticks, and he made all

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:34.160
of this equipment, and then he
goes out and tests them himself.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.150
He's -- all of these
gear makers are hunters

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:40.670
and fishers and use their gear.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:43.450
Sticking with fishing,
this is Marvin Nolte,

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:46.430
who makes what are
called salmon flies,

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:48.480
which are really not
a Wyoming tradition,

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.980
not at all a Wyoming tradition.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.070
It was from the British Isles.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:54.070
They used to fish
these big salmon,

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.140
I guess ocean-going
salmon, in the rivers,

00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.190
so they made these big --
this shows you how big.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:04.290
They're this big, and
they've turned into this sort

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:07.190
of art form and collector's
item.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:08.490
So he makes these.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:10.530
He has all kinds of exotic
feathers that he uses

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.920
to make these salmon flies that
are just gorgeous, and so we had

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.220
to have him in the exhibit.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.150
Even though they're
not used in Wyoming,

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:18.760
they're made in Wyoming.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.750
There are loads of
decorative art

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:25.490
with hunting themes
-- quilts, rugs.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:31.130
That first opening slide,
that's a hooked wool rug.

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:34.730
Things made out of antlers,
like antler chandeliers.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.500
I've always wanted one.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.340
Cribbage boards that
are made out of antlers.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.810
Carved wooden fish or
wooden animals -- birds.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:47.500
This is a Native American
beadwork tradition.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.070
This is a Shoshone artist
named Glenda Trosper.

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:51.720
They're like photographs.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.730
The detail in these pieces
is amazing, and she does lots

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:58.390
of pieces with native
animals in them.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:01.470
Just incredible work.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:04.300
Here's another fish rug.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.360
This is my fish rug.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.410
I found it in a store
in Aladdin.

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:13.160
There were a couple of
these rugs and chair pads,

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.440
and I could tell they were --
someone local had made them,

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.540
and I just loved this smiling
fish, so I had to buy it.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.750
So I asked, when I checked
out, "Who made this?"

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.750
and they gave me the name
of the woman who made it,

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.910
who lived back in the country,
and I ended up going back

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:30.340
and interviewing her, and she
just buys old wool clothes

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.070
from thrift shops and
cuts them into strips

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.850
and makes these hooked
rugs with, again,

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:38.790
using designs from nature.

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:42.630
That's very common in the state.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:45.090
So the ultimate goal of
this project had always been

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:46.390
to have an exhibit.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.590
So we had been talking to
the state museum in Cheyenne,

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:51.800
and they were very excited,
but they said, you know,

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.820
"We don't have the staff
or the capability to design

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.120
and build this exhibit.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.550
You'll have to find
an outside company,

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.440
which we had not been expecting,

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.460
so we had to push
everything back a year.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.310
We had to raise a
bunch of money.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.190
We did have funding
from the NEA.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:12.240
Wyoming has a cultural trust
fund which gave us a lot

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:16.270
of support, our humanities
council, both of our agencies,

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:19.490
and we hired a company
called Split Rock Studios

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:24.360
out of Saint Paul, Minnesota,
a very well-known design firm.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.310
We were thrilled to have them.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:29.740
So we worked with them to design
this exhibit, and we had kind

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.270
of planned out a
storyline, Annie and I,

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:33.570
sort of an introduction.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:34.870
What is folk art?

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:36.850
Then sort of planning
for the hunt, preparing,

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:41.060
making all the gear, being
out in the field, camping,

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.350
storytelling, back home
after the hunt, taxidermy,

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:48.140
all the things that are
made with materials,

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:52.090
or decorative items, and then
we added a last section on sort

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.000
of conservation efforts.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.170
Hunters will tell you
they're the biggest

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:57.900
conservation supporters.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.410
They are, because they want lots

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:02.960
of open space and
land and animals.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.420
So there are things like there's
a one-shot antelope hunt,

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.780
which is sort of a competition
between the governors of Wyoming

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.600
and Colorado, but it's all men.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.900
So about five years ago,

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:18.230
the Wyoming Women's Foundation
started a women's antelope hunt,

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.800
which has been extremely
successful, very popular,

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.620
and get more women
involved in hunting,

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.430
and there are more women.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:27.480
The number of hunters in general
is declining, but the number

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.700
of women is increasing.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:35.450
So we sent the designers
hundreds of photographs

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:38.060
and interview transcripts,
and somehow they pulled all

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.490
that information and, you know,

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:42.530
produced all the exhibit
text and the labels.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.270
We told them which artists
we were going to have

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:47.950
and which pieces in general
we were going to have,

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.620
and they were wonderful
to work with.

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:54.000
So meanwhile, Annie and I
were picking out objects.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.700
This is a whole bunch
of taxidermy

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.620
that the museum insisted
was quarantined

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.130
to make sure they didn't
have bugs [laughter].

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.770
They didn't want bugs in their
museum, so they were lying

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:04.890
around in the Arts
Council's back office

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:07.400
with [laughter] bug
stickers on them.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:12.750
And in general, we allowed
artists to send us pieces

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:14.570
that they wanted displayed.

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.640
So we might say a particular
-- like we asked Von Ringer,

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.850
"We want one of those
Wyoming combination hostlers."

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:21.250
So he sent one that
was very plain.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.820
It didn't have a lot of fancy
tooling, and Annie was sort

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.210
of surprised, thought
he might want

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:28.090
to show off his fancier work,

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:30.110
and she asked him why he chose
that, and he said, "Well,

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.640
that's what most hunters
would take into the field,

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.280
would be a basic,
functional, not a fancy piece,"

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.850
which totally makes
sense, you know.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:43.500
So we let them choose
what they wanted to send,

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.310
and J. R. Butler, the
taxidermist, was helping us

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:47.610
with a number of pieces.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:50.290
He got us an elk, an elk
head, which we really wanted,

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:54.000
and he had sent photos of
a number of pieces for us

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.130
to choose from, and
this was one of them.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:58.720
It's very unusual.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.520
It's an unusual specimen.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:05.380
The buck has these weird
antlers, and apparently,

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.990
the owner had told J. R. just

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:10.230
like do what you want
with it [laughter].

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.530
Your face.

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:15.300
So it has this arm with holding
a bow made out of some kind

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.270
of material that he uses to
make fake rocks and stuff.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:22.000
So we were -- it's like, "Well,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.550
this is really interesting
[laughter], and this is --

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:28.380
" John Dorst said this is
really a trend in taxidermy,

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.450
to make these art pieces
or to tell a story,

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.740
but this was pretty
far-out in the world

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.760
of traditional taxidermy,
and the exhibit -- we were --

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.170
and we wanted the best stuff.

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:41.900
We wanted excellent quality
stuff, but really sort

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.610
of representing the traditions,
and this is pretty far

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:48.040
out on the tradition
scale of things.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.340
So we talked about it.

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.250
We were afraid it would be
too distracting from the rest

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:56.520
of the show, that this would end
up being a focus, and went back

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.170
and forth about it and, you
know, finally wrote him back

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:00.970
and said, you know, "Here
are the pieces we want,

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:04.160
but I don't think we can really
use that piece on the pedestal

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.810
with the arm," [laughter]
and he was very upset.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.780
He really wanted this
piece in the show,

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.400
because he considers
himself an artist.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.790
This was something where he
was really artistic and wanted

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:20.000
to show this off, and an artist
wants people to look at his work

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.680
and go "wow," and we wanted
people to go "nice taxidermy"

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:30.670
and will not be distracted,
but he convinced us to let --

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:32.540
you know, to include
it in the show,

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.130
and he had been so
helpful to us.

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.710
So he and his son were --
loaded up a van and, you know,

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:40.150
they brought all their
pieces down to Cheyenne,

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:43.090
and including this giant elk.

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:45.490
So we unloaded the van,
and this piece wasn't

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.170
in it, and we asked him.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:49.620
We said, "Well, how about
that piece with the arm?"

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.080
and he said, "Oh, there wasn't
room for it with all the rest

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.630
of this other stuff I was
bringing, so I didn't bring it,"

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:57.200
you know, so we were
like, "Phew."

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.890
[Laughter] That solved
that problem,

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:02.820
but it raised a lot of issues.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.940
You know, what is
traditional taxidermy,

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:08.470
and what is the direction of
taxidermy, and who decides?

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:11.510
I mean you can do a whole
exhibit around this piece

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:14.330
and talk about all
of these issues.

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:18.940
It just wasn't something we
were expecting to deal with.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:23.430
So once we got through
all of that,

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:27.150
this giant moving van showed
up from Minnesota just

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:31.260
after the Fourth of July with
all of the exhibit stuff in it,

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.930
and they had three people
on their crew there who came

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:36.740
with it and unloaded everything.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:41.170
They had all the cases, and some
of the pieces were too big to go

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:44.970
in the freight elevator, like
our mule, whose name is Art.

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:48.380
They had to carry them
up through the museum,

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:51.210
and the visitors got a
big kick out of that.

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.320
So they were there for two
weeks seven days a week,

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.820
12 hours a day, doing this
installation, and Annie

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:59.300
and I had to be there
the whole time,

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.340
because there were all
kinds of little decisions.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.600
Which label goes with
which fishing rod,

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.000
and where do you
want to hang the elk?

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.610
And so it was pretty
intense, and we were --

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:14.140
we have a Facebook page called
Art of the Hunt: Wyoming.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.760
We haven't posted for a
while, but it's still there,

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.240
but I've been taking
photos of the installation

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.540
and posting them and trying

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.430
to get excitement
about the exhibit.

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:26.100
So they had brought in this
guy to hang murals for a couple

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:30.240
of days, and so I posted this
picture that included the mule,

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.050
and a guy who was on the board

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:36.570
of the state parks
immediately responded.

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:37.870
I don't think it
was on Facebook.

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:40.470
I think he wrote head of
state parks, and he said,

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.590
"That's not the kind of
packs we use in Wyoming."

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:45.540
I think it's called a
box pack, and he said,

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.280
"They do that in Montana.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.930
We don't do that here.

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:51.130
We tie our packs with
a double diamond hitch,

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:52.890
and that's what should
be in this exhibit.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:54.490
This is wrong."

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.640
So that word got back to
us pretty quick [laughter].

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:04.310
Oh. So the museum -- and we
had wanted interactive stuff

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:06.500
in the exhibit, so they
had tried to find a pack

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.810
where people could
practice tying the knots.

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:11.230
Visitors could actually
tie the knots.

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:14.480
So the exhibit company had
researched and found this type

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:19.910
of pack where you could do that,
but we didn't double-check,

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:22.420
which we did with most
other things, you know,

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:24.970
if they had sent us
this information.

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:27.500
We should have gone
to a packer and say,

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.570
"Is this accurate for Wyoming?"

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:30.870
We didn't.

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:32.650
So this guy said, "You
know, this is wrong.

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:33.950
You can't do this.

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:35.620
I'm going to tell all my friends
not to come to your exhibit,"

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.480
and so we had to scramble.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:42.640
The museum really wanted to keep
the hands-on part, and we said,

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.500
"No, we have to -- the
people we want to come

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.080
to this exhibit are the
people who will know,

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.290
the people who are
hunters and packers,

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:52.950
and if they see something
wrong, they will let us know,

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:55.000
and we have to do it right."

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.950
So we took the packs
off, and for a while,

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:58.660
we thought we would just
leave the pack saddle

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.010
so people could see it, because
if it's got a pack on it,

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.950
you can't see it, but then
once the exhibit opened,

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:06.030
the museum found that people
were putting their kids

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.470
up here [laughter] and
taking pictures of them.

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:12.220
I said, "No, we cannot
have that."

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.490
So we got in touch with a packer
friend of ours, Ollie Hill,

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:17.890
and had him -- we had
to buy all this gear

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:21.720
and had him pack it properly and
tie this double diamond hitch,

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.800
which is beautiful, but it's
not something people can do.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.100
It's too complicated.

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:29.690
So we lost the hands-on element,
but we have the right kind

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:33.550
of pack there, and we should
have -- I mean that's our fault.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:35.760
We should have researched
it better.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.180
We did it with things, like
guns, that we knew we knew --

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.740
didn't know anything about.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:42.410
We would write a label and
send it to the gunsmith

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:44.030
and say, "Is this correct?"

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:47.350
You know, the caliber and the
type of stock and whatever,

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:49.440
because we knew people --

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:55.140
we hoped people who
came were going to know.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.500
So the exhibit got finished.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:01.000
Here's our entry
gate, which is --

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.380
we had been dreaming
about for years.

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:05.060
We had -- Carla did
the metalwork.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.610
We commissioned the metalwork.

00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:09.630
It looks like a typical
ranch gate.

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:13.040
There was an introductory
panel on what is folk art,

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.800
what is folklore to kind
of give people the idea

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.470
of how we were approaching
this material.

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:23.500
The first section is a fly-tying
bench and a leather workshop

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.020
and the getting prepared,
making your stuff.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:29.890
Then you came around to
where you were in camp.

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:31.190
We had a tent company

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:34.890
in Sheridan make a little
short piece of tent for us.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:36.190
There's the camp stove.

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:39.390
We had a corral with some
saddles and horse gear.

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:43.470
Inside the tent, we had
the firearms and knives,

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:46.600
and we had some bows
and arrows in the tent.

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.860
Then you came around the corner,

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:53.630
and there was this campfire
scene, and that dome up above,

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:57.000
if you walked under it, it would
trigger little audio sections.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.620
We had about a dozen little
short stories, hunting stories.

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:05.760
Then you came around to the
back home, all of the taxidermy,

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.930
the decorative arts, the
quilts, the wood carving.

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:10.370
Here's looking the
other direction.

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:14.190
We had a little café
table with a menu

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:17.380
with some recipes
for cooking game.

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:21.990
So we had an opening
reception first of August.

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:26.180
About a dozen of the artists
came, including Tex and Dale,

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:29.530
posing here with their
photograph that was made

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:31.420
into a directional sign.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:35.110
The caterer's husband was
a hunter, so we had venison

00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:39.270
and trout for refreshments
at the opening,

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:45.760
and then we had another
reception for legislators

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.090
at the beginning of the year.

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:50.100
They only meet early in the
year, and here's a couple

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.800
of them sitting with
the head of state parks

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.530
and cultural affairs, listening
to some of the stories,

00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:00.790
and here's a story from
our governor, Matt Mead,

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:03.320
who grew up in a ranching
family near Jackson,

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.200
and he has a hunting story about
hunting with his grandfather,

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.010
who was also the governor.

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:13.150
Oops. Go back.

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:14.720
That's supposed to play.

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.690
&gt;&gt; I did grow up hunting,
and it's interesting,

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:21.120
because the family was
a big hunting family,

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.230
because my great-grandparents'
homestead is in Teton County,

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:26.300
and they were ranchers,
and at that time

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:29.840
in our state's history,
especially with ranchers,

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.540
you know, beef was
considered quite a luxury,

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.100
and in other words, you
didn't eat your own product,

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:40.660
and so my great-grandparents and
my grandparents and even my mom,

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.310
you know, when you
talked about meat

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:49.560
for them personally consuming,
it was through hunting,

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.970
and whether it was
elk, antelope, moose,

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:53.640
that's how they fed themselves.

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.060
They didn't go butcher
the fat steer.

00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:01.500
They took care of
themselves through hunting,

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:04.460
and so from an early age,
that was instilled in me,

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.950
and the value of hunting is
it's not only great recreation,

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:09.670
it's not only great
for getting around

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:14.690
and seeing Mother Nature's
wonders, but it's really a way

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:19.850
to sustain yourself, and I
can't remember how old I was,

00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:24.970
but I was young, and my first
hunt was with my grandfather,

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:29.460
Cliff Hansen, and it was
the day before Thanksgiving,

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:33.960
and we went out on
the ranch to a place

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.470
where we have a spring crick,
and so very open water,

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:45.180
and he had a big side-by-side
double-barrel shotgun,

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:50.220
and he was worried that I
couldn't stand and shoot it,

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:54.460
because he was worried it'd
knock me down, and so we snuck

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:58.390
over the crick, and
he had me sit down,

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:03.610
and then he sat behind
me and braced me,

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:06.900
and a mallard came
by, and I didn't wait

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.200
for the mallard to fly.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.030
He wanted me to make
sure I hit the bird,

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:15.720
and I did hit the bird, and
then he made a big production

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:21.470
of us cleaning it, and then
we had it for Thanksgiving,

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:24.690
and as a little kid, that
was a big, big deal to me.

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:28.830
&gt;&gt; That's a great hunting
story, and the governor,

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:30.600
he was really excited
about this project.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.360
I think he came to
see the exhibit.

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:34.450
I mean it's right across
the street from the capitol,

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:39.850
so we never heard
specifically, but --

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:42.690
and then in conjunction with
the exhibit, we did a series

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:45.580
of artist demonstrations
and panel discussions

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:49.140
that were funded by our
state humanities council.

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:53.030
So here's Rich Wormington with
his bows in the various stages

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:56.500
of production, so people
could see the process.

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.760
This guy, Ty Hallock,
we actually didn't know

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.580
about when we put
the exhibit up.

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:10.420
He decorates coolers and fly
tackle boxes with these drawings

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:12.800
of fish that he does
with Sharpies.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.180
These are just great, and we
definitely would have had one

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.300
in the exhibit, but we didn't
know about him in time,

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:21.250
but we had him at one
of our demonstrations.

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:25.300
Karen Mott from Lander, she
raises sheep and processes it,

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:28.050
and then she makes
cinches for saddles.

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:29.750
So she has this jig
that she made up,

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:34.290
and she's making a
cinch out of her wool.

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:39.200
This is Ollie Hill,
who packed our mule.

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:42.150
He had this funky
horse that he made

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:46.700
to show how you pack an
animal for going back

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.840
into the back country,
and then we did a --

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.220
we had four panel discussions.

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:57.070
The first one was taxidermists
that John moderated.

00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:59.210
We had one with guides
and outfitters.

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:02.000
We had one with family
traditions, and we had one

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.630
with game wardens, and game
wardens have excellent stories,

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:09.540
because they're always out on
adventures and chasing people,

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:12.730
and people are giving
them these insane stories

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:14.590
about how the deer got in
the back of their truck

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:15.970
without a tag, and [laughter]

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:19.740
so we had a really
great panel discussion

00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.830
with these three game wardens,

00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:23.230
and then I just love
this picture

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:25.470
of these little girls
talking to Kim Olsen.

00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:28.400
It's like, "I could be a
game warden, you know."

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.640
You can just see they
just idolize her.

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.970
"I can wear a red shirt."

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:35.900
And these are the same kids in
the picture with the bow maker.

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.700
I realized when I was
putting this show together.

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:39.370
It's like, "That's
the same family."

00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:41.790
So I assume they're a
hunting family and came

00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:44.940
to several of our productions.

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:48.290
So the exhibit was up
for just over a year,

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:49.780
and all of the artists were
really honored were really

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:52.020
honored to be part
of it and thanked us,

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:55.240
and part of the goal was to
help people know about them

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.400
and maybe help them
in their business.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.280
I don't know if that
actually happened,

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:03.140
but they were all really
pleased to be included.

00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:06.130
So this is all that's
left of the show,

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:11.130
the top bar of the gate, but
you can see Carla's metalwork.

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:14.390
This is hanging in the Arts
Council office, so Annie gets

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:19.090
to look at it every
day, but we are --

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:22.260
Annie and I are still
so tuned into hunting.

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.940
We just became aware of how deep
and how wide its influence was

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:27.630
in the state, and we
keep seeing things.

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.910
We call it the project
that won't die [laughter].

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:32.220
There's always more to see.

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.360
I was out in Green River
last fall and walked

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:37.680
by this meat processing company
and had to take a picture

00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.980
of their sign, and they have

00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:42.880
that nice little
battling elk metalwork

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.730
on top of their building.

00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:50.460
It's just a pervasive
part of Wyoming culture,

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:54.490
and we were just really thrilled
that we were able to get

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:59.500
into it, and now we can't
get out of it [laughter].

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.780
So that's my talk, and
this is another one

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.650
of Glenda's beadwork pieces.

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:10.380
So if anybody has any questions
or if there are any hunters

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:14.380
who have -- does this
ring true with you?

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:15.910
Bill?

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:17.800
&gt;&gt; This has been a
great exploration

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:21.770
of the physical stuff
with hunting.

00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:25.590
What about their stories that
you had, and I guess traditions?

00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:28.940
I always heard when a person
kills their first deer,

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.330
they rip their shirt
or whatever.

00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:32.010
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: They
rip their shirt and --

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:33.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:34.610
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:36.020
Yeah, we had a lot of those
stories, stories about the one

00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:40.110
that got away, the
stories about --

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:42.650
several people told us stories
about teaching their kids

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:44.790
to hunt, and they
taught their kids

00:58:44.790 --> 00:58:48.960
that you don't just go wantonly
shoot things like squirrels

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.530
and birds, and if
a kid did that,

00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:52.540
they would make them clean
the animal and eat it,

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:57.760
because you don't waste
food, you know, so those kind

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:01.920
of lessons that people
are passing on their kids,

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.480
stories about maybe -- you know,
someone might have had a chance

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:10.490
at this beautiful trophy buck,
but they never were in a place

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:14.220
to really get a good clean,
shot, the idea of a clean shot.

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:16.480
You don't make the
animal suffer.

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.060
We heard lots of those stories.

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:20.420
You know, just the lessons.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:24.320
&gt;&gt; And have you done anything

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.100
with these stories
other than enjoyed them?

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:27.400
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham:
[Laughter] They're

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.820
in our archive, in
our collection.

00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:33.750
Some of those, that little
campfire scene, you know,

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:37.100
we had some of those shorter --
you know, the two that I played,

00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:41.030
the governor and the guy about
the good hunt with his kid.

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:44.120
So we had several of
those in the exhibit as,

00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.420
you know, the audio track.

00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:58.420
&gt;&gt; Do the same families tend
to be both hunters and fishers,

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.110
or are they one or the other?

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:03.430
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: There
are a lot more fishers,

01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:10.300
just because it's simpler
to do, less equipment.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.090
Somehow killing a fish is not
the same as killing a deer.

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:14.550
You don't have to deal with --

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:17.470
so there are a lot
more people who fish.

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:21.840
I would say most hunters
probably also fish,

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.180
but not necessarily
fishers also hunt.

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:29.000
Hunting is a pretty
big undertaking.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.030
&gt;&gt; Is catch and release
common with ice fishing?

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:33.830
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Apparently.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:37.140
[ Laughter ]

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.440
Yeah.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.250
&gt;&gt; One of the things
that's common among hunters

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:45.460
in this area are
supernatural stories.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:55.400
I don't know if you've ran
across those kinds of stories,

01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:04.470
where the legends of
the area get bound

01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:09.880
up with the hunter's lore.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:15.430
Like, you know, a
dog, it gets excited,

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:18.650
and they think they're
going after game,

01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:26.500
and hunters are running after
the dog as fast as they can,

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:34.230
the dog runs into a graveyard
and then sits down and howls,

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:35.530
-- because whatever --

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:36.830
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Oh.

01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:38.130
&gt;&gt; -- the dog was
chasing, it was --

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:39.430
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Isn't there.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:40.730
&gt;&gt; -- gone.

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.030
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:43.330
There are sort of legendary
animals that people see

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:44.630
for years and sort of
really don't want to kill,

01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:47.260
because it's this majestic,
giant beast, and yeah.

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.300
So I'm sure there
are those, yeah.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.600
&gt;&gt; Is that a bag?

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.900
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yes.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.200
Yeah.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.500
&gt;&gt; Did you deal with
buffalo hunting at all?

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.800
Are there buffalo?

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.100
Do people hunt buffalo
in [inaudible]?

01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.400
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Yeah.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.700
They're not really wild.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.000
I mean the ones that
roam are in Yellowstone,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.500
and you're not allowed
to hunt in Yellowstone.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.870
The tribes have some.

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:07.170
Thanks for coming.

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:08.470
The tribes have recently
reintroduced

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:09.770
and gotten their own herds, and
I think they maybe sell licenses

01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:11.070
for a few hunts on
the reservation,

01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:12.370
but they're generally
not out wandering around.

01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:13.670
There's bison farms where people
raise them for their meat,

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:14.970
but they're not out
roaming around,

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:17.270
generally, like they used to be.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.500
Okay. Oh.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.450
&gt;&gt; Did you come across any
like, well, local organizations

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:31.140
that would put out, you know,
periodic newsletters and things

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:35.330
like that, or like for
community gatherings,

01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:40.040
like or was it more individual
sort of family-based groups?

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.340
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Some of both.

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.040
They're -- a number of
communities will have

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.860
like game dinners,
where people will bring

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:49.650
in their wild game prepared
in different ways, you know,

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:52.860
and you have a tasting, so
you could try, you know,

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:58.830
venison enchiladas or
[laughter] -- so there is that.

01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:02.250
Of course, there are, you know,
loads of local organizations

01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:04.180
and state organizations.

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:09.720
There's hunters or Sportsmen
for Public Lands that want

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.380
to preserve public lands.

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.100
This idea of federal lands
being given to the state --

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:18.020
they do not like that,
because they want those open

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.320
public spaces.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.620
That's where you can hunt.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:23.350
&gt;&gt; I think that --

01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:24.650
&gt;&gt; Andrea Graham: Okay.

01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:25.950
