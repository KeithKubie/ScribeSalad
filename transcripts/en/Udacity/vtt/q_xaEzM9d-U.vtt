00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, this was a really tricky question.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You might have been tempted to choose this first answer.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I can understand why--1, 1, 2, 2--seems pretty equal.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But not quite, because this left column has units of speed or velocity,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and this right has units of distance.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's like comparing apples to oranges. They can never be truly equal.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A better thing to say is that they're proportional,

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and that there's some constant of proportionality which relates the two.
