00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.189
Okay. Let's move on and now we're going to

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:04.900
talk about HTTP. If you recall, this was what

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.490
we described as the main protocol of the

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.630
Web. This is what your browser uses to talk

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.860
to the, to Web servers. HTTP stands for

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.320
HyperText Transfer Protocol. The request from your browser for

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.850
the URL www.example.com/foo, begins with a request line, it'll

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.350
look something like this. This is the request line,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.360
now HTTP is a, a very simple text

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.970
protocol. So, this text is sent over the Internet

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.020
to the server, just like this, it's human readable

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.032
too. The request line has three main parts. First

00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:42.490
there's the method, next is the path and finally

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.072
is the version. The method is what type of

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:47.810
requests are making to the server. The most common

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.380
method by far is GET. And this is how

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.670
you GET a document from the server. Other popular

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.080
methods are GET and POST. There are other ones, but

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.040
these are the ones we're going to use in the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.540
class. Next is the path. In this case, it's /foo.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.810
You remember this from the URL. But the path

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.170
and URL comes here. This is the actual document we're

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.360
requesting from the server. And finally is the version. It's

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.570
always http/ and then a version number. Most browsers and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.690
servers these days speak at 1.1, but we'll also

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.225
touch on 1.0 a little bit in this class. Because

00:01:24.225 --> 00:01:26.330
1.0 has, you know, a few uses of its

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.100
own. Now, you're wondering where the host name is in

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.720
this request line? It's not here. All that's here

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.940
is the path. We're connected to this host, your browser

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.160
connected to this host. Or, if we're playing around

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.570
with HTTP, we made the connection. But that's how we

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.790
know where we are. So that's, this is used for making

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.440
the connection, and the path is used for making the request.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.840
Let's have a quick quiz.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.300
Given the following URL, example.com/foo/logo.png?P=1#tricky, what

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.653
is the request line to get this URL using HTTP 1.1?
