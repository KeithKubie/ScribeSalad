I'm here to address
the allegations

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.938 line:0%
 
of inappropriate
behavior on my part.

00:00:04.972 --> 00:00:10.944 line:0%
 
It's amazing that in 2014, there
can still be a witch hunt.

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:14.181 line:0%
 
I'd like to thank everyone
who has stood by me,

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.851 line:0%
 
especially my
beautiful husband, Trentman.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.119 line:0%
 
Yes, you have a question?

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.288 line:0%
 
Can you explain the graphic
photos of yourself

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.756 line:0%
 
that you tweeted?

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.359 line:0%
 
I tweeted those photos
privately to my doctor,

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.028 line:0%
 
who was available only
via direct message.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.430 line:0%
 
I see, so your doctor's
Twitter handle is

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:32.366 line:0%
 
"Hung as (bleep)"?

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.967 line:0%
 
Correct.
Dr. Hung.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.604 line:0%
 
He is Korean, and yes, my
vagina's in perfect health.

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:40.874 line:0%
 
Thank you for your concern.

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:43.577 line:0%
 
What about the lewd texts
sent from your cell phone

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.245 line:0%
 
to college-aged interns?

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:47.447 line:0%
 
I--
What do you consider lewd?

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.949 line:0%
 
"Your (bleep),
my mouth right now."

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.552 line:0%
 
Okay, that was an
autocorrect issue.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.454 line:0%
 
Now, I'd like to focus
on the work I've done

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:56.223 line:0%
 
since I've been
in office.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.559 line:0%
 
Have there been some scandals?
Yes.

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:00.160 line:0%
 
Have I done a good job?

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:02.296 line:0%
 
No.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.798 line:0%
 
Well, that's why I need
another term.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.133 line:0%
 
Why did you send the guy
an invite

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.801 line:0%
 
to your pussy on Facebook?

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:11.638 line:0%
 
That was a misunderstanding.
I'm new to Facebook.

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:12.739 line:0%
 
You put "invite"
and then "pussy."

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:14.141 line:0%
 
I mean, how confusing
is that?

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.809 line:0%
 
Would you comment, please,
on allegations

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:17.644 line:0%
 
that you were seen coming out
of Slayer's dressing room

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:20.080 line:0%
 
with your face
and hair covered

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.782 line:0%
 
in what appeared to be
tapioca pudding?

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.418 line:0%
 
Um... no.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.619 line:0%
 
We were going through
your old yearbook,

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.855 line:0%
 
and can you clarify
your senior quote,

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:31.925 line:0%
 
"Where you see a fist,
I see a comfortable chair"?

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.494 line:0%
 
I at this time would like
to take the last question.

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:37.531 line:0%
 
Is anything related to not
what you just asked?

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:38.932 line:0%
 
Yes?

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.502 line:0%
 
Yes, what about allegations
you had sexual relations

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:42.703 line:0%
 
with Chris Christie's
dog walker

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:44.271 line:0%
 
while on government property?

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.106 line:0%
 
That wasn't a dog,
that was a prostitute,

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:49.109 line:0%
 
and it was at my gym.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.112 line:0%
 
(all shouting)

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:57.317 line:0%
 
Okay, well, looks like you
caught your witch, all right?

00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:00.487 line:0%
 
This is just a case of
slut-shaming.

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:03.690 line:0%
 
This slut is not ashamed.

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:07.060 line:0%
 
Especially of the perfect puss
pic I tweeted?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.796 line:0%
 
You're welcome!
You are welcome!

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.499 line:0%
 
There are more where that
came from, okay?

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:16.069 line:0%
 
If you're lucky, you'll catch
another glimpse.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.907 line:0%
 
At this time, if anybody has
any further questions,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.077 line:0%
 
you can address them to my
campaign manager... Damone.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:27.848 line:0%
 
Isn't that right, Damone?

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:30.083 line:0%
 
That's it for questions
for the congresswoman.

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:32.319 line:0%
 
Her husband will make
a brief statement

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.955 line:0%
 
while I talk to the
congresswoman in private.

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:42.429 line:0%
 
I just want to say that I love
my wife and I'm standing by her.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.098 line:0%
 
Our private life is just
that, private,

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:47.267 line:0%
 
and I don't think
that she should be punished

00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:49.937 line:0%
 
just because of the perfect
pussy picture

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.905 line:0%
 
that you guys published.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.173 line:0%
 
Thank you.
