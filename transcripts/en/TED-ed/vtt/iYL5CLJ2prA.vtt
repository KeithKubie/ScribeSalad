00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.628
Since the time of Homer,

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:14.578
ancient stories told of fierce warriors 
dwelling beyond the Mediterranean world,

00:00:14.578 --> 00:00:18.669
striking fear into the mightiest 
empires of antiquity.

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.380
Their exploits were
recounted by many epic poets.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.729
They fought in the legendary Trojan War 
and their grand army invaded Athens.

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:30.300
Jason and the Argonauts 
passed by their shores,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.998
barely avoiding their deadly arrows.

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:37.280
These formidable fighters faced off 
against the greatest champions of myth:

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.311
Heracles,

00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.291
Theseus,

00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:41.321
and Achilles.

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:45.841
And every single one 
of these warriors was a woman.

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:51.019
The war-loving Amazons,
"the equals of men" in courage and skill,

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.111
were familiar to everyone in
ancient Greece.

00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:58.101
Amazon battle scenes decorated 
the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis;

00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:03.362
paintings and statues of Amazons
adorned temples and public spaces.

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:05.671
Little girls played with Amazon dolls,

00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:10.402
and Amazons were a favorite subject 
on Greek vase paintings.

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:12.141
In Greek art and literature,

00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:15.131
they were depicted as daring 
and desirable,

00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:16.915
but also terrifying and deadly,

00:01:16.915 --> 00:01:21.082
and doomed to die 
at the hands of Greek heroes.

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:24.981
Were Amazons merely figures of myth,
or something more?

00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:27.517
It was long assumed 
that they were imaginary,

00:01:27.517 --> 00:01:29.602
like the cyclops and centaurs.

00:01:29.602 --> 00:01:33.113
But curiously enough, 
stories from ancient Egypt,

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:34.324
Persia,

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:35.397
the Middle East,

00:01:35.397 --> 00:01:36.463
Central Asia,

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:37.422
India,

00:01:37.422 --> 00:01:38.242
and China

00:01:38.242 --> 00:01:41.403
also featured Amazon-like warrior women.

00:01:41.403 --> 00:01:46.883
And Amazons were described in ancient
historical accounts, not just myths.

00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:52.024
Writers like Herodotus, Plato, 
and Strabo never doubted their existence.

00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:56.379
So who were the real women 
warriors known as Amazons?

00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:00.507
Ancient historians located 
the Amazon homeland in Scythia,

00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:02.398
the vast territory stretching from

00:02:02.398 --> 00:02:05.901
the Black Sea across 
the steppes of Central Asia.

00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:08.695
This immense region was populated 
by nomadic tribes

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.919
whose lives centered on horses,

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:11.928
archery,

00:02:11.928 --> 00:02:13.120
and warfare.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.535
Their culture flourished for about
1,000 years beginning around 800 BC.

00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:22.916
Feared by Greeks, Persians, and
the Chinese, the Scythians left

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:26.636
no written records.
But we can find clues in how

00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:30.486
their neighbors described them,
as well as in archaeology.

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:33.356
Scythians' ancestors were 
the first to ride horses

00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:36.030
and they invented the recurve bow.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.647
And, because a female mounted archer 
could be as fast and as deadly as a male,

00:02:41.647 --> 00:02:44.695
all children were trained 
to ride and shoot.

00:02:44.695 --> 00:02:49.208
Women hunted and fought alongside men,
using the same weapons.

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:52.227
The harsh landscape 
and their nomadic lifestyle

00:02:52.227 --> 00:02:55.007
created its own form of equality.

00:02:55.007 --> 00:03:00.797
This amazed the ancient Greeks, 
whose women led restricted indoor lives.

00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:03.888
The earliest stories of the Scythians, 
and Amazons,

00:03:03.888 --> 00:03:06.619
may have been exaggerated rumors.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:10.739
But as the Greeks began to trade around 
the Black Sea and further east,

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.646
their portrayals became more realistic.

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:17.539
Early depictions of Amazons showed them 
with Greek weapons and armor.

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.758
But in later representations,

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:22.220
they wielded bows and battle-axes,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.347
rode horses,

00:03:23.347 --> 00:03:26.101
and wore pointed caps 
and patterned trousers

00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:29.238
characteristic of steppe nomads.

00:03:29.238 --> 00:03:32.862
Until recently, no one was sure 
how strong the links were

00:03:32.862 --> 00:03:36.170
between Scythians 
and the Amazons of Greek myth.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.851
But recent archaeological discoveries 
have provided ample evidence.

00:03:40.851 --> 00:03:46.234
More than 1,000 ancient Scythian kurgans,
or burial mounds, have been excavated,

00:03:46.234 --> 00:03:48.817
containing skeletons and weapons.

00:03:48.817 --> 00:03:51.065
Archaeologists had previously assumed

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:54.164
that weapons could only 
belong to male warriors.

00:03:54.164 --> 00:03:56.781
But modern DNA analysis so far

00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:59.825
has revealed that about 300 skeletons 
buried with weapons

00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:04.092
belong to females ranging
in age from 10 to 45,

00:04:04.092 --> 00:04:07.166
and more are being found every year.

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:09.543
The women's skeletons 
show battle injuries:

00:04:09.543 --> 00:04:11.762
ribs slashed by swords,

00:04:11.762 --> 00:04:14.211
skulls bashed by battle-axes,

00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:17.473
and arrows embedded in bones.

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:19.744
In classical art and writings,

00:04:19.744 --> 00:04:24.654
the fearsome Amazons were always portrayed
as brave and heroic.

00:04:24.654 --> 00:04:27.295
In male-dominated classical Greece, 
however,

00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:34.162
the very idea of strong women who gloried 
in freedom and war aroused mixed feelings.

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:38.044
And yet, the Greeks were also drawn
to egalitarian ideals.

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:42.167
Is it possible that the mythic realm 
of thrilling Amazon tales

00:04:42.167 --> 00:04:46.194
was a way to imagine women
and men as equal companions?
