Speaker 1:          00:00          There's some fucking, you go into that deep country music. What were you just telling me about country music that some giant country rap. What is the song? It's called Old Town road. Old Town road. Old Town. Like one of the biggest songs out of it's at the, it's number one on the regular church in the country. Took charge, right? You put it together, little nausea x, is that right? Everyone's a little licks. Little Nas. What? A little nausea but so he was on the country charge. They took him off because like this isn't country man, but then he linked up with Miley Cyrus's dad. What's his name? Billy Ray. Cyrus. Billy Ray Cyrus. How dare you. I think what also has to do with this is he used at whether he did it or not, I don't know, but he used the video game, red dead redemption and some of the cool graphics and then made a rap song.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Country rap song. It's called called country trap is what they're calling it. That's why it's a different thing, but it's got, it's got, it's catchy and it's based around this kind of stuff. It got it got hot, it caught, they're caught. The wave country, like the djs on all the stations were like just ripping it off of youtube and playing it. That's why it made it on the billboard. And then build board is like, no, this isn't a country song. Take it off. And then because that almost, it's like Streisand effect. It got bigger. So they um, they who, who, who took it off billboard did, why did they take it off? Because it doesn't, and there third a description was that it doesn't meet the qualifications to meet country with Billy Ray. Cyrus jumped on board and then there's video of him and Billy Ray Cyrus in the studio.

Speaker 1:          01:27          No, it's so interesting when you're looking at the footage of it. How cool. That fucking game. This is just a game. This is, that's a huge game, right? Yeah. Red Redemption two but what a great idea to wrap over real smart Dempson that's a genius idea. I think that game is played in here. Jamie and I would play that game. Yeah. You guys beat the Shit on me. Whatever game we played last than that was quick as, fuck. You don't want to fuck with that game. Do we just talk a little about us? Tom Papa walked in, Jeff and I were in battle into the death. Tom Papa don't play. You know, he was just watching us going, what the fuck are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Tom Pop is so funny, man. He just wants everything to be old school. He's still wants to go to the, to the paper vendor and get a newspaper and bake his own bread.

Speaker 1:          02:08          I take that. What does this Manson, what does that, they've made a remix stuff, but now with Billy Ray, it's just like a real video. Now they've got money. They know. Oh Wow. I'm not feeling the real video too. I liked the way you just do dances with a cowboy hat on. No, but he's low. He's become a star because of this. It's getting played. All the festivals, all the last couple of weeks. The crowds are loving it. Why didn't he open up at Coachella? It was already booked. It's more along. It's just happened so quick. You could sneak them in. Billy Ray Cyrus slip bit, your mind ready to get his whistle wet at Coachella might've played it, I'm sure. But like I saw that little like the Yodel kid was singing this song. Like he's even taught on all kinds of shit. Do you know who Billy Ray Cyrus is until you know his big hit?

Speaker 1:          02:46          Oh yeah. Don't keep breaking my heart. Keep her in a weird, his daughter's way bigger. Um, he was really huge for a brief moment in time. But yeah, he was never like what she is. She, she, she, she can sound to fuck. And she was on that crazy. Disney hit forever. Hannah, my Hannah Montana forever, which made no sense. I put a wig on and nobody knows this video together. This strange. That's so ridiculous. Like Batman, there is glorious locks. God looks like Joe's brother. Yeah. So how from everybody was doing the Achy breaky heart back then, 53 million. I bet that must have fucking freaked him out, man. Take his famous, he was back then for that brief moment in time to sweared are now almost could be famous like back then you could get away with things and now it's a nightmare.
