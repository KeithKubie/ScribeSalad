AYAKA: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.460
INTERVIEWER: Ayaka
is in love with Cain,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.705
a character in
"100 Day Princess,"

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:25.310
a simulated dating app targeted
at women in their 20s and 30s.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:38.959
AYAKA: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:40.500
INTERVIEWER: The
game is about a girl

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.720
who becomes a princess
while wearing a glass

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.230
slipper for 100 days.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.270
The user plays the
role of the princess.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.640
The game was created by Cybird,
one of many companies producing

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.120
these types of apps.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.410
LENA: The term
virtual boyfriend is

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.180
what's most commonly
used in US media outlets,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.690
but most of our fans
don't use that term.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.680
They will refer to
the genre they're

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.660
playing as an otome
game, or some of them

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.100
might call it a romance
game or a love sim.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.330
Otome game when
literally translated

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.560
means a meet in
game-- just basically

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.480
a game for young women.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.900
INTERVIEWER: In an otome
game, the usual objective

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.400
is to fall in love.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.340
Users can often have multiple
boyfriends at one time

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.690
and decide on interactions
with boyfriends that

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.510
decide the fate of the game.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.340
Otome games have fueled
the thriving mobile gaming

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.690
industry, which accounts
for nearly $6 billion

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.960
of the Japanese gaming market.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.136
LENA: Otome games are definitely
our biggest strength right now.

00:01:37.136 --> 00:01:40.220
What sets otome games
apart is definitely

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.000
the amount of reality that
we bring to all of our games.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.630
You really do feel like you're
falling in love with somebody,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.530
and you also feel
like this really

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.420
could happen to me
some time, even if it's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.660
outside of this virtual world.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.660
INTERVIEWER: Games contain
complex plots written

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.010
by a team of predominately
female writers,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.908
and the storylines get creative.

00:01:59.908 --> 00:02:01.710
Other companies
have released games

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.455
where users can date
samurais, historical figures,

00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:07.680
or even pigeons, like
in one game called

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.430
"Hatoful Boyfriend."

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.170
Cybird is hoping its US version
of "100 Day Princess," known

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.490
as "Midnight Cinderella,"
will also become a hit.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.170
LENA: We've had about 1.3
million downloads since we

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.870
released it two years ago.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.670
This is a fantasy
slash romance app

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.320
where you become the
princess of a kingdom,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.740
and your first job is
to find your prince.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.210
There are nine really hot guys
that you get to choose from,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.560
and over the course of
the game, you fall in love

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.900
and find out whether or not
your romance is going to last

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.950
or not.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:03:05.390
NATUSKO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.250
INTERVIEWER: Simulation games
gained popularity in Japan

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.090
in the 1980s, but the first one
designed specifically for women

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.190
was released in 1994
named "Angelique."

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.160
It was made for Super
Nintendo, and it

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.090
set the precedent
for women's games

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.050
in this genre to
focus on romance.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.280
LENA: I think it can be a
great stress reliever when

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.500
you're playing these games.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.000
It's really, really
nice to have a guy who

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.860
lives in your cell
phone who only comes out

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.970
when you want him to.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.670
He loves you unconditionally.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.110
He's just the perfect guy.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:04:01.794
AYAKA: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:04:01.794 --> 00:04:03.210
INTERVIEWER: And
although some may

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.300
be quick to write
off otome games

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.710
as a quirky Japanese
subculture, the genre

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.770
is becoming immensely popular
in the United States, as well.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.450
LENA: Our American
audience has been

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.470
exposed to Japanese
anime and manga

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.610
from a very, very young age.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.510
About 15 to 20 years ago,
"Sailor Moon" and "Pokemon"

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.970
really made a big impact on a
lot of young people's lives.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.540
So they can really relate to
the characters in the game,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.930
and they feel comfortable
with the illustration style.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.790
I think within the
next 5 to 10 years

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.850
this is going to be a very, very
popular genre that most people

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.980
know about and will be playing.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.270
INTERVIEWER: With such loyal fan
bases comparable with cult TV

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.590
shows, otome games
may just become

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.870
another feature of a
typical modern woman's life.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.550
AYAKA: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.750
LENA: I personally feel that
this is just an evolution

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.255
of the romance novel genre.

00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:58.580
I think as people are
shifting away from reading

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.200
and not buying
books, and they're

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.740
spending a lot more of their
leisure time on their phones

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.740
or on tablets, and
that's where they

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.350
get their romantic
satisfaction from.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.600
INTERVIEWER: Be sure to watch
this next episode, which

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.140
looks at how a website helping
young couples book hotel rooms

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.870
is shaking up
conservatives in India.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.400
SUBJECT: [INAUDIBLE]
of confidence

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.216
in these people
[INAUDIBLE] we work

00:05:22.216 --> 00:05:23.974
with are going to be very safe.

00:05:23.974 --> 00:05:25.396
There will be no
questions asked,

00:05:25.396 --> 00:05:29.049
and they'll be given a safe
space. [INAUDIBLE] safe in all.

00:05:29.049 --> 00:05:31.090
INTERVIEWER: Thanks for

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.970
