00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:01.769
- [Voiceover] Today we're
gonna talk about the

00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:03.814
sign convention for passive components.

00:00:03.814 --> 00:00:07.119
It's a big mouthful, but
it's a fairly simple idea.

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:09.299
Well first of all, let's
look at this word passive.

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.026
Passive is the way we describe

00:00:11.026 --> 00:00:13.572
components that do not create power

00:00:13.572 --> 00:00:17.548
or components that do not amplify signals.

00:00:17.548 --> 00:00:20.271
So particularly resistors,
as we have one here.

00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:22.567
Does not amplify a signal.

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:24.659
Capacitors and inductors do not either.

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:29.139
So all three of those
are passive components.

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:31.251
And sometimes we say
something like a battery

00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:33.527
or a voltage source is a passive component

00:00:33.527 --> 00:00:36.168
because it can't amplify a signal.

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:39.337
It does provide power, but it
does not make signals bigger,

00:00:39.337 --> 00:00:43.759
it can't make a voltage
larger than it already is.

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:47.261
So we're gonna start with the
way to label this resistor

00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:49.273
with its current and voltage.

00:00:49.273 --> 00:00:51.548
First we'll resort to Ohm's law,

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:52.626
our friend,

00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:56.687
voltage equals current,
which is i times r,

00:00:56.687 --> 00:00:59.370
and when we label this,
when we label this device,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.540
here's a resistor, so
we'll give that a label,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.183
and we're gonna put a voltage across this,

00:01:04.183 --> 00:01:06.581
something outside of this is
gonna put a voltage across it

00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:10.603
and this end will be positive
with respect to this end.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:13.021
And the question is, the
question we want to answer is

00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:15.053
which direction does the current go?

00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:16.435
When the positive voltage is here

00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:17.592
and the negative voltage is here,

00:01:17.592 --> 00:01:19.970
which way's the current
flow through this resistor?

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.261
Does it go from top to
bottom, or bottom to top?

00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:27.650
The answer is the positive
current goes this way,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.367
it goes down, so that's i in this.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:35.086
And the current is going into

00:01:35.086 --> 00:01:39.248
the end with the positive
sign on the voltage.

00:01:39.248 --> 00:01:41.462
Now I'm gonna draw another one of these,

00:01:41.462 --> 00:01:45.384
same sort of thing, and
we'll do it a different way.

00:01:45.384 --> 00:01:47.650
We'll do this one sideways.

00:01:51.053 --> 00:01:54.202
And I'll label the voltage, here's r,

00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:57.737
and I'll put a voltage on it,

00:01:57.737 --> 00:02:00.096
and the voltage let's label it this way,

00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:01.496
we label the plus end this way

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:03.528
and label the minus end this way.

00:02:03.528 --> 00:02:05.302
The question is which
way does the current go?

00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:07.375
Well the current goes in the positive end

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:09.223
so it goes in that way.

00:02:09.223 --> 00:02:11.043
And that's the sign convention

00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:14.756
for passive components.

00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:18.886
The current goes into

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:21.704
the voltage on the positive
terminal or the voltage.

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:24.446
If I drew the arrow over here like this,

00:02:24.446 --> 00:02:25.828
that would still mean the same thing,

00:02:25.828 --> 00:02:28.001
it's still going in the positive

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:30.420
and coming out the negative side.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.933
So when we draw this for
capacitors and inductors,

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:34.997
let's draw a capacitor over here,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.830
and there's c, and if I
labeled this with a voltage,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.809
plus and minus v,

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.085
then the passive sign convention tells me

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:53.433
that I label the positive
current going in, i.

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:55.302
The same for an inductor.

00:02:55.302 --> 00:02:58.308
We'll draw a curly inductor,

00:02:58.308 --> 00:03:02.624
like that, we'll put a
voltage on it this time.

00:03:02.624 --> 00:03:07.254
I'll put the voltage on
this side, plus, minus v,

00:03:11.094 --> 00:03:13.777
this is our inductor, like that,

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:15.568
and the current,

00:03:22.026 --> 00:03:23.752
the current goes in the top like that.

00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:25.987
So it goes in the same side as the plus.

00:03:25.987 --> 00:03:28.943
And the current comes
out on the minus side.

00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:32.653
You can draw it either way you want.

00:03:32.653 --> 00:03:33.859
Let's practice some more,

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.749
this time we'll do it
with a resistor, again.

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:40.175
Here's another resistor, and
this time I'm gonna label

00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:41.333
the current first.

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.284
I'm gonna say the current goes

00:03:43.284 --> 00:03:47.631
this way through the resistor.

00:03:47.631 --> 00:03:50.130
And now, using the passive component

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.727
sign convention, how do
we label the voltage?

00:03:53.727 --> 00:03:55.738
I wanna label the voltage.

00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:56.957
Where's the plus sign?

00:03:56.957 --> 00:04:00.249
Plus sign is on the side
that the current goes in.

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:02.614
The current's going in to this terminal,

00:04:02.614 --> 00:04:05.700
so that is the plus side

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.886
of the resistor.

00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:12.405
And that's basically the
idea of a sign convention

00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:13.441
for passive components.

00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:14.823
When we're setting up a circuit,

00:04:14.823 --> 00:04:16.225
if we have a complicated circuit,

00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:18.337
we're setting it up, we have to give names

00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:20.552
to all the voltages and all the currents.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:23.323
And this is the way you
do it to make sure that

00:04:23.323 --> 00:04:26.018
Ohm's law comes out with the correct sign.

00:04:26.018 --> 00:04:28.541
That's why we have this sign convention.
