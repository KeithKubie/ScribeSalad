00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.650
 

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.110
Find the distance between the
point negative 2, negative 4.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.380
This point right here.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.600
And the line y is equal
to negative 1/3 x plus 2.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.740
That's this line
right over here.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.660
Now to do it, we just need
to figure out a perpendicular

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.770
line to this blue line, to
y is equal to negative 1/3

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.420
x plus 2, that contains
this point right over here.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.829
So we need to figure out
the equation of this line.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.870
And then we need to figure
out where do these two

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.190
lines intersect,
and then we need

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.190
to find the distance
between these two

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.270
points of intersection, and
we have the shortest distance

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.120
between this point and
this line right over here.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.720
So the first step
is to figure out

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.930
what is the slope of
this perpendicular line.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.310
Well, the slope of
a perpendicular line

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.490
is going to be the
negative inverse

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.460
of the slope of this blue line.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.170
So the negative
inverse of negative 1/3

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.840
is going to be positive 3.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.980
So this line right over here
is going to have a slope of 3.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.560
So it's going to
have the form y is

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.234
equal to 3x plus b, where
b is its y-intercept.

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:11.650
It looks, just
eyeballing it here,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.370
that it's going to
be pretty close to 2.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.020
But let's verify that.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.724
So to figure out what b actually
is, let's substitute this point

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:19.390
right over here.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.970
We know that not only
is this line slope 3,

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.970
but this point has to sit on it.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.890
So this point has to
satisfy this equation.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.200
So when x is negative
2, y is negative 4.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.160
Or we have negative 4 is equal
to 3 times negative 2 plus b.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.030
Let me write the
negative 2 in there.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.390
3 times negative 2 plus b.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.750
And now we can solve for b.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.400
We get negative 4 is equal
to negative 6 plus b.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.270
Add 6 to both sides, you
get 2 is equal to b or b

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.590
is equal to 2.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.680
So we were right.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.370
The y-intercept for the
second line is at 2.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.560
So we immediately
can eyeball, or we

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.440
can verify, where
they both intersect.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.210
They both intersect the
y-axis at y equals 2.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.536
For both of these, when x is
equal to 0, y is equal to 2.

00:02:11.536 --> 00:02:12.910
If it wasn't so
obvious, we could

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.020
set these two equations
equal to each other.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.510
We could say look,
we have 3x plus 2.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.300
We know that this is now
3x plus 2, because b is 2.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.390
When does 3x plus 2 equal
negative 1/3 x plus 2?

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.320
Well, let's see.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.660
If we subtract 2
from both sides,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.904
when does 3x equal
negative 1/3 x?

00:02:38.904 --> 00:02:40.570
Well, there's a couple
of things that we

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.470
could do right over here.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.740
We could add 1/3
x to both sides.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.580
And then we will
get 3 and 1/3, which

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.320
is the same thing as
(10/3)x is equal to 0.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.060
And if you multiply
both sides by 3/10,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.850
you get x is equal to 0.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.110
So these two lines intersect
when x is equal to 0.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.790
For both of them, when x is
equal to 0, y is equal to 2.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.600
 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.654
But you could have
eyeballed it here.

00:03:19.654 --> 00:03:21.820
You could have seen that
both of their y-intercepts,

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.010
which happens when x is
equal to 0, y is equal to 2.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.792
So this point right over
here is the point 0, 2.

00:03:27.792 --> 00:03:29.750
We already know that this
point right over here

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.742
is the point negative
2, negative 4.

00:03:33.742 --> 00:03:36.200
And now we just need to find
the distance between these two

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.140
points.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.290
And the distance
formula really is just

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.900
an application of the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.610
We just need to
find the distance

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.660
in the change in the y
direction and the change

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.620
in the x direction.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.380
So let's do that separately.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:57.110
So in the y direction, what is
this distance right over here?

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.310
So we went from y is equal to
negative 4 to y is equal to 2.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.630
This distance right
over here is 6.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.620
And what is this
distance right over here?

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.860
Well, we go from x equals
negative 2 to x equals 0.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.560
So this distance
right over here is 2.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.290
So the distance between
these two points

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.079
is really just the hypotenuse
of a right triangle

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.420
that has sides 6 and 2.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.890
If we call this
distance d, we could

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.804
say that the distance
squared is equal to.

00:04:27.804 --> 00:04:30.470
And all I'm really doing here is
restating the distance formula.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.190
The distance formula
tells you all this Y2

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.034
minus Y1, which is 6, squared.

00:04:39.034 --> 00:04:40.700
But that's just the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:47.040
That's just saying 6 squared
plus x2 minus x1, which

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.000
is 0 minus negative 2, which
is positive 2 squared is going

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.500
to be equal to the
distance squared.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.940
But we see that's just
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.947
But anyway, let's
solve for the distance.

00:04:57.947 --> 00:04:59.530
So the distance
squared is going to be

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.900
equal to 36 plus 4, which is 40.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.540
And now, let's see.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.030
 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.092
The distance is equal to
the square root of 40.

00:05:14.092 --> 00:05:15.550
Square root of 40
is the same thing

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.840
as the square root
of 4 times 10.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.150
And so that's the same.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.857
So the distance is equal to
2 if we factor out the 4.

00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:25.940
It's the square root of 4
times square root of 10.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.050
2 is the square root of 4.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.120
2 square roots of 10.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.060
And we're done.
