we do plan for success so at every

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540
we do plan for success so at every
 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.110
we do plan for success so at every
observatory we've ever worked and now at

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120
observatory we've ever worked and now at
 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.209
observatory we've ever worked and now at
the Allen telescope array our own

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219
the Allen telescope array our own
 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.209
the Allen telescope array our own
telescope we keep champagne on ice right

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219
telescope we keep champagne on ice right
 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.480
telescope we keep champagne on ice right
we we intend to celebrate if we have a

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490
we we intend to celebrate if we have a
 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.839
we we intend to celebrate if we have a
detection and then of course there's a

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849
detection and then of course there's a
 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.089
detection and then of course there's a
lot that needs to be done first you need

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099
lot that needs to be done first you need
 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.450
lot that needs to be done first you need
to verify that what you've detected is

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460
to verify that what you've detected is
 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.089
to verify that what you've detected is
actually what you think it is and with

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099
actually what you think it is and with
 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.820
actually what you think it is and with
SETI because it's so attractive to so

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830
SETI because it's so attractive to so
 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.860
SETI because it's so attractive to so
many people you have to worry that it

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870
many people you have to worry that it
 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.010
many people you have to worry that it
might be a deliberate hoax so we have to

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020
might be a deliberate hoax so we have to
 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.209
might be a deliberate hoax so we have to
take precautions and one of the easiest

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219
take precautions and one of the easiest
 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.729
take precautions and one of the easiest
things to do and one of the the most

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739
things to do and one of the the most
 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.490
things to do and one of the the most
sensible things to do is to call up a

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500
sensible things to do is to call up a
 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.360
sensible things to do is to call up a
telescope to the west of us that that

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370
telescope to the west of us that that
 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.389
telescope to the west of us that that
has the capability to detect the

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399
has the capability to detect the
 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.420
has the capability to detect the
frequencies that we've detected and ask

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430
frequencies that we've detected and ask
 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.180
frequencies that we've detected and ask
them to go looking with their equipment

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190
them to go looking with their equipment
 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.330
them to go looking with their equipment
to see if they see a signal so if they

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340
to see if they see a signal so if they
 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.910
to see if they see a signal so if they
can confirm that they can see something

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920
can confirm that they can see something
 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.609
can confirm that they can see something
with equipment that we didn't build and

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619
with equipment that we didn't build and
 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.880
with equipment that we didn't build and
software that we didn't right then it's

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890
software that we didn't right then it's
 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.149
software that we didn't right then it's
a pretty good independent confirmation

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159
a pretty good independent confirmation
 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.480
a pretty good independent confirmation
that it's a real signal and it probably

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490
that it's a real signal and it probably
 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.210
that it's a real signal and it probably
is exactly what we think it is either

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220
is exactly what we think it is either
 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.890
is exactly what we think it is either
that or it's a whole new brand of

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900
that or it's a whole new brand of
 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.560
that or it's a whole new brand of
astrophysics that could happen too I

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570
astrophysics that could happen too I
 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.480
astrophysics that could happen too I
mean we're looking for signals of a

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490
mean we're looking for signals of a
 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.490
mean we're looking for signals of a
particular type because we don't think

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500
particular type because we don't think
 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.219
particular type because we don't think
nature can make them if we find that

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229
nature can make them if we find that
 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.170
nature can make them if we find that
kind of signal it's either the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180
kind of signal it's either the
 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.260
kind of signal it's either the
engineering we're looking for or

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270
engineering we're looking for or
 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.510
engineering we're looking for or
something amazing and knew about nature

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520
something amazing and knew about nature
 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.240
something amazing and knew about nature
so we'll we'll try and get that

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250
so we'll we'll try and get that
 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.880
so we'll we'll try and get that
independent confirmation then we'll go

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890
independent confirmation then we'll go
 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.789
independent confirmation then we'll go
through a whole process where we first

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799
through a whole process where we first
 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.020
through a whole process where we first
send out an iau telegram which is

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030
send out an iau telegram which is
 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.630
send out an iau telegram which is
essentially an email to all the world's

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640
essentially an email to all the world's
 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.660
essentially an email to all the world's
observatories and it says here's what we

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670
observatories and it says here's what we
 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.910
observatories and it says here's what we
found here are the details about the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920
found here are the details about the
 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.450
found here are the details about the
discovery and any observatory could in

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460
discovery and any observatory could in
 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.460
discovery and any observatory could in
fact choose to look with whatever

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470
fact choose to look with whatever
 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.620
fact choose to look with whatever
equipment they have to see what else

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630
equipment they have to see what else
 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.990
equipment they have to see what else
might be there but the other thing that

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000
might be there but the other thing that
 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.059
might be there but the other thing that
that does for you is

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069
that does for you is
 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.869
that does for you is
it informs your scientific colleagues

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879
it informs your scientific colleagues
 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.300
it informs your scientific colleagues
about the details and these are the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310
about the details and these are the
 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.390
about the details and these are the
people who are most likely to be

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400
people who are most likely to be
 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.059
people who are most likely to be
reachable by the world's media and

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069
reachable by the world's media and
 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.970
reachable by the world's media and
journalists who when we make an

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980
journalists who when we make an
 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.459
journalists who when we make an
announcement and we certainly will hold

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:33.469
announcement and we certainly will hold
 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.069
announcement and we certainly will hold
a press conference and tell the world

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079
a press conference and tell the world
 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.099
a press conference and tell the world
when that happens the world's media are

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109
when that happens the world's media are
 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.979
when that happens the world's media are
not going to be able to call up the SETI

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989
not going to be able to call up the SETI
 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.599
not going to be able to call up the SETI
Institute and get a comment and we don't

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609
Institute and get a comment and we don't
 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.789
Institute and get a comment and we don't
want to leave them without some

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799
want to leave them without some
 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.949
want to leave them without some
authoritative source so by sending out

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959
authoritative source so by sending out
 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.839
authoritative source so by sending out
this telegram to the observatories

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849
this telegram to the observatories
 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.580
this telegram to the observatories
around the world then the discovery

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590
around the world then the discovery
 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.379
around the world then the discovery
information is in the hands of people

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389
information is in the hands of people
 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.069
information is in the hands of people
who can hopefully help interpret it to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079
who can hopefully help interpret it to
 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.429
who can hopefully help interpret it to
to the journalists to the media and we

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439
to the journalists to the media and we
 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.339
to the journalists to the media and we
don't leave them a wash and making up

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349
don't leave them a wash and making up
 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.220
don't leave them a wash and making up
their own stories so and then of course

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230
their own stories so and then of course
 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.800
their own stories so and then of course
we do tell the world we first probably

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810
we do tell the world we first probably
 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.059
we do tell the world we first probably
make some very discreet courtesy calls

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069
make some very discreet courtesy calls
 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.270
make some very discreet courtesy calls
to our major donors to let them know

anything to do with the discovery is
appropriately credited and then I don't

the end of the day what could we say we
said that people will react in

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990
said that people will react in
 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.379
said that people will react in
accordance with the belief systems that

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389
accordance with the belief systems that
 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.709
accordance with the belief systems that
are in place at the time doesn't tell

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719
are in place at the time doesn't tell
 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.170
are in place at the time doesn't tell
you a lot so I guess the other thing

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180
you a lot so I guess the other thing
 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.219
you a lot so I guess the other thing
that came out of these workshops was the

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229
that came out of these workshops was the
 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.309
that came out of these workshops was the
importance of trying to educate and

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319
importance of trying to educate and
 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.760
importance of trying to educate and
inform people in advance that this is a

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770
inform people in advance that this is a
 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.209
inform people in advance that this is a
possibility this could happen this could

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:02.219
possibility this could happen this could
 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.879
possibility this could happen this could
show up on their television screen or in

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889
show up on their television screen or in
 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.050
show up on their television screen or in
their newspapers tomorrow and they might

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060
their newspapers tomorrow and they might
 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.029
their newspapers tomorrow and they might
be thinking about what that means for

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039
be thinking about what that means for
 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:17.029
be thinking about what that means for
them and that's some it's another avenue

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039
them and that's some it's another avenue
 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.279
them and that's some it's another avenue
that we're trying to go down right now

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289
 
 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.649
 
I would be so overwhelmed and excited

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659
I would be so overwhelmed and excited
 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.689
I would be so overwhelmed and excited
simply to have an answer to this old

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699
simply to have an answer to this old
 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.359
simply to have an answer to this old
question even if there is no message

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:31.369
question even if there is no message
 

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:33.850
question even if there is no message
even if it's just kind of a cosmic dial

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860
even if it's just kind of a cosmic dial
 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.730
even if it's just kind of a cosmic dial
tone that's a proof of existence I mean

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740
tone that's a proof of existence I mean
 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.010
tone that's a proof of existence I mean
good heads we've answered a question

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020
good heads we've answered a question
 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.429
good heads we've answered a question
that we've wondered about for ages and

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:42.439
that we've wondered about for ages and
 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:45.879
that we've wondered about for ages and
it's interesting because in this field

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889
it's interesting because in this field
 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.929
it's interesting because in this field
the number two is really really critical

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:49.939
the number two is really really critical
 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:54.399
the number two is really really critical
so we have one example of life life here

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409
so we have one example of life life here
 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.889
so we have one example of life life here
on this planet we don't know about any

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:56.899
on this planet we don't know about any
 

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:00.730
on this planet we don't know about any
other but the moment you get a second

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740
other but the moment you get a second
 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.959
other but the moment you get a second
example then you know there are many you

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:04.969
example then you know there are many you
 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:07.540
example then you know there are many you
know in physics we sent send account one

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550
know in physics we sent send account one
 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.019
know in physics we sent send account one
to infinity so with a single example it

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:11.029
to infinity so with a single example it
 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:13.359
to infinity so with a single example it
could be unique the moment you get a

00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:13.369
could be unique the moment you get a
 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:17.889
could be unique the moment you get a
second you know it's abundant and so the

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:17.899
second you know it's abundant and so the
 

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:22.809
second you know it's abundant and so the
moment that we find that evidence of the

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819
moment that we find that evidence of the
 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.049
moment that we find that evidence of the
second technology will start looking for

00:06:26.049 --> 00:06:26.059
second technology will start looking for
 

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:27.639
second technology will start looking for
more because we know they're going to be

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:27.649
more because we know they're going to be
 

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:33.100
more because we know they're going to be
out there and so understanding actually

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110
out there and so understanding actually
 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.429
out there and so understanding actually
how we fit in what the diversity is what

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:38.439
how we fit in what the diversity is what
 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:44.829
how we fit in what the diversity is what
what physics and chemistry have managed

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:44.839
what physics and chemistry have managed
 

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:49.179
what physics and chemistry have managed
to concoct other places what other kinds

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:49.189
to concoct other places what other kinds
 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:51.149
to concoct other places what other kinds
of biology that's what interests me

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:51.159
of biology that's what interests me
 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:55.059
of biology that's what interests me
rather than sending a message about us

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:55.069
rather than sending a message about us
 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:58.990
rather than sending a message about us
I'm really interested in them
