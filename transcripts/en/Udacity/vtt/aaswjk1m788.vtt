00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Sindbad certainly can't catch a break,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but perhaps we can catch or notice errors in Python programs.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If we are very wary and think that an error might happen,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we can use the Python keywords try and except to guard critical code.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This code is guarded.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And if an error happens in here instead of aborting Python execution,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
it will go down to this except block and start executing there.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This except block only runs if the guarded block has an error.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So this code will print out "hello"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and then we've seen before that when we try to do integer division by 0

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that doesn't make much sense, so we'll jump down here and print out "didn't work"

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and then print out problem, which was our particular exception.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And if you haven't run into it before, exception is just a special computer science keyword

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
meaning an error in a program.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It derives from exceptional situation and can refer to either something like

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
you're out of space on your disk or memory card

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
or a problem in your program like you're trying to divide by 0.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
However, it's also entirely possible to raise exceptions on our own.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So here in this Python code fragment we're printing out "joseph heller"

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but in the middle we raise this exception with the value 22.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And then down here we catch that exception, calling it the variable problem,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and then we print out, oh, it "didn't work: we caught" problem,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and this will end up printing out "joseph".

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We'll raise the exception,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so we'll never actually print out "heller".

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We will print out it "didn't work: we caught" 22.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And Catch-22 is a satirical novel by Joseph Heller. It's a bit absurd.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The phrase "catch-22" has actually entered the popular English lexicon,

00:01:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
meaning, approximately, "no win situation."
