00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.173
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Its been pretty easy to see what the factors of these terms with only

00:00:04.173 --> 00:00:08.879
variables in them are, but what if we have a number instead? An integer factor

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:13.494
of a number goes into that number, an integer number of times without leaving a

00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:18.239
remainder. So, this is a number that we can divide evenly into another number.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:23.439
So, for example, since 8 is equal to 4 times 2, 4 and 2 are both factors of 8.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:29.229
So, for example, what are all the factors of 6? Please fill in those four

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.365
numbers here.
