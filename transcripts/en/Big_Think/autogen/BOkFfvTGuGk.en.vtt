00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.620
I've had several people come up to me and
say, “What can I do to be you?”&nbsp;

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.639
And the only aspect of me that’s really
doable is I can tell you what my academic

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.070
pedigree is and what I did as a kid and what
things interested me, but what I do day-to-day

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.330
is not the fulfillment of some preexisting
job description.&nbsp;

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.140
It’s just things that I took interest in
on my own that the general public happened

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.500
to also appreciate or like or want access
to.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.960
&nbsp;And so within my job description as Director
of the Hayden Planetarium and as an educator,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.710
as an astrophysicist, I kept accreting other
things that I did that people responded to,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.590
positively responded to.&nbsp;

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.020
So, I can tell you about the academic pedigree.&nbsp;

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.670
The rest, you have to create what it is that
you do best that layers onto the formal training

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.800
that may be behind it.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.440
I think the greatest of people that have ever
been in society, they were never versions

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.020
of someone else.&nbsp;

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.200
They were themselves.&nbsp;

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.750
You don’t think about Michael Jordan the
basketball player and say, “Oh, he was just

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.420
like this other player.”&nbsp;

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.980
No, you don’t even say, “He was like this
player plus that player divided by two plus

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.980
this.”&nbsp;

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.980
No.&nbsp;

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.780
He’s Michael Jordan.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:39.030
&nbsp;I think the greatest of people in society
carved niches that represented the unique

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:48.640
expression of their combinations of talents,
and if everyone had the luxury of expressing

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.450
the unique combinations of talents in this
world, our society would be transformed overnight.&nbsp;

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.450
It’s the great tragedy -- people employed
in ways that don’t fully tap everything

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.259
they do best in life.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.010
&nbsp;
I am privileged and I don’t take a day for

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:15.120
granted on the job about the fact that what
I do, what people most warmly receive about

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.500
what I do, are some of the things that I do
best in life.&nbsp;

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.820
I'm honored and flattered by that combination
of facts as they apply to me.&nbsp;

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.160
So, your task is to find the combination of
facts that apply to you.&nbsp;

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.230
Then people will beat a path to your door.
