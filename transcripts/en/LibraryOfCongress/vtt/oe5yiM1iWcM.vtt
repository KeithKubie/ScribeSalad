&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Hello
everyone, I'm Tom Gjelten.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.540
I'm a correspondent
for NPR, which is one

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.240
of the media partners.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.210
Thank you.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.510
Thank you very much.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.090
Thank you to the
Library of Congress

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.390
for doing this every year.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.120
It's always, to me, one of the
highlights of the year here

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.130
in Washington D.C. And
we're really thrilled,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.510
and I'm personally really
thrilled to be a part of this.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.340
And I'm especially
delighted today

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.900
because these are
two fabulous books.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.240
And I'm glad to see
you all here.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.050
You've already had your
signings I guess right?

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.350
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: Yes.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.650
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: But I'm
guessing that if any

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.950
of you didn't get a chance

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.470
to get them signed before
you can probably catch

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.770
him afterwards.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.070
They're really terrific books.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.650
Alfredo Corchado, Homelands.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.940
Four friends, two
countries and the fate

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.570
of the great Mexican/American
migration.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.900
And Francisco Cantu, The
Line Becomes a River,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.380
Dispatches From the Border.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.850
I loved these, both
of these books.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.420
Both of them are
beautifully written,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.010
profoundly personal and intuit.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.520
And I would say both
qualify as memoirs

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.770
and you know both
Mexican American

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.650
with Mexican American
heritage and you both write

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.850
from the vantage point
of that experience.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.800
Have you read each
other's books?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.600
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: Yes.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.040
[ Laughter ]

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.340
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado:
I gave him a blurb.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.640
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: I know
you gave him a blurb.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.010
And I'm glad that you read it
before you gave him a blurb.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.260
But we can have a three
way conversation then

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.200
since you're familiar with
each other's writings.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.830
So I say they're both memoirs
written both in first person.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.930
But in each case, each of these
books tells a larger story,

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.940
aside from the personal
narrative.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.520
And in both cases
really important

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.810
and timely stories right now.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.080
Both in a very general
sense about the border,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.220
and that's I think the title

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.450
of this presentation
this afternoon.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.110
But in different ways.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.060
And I'm going to just briefly
give you a couple thoughts,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.920
my own thoughts about
each of these books

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.340
to sort of start it off.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.650
Alfredo, you're a journalist
and you write both as a migrant,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.970
as a Mexican American but you
also write as a journalist.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.930
And we're talking before, I
think our paths probably crossed

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.540
because I lived and covered
Mexico back in the 80's

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.250
and you were there as well.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.210
And I think we've met
here in Washington D.C.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.950
So Alfredo's book is largely
about the migration experience,

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.080
and what it means to
be Mexican American.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.450
You spent much of your life
living along the border.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.390
But you also say that you live
on the border not just literally

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.150
but sort of figuratively.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.470
And reading your book I
was reminded of a book by -

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.160
another great book by a
Cuban American writer Gustavo

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.560
Perez Firmat.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.590
It's called Life on the Hyphen.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.390
And the title of that
book sort of, to me,

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.200
is exactly what you're
writing about too.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.060
What it is like to live
on the hyphen of a -

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.910
with binational kind
of heritage.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.960
And I recall from your book
a conversation you had,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.610
so Alfredo can tell
you about this,

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.340
but there are four friends,
four Mexican American friends

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.750
that sort of come
together in Philadelphia.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.920
One of them is an older friend

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.900
of yours Primo, more
of an activist.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.540
And at one point in your book
you talk about him asking you

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.370
which side are you on?

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.980
Where is your homeland?

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.110
And do you remember
what you said?

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.800
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado:
Yes I said it depends -

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.440
if I'm watching a soccer game
between the United States

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.300
and Mexico I'm rooting
for whoever is behind.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.150
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: That's
right, but then you say,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.840
I push the conversation aside

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.610
because at times I really
have no clue how to answer.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.910
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado:
Right, right.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.330
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Which I think
was just a story that sort

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.370
of goes to your experience
of what it's like to sort

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.470
of have those kind of
conflicting identities.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.030
And you can say as we get into
this whether you regard them

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.430
as conflicting or complementary.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.540
But you do have sort of a
dual aspect to your identity,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.990
which is - Alfredo's book
is very much about sort

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.530
of his own experience with
discovering his identity.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.000
Francisco, you also
write about the border

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.600
but whereas I was saying
with Alfredo the border is

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.330
as much a figurative
thing as a literal thing.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.450
For you it's very
much a literal thing.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.910
Your experience of the border
is a very physical place.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.400
You write about its
geography, about its history.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.610
It's not so much, it seems
to me in your view something

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.670
that can be straddled the way

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.030
that Alfredo has straddled
the border figuratively

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.570
and literally.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.980
You write really about
the border as something

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.340
that separates and
something that is enforced,

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.710
that is crossed only
with difficulty.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.960
Those of you who know
the background here,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.270
know that Francisco
spent four years

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.360
as an agent of the
border patrol.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.200
So firsthand experience
in that sense.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.640
But then in the last part of
your book and you write a lot

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.010
about what it was
like, your experience

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.310
as a border patrol agent.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.570
But in the last part of your
book you actually write sort

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.230
of in the sense of an advocate,
at least in a personal way

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.430
for people who are migrating.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.370
So that's as much as I'm
going to give away for now

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.680
about these two books.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.170
We're going to have a good
conversation and you know if -

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.060
I'll pause let's say about
15 minutes before the end

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.640
to see how much interest
there is on your part,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.730
if you kind of want to get
into the conversation or not.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.420
We have a lot to talk about so I
can't promise I'm going to give

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.900
up the floor, but if
you insist we can.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.870
So let's talk first a little bit
about your personal histories.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.000
Alfredo you were born in Mexico.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.720
Give us the first 15 years
of your life let's say.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.020
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: I was born

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.530
in a town called San
Luis Cordero Durango,

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.590
which is in Northern Mexico.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.240
My father was a bracero
worker, a guest worker.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.790
And I felt like back then I had
the most idyllic perfect life,

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.090
you know?

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.390
My father would send
money every two weeks,

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.180
we had a little grocery
store in Durango.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.170
And part of my job was to make
sure that every toy worked

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.980
that my mother would sell.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.150
So that was - that
was my life, you know?

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.300
And I think for a lot of kids
back then we had parents living

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.920
in the United States.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.130
You were able to hear
about the United States,

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.020
but it wasn't something
that you at least at my age,

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.560
that I longed to go
to to be a part of.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.750
Obviously in 1965 we can
talk about that later,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.940
but in 1965 comes around
and changes our entire life.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.400
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: A law that
really opened Americas doors

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.270
to immigrants of color
for the first time.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.570
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado:

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.190
And my father's boss every
Christmas he would dread the

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.270
Christmas vacation because
he thought this guy is

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.190
such a great worker that
he may not come back

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.100
to - after the holidays.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:22.100
So after '65 we were able to
become legal, legal immigrants.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.970
And first 10 years of my
life was in the California,

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.060
in the Central Valley,
the San Joaquin Valley.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.440
We were farm workers.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.220
My mother and father
worked for the UFW.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.720
Cesar Chavez was the leader

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.840
and that was really the
first part of my life.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.490
I quickly assimilated and
learned to speak English

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.800
with the help of the song
Ben by Michael Jackson,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.230
and I Think I Love You
by the Partridge Family.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.200
That's how I tasted
the U.S. assimilation.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.740
And never thought - I mean I
never thought I would amount

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.040
to much.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.010
But my parents had I think
from the moment they decided

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.240
to sacrifice their life,
they thought that you come

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.130
to this country, you come
to reinvent yourself.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.620
And when I - I told
them one day, I said,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.920
"I'm going to drop
out of school."

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.300
Or I didn't even tell
them, I just did it.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.980
And that was like
their life had ended.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:31.380
But I ended up going back
to school, community college

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.160
and became a journalist.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.910
Mainly because there was one
afternoon where a TV crew went

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.040
up to the fields and they
were interviewing people.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.540
And they were looking
for underage workers.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.350
And you were considered
under age

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.150
if you were below the age of 15.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.090
So my mother was always
telling me "Pretend

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.690
like you're 15" big
hat, shirt and so forth.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.320
And this crew came up
to me, interviewed me

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.620
and the first question

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.920
out of their mouth
was "How old are you?"

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.980
And I said, "13";
so that was it.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.430
I did the reporters job and I
did it pretty easy for them.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.280
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: You grew up
in poverty would you say?

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.580
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado:
Yeah I mean we -

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.210
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Talk about
where you lived in California

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.610
when you first moved there?

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.330
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado:
Sure, my dad -

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.880
we didn't even know
we had a father.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.180
I didn't even know his name

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.770
because he was always
going back and forth.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.040
This was a time in America where
you had a circle of migration.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.810
Where people would work eight,
nine months out of the year.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.800
And then when we decided
that we were going

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.370
to all leave, we
were heartbroken.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.830
And he sent us one of the most
touching moments of my life

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.920
with my dad was he sent us a
postcard of the state capital.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.480
And we're leaving, we're
on the Greyhound bus.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.520
I'm the oldest of
four at the time.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.910
And every town that
we stopped in,

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.250
my brother would say
"Are we there yet?"

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.840
And I would take out
the card and I would go,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.680
"No, we're not there yet."

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.680
We ended up in a trailer
house for migrant workers

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.170
where sometimes - it
was a very tiny place.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.720
My uncle slept outside with us -

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.410
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Outside.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.710
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: Outside.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.770
You had - at times you had rats.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.430
It depended on the
crop that was there.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.400
Melons for some reason tended
to attract a lot of those.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.520
And that's really
how our life began.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.730
I mean it was trailer house
and slowly things get better.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:30.310
The housing got better, the
working conditions got better.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:31.610
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: And
Francisco tell us

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.220
about your upbringing
in Arizona.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.810
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: Yeah
so I grew up in Arizona.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:43.870
I grew up in a town four or
five hours from the border.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.280
So what's interesting
about that is

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.220
that you know the border is
not a totally abstract thing,

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.300
like I think it is in a lot
of places in the country.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:57.040
But it's also not immediate,
it's not in your backyard.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.960
And my mother was born
to Mexican father,

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.900
so migrant father,
came up during the time

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.300
of the Mexican Revolution.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.880
And they came as refugees
fleeing the violence

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.960
of the revolution
from Monterrey, Leon.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.860
But my mom was sort of you
know, her parents split

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.240
when she was very young,
so she didn't really grow

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.670
up with the Mexican
side of the family.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.140
And so she didn't grow
up speaking Spanish.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.730
I didn't grow up
speaking Spanish.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:34.830
I didn't grow up with
my Mexican grandparents.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.740
I remember you know,
visiting him.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.970
So I think a lot
of people who grow

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.910
up in this country,
I'm third generation.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:49.070
And you know my entire identity
was as this American kid,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.670
but I had this funny name.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.430
Like my - I go by Paco
and so everybody -

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:56.930
that was the one
thing that made -

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.220
that sort of tied
me to my identity.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.520
And -

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.500
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Your mother
couldn't name you Frank

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.410
or Francis, but she
named you Francisco.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.030
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: Right,
and it was interesting

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:13.560
because in school I didn't
really become conscious

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.390
of the fact that
my name was weird,

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.260
or that I had this other
identity until I became older.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.310
And then you know, I remember
sort of my step dad explaining

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.660
to me he was like "You
probably need to learn Spanish".

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.320
It was like I was in high
school and you could take French

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.430
or Spanish and he's like
"You better take Spanish".

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.680
And then he explained to me,
people are going to expect -

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.450
it was interesting
moment where he was like

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:43.820
"Here's what people are
going to expect from you."

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.360
You grow up in Arizona, you
know you have this name.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.880
And so then that sort of became
a different awakening for me.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.660
Like I studied abroad in Mexico.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.490
I began to study
international relations

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:57.790
when I went away to college.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.350
I went to school here
at American university.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:05.230
And when I started
working in high school,

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.970
my first job was as a bus boy.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.860
And all of the people
in the kitchen were

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.160
from the same town
in [Inaudible].

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.640
And I began, I had
begun learning Spanish

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.740
and so I was speaking
Spanish with them.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.670
And the first time I traveled
to Mexico I went to this town

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.550
where they were all from - and
they had kind of called their -

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.990
they called their brother and
let them know that I was coming.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.510
And he was getting
married that weekend,

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.890
so I got invited to his wedding.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.350
And all of a sudden I'm - you
know I arrived in this town,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:38.350
2,000 miles away in Central
Mexico and people knew who I was

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.990
and they knew where I
was from because they're

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.350
such a community, you know
a cross border community.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.420
A lot of people had been
deported from Arizona.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.360
They had worked in the same
restaurant where I worked.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.350
And so that was this moment as a
young man where I realized sort

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.210
of how - how significant

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.820
and insignificant the border
can be simultaneously.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.770
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Well and
then you become a border

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.670
patrol agent.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.850
And rather than ask you what
led to that I'm just going

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.910
to read a couple
lines from your book.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.690
You write, "When I was in school
I spent all this time studying

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.300
international relations,
immigration, border security.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.870
I was always reading,"
this is your talking

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.920
to Beto, your fellow agent.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.230
He asked you why you joined
the border patrol when you did.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.120
"I was always reading
policy and economics,

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.130
looking at complex academic ways

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.450
of addressing this big
unsolvable problem.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.870
When I made the decision
to apply

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.040
for this job I had the idea that
I'd cease things in the patrol

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.030
that would somehow unlock
the border for me, you know?

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.350
I thought I'd come up with
all sorts of answers."

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.960
Do you remember that
conversation with Beto?

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.160
I'm sure you do because
you wrote it.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.800
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: Yeah and I
really - that conversation comes

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.790
after I'd been doing
the job for a while.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.430
And I think that
conversation is very different

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:05.330
than the conversation I had
with my mom, who was horrified

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.100
that I was joining
the border patrol.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.020
When I first told her
she thought I was crazy

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.170
and was basically did everything
she could to convince me not to.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.130
And I think by the time I was
having this conversation you

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.890
know I had been doing the job
for three years or something

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.100
and a lot of the
naiveté had worn off

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.710
about the idea of
getting answers.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.630
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: So when
you began did you have any

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.170
preconceptions about the
border patrol being you know,

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:36.200
charitable, being kind
of adversarial, neutral?

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.810
I mean what kind of
attitudes towards the border,

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.480
towards immigrants, towards
undocumented people did

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.890
you bring?

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.270
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: So I had
a liberal arts education.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:50.050
And I sort of understood
the border patrol.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.210
I felt like I was going into
this lion's den and I was going

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:58.010
to be kind of you know that
I was going to have to be

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.490
in disguise because my
politics didn't align

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.570
with what I imagined a lot of -

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.500
I kind of imagined I would be
working with all these people

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.800
who kind of signed up to

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.260
like kick Mexicans
out of the country.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.490
But you know what
I saw when I showed

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.290
up at the training
academy is that half

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.800
of my classmates were you know
Mexican, Mexican American.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.700
They were from the
border region.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.350
And I think still you
know just under half

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.650
of the border patrol
is Hispanic.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.770
And a lot of them have
undocumented people

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.070
in their family.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.970
And a lot of people they
grow up in these border towns

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:36.090
where if you look at who
owns a house, who owns a car,

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.780
who is doing well, who is able
to provide for their family,

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.170
it's people that are in law
enforcement or it's people

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.180
who are you know involved
somehow with the cartel.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.550
And so for a lot of these
people it's a very easy choice.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.500
It's not this big
conflicted choice.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.770
But you know for
me I looked at it

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.830
as an extension of my education.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.680
I had just finished the
international relations degree

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.470
focusing on the border
and you know I imagined

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.710
that I would do this work
for three or four years

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.650
as like a graduate degree and
that I would be able to go

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.850
and have like all these answers
had alluded everybody else

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:14.920
and that I'd be able to
go into politics or policy

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.540
or become an immigration lawyer.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.660
And I just have this whole
you know, bag of tricks,

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.360
but it wasn't like that at all.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.200
I left with more questions
than I joined with.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.310
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: We'll get
into some of those questions.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:32.770
Alfredo did you have a
- what was your opinion

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:38.030
of the border patrol experience
as a young man in El Paso?

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:43.380
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: In El Paso
we had a small little restaurant

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.490
called Freddy's Café which
is about three or four blocks

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.070
from the international line.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.540
And they were good tippers.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.960
I mean they spent a lot of time.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.980
I didn't realize at the
moment but this was sort

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.600
of my early years
as a journalist

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.160
and Freddy's was the best
place to go there and sort

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.640
of listen to what was going on.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.340
I mean we had some
other people coming

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.940
in from Mexico were smuggling,
this was before NAFTA,

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.620
so it was a lot more
smuggling back and forth.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.250
And you can kind of listen into
the conversations that was going

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.150
on between both sides.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:24.400
But I remember it
was in the early 90's

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.780
when the border patrol,
they were on bikes,

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.380
they were with the city police
and they begin asking people

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.470
for identity, for
proof of citizenship.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.870
Obviously you felt harassed.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:44.100
Going to the airport, I remember
one time I had just become a

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.590
citizen and so they
took my green card away.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.990
And I became a citizen because
my editor - I was now working

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.640
for the Wall Street
Journal in Philadelphia

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.970
and my editor felt very
strongly that if I was

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.730
to become a foreign
correspondent I should be a

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.030
U.S. citizen.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.200
He said it would provide
much more protection.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.210
So I go to El Paso, they
take my green card away

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.240
and they just gave me some
paper basically saying I was

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.050
in this country legally.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:16.010
And I think in Philadelphia
the 76ers played a game,

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.190
it was a pre-season game in
El Paso but we're leaving,

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.510
it's a 5:00 a.m. flight

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.300
or something really
early in the morning.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.220
And the border patrol came up
to me and they kept asking.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:30.870
And at first I felt offended
that they were profiling me.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.610
You're Hispanic, so
they went after me

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:34.940
and kept asking me questions.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.150
And I didn't have a way to
prove my citizenship or the fact

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.280
that I was in this
country legally.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.190
And the - I remember I took

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:49.500
out my Dow Jones credit
card, my American Express.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.290
And that's how they
were able to let me go.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.560
And that always kind of
registered and so years later

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.860
when my brother said
that he wanted

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.090
to become a border patrol agent,

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.130
we also sort of begged
him not to.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:06.010
But my parents, to their
credit they thought

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.070
that was a good job.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:12.660
And so as Francisco was
saying there's a lot

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.610
of border patrol
agents who are Hispanic.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.890
A lot of people I know,
people I grew up with

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:23.300
and I think you know you learn
to - not to categorize them.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.220
But they're always, there's to
this day whenever I'm traveling

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.550
or whenever my parents
are traveling with me

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.610
and my father is still
very much a Durango native.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.140
I mean he still wears his hat.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.700
You know they're
going to stop him

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.750
and you know they're going
to ask him questions.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.010
I get very sarcastic
at times and I come in

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.780
and I'll speak Spanish
the whole time, [Spanish].

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.200
But I realize that it's -
it's still very much that cat

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.670
and mouse game that
we grew up with

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.820
as little kids on the border.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:01.640
Today it's a much
more tense time.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.830
And so you try not
to do anything.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.810
I mean you try to just
be as polite as possible.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.710
You don't want to give them
any reason to harass you

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:12.950
and miss your flight
or especially

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:14.550
when you're crossing the border.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:19.580
I mean I live on the border and
I'm criss crossing all the time.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.330
So you - all that stuff we
used to do five, six years ago.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.090
I mean all that or
maybe right after 9/11,

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.560
I mean it's a new
world on the border.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.840
And you try - and you know
that there's no room for joking

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.190
around or kidding around.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.480
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Yeah,
we just saw a story

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.660
in the Washington Post last week
that even people who are born

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.750
in the United States,
Mexican Americans born

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.870
in the United States are
- have to deal with having

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.170
to prove their citizenship.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.010
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: My sister
is an immigration lawyer

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.370
and she's been warning
me for months.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:54.350
She says you know,
"You need to understand

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.930
that this is a new
time in America.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.930
This is a different
time in this country."

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:01.070
And they can - I can't
believe I'm saying this here

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:05.190
at the National Book Festival
but anyone can really go back

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:09.210
and look at your records and if
there's any reason to doubt you,

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:15.450
you know, they can - they can
take your citizenship away?

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:16.920
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Francisco,

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.920
when you joined the
border patrol, was it 2012?

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.220
Was that when it was?

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.380
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: I left
in 2012 actually, 2008.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.680
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: 2008.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:30.480
So was 2008 a very different
time, was it different

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:36.460
on the border in 2012 than it
was when you joined in 2008?

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.070
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu:
I think Alfredo talks

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.530
about this in his book.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:47.640
Because I grew up I Arizona
and I think the border

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.080
and border enforcement in
Arizona is very different

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.570
and was very different at
that time than it had been

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.500
in the past in places
like Texas and California.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.870
Because Arizona is sort
of the place where all

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:06.540
of the border traffic has
been funneled over the course

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:11.140
of two decades like
beginning in the early 90's

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:15.760
and then you know, by the time
I joined we were in the middle

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.930
of Arizona being - the
Arizona desert being the sort

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:26.540
of you know, this killing
field really of hundreds

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.910
of deaths take place
every year in the desert.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.550
So I forgot the original
question,

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.100
I just started talking
about Arizona and -

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.720
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: That's an
interesting threat talking

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.970
about how many times
you're out in the desert

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:45.270
and I think it was illuminating
to me how dangerous it is

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.750
for migrants to cross
the desert.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:51.440
My original question was did the
border have a different feeling

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.010
in 2008 from 2012?

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.130
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: I guess
what I call attention to that

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.280
because sort of the
cat and mouse game.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.200
It exists but it's very
different because the stakes -

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.400
the area where I was
working was so remote.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.170
And so you know the feeling,
it was - I joined right

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:14.720
as the election of
Barack Obama happened.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.040
And so it was this
transition time.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.660
Like I came in at the tail end
of the George Bush hiring push.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.430
And you know the
border patrol academy

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:29.170
where I was trained was just
turned into this factory

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.620
to pump border patrol
agents out into the field.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.550
The size of the border
patrol you know I don't know

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:39.700
if it doubled but there
was thousands and thousands

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:44.010
of agents from you know
after 9/11 to 2008.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:47.350
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: And what
would be a typical night

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.970
or day particularly
in the early period

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.270
when you're a border
patrol agent.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:56.190
What were you doing?

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.050
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: You
know you - what's incredible

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:04.370
about the border patrol is
how quickly you are turned

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.870
to work on your own.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.220
And you know because -
because you're patrolling

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.290
such vast amounts of space.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:14.500
You know you don't work

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.010
with partners unless something
happens and then you say okay,

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.970
like I've got - I'm
tracking a group and may call

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.080
in some backups so that I
can work this with somebody.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.620
But you're often alone.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.600
You're often - it's often
very boring, you know like 80%

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.140
of the job is boredom.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.390
You're literally driving
in a car back and forth

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.690
on dirt roads looking
for foot prints.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:41.660
And there's also depending on
what kind of agent you are,

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.960
you're also outside a lot.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.320
You're out in the desert
a lot and it's very -

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.360
for all of the technology
that exists on the border,

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.600
for all of the militarization
that has happened there,

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.450
the bread and butter of border
patrol work comes down to

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.640
like tracking, you know
following footprints.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.410
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: You talk about
always looking for a sign.

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:06.710
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: Right.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:09.760
Yeah we call it foot sign.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.400
And so you know in the area
where I worked it was -

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.890
there was a lot of
drug trafficking.

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:23.510
It was maybe half and half, but
you know we were sort of trained

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:28.520
to let - to just seize the
drugs and not arrest people

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.820
because it's all this paperwork.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:36.770
You find out like how much -
how lazy - how lazy people are.

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:40.110
And how - you know
like bureaucracy -

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.110
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: You're
talking border patrol agents -

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.410
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: Everyone.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:47.970
I mean in like bureaucracy
breeds a certain kind

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.490
of indifference.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:53.530
And you see that happening on
the job and then you realize

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.300
like that you're dealing
with human beings.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.260
And there's a certain amount
of callousness that is part

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.330
of the culture of that job.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.900
That you know, it's sort of
infiltrating and normalized.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.530
It's being normalized
for young recruits.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.910
You come into the field and the
people who are training you are

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.130
like "Okay we got these drugs.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.160
We're not going to go
chase after these people.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.860
They'll probably make it."

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.350
You're in the middle of
nowhere, like you're miles

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.820
from any paved road where
anybody would be driving.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.940
And they're like
okay, these people,

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.780
they'll make their way
out into the desert.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.040
But then what you realize when
you see the bigger picture is

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.500
that those people
are often dying.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.240
You know they've been scattered,
they've left all their food

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.930
and water and so there's a lot
of disconnect, that's happening

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:45.910
and is being passed
along to these agents.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:49.890
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: I
was just going to add.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:52.750
I used to see a lot when
we worked in the fields

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:55.640
in California there was a
lot of cynicism on our part

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.000
about the border patrol.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.840
Because they would
usually show up right

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.250
as the season was
going to end, you know?

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:07.170
And we would all cry
[Spanish], but they were there

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:14.230
and you know this was August,
the sugar beet season was

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:16.170
about to end and it
was time to leave.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.730
And so you would have
the border patrol come in

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:24.110
and sometimes it was a free ride
back to Tijuana or something.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.720
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: Yeah
and also the fiscal year

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.830
for the government ends in
September; so it's a good way

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:32.550
to get the numbers up.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.880
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: So
meanwhile Alfredo,

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.180
let's go back to Philadelphia.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.820
You begin as a journalist in
El Paso, then you get a job

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.060
with the Wall Street Journal
and you go to Philadelphia.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.220
You have a pretty
boring assignment,

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.620
as I recall you're covering
quarterly earnings and so forth.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.580
But one of the things
that caught my attention

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.080
because you know we're
accustomed to hearing

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.920
so much Spanish around us,
even watching you know is

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.730
when you moved to Philadelphia
you felt pretty isolated

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.750
as a Hispanic, generally
specifically

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.520
as a Mexican American.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.840
Granted you used to follow the
janitors into the restroom just

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.860
to hear them speak
Spanish because you were

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.960
so lonesome for hearing Spanish.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.160
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: Right,
when I - before I left

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.690
for Philadelphia I called
several people in El Paso

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.240
and I said, "Do you
know anyone in Philly?"

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.830
And one of them said there's
- this was a union leader

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.530
in El Paso said "There's a guy
named [Inaudible] Rodriguez

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:30.590
who is a human rights activist
and he might be the only Mexican

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:35.830
in the whole region;
so be nice to him."

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.480
And he gave me the number.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.070
This is before social media.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.200
So I remember I called
him and called him

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.360
and he finally answered
the phone, "Bueno?"

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.830
And I thought, okay
I'm in Heaven.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:49.860
And that's really -
that's how we met.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:54.820
It was [Inaudible] and I, we
meet at an Indian restaurant,

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.420
right near the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.340
I think after our
third meeting we said,

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.410
there's got to be something
- we loved Indian food,

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.620
but there's got to be something
closer to Mexican food.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.830
Even if - and he
said there's a write

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:12.440
up in the Philadelphia
Enquirer about a restaurant

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.160
that just opened up,
and it's Mexican.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.460
And I thought it's probably part

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.950
of that Chi Chi's
chain or something.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:21.480
But we were so desperate
that we made it to Tequila's,

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.010
the restaurant was Tequila's.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:28.530
And it was on Locust Street
and it was that night -

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.880
a wintery night in Philadelphia

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.470
where we met these
four other Mexicans.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.030
And it was at that moment that -

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.780
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: These
are the characters?

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.290
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: These
are the main characters,

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:42.410
[Inaudible] who ends up
becoming a Tequila connoisseur

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:46.200
and now he's in [Inaudible]
and the restaurant.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:51.430
He probably has the best
Mexican restaurant -

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.400
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Tequila's
still exist.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.680
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado:
Tequila's still exist.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.290
In fact it expanded.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:00.030
A second guy [Inaudible]
at the time just graduated

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:04.810
from the University of
Pennsylvania and ran

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.710
for mayor a couple years ago.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:09.560
He has probably a
future as mayor.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.860
He dropped out.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.430
His mother was very
ill and later died

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.450
and obviously [Inaudible]
Rodriguez.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.530
But I thought these four
characters could sort

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.530
of help tell the story
that's been told forever,

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:23.160
a story about immigration.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.640
But for me in telling the story

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.660
through these four
people I was really trying

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.750
to tell the larger story.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:33.440
And the person who
really inspired me more

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.050
than anything was my father

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.570
and his generation
of bracero workers.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.980
How do I tell that story?

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.690
How do I tell the
bigger story at a time

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.440
when Mexican migration
has really slowed down.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.780
I mean you hear a lot
about the invasion coming

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.710
from the south, from Mexico.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.070
Mexican migration is
at an all-time low.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:56.400
And people in my
father's generation,

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.350
bracero generation
they're in their 70s, 80s,

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:03.910
90s most of them - a
lot of them are dying.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:05.970
So that was really my way to try

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:10.010
to tell this bigger
story is friendship

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.650
and the backdrop you have
the biggest migration shift

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.990
in the United States.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:20.600
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Right, and you
really over these last 30 years,

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.010
you've really sort of
explored your dual identity.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.460
There's a line here that I love.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:31.190
[Inaudible] and his
restaurant I think you ask him

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:33.510
if he has nachos or
something like that.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.810
And he says [Spanish].

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:40.380
I can't translate that because
this is going to be archived.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.190
But basically he's saying
no way do I have nachos,

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.300
that's like dirty Tex Mex food.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.100
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado:
This was from his menu

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.270
and it said Nachos [Inaudible].

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.860
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: That's
what it was, yeah.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.090
He's obligated to have nachos.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.540
And then he says to you that's
just dirty Tex Mex food.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.990
Do you remember what
you said to him?

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:04.850
Maybe it was - it
might have been Primo.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:09.240
"I wasn't so sure how to defend
that other than remind him

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.370
that Tex Mex is not so different

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.190
from what we were
becoming at table 21.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:17.850
Something else that wasn't
soley Mexican anymore."

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.150
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado:
Right, right.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:20.860
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: So you
begin to see yourself sort

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:24.120
of in an analogous
way to Tex Mex food.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.560
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: Tex Mex
food and I would also say

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.130
that it was Philadelphia,
because it was Tequila's we -

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.170
at the end of the day we ended
up becoming more Mexican.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:37.860
I think more Mexican than I
would have become on the border

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:42.730
or in El Paso because it gave
us a much more of an identity.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:47.270
And the nostalgia
obviously played a big role,

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.520
the music and yes, the Tequila.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.240
I mean it - I mean when we met

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.560
about a year ago we had a 30
years reunion and we met -

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.150
and we looked at one another.

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:00.870
And it was Primo
who looked at us

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.350
and said "Aren't you
glad you made the move?

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:06.290
You would never have been as
Mexican as you are today."

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:08.350
And I thought that was -

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.720
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Well
in your book,

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:12.850
and Primo is the Human
Right's activist.

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:16.860
David is the restaurant
owner and you have a section

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:21.610
in your book where David's son
is there and Primo tells him,

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:23.800
I'm going to read this for you

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.000
that his father David has
built his own Mexico here

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.300
in Philadelphia.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.120
He doesn't need to
be back in Mexico.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.450
He lives in the Mexico he has
built for himself and for us,

00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:38.100
a Mexico more real than
the one he left behind

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.430
which is what you're saying.

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:42.210
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: And the
context of that was right

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:49.220
after - right after the
election in 2016 there was a lot

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.280
of debate, especially
with David and myself

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.580
as to whether we would stay

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.700
in the United States
or go back to Mexico.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.240
And so his son was
incredibly fearful

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.110
that his father would
actually move

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:03.830
to [Spanish] where he's from.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.230
And so there was
all this debate.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:11.250
Dave had just become a
father and he kept sort

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:13.770
of imagining his father
and his son growing

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.070
up without a grandfather.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.150
And so that was this
big debate going on.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:22.160
Do we go back to Mexico or
do we stay in this country?

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.840
We ended up staying.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.720
But as David says you know we
don't really have to choose,

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:33.150
because he's [Inaudible] in
Philadelphia and the same thing

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.260
with me going back and forth.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.690
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Francisco,
the Mexicans

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:40.880
that you were encountering as
a border patrol agent there -

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:46.140
the experience of coming to this
country is a really traumatic

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.380
experience because you're
dealing with the ones

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.420
who are coming illegally.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.500
And you talked about
the disconnect

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.470
that many border patrol
agents feel from the lives

00:35:55.470 --> 00:36:00.860
of the people that they
are monitoring or tracking.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.460
Did you feel that yourself?

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.610
There are certainly moments
where you are really connecting

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.620
with these people and then
you find yourself sort

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.070
of forgetting their names
or - you know what was it

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.880
like to sort of connect with
them and then disconnect?

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.520
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: You
know I think a big theme

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:22.330
of this book is how institutions
are built often in a way

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:25.460
that dehumanizes the
people that they deal with.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:29.020
And so you know I think
that disconnect comes

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.250
from the training
that you're given

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.370
and the border patrol academy.

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:38.800
You're taking people who
they have this background,

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.490
they have this connection
often with these people

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:45.480
but then you step into this
academy and you know it's much

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.640
like military, law
enforcement, any military

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.940
or law enforcement
training where you're kind

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.220
of like breaking down
someone's sense of who they are

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.550
and where they come from
and you're rebuilding them

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.720
in the image of this
enforcement agent.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:05.530
And so I think you know
you are being trained

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.490
that the people you're
encountering are criminals,

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:10.590
and you're being trained
that the encounters

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:14.510
that you're having are criminal
encounters and at any point

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:17.660
like this person could
pose a threat to you,

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.440
which you know I understand
why that has to be the training

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.950
because you're dealing with
drug trafficking as well.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:29.710
But the reality of that is when
you're in that job you know most

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.490
of the time when you're
encountering somebody,

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:35.170
that's a humanitarian encounter,
it's not a criminal encounter.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:38.710
You're encountering someone
at least where I worked

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.990
in the deserts of Arizona,
you're encountering people

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:46.570
who are lost, who haven't
had food or water for days.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:52.960
And at the same time that's
being normalized because -

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.820
because it happens every day.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.810
And so I think it can
be really challenging

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:03.710
to people develop these
defense mechanisms

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:08.890
where they push away the part
of that - the like human part

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:11.540
of themselves, the part of
themselves that is compassionate

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.900
and that would you know feel
empathy for these people,

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.650
because you have to wake up
the next day and do it again.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:21.060
And you're sending these
people back to the places

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.890
that they've risked
their lives to flee.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:28.110
And so I think that began
to take a toll on me

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:31.010
and that's ultimately why I left

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.000
and why I began writing
this book is

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.890
because it was you know
you realize all the things

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.960
that have become normal to
you and but that's not normal,

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.410
and you don't want
that for your life.

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:48.820
And you don't want to become
calloused, and you don't want

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:53.870
to become disconnected from
the humanity of these people

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:58.100
and so you know for me I thought

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.860
that leaving the border patrol
was you know the separation

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.040
from that and that I had kind
of done my work to move past

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.920
that part of my identity but
it was really this encounter

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.930
that you mentioned, with
somebody that I worked

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:12.610
with years after I
left the border patrol

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.390
who wasn't documented
and was deported

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:19.310
and because I had
become friends with him

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:21.780
and because I knew the
inside of this system,

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.630
I sort of helped his family
navigate the deportation

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:28.920
process, brought his kids to
see him in court and in jail.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:33.350
And that was the first time
that I saw behind the other side

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:37.060
of this immigration
deportation complex

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.360
that we are seeing right now

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.800
and actually talking
about right now.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.120
But you know seeing it

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.790
and seeing how it affected
somebody I cared about,

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.140
somebody's family.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:50.140
And seeing how profoundly
borders can be this

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.440
violent thing.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.730
Because I think Alfredo and
I we both have a lot of love

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:55.970
for living on the border.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:58.250
It's this region; it's
this culture that we love.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:01.900
But for so many people even if
they live in Washington D.C.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.880
or they live in the Midwest

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.270
when they get deported
the border is being thrust

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:10.000
into their lives again, and it's
also being thrust into the lives

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.450
of their kids and
their family members.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:14.360
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: I'm going
to give you a chance

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.750
in the audience to ask some
questions now and it seems

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:21.450
to me an obvious way to go here.

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:25.740
Is these experiences that
you write about are happening

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:31.250
in a particular political
moment when the border is a word

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:35.100
that we hear used in a discourse
all the time in border policy

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:41.060
and immigration policy
are so front and center.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.180
And so I'm guessing that
some of you have questions

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:51.240
about the wall, about
immigration policy,

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.170
etc. So we got about
10 minutes left here.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:56.470
You ma'am.

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:58.960
&gt;&gt; Hi my name is Lila Hernandez;
I work at American University

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.090
and once an Eagle,
always an Eagle.

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:05.770
I wondered if either of you
two had the same experience

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.210
that I had growing
up on the border.

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:12.440
I grew up in Michelin and in the
90s we teenagers would just go

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:17.410
to Renosa to go dancing and
clubbing every Friday night.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:21.150
And I know that a lot of
serious things are happening

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:22.680
on the border and do
happen on the border.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.670
But did any of you
have those experiences

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.450
when you were teenagers.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:29.810
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: I grew
up at the Kentucky Club

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:36.640
in [Inaudible] and I mean
yeah, it was our life as -

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:40.300
I went to school at UTEP
and community college

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:45.330
so really it was friends
it was just on and on,

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:49.050
I mean the [Inaudible] and that
is one of the hardest things

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:52.630
as a border resident to see
if how we've just sort of left

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.230
that behind and how
we - I mean I talked

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.570
to young generations
today of people

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:02.250
and they have no idea
what this is all about.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.550
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: So
young people growing

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:04.850
up in El Paso now don't go back?

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.150
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: They
don't go back as much.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:09.750
I mean some do, but not what
the - not in the same numbers

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.460
when I was growing up.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:15.310
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: And when
I was young and in college

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:17.260
and really sort of
falling in love

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:23.530
with the border you know it
was a place that was so fun

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:25.950
and joyous and full
of so much life.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:30.100
And you know then having
the experience of working

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.080
in the border patrol,
you know which is

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.790
in so many ways this
very violent job

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:39.400
and you're seeing things
through this very violent lens.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:44.240
That's been a really
hard thing for me

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.340
because I also see the ways
that we through our policy

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.640
and through our rhetoric

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.300
and through our discourse
we have turned the border

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.170
into this place that
is to be feared.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:58.600
And we have you know, we are
constantly othering the people

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.140
that are on the other
side of it.

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.930
We're constantly othering
even the region itself that is

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:06.920
in the United States as if
you know, when you hear a lot

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.100
of politicians talk about the
border, they're talking about it

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:13.990
as this sort of wasteland,
this disposable landscape.

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:18.300
And it's - but it's a place
that I love and it's a place

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:23.850
that the culture you know,
predates the border being there.

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:26.560
And I think that was a very
hard journey for me because -

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.420
and it's also very
hard as a writer

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:31.850
and I know Alfredo has this
problem too where you want

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:34.010
to capture, you want

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:37.700
to communicate how
grave this situation is

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:42.120
and how you know the
stakes of it for the people

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.560
who are crossing the border.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.870
And you know the violence
that exists on the border

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:49.270
and on the other side.

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:51.310
But you also want to
capture it; you don't want

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:53.670
that to be the only thing that
you represent about the place.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:57.010
You also want to capture
the joy and the love

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:59.850
and the culture and
pride in that.

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:02.560
And so I think that's
part of our challenges

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.860
as people writing about -

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.400
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: And really
the co-dependency on both sides.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.040
One side doesn't thrive
without the other.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.110
I think that's something like El
Paso has realized over the years

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:16.580
that you can't turn
your back to place

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.470
like [Inaudible]
because of violence.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:22.900
I think Tijuana and San Diego
try to do that and they realize

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.440
in the end you know, you're
connected and you have

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.290
to be a solution for both sides.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:32.230
I mean it's - I don't want to
scare people about the border,

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:37.130
but the U.S. side of the border
today it's - they represent some

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:39.780
of the safest communities
anywhere in the United States.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:43.610
On the Mexican side you
still have the ups and downs,

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:49.110
the flows etc. But on the U.S.
side it's not just a beautiful

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:53.190
place, not just a great place,
but it's also a very safe place.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:54.580
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: You ma'am.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.160
&gt;&gt; Thanks for this discussion.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.340
Most of this is focused on
the Mexican U.S. relationship

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.810
and I just wanted to know
if you have any reflections

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:04.160
about the other people coming

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.010
through the borders whether the
Central Americans, Hondurans,

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:08.760
Guatemalans, everyone else?

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.080
What are some of the
experiences and reflections?

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.380
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Did you run

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.680
across very many
Central Americans?

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.980
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu:
In the time that I was

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:20.160
in the border patrol it
was still primarily people

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.420
from Mexico but we were
beginning to see that shift.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:25.900
You know I think what's
important to keep in mind

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:29.940
about because now Central
America migration has overtaken

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.550
Mexican migration as Alfredo
mentioned, Mexican migration is

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:35.340
at one of the lowest
points it's ever been.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:38.530
And Central Americans
have you know,

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:40.570
they are crossing the border -

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:44.220
the undocumented crossings are
primarily Central American now.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.750
This year I think
was the first year

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:48.190
that happened, that
switch happened.

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:50.080
But I think the thing that's
important to keep in mind is

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.590
that those - the people
who are crossing the border

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:56.860
from Central America have
already endured this grueling

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:58.880
crossing through Mexico.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.820
The Guatemalan Mexico
border is very dangerous;

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.430
the U.S. is sending
a lot of money

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:05.540
to help militarize that border.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:10.920
And training Mexican
officials and so these people,

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.610
you know the minute that
they leave their doorstep

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:15.750
in El Salvador, Guatemala

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.520
like their bodies
are being commodified

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.840
by the trafficking
organizations that are profiting

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.580
by moving them through
the interior of Mexico.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.330
You know the constant
subject of threats by gangs

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:34.150
and law enforcement throughout
the duration of that journey.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:37.520
So when they get to the United
States I mean that's just sort

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.230
of when they get to the
U.S. border that's just the

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.710
next step.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:44.030
And I think we forget that.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:47.090
And I think that we forget that
these people are really refugees

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:50.630
and I think that we've
sort of dirtied that word

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:52.170
in our discourse in this country

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.540
like we're using refugee
as this dirty word.

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.780
But you know growing up
like you recognize refugees

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.610
as the most vulnerable
population that you know

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:07.510
that we have an obligation to
you know help these people.

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:13.050
[ Applause ]

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.690
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is
Maria and I also grew

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:18.180
up on the border region
actually in Edinburgh.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.930
So shout out to whoever
was from [Inaudible].

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:24.570
And my question is how do
you deal with your identity -

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:26.340
I often feel like
most [Inaudible].

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:30.550
And then my other question
is with militarization

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:34.040
of the border what is your view
on the violation of privacy

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:39.970
of citizens in the
border regions.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:44.530
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: I arrived
in Mexico - Mexico City in 94

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:47.610
and that really felt
[Inaudible].

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:48.910
I think -

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.390
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: Neither
here nor there.

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:54.260
&gt;&gt; Alfredo Corchado: You had
to claim one or the other.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.990
I think those feelings are
really - have really changed.

00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:01.970
I mean I find that
Mexico has become a much,

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:03.270
much more accepting.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:04.570
Obviously the United
States is going through -

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.940
there's a lot of diversity.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:13.480
So it's that sense of
seamless where I go to Mexico.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:18.420
I'm in Mexico City and all I
hear is English from Mexicans.

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.590
I come to the United States
and it's the same thing.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:25.100
I feel - I don't feel that
sense of machismo anymore.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.720
I'm not a [Inaudible] anymore.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.020
[Inaudible].

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.610
And that's - I mean that
was the thing that I wanted

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:36.030
to come across in this book.

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:42.370
In Mexico [Inaudible], but
it's really coming together.

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:46.030
School children in Mexico are
now required to learn English

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:48.670
and speak English; so those -

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:52.130
I mean I'm responding
to you as a Mexican.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:58.010
Because when I was over there
I would get all this crap you

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:01.020
know, you were - you
betrayed us and so forth.

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.920
Those feelings are largely gone.

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:07.340
&gt;&gt; Tom Gjelten: We have
literally one minute left

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.710
quick questions.

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:11.220
&gt;&gt; Okay I spent some time

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.050
on the border this summer
doing humanitarian aid work

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:16.890
and Francisco if you could
speak to the relationship

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:19.810
between border patrol and
humanitarian aid workers.

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:23.420
Because I witnesses border
patrol destroying humanitarian

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.130
aid supplies in the
desert in Arizona.

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:27.640
&gt;&gt; Francisco Cantu: Thank
you for mentioning that.

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:30.040
There's a case that everyone
should be paying attention

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:34.140
to right now where humanitarian
aid worker his name is Scott

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:37.100
Warren, was arrested
by the border patrol.

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:40.940
There was long, at least
under Obama there was sort

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:45.800
of this uneasy peace
between the two sides.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:51.190
And now under the new
administration humanitarian aid

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.460
workers are being arrested
and charged with littering

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.920
by leaving water
out in the desert.

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.930
And so it's a really
important case

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:02.990
and I think you know
criminalizing humanitarian aid

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:12.510
is you know, I think it's really
unforgiveable and I think that -

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:16.050
[ Applause ]

00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:17.710
And the last thing I'll say
because we're out of time is

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:22.750
that I think you know sort of
up to us to maintain outrage

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:25.120
at the border patrol
slashing water bottles

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.420
or dumping water bottles.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.320
We all saw - maybe we didn't
all see it but there's a video

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.390
that went around
and become viral.

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:34.810
And we keep forgetting
that's happening

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:37.170
and then a video comes
out and we remember.

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:40.590
And I think we have to sustain
our outrage at those practices

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:43.070
and hold these institutions
accountable

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:45.510
so that change will happen.

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:50.040

Alfredo Corchado, Homelands
Four Friends, Two Countries

and the fate of the great
Mexican American migration.

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.620
Thanks to you.

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:02.920
