00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Last unit we talked about HTTPS--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
how to use the transport layer security protocols to first do a handshake,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to agree on our secret key, and then to have a secure channel between the client and server.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What these messages are we just drew as arrows, but what they really are--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if we think Internet, well, their message is going through routers on the Internet.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There may be many hops between the client and the server.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Along these hops will go packets.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Because they're using TLS, part of the packet is the encrypted message,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but another part of the packet is the routing information.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is necessary so R1 knows the direction to send the message.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It needs to know that the goal is to reach the server.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Any eavesdropper who can see one of these messages, and it could be the first one

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
from the client to the first router or maybe she is intercepting

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a message on some later routing path.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
She can learn that the client and the server are talking to each other.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is a form of traffic analysis where the important property we want to hide

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is not the contents of the message, which if HTTPS is working correctly, are encrypted

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and cannot be understood by Eve.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But what we really want to hide is the fact that this client is talking to the server

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
or that Alice is talking to Bob.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The mere presence of communication between two parties

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is often enough to cause problems.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
An example would be if the client is a dissident in some oppressive country

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and is connecting to server, it's used by dissidents to communicate

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
or a server in another country that's viewed as a threat.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If we want to prevent this kind of traffic analysis, we want to prevent

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
adversaries who can observe messages on the routers from

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
being able to know which parties are communicating,

00:01:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we need to do something else.
