00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.549
Let's go back to a demonstration here, and
I am going to show you an app called crashy.

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:12.549
It does exactly that really well. Matt, why
don't you start the app, and it crashed.

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.360
Note there's a button there called Report.
The user can press Report, can provide a description

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.820
of what happened. They can look at all the
data they are going to send, make sure they

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.050
are comfortable with that data and they can
hit send. And that is sent back to the developer.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.820
Note on this screen the Android Marketplace,
note a brand-new tab, "Bugs." And when you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.290
click on bugs we will show you those reports
for your application, and we will show you

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.660
the entire stack trace of what happened.
[ Applause ]

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:57.910
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: We thought you might like
that. And closing the loop, allowing apps

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:06.479
to get better and better.
All right. Let's go back to slides.

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.420
I want to go a little bit beyond Froyo and
show you a sneak peek at other exciting things

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.719
that we are doing in the Android Marketplace.
I think you are going to like some of these

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:21.850
things. Let's go back to demo.
Matt is now showing you the Android Marketplace,

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.000
except this is unlike anything you have ever
seen before. It's the Android Marketplace

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.109
accessible from a browser on a PC, and that's
great.

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:37.979
Matt can browse apps, he can look at reviews,
but you will look up in the upper right-hand

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.770
corner, Matt is signed in, and because he
is signed in, we know every Android device

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.779
that he has.
[ Laughter ]

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:52.359
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yeah, he is a little weird.
In this case, the device that he has on the

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:58.029
stage, he has selected at nutter butter, nutty
buddy, something. Like I said, he is weird.

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:02.840
He has got his phone selected, and so now
he can go browse a particular app. He is going

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.310
to find an app he likes like Open Table. Hold
on, hold on Matt. He is going to hit free

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.580
and he is going to go and download the app.
What do you think happens? Let's see, what

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.670
happens today on some other systems. You find
the app, you download it to your PC or Mac.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.560
You then have to tether your device. Once
it's on your PC, you have to then convert

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.970
it over that tethering to your device and
then make that sync happen. Well, guess what?

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.690
We discovered something really cool. It's
called the Internet.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.690
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And when Matt presses download,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.050
keep your eye on the Android device.
[ Applause ]

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:57.510
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Over the air.
Isn't that totally great? Over the air, installed

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.000
on your device.
Now, it turns out it's called the Android

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.230
 -- or the Marketplace because it's more than
apps. In fact, what we are about to show you

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:15.460
is a new category.
How about some music?

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.000
Matt, why don't you find an album or song
you like, and why don't you just send it to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.370
the device using the Internet, over the air.
And boom, keep your eye on the Android device.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.159
There you go. There is the music coming right
on down.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:43.010
[ Cheering and Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Now, we're not done yet. Some

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.910
of you may be thinking this is really cool,
this is so hot, but I have my music already

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.670
on my device at home, my Windows media or
my iTunes library. I have thousands of songs

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.780
there. What do I do with those?
We recently acquired a company called Simplified

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.850
Media and it is our intention to incorporate
that technology into the marketplace as well

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.600
and that allows you at home to run a simple
piece of hardware that makes all your non-DRM

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.560
music available to your Android device. Would
you like to see this? Let's go to your Android

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.529
device.
Android device has two songs on it. That's

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:23.120
nice, but I want more than two songs. I want
all my music I have.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.820
So Matt will go down and select -- I guess
he has to plug in the device so you can hear

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.749
it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Options, touch nine. Thank you for calling

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:39.409
the fifth floor restaurant.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: My God!

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.080
[ Applause ]
[ Laughter ]

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.110
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Let me offer a public apology.
Now.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.509
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You know what's really odd?

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.870
Is that they didn't pick up all that time.
[ Laughter ]

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.599
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Wow!
Getting back to music. Two songs. I want all

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:03.090
my music. He is going to select that button
that says all, and magically, all the music

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.159
is now available.
Now, you might be wondering what just happened?

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:12.520
We are making your whole music library available
to your Android device as a stream. So, for

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.850
example, if Matt was to select a particular
song, I guess Matt's an Earth, Wind and Fire

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.929
fan, hit play. Will this work?
(music playing).

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:35.080
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yeah, we think users are going

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:50.750
to love this feature.
All right. Let's go back to slides.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:58.620
Let's talk a little bit about advertising.
It turns out that we know a little bit about

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:05.580
advertising. Today happens or this year happens
to be Google's tenth anniversary of providing

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.870
advertising solutions. And we have learned
a few things in that decade.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.139
One of the foremost things we have learned
is if you want to have a healthy ecosystem

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:22.370
of advertising, you need advertisers. And
we have hundreds of thousands of them.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.370
That means if you have an ad spot, we have
a relevant ad that can fill it. It's called

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.430
inventory.
We're not new at this game. We're not working

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.860
with a handful of partners and charging them
a million dollars each to be a part of our

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.259
program.
Okay? So we can be your advertising partner.

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:46.300
We have also learned something else in that
decade. That advertisers and accomplishers

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.360
have different kinds of needs.
There are local advertisers, there's direct

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.289
response advertisers, there are brand advertisers.
And if you want to play, you need formats

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:02.689
that meet the needs of those kinds of advertisers.
And we have those formats.

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:09.729
A third thing that we have learned, advertising
needs to be measured. And that means it needs

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.400
to have great tools.
Why does it need to be measured? Well, you

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.550
need to know if the money you are spending
is giving you a return on the investment.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.460
You need to know which campaigns are working
so you can invest more in them or tweak them

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.039
as necessary.
And it turns out that we have some tools you

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:33.539
might have heard of called DoubleClick, analytics,
AdSense, AdWords? The tools the industry knows

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:37.740
and loves are being used seamlessly to work
in the mobile environment.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.559
And finally, we know it's important to be
open to innovation.

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:47.750
Now, I don't even know what the ponies have
to do with this slide, but part of being open

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.679
is when you get a designer who gives you a
slide, you go with it.

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:54.580
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Let's show you each one of

00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:03.569
these four points and go to demos.
Now, these are real advertisers and real applications.

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:08.169
Let me make that point clear. You are looking
at Backgrounds. One of the most popular applications

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:13.439
available in the Android Marketplace.
At the top, you are looking at a Google ad.

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:18.830
Our ad program, which has been available only
to a limited number of beta participants,

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:24.330
is called AdSense for Mobile Apps, AFMA, and
you are looking at one of those AFMA ads.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:29.330
You are looking at our large inventory of
text ads being optimized and served on that

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.490
device. We are taking advantage of the small
space we have and you are seeing the nice

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.680
rotation. That's just one ad format. What
happens if Matt selects something like beaches?

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:45.770
Then we can serve a contextually relevant
ad. In this case, Kayak is a popular Web site,

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:51.340
an application for travel. But in this case
when you click on the ad, we take you to deep

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:57.010
within the Android Marketplace so the user
can download the app. That's another important

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:01.020
ad format.
Let's show you another format.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:06.710
This is a third format for brand advertising.
In other words, a banner ad where an advertiser

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:11.650
has decided to convey their message through
an image. We support that.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:16.310
How about another category, and this is something
that we are announcing available today, and

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.900
that's an expandable ad format.
One of the things that we have seen through

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.800
our research is that users, if at all possible,
would like to stay within the context of the

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.170
application they are using.
So in this case, when Matt selects that Volkswagen

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.920
ad, it expands right out, you can look at
that ad and when he is done with it he can

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.360
simply make it slide right back in.
We think that's great for advertisers, and

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.620
we think that's great for users.
That expandable format is available today.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.700
Let me show you another brand-new one we are
making available today. This is an expandable

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:52.260
ad format. This is a Flixter application.
Why don't you expand that ad out. In this

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.530
case it's not just display; it's rich media.
He is linking directly to a trailer. He clicked

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.160
on it and the trailer will begin
