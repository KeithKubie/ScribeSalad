single variable holding all others
 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:04.330
single variable holding all others
constant okay okay so what's the

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340
constant okay okay so what's the
 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.190
constant okay okay so what's the
interpretation of the partial derivative

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200
interpretation of the partial derivative
 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.300
interpretation of the partial derivative
well it is simply the rate of change of

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310
well it is simply the rate of change of
 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.930
well it is simply the rate of change of
the function with respect to X for all

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940
the function with respect to X for all
 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.050
the function with respect to X for all
other variables held constant for all

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060
other variables held constant for all
 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.090
other variables held constant for all
other input variables held constant

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100
other input variables held constant
 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.660
other input variables held constant
right or keeping all other input

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670
right or keeping all other input
 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:31.180
right or keeping all other input
variables constant what is the what's

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190
variables constant what is the what's
 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.200
variables constant what is the what's
the change in the output variable for a

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210
the change in the output variable for a
 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.040
the change in the output variable for a
small change in X

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050
small change in X
 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.170
small change in X
when X is the variable with respect to

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180
when X is the variable with respect to
 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.879
when X is the variable with respect to
which you are taking the partial

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889
which you are taking the partial
 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:49.540
which you are taking the partial
derivative okay so how do you do partial

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550
derivative okay so how do you do partial
 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.439
derivative okay so how do you do partial
differentiation well the mechanics are

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449
differentiation well the mechanics are
 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:07:00.189
differentiation well the mechanics are
very simple since we assume that all

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199
very simple since we assume that all
 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:02.710
very simple since we assume that all
other by definition the partial

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720
other by definition the partial
 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.290
other by definition the partial
derivative assumes that all other

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300
derivative assumes that all other
 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.020
derivative assumes that all other
variables are kept constant you can

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030
variables are kept constant you can
 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.629
variables are kept constant you can
treat all other variables as a constant

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639
treat all other variables as a constant
 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:15.189
treat all other variables as a constant
and as such they're derivative would be

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199
and as such they're derivative would be
 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.150
and as such they're derivative would be
zero so take for example this function

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160
zero so take for example this function
 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.680
zero so take for example this function
5x cubed Y squared and you want to find

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:23.690
5x cubed Y squared and you want to find
 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:30.390
5x cubed Y squared and you want to find
the partial derivative with respect to X

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400
 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.080
you could think of this function as a

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.090
you could think of this function as a
 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.689
you could think of this function as a
function simply of X with this Y squared

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:40.699
function simply of X with this Y squared
 

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:44.379
function simply of X with this Y squared
as part of the constant okay so here

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:44.389
as part of the constant okay so here
 

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:47.589
as part of the constant okay so here
I've written it as if 5y squared is some

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599
I've written it as if 5y squared is some
 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:56.560
I've written it as if 5y squared is some
constant times X cubed okay well if you

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:56.570
constant times X cubed okay well if you
 

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.020
constant times X cubed okay well if you
had some constant times X cubed and you

00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.030
had some constant times X cubed and you
 

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.589
had some constant times X cubed and you
had to take and it was just a univariate

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:02.599
had to take and it was just a univariate
 

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:07.409
had to take and it was just a univariate
function of X then what would be its

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:07.419
function of X then what would be its
 

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:13.540
function of X then what would be its
derivative 333 x squared times the

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:13.550
derivative 333 x squared times the
 

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.350
derivative 333 x squared times the
constant okay so that's what you have 3x

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360
constant okay so that's what you have 3x
 

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.120
constant okay so that's what you have 3x
squared times the constant so don't

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.130
squared times the constant so don't
 

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:25.260
squared times the constant so don't
forget the constant right okay similarly

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:25.270
forget the constant right okay similarly
 

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.730
forget the constant right okay similarly
here you have a slightly more

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:27.740
here you have a slightly more
 

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.320
here you have a slightly more
complicated function this is a function

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.330
complicated function this is a function
 

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.959
complicated function this is a function
of x and y inside the brackets to the

00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:34.969
of x and y inside the brackets to the
 

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:42.790
of x and y inside the brackets to the
power 8 okay so you could simply think

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800
power 8 okay so you could simply think
 

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.560
power 8 okay so you could simply think
of this is 4x that's the function of X

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:46.570
of this is 4x that's the function of X
 

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:53.160
of this is 4x that's the function of X
plus 3y minus 5 that's some constant

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.170
 

00:08:53.170 --> 00:09:00.880
raised to the power 8 okay so it's as if

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:00.890
raised to the power 8 okay so it's as if
 

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:09.310
raised to the power 8 okay so it's as if
we f is really 4x plus some constant

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:09.320
we f is really 4x plus some constant
 

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.260
we f is really 4x plus some constant
raised to the power 8 okay this is f of

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:14.270
raised to the power 8 okay this is f of
 

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:28.079
raised to the power 8 okay this is f of
X so f prime of X here would be what 8

00:09:28.079 --> 00:09:28.089
X so f prime of X here would be what 8
 

00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:33.240
X so f prime of X here would be what 8
ok something in there to the power 7

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:33.250
ok something in there to the power 7
 

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:38.769
ok something in there to the power 7
okay so that's going to be 4x plus C am

00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:38.779
okay so that's going to be 4x plus C am
 

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:44.050
okay so that's going to be 4x plus C am
I done x 4 right plus the inside

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:44.060
I done x 4 right plus the inside
 

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.620
I done x 4 right plus the inside
derivative so i could just multiply here

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:47.630
derivative so i could just multiply here
 

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:56.139
derivative so i could just multiply here
by four okay and you would be you would

00:09:56.139 --> 00:09:56.149
by four okay and you would be you would
 

00:09:56.149 --> 00:10:00.510
by four okay and you would be you would
be just fine so that's four times 8 is

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:00.520
be just fine so that's four times 8 is
 

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:10.319
be just fine so that's four times 8 is
32 okay and that's what you have here

00:10:10.319 --> 00:10:10.329
32 okay and that's what you have here
 

00:10:10.329 --> 00:10:14.500
32 okay and that's what you have here
except that you know this C is really 3y

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:14.510
except that you know this C is really 3y
 

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:19.230
except that you know this C is really 3y
minus five okay

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240
minus five okay
 

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.340
minus five okay
yeah so this see I just defined this

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:23.350
yeah so this see I just defined this
 

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:28.650
yeah so this see I just defined this
constant on the fly meaning when I look

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:28.660
constant on the fly meaning when I look
 

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.610
constant on the fly meaning when I look
at this expression this is a function of

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:32.620
at this expression this is a function of
 

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.470
at this expression this is a function of
x and y however i'm looking for the

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480

00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959
partial derivative with respect only 2 X
 

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:43.320
partial derivative with respect only 2 X
in other words i'm taking a cross

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:43.330
in other words i'm taking a cross
 

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.970
in other words i'm taking a cross
section of that function holding Y

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:47.980
section of that function holding Y
 

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.100
section of that function holding Y
constant since I'm holding Y constant I

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.110
constant since I'm holding Y constant I
 

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.079
constant since I'm holding Y constant I
can pretend this is really a constant

00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:55.089
can pretend this is really a constant
 

00:10:55.089 --> 00:10:58.079
can pretend this is really a constant
and this I know is a constant so on the

00:10:58.079 --> 00:10:58.089
and this I know is a constant so on the
 

00:10:58.089 --> 00:11:03.720
and this I know is a constant so on the
fly i defined see to be this constant it

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:03.730
fly i defined see to be this constant it
 

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.090
fly i defined see to be this constant it
just made it simpler so that when i took

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:06.100
just made it simpler so that when i took
 

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.560
just made it simpler so that when i took
the derivative it was easier ok

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:10.570
the derivative it was easier ok
 

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:15.389
the derivative it was easier ok
everybody good ok so let's look at that

00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:15.399
everybody good ok so let's look at that
 

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:26.069
everybody good ok so let's look at that
heat loss problem again we've got the

00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079
heat loss problem again we've got the
 

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:27.750
heat loss problem again we've got the
heat loss function that we worked out

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760
heat loss function that we worked out
 

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:35.970
heat loss function that we worked out
before as a function of x y&amp;z so let's

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:35.980
before as a function of x y&amp;z so let's
 

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.949
before as a function of x y&amp;z so let's
say where we have to calculate and

00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:37.959
say where we have to calculate and
 

00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:41.280
say where we have to calculate and
interpret the partial derivative with

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:41.290
interpret the partial derivative with
 

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.920
interpret the partial derivative with

with seven and height five well what's

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:57.930
with seven and height five well what's
 

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.510
with seven and height five well what's
what's the partial of this with respect

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:00.520
what's the partial of this with respect
 

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:07.230
what's the partial of this with respect

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:14.040
to X what's the partial with respect to
X of this first term 11 y what about

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.050
X of this first term 11 y what about
 

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:21.090

this one what's the partial with respect

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:21.100
this one what's the partial with respect
 

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.630
this one what's the partial with respect
to X of the second term zero right this

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:24.640
to X of the second term zero right this
 

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.850
to X of the second term zero right this
is we would treat y and z is constant

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:26.860
is we would treat y and z is constant
 

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.930
is we would treat y and z is constant
and the last one would be 15 z ok so

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:30.940
and the last one would be 15 z ok so
 

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.000
and the last one would be 15 z ok so
this is 11 y plus 15

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.010
this is 11 y plus 15
 

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:38.790
this is 11 y plus 15
head and you could evaluate that at the

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800
head and you could evaluate that at the
 

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:45.150
head and you could evaluate that at the
value 10 75 it's only a function y and z

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160
value 10 75 it's only a function y and z
 

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.510
value 10 75 it's only a function y and z
so we only use the seven and five gives

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:48.520
so we only use the seven and five gives
 

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.930
so we only use the seven and five gives
you the number 152 well what's the

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940
you the number 152 well what's the
 

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:57.330
you the number 152 well what's the
interpretation of 152 I have the answer

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:57.340
interpretation of 152 I have the answer
 

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.430
interpretation of 152 I have the answer
up there but maybe somebody can read it

00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440
up there but maybe somebody can read it
 

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:05.700
up there but maybe somebody can read it
to us but if X if the length of the

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:05.710
to us but if X if the length of the
 

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.670
to us but if X if the length of the
building is increased by one unit right

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:08.680
building is increased by one unit right
 

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.500
building is increased by one unit right
so if I go from a length of 10 meters oh

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:13.510
so if I go from a length of 10 meters oh
 

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.290
so if I go from a length of 10 meters oh
I guess this was in feet right 10 feet

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:16.300
I guess this was in feet right 10 feet
 

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:21.630
I guess this was in feet right 10 feet
to 11 feet then the rate of heat loss

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:21.640
to 11 feet then the rate of heat loss
 

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.060
to 11 feet then the rate of heat loss
for the building as a whole would

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:24.070
for the building as a whole would
 

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.150
for the building as a whole would
increase by 152 units yes absolutely

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160
increase by 152 units yes absolutely
 

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.610
increase by 152 units yes absolutely
partial derivative could be negative in

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:29.620
partial derivative could be negative in
 

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.660
partial derivative could be negative in
this case it wouldn't be because heat

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:33.670
this case it wouldn't be because heat
 

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.940
this case it wouldn't be because heat
loss is going to be increasing as you

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:35.950
loss is going to be increasing as you
 

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:37.950
loss is going to be increasing as you
increase the dimensions of the building

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:37.960
increase the dimensions of the building
 

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.190
increase the dimensions of the building
but there's no for example in the case

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:41.200
but there's no for example in the case
 

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.580
but there's no for example in the case
of the fertilizer and labor if you

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:44.590
of the fertilizer and labor if you
 

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:49.380
of the fertilizer and labor if you
already had passed the optimal level of

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:49.390
already had passed the optimal level of
 

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.300
already had passed the optimal level of
Labor and fertilizer and you added more

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:51.310
Labor and fertilizer and you added more
 

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.180
Labor and fertilizer and you added more
labor you would have a negative partial

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:54.190
labor you would have a negative partial
 

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:59.970
labor you would have a negative partial
derivative okay okay but now suppose

00:13:59.970 --> 00:13:59.980
derivative okay okay but now suppose
 

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.880
derivative okay okay but now suppose
that we want to find the dimensions of

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:02.890
that we want to find the dimensions of
 

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.130
that we want to find the dimensions of
the building that minimises heat loss

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:07.140
the building that minimises heat loss
 

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.000
the building that minimises heat loss
okay as with univariate optimization

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.010
okay as with univariate optimization
 

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.780
okay as with univariate optimization
we're going to look for critical points

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:14.790
we're going to look for critical points
 

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.880
we're going to look for critical points
of the multivariate function and those

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:17.890
of the multivariate function and those
 

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:24.260
of the multivariate function and those
critical critical points will be

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:24.270
 

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.170
combinations of the input variables such

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:28.180
combinations of the input variables such
 

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.290
combinations of the input variables such
that the partial derivatives are equal

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:31.300
that the partial derivatives are equal
 

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:41.310
that the partial derivatives are equal
to zero okay now there are two look for

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:41.320
to zero okay now there are two look for
 

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.850
to zero okay now there are two look for
a minimum or a maximum

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:44.860
a minimum or a maximum
 

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.710
a minimum or a maximum
there is a first order condition and a

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720
there is a first order condition and a
 

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.390
there is a first order condition and a
second order condition when we optimized

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:51.400
second order condition when we optimized
 

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.990
second order condition when we optimized
the univariate functions I didn't tell

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000
the univariate functions I didn't tell
 

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.120
the univariate functions I didn't tell
you what the second order condition was

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.130
you what the second order condition was
 

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:02.020
you what the second order condition was
because I built it into my description I

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:02.030
because I built it into my description I
 

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.210
because I built it into my description I
told you that if you have a concave

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:04.220
told you that if you have a concave
 

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:10.450
told you that if you have a concave
function and you look for a zero of the

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:10.460
function and you look for a zero of the
 

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.240
function and you look for a zero of the
ordinary derivative then you are at a

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:13.250
ordinary derivative then you are at a
 

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.840
ordinary derivative then you are at a
maximum if you have a convex function

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:16.850
maximum if you have a convex function
 

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:22.480
maximum if you have a convex function
and you look for a zero of the ordinary

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:22.490
and you look for a zero of the ordinary
 

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.490
and you look for a zero of the ordinary
derivative then you're at a minimum okay

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:26.500
derivative then you're at a minimum okay
 

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:32.470
derivative then you're at a minimum okay
the first order condition is a necessary

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480
the first order condition is a necessary
 

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.630
the first order condition is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:36.640
but not sufficient condition for
 

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.660
but not sufficient condition for
attaining a minimum or maximum okay that

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:40.670
attaining a minimum or maximum okay that
 

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.520
attaining a minimum or maximum okay that
first order condition is that the

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:42.530
first order condition is that the
 

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:47.920
first order condition is that the
derivative is equal to zero if you want

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:47.930
derivative is equal to zero if you want
 

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.110
derivative is equal to zero if you want
a sufficient condition as well as a

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.120
a sufficient condition as well as a
 

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.540
a sufficient condition as well as a
necessary condition then you have to

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:52.550
necessary condition then you have to
 

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.530
necessary condition then you have to
look at the second order condition in

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:55.540
look at the second order condition in
 

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.900
look at the second order condition in
the univariate case we didn't bother

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:58.910
the univariate case we didn't bother
 

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.910
the univariate case we didn't bother
with that because we simply said that

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920
with that because we simply said that
 

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.829
with that because we simply said that
you'll either be looking at convex

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839
you'll either be looking at convex
 

00:16:02.839 --> 00:16:05.650
you'll either be looking at convex
functions or concave functions and if

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:05.660
functions or concave functions and if
 

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.840
functions or concave functions and if
you're dealing with a concave function

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:07.850
you're dealing with a concave function
 

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.180
you're dealing with a concave function
you're going to have a maximum and if

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:10.190
you're going to have a maximum and if
 

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.890
you're going to have a maximum and if
you're dealing with a convex function

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:11.900
you're dealing with a convex function
 

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.750
you're dealing with a convex function
you're going to have a minimum okay and

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:13.760
you're going to have a minimum okay and
 

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.420
you're going to have a minimum okay and
you can remember that by remembering the

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:16.430
you can remember that by remembering the
 

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.960
you can remember that by remembering the
shapes of those graphs that I put up

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:19.970
shapes of those graphs that I put up
 

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.280
shapes of those graphs that I put up
right at the beginning of this session

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:23.290
right at the beginning of this session
 

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:29.850
right at the beginning of this session
with multivariate functions you

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:29.860
with multivariate functions you
 

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.960
with multivariate functions you
typically need to think about

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:31.970
typically need to think about
 

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.690
typically need to think about
second-order conditions more carefully

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:34.700
second-order conditions more carefully
 

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.920
second-order conditions more carefully
because there are many more possible

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:38.930
because there are many more possible
 

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.050
because there are many more possible
scenarios it's not so much that the

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:41.060
scenarios it's not so much that the
 

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.870
scenarios it's not so much that the
function is concave or convex because

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880
function is concave or convex because
 

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.520
function is concave or convex because
you're in three dimensions now it could

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:48.530
you're in three dimensions now it could
 

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.790
you're in three dimensions now it could
be concave if you take a section along

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800
be concave if you take a section along
 

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.820
be concave if you take a section along
one axis but convex if you take a

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:54.830
one axis but convex if you take a
 

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.130
one axis but convex if you take a
section along the other it could be

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:57.140
section along the other it could be
 

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.210
section along the other it could be
concave in both

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:58.220
concave in both
 

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.850
concave in both
ways and so on right and if you have

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:00.860
ways and so on right and if you have
 

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.640
ways and so on right and if you have
three if you have three input variables

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:03.650
three if you have three input variables
 

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:08.170
three if you have three input variables
then you're in even more with even many

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:08.180
then you're in even more with even many
 

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.940
then you're in even more with even many
more probabilities many more

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:09.950
more probabilities many more
 

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.880
more probabilities many more
combinations so you would need to look

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:12.890
combinations so you would need to look
 

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:18.150
combinations so you would need to look
at the second order condition okay so

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160
at the second order condition okay so
 

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.200
at the second order condition okay so
we'll talk about the second order

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:20.210
we'll talk about the second order
 

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.540
we'll talk about the second order
condition in a second the first order

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:22.550
condition in a second the first order
 

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.600
condition in a second the first order
condition is always that the partial

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:25.610
condition is always that the partial
 

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:28.660
condition is always that the partial
derivatives of both with respect to X

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:28.670
derivatives of both with respect to X
 

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.570
derivatives of both with respect to X
and with respect to Y are equal to 0 and

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:31.580
and with respect to Y are equal to 0 and
 

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.030
and with respect to Y are equal to 0 and
of course if this were a function of

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.040
of course if this were a function of
 

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.020
of course if this were a function of
three variables then all three partials

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:38.030
three variables then all three partials
 

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.830
three variables then all three partials
will have to be equal to 0 and so on

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840
will have to be equal to 0 and so on
 

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:47.560
will have to be equal to 0 and so on
okay for the energy energy loss the heat

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:47.570
okay for the energy energy loss the heat
 

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:51.340
okay for the energy energy loss the heat
loss function we have a function of

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:51.350
loss function we have a function of
 

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:57.250
loss function we have a function of
three variables if we're looking for a

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:57.260
three variables if we're looking for a
 

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:03.190
three variables if we're looking for a
minimum of this function then we would

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200
minimum of this function then we would
 

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.500
minimum of this function then we would
have to set all three partials equal to

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:05.510
have to set all three partials equal to
 

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:11.890
have to set all three partials equal to
zero okay now here suppose that we want

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:11.900
zero okay now here suppose that we want
 

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.800
zero okay now here suppose that we want
to design the rectangular building with

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:14.810
to design the rectangular building with
 

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.730
to design the rectangular building with
a specific volume of course if you're

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:18.740
a specific volume of course if you're
 

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.130
a specific volume of course if you're
building is very small then its heat

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:21.140
building is very small then its heat
 

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.900
building is very small then its heat
loss will be much less than a large

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:22.910
loss will be much less than a large
 

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:26.680
loss will be much less than a large
building the key here is to have minimal

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:26.690
building the key here is to have minimal
 

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.220
building the key here is to have minimal
heat loss for a particular size so let's

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:30.230
heat loss for a particular size so let's
 

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:34.000
heat loss for a particular size so let's
suppose that we set the volume equal to

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.010
suppose that we set the volume equal to
 

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.670
suppose that we set the volume equal to
this I've chosen this number so that its

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:36.680
this I've chosen this number so that its
 

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.650
this I've chosen this number so that its
root is an integer so we don't have to

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:40.660
root is an integer so we don't have to
 

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:45.520
root is an integer so we don't have to
you know so we can do things nicely okay

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:45.530
you know so we can do things nicely okay
 

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.190
you know so we can do things nicely okay
we must we have to minimize the heat

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.200
we must we have to minimize the heat
 

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.370
we must we have to minimize the heat
loss function such that the volume which

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:51.380
loss function such that the volume which
 

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.980
loss function such that the volume which
is of course x y times X times y times Z

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:53.990
is of course x y times X times y times Z
 

00:18:53.990 --> 00:19:01.120
is of course x y times X times y times Z
is is that number okay OST means such

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.130
is is that number okay OST means such
 

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.850
is is that number okay OST means such
that such that you'll see this a lot

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:03.860
that such that you'll see this a lot
 

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.390
that such that you'll see this a lot
okay good question

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400
 

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.670
okay so we have to minimize that

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:11.680
okay so we have to minimize that
 

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.930
okay so we have to minimize that
function well actually this simplifies

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:15.940
function well actually this simplifies
 

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.420
function well actually this simplifies
things a little bit because we have a

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:18.430
things a little bit because we have a
 

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.470
things a little bit because we have a
constraint on the potential combinations

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480
constraint on the potential combinations
 

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.040
constraint on the potential combinations
of XY and Z and that's going to allow us

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.050
of XY and Z and that's going to allow us
 

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.110
of XY and Z and that's going to allow us
to eliminate one of the variables so

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.120
to eliminate one of the variables so
 

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.390
to eliminate one of the variables so
instead of a three dimensional problem

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400
instead of a three dimensional problem
 

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.540
instead of a three dimensional problem
we'll have a two dimensional problem

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:32.550
we'll have a two dimensional problem
 

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:42.080
we'll have a two dimensional problem
okay so X Y Z has to be this so suppose

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:42.090
okay so X Y Z has to be this so suppose
 

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:46.830
okay so X Y Z has to be this so suppose
that we just call the constant V this

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840
that we just call the constant V this
 

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.720
that we just call the constant V this
number so that's going to just reduce

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:48.730
number so that's going to just reduce
 

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:55.050
number so that's going to just reduce
the ugliness of the algebra we can

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.060
the ugliness of the algebra we can
 

00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:00.090
the ugliness of the algebra we can
express Z in terms of x and y and v okay

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:00.100
express Z in terms of x and y and v okay
 

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:06.170
express Z in terms of x and y and v okay
so that's just dividing v by x times y

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:06.180
so that's just dividing v by x times y
 

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.170
so that's just dividing v by x times y
okay and then we can substitute for z in

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:10.180
okay and then we can substitute for z in
 

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.170
okay and then we can substitute for z in
the original heat loss equation so it's

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:13.180
the original heat loss equation so it's
 

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.580
the original heat loss equation so it's
going to be 11 x y plus 14y substituting

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:17.590
going to be 11 x y plus 14y substituting
 

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.300
going to be 11 x y plus 14y substituting
for z here plus 15x substituting for z

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:21.310
for z here plus 15x substituting for z
 

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:30.710
for z here plus 15x substituting for z
here and i get this equation right okay

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720
 

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.350
okay so to minimize this function we're

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.360
okay so to minimize this function we're
 

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.750
okay so to minimize this function we're
going to compute partial derivatives

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760
going to compute partial derivatives
 

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.410
going to compute partial derivatives
with respect to x and y equate them to 0

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:40.420
with respect to x and y equate them to 0
 

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:47.280
with respect to x and y equate them to 0
and find the values of X&amp;Y which satisfy

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:47.290
and find the values of X&amp;Y which satisfy
 

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:52.430
and find the values of X&amp;Y which satisfy
those two equations okay so this is my

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440
those two equations okay so this is my
 

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.460
those two equations okay so this is my
heat loss function as a function of x y

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:56.470
heat loss function as a function of x y
 

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:01.470
heat loss function as a function of x y
and v but v is just a constant so there

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.480
and v but v is just a constant so there
 

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.850
and v but v is just a constant so there
are no partial derivatives for that okay

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:05.860
are no partial derivatives for that okay
 

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.070
are no partial derivatives for that okay
so you you know how to take this partial

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080
so you you know how to take this partial
 

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.700
so you you know how to take this partial
derivative with respect to X that's just

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:11.710
derivative with respect to X that's just
 

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:17.400
derivative with respect to X that's just
11 y and here with respect to X is 14 v

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:17.410
11 y and here with respect to X is 14 v
 

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.299
11 y and here with respect to X is 14 v
over x squared

00:21:20.299 --> 00:21:20.309
 

00:21:20.309 --> 00:21:25.969
okay everybody know how to do that right

00:21:25.969 --> 00:21:25.979
 

00:21:25.979 --> 00:21:30.749
and then do the same thing with respect

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:30.759
and then do the same thing with respect
 

00:21:30.759 --> 00:21:35.070
and then do the same thing with respect
to Y that's going to be 11 x there's no

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080
to Y that's going to be 11 x there's no
 

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.869
to Y that's going to be 11 x there's no
y in that term so that's 0 and here

00:21:39.869 --> 00:21:39.879
y in that term so that's 0 and here
 

00:21:39.879 --> 00:21:41.820
y in that term so that's 0 and here
there's a why so it's 15 V over Y

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:41.830
there's a why so it's 15 V over Y
 

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:53.039
there's a why so it's 15 V over Y
squared okay by the way this is a notice

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:53.049
squared okay by the way this is a notice
 

00:21:53.049 --> 00:21:56.869
squared okay by the way this is a notice
this minus sign here okay everybody

00:21:56.869 --> 00:21:56.879
this minus sign here okay everybody
 

00:21:56.879 --> 00:21:59.899
this minus sign here okay everybody
understand why there's a minus sign here

00:21:59.899 --> 00:21:59.909
understand why there's a minus sign here
 

00:21:59.909 --> 00:22:03.239
understand why there's a minus sign here
tell me if you do not understand yes

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:03.249
tell me if you do not understand yes
 

00:22:03.249 --> 00:22:10.159
tell me if you do not understand yes
okay so so that's that right so we had

00:22:10.159 --> 00:22:10.169
okay so so that's that right so we had
 

00:22:10.169 --> 00:22:19.759
okay so so that's that right so we had
14 v / x is really 14 v x to the minus 1

00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:19.769
14 v / x is really 14 v x to the minus 1
 

00:22:19.769 --> 00:22:24.019
14 v / x is really 14 v x to the minus 1
okay so when i take this derivative i

00:22:24.019 --> 00:22:24.029
okay so when i take this derivative i
 

00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:27.299
okay so when i take this derivative i
take the power and put it in front make

00:22:27.299 --> 00:22:27.309
take the power and put it in front make
 

00:22:27.309 --> 00:22:30.599
take the power and put it in front make
it a coefficient and reduce the exponent

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:30.609
it a coefficient and reduce the exponent
 

00:22:30.609 --> 00:22:42.090
it a coefficient and reduce the exponent
by one so i'll get minus 1 x 14 v x

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:42.100
 

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:52.870
minus 14 v over x squared okay so we

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880
minus 14 v over x squared okay so we
 

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.170
minus 14 v over x squared okay so we
worked out the partial derivatives we

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:56.180
worked out the partial derivatives we
 

00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:01.600
worked out the partial derivatives we
set them equal to 0 now we've got two

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:01.610
set them equal to 0 now we've got two
 

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:06.490
set them equal to 0 now we've got two
equations in terms of x y and v we know

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:06.500
equations in terms of x y and v we know
 

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.430
equations in terms of x y and v we know
what v is that's just a constant so we

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440
what v is that's just a constant so we
 

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.560
what v is that's just a constant so we
can solve you know we have these two

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:14.570
can solve you know we have these two
 

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:19.570
can solve you know we have these two
equations why is expressed in terms of V

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:19.580
equations why is expressed in terms of V
 

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.210
equations why is expressed in terms of V
and X so you could just substitute for Y

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:22.220
and X so you could just substitute for Y
 

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:27.160
and X so you could just substitute for Y
in here and if you do that and a bit of

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:27.170
in here and if you do that and a bit of
 

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:32.590
in here and if you do that and a bit of
algebra you get X or X cubed in terms of

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600
algebra you get X or X cubed in terms of
 

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:39.970
algebra you get X or X cubed in terms of
V which we know what that is and V this

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:39.980
V which we know what that is and V this
 

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:44.410
V which we know what that is and V this
number was chosen so that X turns out to

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:44.420
number was chosen so that X turns out to
 

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:50.410
number was chosen so that X turns out to
be an integer okay so you you know that

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:50.420
be an integer okay so you you know that
 

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.420
be an integer okay so you you know that
X would be 56 and then once you know

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:52.430
X would be 56 and then once you know
 

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.230
X would be 56 and then once you know
what X is you can work out y and z okay

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240
what X is you can work out y and z okay
 

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.850
what X is you can work out y and z okay
so the building which minimises heat

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:57.860
so the building which minimises heat
 

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:03.820
so the building which minimises heat
loss and has volume equal to that has to

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:03.830
loss and has volume equal to that has to
 

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:07.840
loss and has volume equal to that has to
be 56 feet by 60 feet by 44 feet okay so

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:07.850
be 56 feet by 60 feet by 44 feet okay so
 

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.460
be 56 feet by 60 feet by 44 feet okay so
given so that shape is of course a

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:11.470
given so that shape is of course a
 

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:16.840
given so that shape is of course a
function of the particular geography of

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:16.850
function of the particular geography of
 

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:20.790
function of the particular geography of
that building right and so would change

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:20.800
that building right and so would change
 

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.310
that building right and so would change
for a different geography let's talk

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320
for a different geography let's talk
 

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.410
for a different geography let's talk
briefly about that second order

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:26.420
briefly about that second order
 

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.860
briefly about that second order
condition because we are dealing with

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:31.870
condition because we are dealing with
 

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:37.260
condition because we are dealing with
now a three-dimensional surface here is

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:37.270
now a three-dimensional surface here is
 

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:40.840
now a three-dimensional surface here is
what we call a saddle point this is a

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:40.850
what we call a saddle point this is a
 

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:45.670
what we call a saddle point this is a
place where a long one section if I

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:45.680
place where a long one section if I
 

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.120
place where a long one section if I
would cut a section this way the

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:49.130
would cut a section this way the
 

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.450
would cut a section this way the
function the cross-sectional function

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:52.460
function the cross-sectional function
 

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.930
function the cross-sectional function
would look concave

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:54.940
would look concave
 

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.390
would look concave
and if I were to cut a section this way

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:57.400
and if I were to cut a section this way
 

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.670
and if I were to cut a section this way
the cross sectional function would look

00:24:59.670 --> 00:24:59.680
the cross sectional function would look
 

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:08.640
the cross sectional function would look
convex so at this red point here my

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:08.650
convex so at this red point here my
 

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.950
convex so at this red point here my
partial derivative with respect to this

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960
partial derivative with respect to this
 

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.450
partial derivative with respect to this
axis would be zero and the partial

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:15.460
axis would be zero and the partial
 

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.950
axis would be zero and the partial
derivative with respect to this axis

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960
derivative with respect to this axis
 

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.750
derivative with respect to this axis
would be 0 2 but I'm neither at a

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760
would be 0 2 but I'm neither at a
 

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.920
would be 0 2 but I'm neither at a
maximum or minimum of that function if I

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:25.930
maximum or minimum of that function if I
 

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.480
maximum or minimum of that function if I
go a little bit this way I could go

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:27.490
go a little bit this way I could go
 

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.550
go a little bit this way I could go
higher if I go a little bit this way I

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:29.560
higher if I go a little bit this way I
 

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.180
higher if I go a little bit this way I
could go lower okay so I am at a

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:33.190
could go lower okay so I am at a
 

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.270
could go lower okay so I am at a
critical point of the function it's a

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:36.280
critical point of the function it's a
 

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:41.700
critical point of the function it's a
saddle point ok so to avoid these kinds

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:41.710
saddle point ok so to avoid these kinds
 

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:46.260
saddle point ok so to avoid these kinds
of avoid finding points like this when

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:46.270
of avoid finding points like this when
 

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.720
of avoid finding points like this when
we simply set the partials equal to zero

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:48.730
we simply set the partials equal to zero
 

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.090
we simply set the partials equal to zero
you need to look at the second-order

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:51.100
you need to look at the second-order
 

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.630
you need to look at the second-order
conditions and most problems that i

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640
conditions and most problems that i
 

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.420
conditions and most problems that i
would give you would would not involve

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:57.430
would give you would would not involve
 

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.190
would give you would would not involve
that but i do want you to understand

00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200
that but i do want you to understand
 

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.680
that but i do want you to understand
that conceptually and I've given you

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:01.690
that conceptually and I've given you
 

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.750
that conceptually and I've given you
what how to work out the second-order

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760
what how to work out the second-order
 

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.580
what how to work out the second-order
conditions here okay so you could yes

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:08.590
conditions here okay so you could yes
 

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.370
conditions here okay so you could yes
well I'll tell ya I'll tell you in a

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:11.380
well I'll tell ya I'll tell you in a
 

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.310
well I'll tell ya I'll tell you in a
second what the word what it has to

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320
second what the word what it has to
 

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.620
second what the word what it has to
satisfy right so if you and this is just

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:16.630
satisfy right so if you and this is just
 

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.450
satisfy right so if you and this is just
for two variables there are analogs for

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:18.460
for two variables there are analogs for
 

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.240
for two variables there are analogs for
larger with larger numbers of variables

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:21.250
larger with larger numbers of variables
 

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:24.780
larger with larger numbers of variables
so for a function of two variables f as

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:24.790
so for a function of two variables f as
 

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:30.360
so for a function of two variables f as
a function of x and y if the partials

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:30.370
a function of x and y if the partials
 

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.630
a function of x and y if the partials
are equal to zero at the point X star Y

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:33.640
are equal to zero at the point X star Y
 

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:40.260
are equal to zero at the point X star Y
star you can define this quantity this

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:40.270
star you can define this quantity this
 

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:48.600
star you can define this quantity this
is the this is a function of the Cross

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:48.610
is the this is a function of the Cross
 

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.300
is the this is a function of the Cross
partials this is the second derivative

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:51.310
partials this is the second derivative
 

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:55.170
partials this is the second derivative
with respect to x times the second

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:55.180
with respect to x times the second
 

00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:00.420
with respect to x times the second
derivative with respect to Y minus the

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:00.430
derivative with respect to Y minus the
 

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:03.630
derivative with respect to Y minus the
cross partial so this is you take a

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640
cross partial so this is you take a
 

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.190
cross partial so this is you take a
derivative of the function with respect

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200
derivative of the function with respect
 

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.680
derivative of the function with respect
to X

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:06.690
to X
 

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.180
to X
and then you take a derivative of that

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:10.190
and then you take a derivative of that
 

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:15.080
and then you take a derivative of that
derivative with respect to Y so it's

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:15.090
derivative with respect to Y so it's
 

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:19.900
derivative with respect to Y so it's
called the second-order cross partial

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:19.910
called the second-order cross partial
 

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:28.310
called the second-order cross partial
yeah you take so let's say that you you

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320
yeah you take so let's say that you you
 

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.830
yeah you take so let's say that you you
have a function of x and y you take a

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840
have a function of x and y you take a
 

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:41.390
have a function of x and y you take a
derivative with respect to X ok let's

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.400
derivative with respect to X ok let's
 

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.230
derivative with respect to X ok let's
just call that gee that's also a

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240
just call that gee that's also a
 

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:52.940
just call that gee that's also a
function of x and y and then you take a

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:52.950
function of x and y and then you take a
 

00:27:52.950 --> 00:28:04.150
function of x and y and then you take a
derivative of G with respect to Y ok

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:04.160
derivative of G with respect to Y ok
 

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.790
derivative of G with respect to Y ok
that's what I've call what I put up

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:07.800
that's what I've call what I put up
 

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:16.890
that's what I've call what I put up
there as

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:16.900
 

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:21.390
okay if you think of a hill and you're

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:21.400
okay if you think of a hill and you're
 

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.020
okay if you think of a hill and you're
trying to work out how high you would go

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.030
trying to work out how high you would go
 

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.830
trying to work out how high you would go
if you move in a certain direction

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840
if you move in a certain direction
 

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.780
if you move in a certain direction
doesn't matter whether you go east and

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:30.790
doesn't matter whether you go east and
 

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:34.670
doesn't matter whether you go east and
then north or west north and then east

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:34.680
then north or west north and then east
 

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.680
then north or west north and then east
okay
