00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.870
Sharks have existed in one form or another
for millions of years.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.060
Just when you thought it was safe to go back
in the water, it was never safe.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.940
It has never been safe!

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.090
Hey there street sharks, HOST here for DNews.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.440
Sharks are truly ancient.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.810
There’s some disagreement on when they actually
appeared on the scene, but any way you slice

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.359
it, they were here almost 200 million years
before the first dinosaurs.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.730
It’s pretty impressive we can trace their
ancestry back that far, when you consider

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.420
that sharks have skeletons made of cartilage,
not bone, which inherently doesn’t fossilize

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.440
as often because it’s easier to break down.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.960
In fact the earliest evidence of sharks is
from just a handful of scales found in Colorado

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.399
that date back 455 million years.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.170
These scales have a characteristic tooth-like
structure to them that makes us reasonably

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.030
certain they were once stuck on something
we would classify as a shark.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.460
The earliest undisputed shark scales are 420
million years old and were found in Siberia.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.140
But aside from their scales, we have no idea
what early sharks looked like.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.499
When you hear “shark” your first thought
is probably of a torpedo shaped superpredator

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:13.470
with rows of teeth like steak knives, but
millions of years ago their shape could have

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.140
been something we wouldn’t recognize.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.619
It’s the definition of what makes a shark
a shark that allows for a lot of flexibility.

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.009
Sharks must have replaceable teeth, internal
fertilization, paired fins, the aforementioned

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.490
cartilaginous skeletons and distinct scales,
and of course, Jaws.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.451
So when the fossil record starts becoming
richer around the devonian period 400 million

00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:38.759
years ago, sharks of all shapes and sizes
start popping up.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.320
We’ve found shark teeth that are two pronged
like the “rock on” symbol, suggesting

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.149
that they had to eat their prey whole instead
of ripping chunks out of them like they do

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.149
today.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.939
Early shark bodies may have been more eel-shaped,
with long tapering tails.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.279
Even when they began looking more familiar,
they were still quite different.

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:01.630
They tended to have long jaws that were at
the front of their heads, and they couldn’t

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.649
extend them to catch prey like modern sharks.

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.689
There were actually two major adaptive radiations
where shark diversity exploded.

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:12.739
The first was during the carboniferous period
starting 360 million years ago.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.200
Mass die offs of competitors meant sharks
could thrive, and in particular one group,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.620
the stethacanthids, really pushed the envelope
of style.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.310
One stethacanthus species had an anvil on
its back, and nobody's quite sure what advantage

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.310
that gave it.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.909
Maybe it was waiting for the hammerhead to
evolve so they could fashion swords together

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.610
and create an unstoppable shark army.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.290
Another shark, the Helicoprion (hell-icko-pryon),
appears to have had a buzz saw shaped lower

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.290
jaw.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.320
But of course, we don’t see these guys around
today.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.560
At the end of the Permian 250 million years
ago, 99% of marine species died out, including

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.319
most sharks.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.400
Some sharks made it through to the other side
though, possibly by sticking to deeper seas

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.329
where the water was less acidic.

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.780
These sharks were minescule, only an inch
long.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.030
But they would be the start of something big.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.440
By the jurassic period 42 million years later,
they would cause the second adaptive radiation

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.730
of sharks, leading to modern sharks as we
know them today.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.519
Sharks have survived through 5 mass extinctions
because they’ve taken on so many different

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.829
forms and filled so many niches.

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.060
But today their populations are dwindling.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.499
The rate we catch sharks, either intentionally
or as bycatch, is devastating for species

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:28.370
with a low reproductive rate.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.099
And sometimes we intentionally slaughter sharks
in the name of protecting swimmers near coast

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.099
lines.

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.190
In the last 450 million years, sharks have
seen a lot, but never anything like us, and

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.610
many species may not last much longer.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.750
If you want to learn more about what sharks
have become tune into Shark Week which kicks

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.489
off Sunday, June 26th 8/7c

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.620
Want to know what you can do to stave off
shark extinction?

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:08.310
Tara has a video on that here.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:18.010
Would you rather swim with one 10 foot long
shark, or 1200 1 inch long sharks?
