00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.202
- Meetings.

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.370
They're the bane of
every office employee

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.372 align:start size:84% position:16%
and something you have
to go to regularly

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:07.573
if you want to keep your job.

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:09.676
But that's where your
responsibility ends.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:10.877
You just have to go.

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:12.444 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
You don't have to
do much beyond that.

00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:14.280 line:0%
I've developed a few simple ways

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.082 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
to appear engaged in a
meeting, when in actuality,

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:19.418
you're calculating what year
you're gonna die in your head.

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:21.120
First technique, fish face.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.055
You know how fish sleep
with their eyes open?

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.591
That's basically what
you're doing here.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.025
Pick a point at the
front of the room

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.760
while making your
mind a total blank,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.929 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it's almost
like you're asleep,

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.398 align:start size:84% position:16%
except you can
still see everyone,

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:35.267
but my mindfulness app
says it counts as rest.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.535
I know what you're thinking.

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:37.870 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
What if you're asked
for your input?

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.539 line:0%
Go with something
basic and vague.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.074 line:0%
I like something like,

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.243
"Wow, I've honestly never
thought about it that way,"

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:46.779
or "It sounds like we're at
a natural stopping point,"

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:50.550 align:start position:0%
or the always risky, "That last
part actually concerns me."

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.484
Generally, everyone wants
the meeting to be over

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:54.553
as soon as possible,
so no one will ask you

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.089
to expand on what you meant.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.090
But if someone does, you
can always fire back with,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.459
"I think we should try
and get back on track."

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:02.595 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Lastly, if you're a
doodler, always doodle

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:05.431 line:0%
after the person speaking
has made a natural pause.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.466 align:start size:88% position:13%
That way, while it will
appear like you are

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.769 align:start size:84% position:16%
diligently taking
notes, you're actually

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:12.171 align:start size:94% position:6%
practicing your signature,
your signature after

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.407
you marry Alexander
Skarsgard, I mean.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.608
An old classic.
