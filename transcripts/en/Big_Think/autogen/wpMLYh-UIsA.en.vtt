00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700
 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.669
behavioural economists are interested in

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679
behavioural economists are interested in
 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.350
behavioural economists are interested in
the same topics that economists are

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360
the same topics that economists are
 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.750
the same topics that economists are
interested in why people buy how we make

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760
interested in why people buy how we make
 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.550
interested in why people buy how we make
decisions what are the right mechanisms

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560
decisions what are the right mechanisms
 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.890
decisions what are the right mechanisms
in the market and so on but the starting

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900
in the market and so on but the starting
 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.080
in the market and so on but the starting
point is different rather than assuming

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090
point is different rather than assuming
 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.999
point is different rather than assuming
people are rational and then take the

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009
people are rational and then take the
 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.370
people are rational and then take the
implications of that we have no prior

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380
implications of that we have no prior
 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.659
implications of that we have no prior
beliefs we said let's just see how

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669
beliefs we said let's just see how
 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.040
beliefs we said let's just see how
people behave let's put them in a

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050
people behave let's put them in a
 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.260
people behave let's put them in a
situation in the lab in the field let's

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270
situation in the lab in the field let's
 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.850
situation in the lab in the field let's
see how they behave and then as a

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860
see how they behave and then as a
 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.160
see how they behave and then as a
consequence let's make the implication

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170
consequence let's make the implication
 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.290
consequence let's make the implication
and because in those situations people

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300
and because in those situations people
 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.720
and because in those situations people
often don't behave rationally the

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730
often don't behave rationally the
 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.400
often don't behave rationally the
implications are often very different

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410
implications are often very different
 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.720
implications are often very different
from the implications from standard

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730
from the implications from standard
 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.979
from the implications from standard
economics

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989
 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.319
so they're many many examples of course

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329
so they're many many examples of course
 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.150
so they're many many examples of course
for irrationality there's one way to be

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160
for irrationality there's one way to be
 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.220
for irrationality there's one way to be
rational and many ways to be irrational

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230
rational and many ways to be irrational
 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.069
rational and many ways to be irrational
we exhibit lots of those a good way to

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079
we exhibit lots of those a good way to
 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.360
we exhibit lots of those a good way to
think about it is to think about

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370
think about it is to think about
 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.990
think about it is to think about
emotions so think about it imagine that

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000
emotions so think about it imagine that

you were in the jungle 20,000 years ago
 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.550
you were in the jungle 20,000 years ago
and you saw a tiger what do you want you

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560
and you saw a tiger what do you want you
 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.469
and you saw a tiger what do you want you
want a a human being in that situation

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479

what should I do
 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.399

a situation in which this person runs as

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490
a situation in which this person runs as
 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.520
a situation in which this person runs as
fast as they can the moment they see the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530
fast as they can the moment they see the
 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.830
fast as they can the moment they see the
tiger and that's basically how emotions

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840
tiger and that's basically how emotions

tiger and that's basically how emotions
work when we see something that puts us

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750
work when we see something that puts us
 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.450
work when we see something that puts us
in danger or have to do something with

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460
in danger or have to do something with
 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.300
in danger or have to do something with
the sexual behavior we turn our

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310
the sexual behavior we turn our
 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.060
the sexual behavior we turn our
cognition off it's not that we think and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070
cognition off it's not that we think and
 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.930
cognition off it's not that we think and
we feel we just feel emotion take over

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940
we feel we just feel emotion take over
 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.450
we feel we just feel emotion take over
and then they just execute a command say

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460
and then they just execute a command say
 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.550
and then they just execute a command say
run as fast as you can don't think don't

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560
run as fast as you can don't think don't
 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.950
run as fast as you can don't think don't
calculate don't don't do anything now

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960
calculate don't don't do anything now
 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.690
calculate don't don't do anything now
emotions still work in the same way

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700
emotions still work in the same way
 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.040
emotions still work in the same way
these days even though we don't have

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050
these days even though we don't have
 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.200
these days even though we don't have
Tigers but now the revoke by other

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210
Tigers but now the revoke by other
 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.770
Tigers but now the revoke by other
things

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780
things
 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.200
things
somebody cut in front of us in the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210
somebody cut in front of us in the
 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.399
somebody cut in front of us in the
highway we have some anger towards

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409
highway we have some anger towards
 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.719
highway we have some anger towards
somebody somebody in customer service

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729
somebody somebody in customer service
 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.819
somebody somebody in customer service
upsets us all kinds of other things

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829
upsets us all kinds of other things
 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.859
upsets us all kinds of other things
happen emotion just work in the same way

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869
happen emotion just work in the same way
 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.020
happen emotion just work in the same way
even though nowadays they're not as

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030
even though nowadays they're not as
 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.199
even though nowadays they're not as
relevant to those situation

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209
 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.759
there is hope and I think the hope

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769
there is hope and I think the hope
 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.369
there is hope and I think the hope
basically has kind of multiple legs to

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379
basically has kind of multiple legs to
 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.500
basically has kind of multiple legs to
it the first thing is that I'm hoping

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510
it the first thing is that I'm hoping
 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.899
it the first thing is that I'm hoping
that when people see a mistake that they

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909
that when people see a mistake that they
 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.030
that when people see a mistake that they
know about it they might be able to fix

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040
know about it they might be able to fix
 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.550
know about it they might be able to fix
it so for example it turns out that free

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560
it so for example it turns out that free
 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.589
it so for example it turns out that free
is a very big allure when we see

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599
is a very big allure when we see
 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.479
is a very big allure when we see
something that is free we often go for

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489
something that is free we often go for
 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.729
something that is free we often go for
it even if it's not good for us but it

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739
it even if it's not good for us but it
 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.890
it even if it's not good for us but it
turns out it if it wasn't free if it was

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900
turns out it if it wasn't free if it was
 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.020
turns out it if it wasn't free if it was
costing us a penny or 10 cents or a

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030
costing us a penny or 10 cents or a
 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.300
costing us a penny or 10 cents or a
dollar we will not have the same allure

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310
dollar we will not have the same allure
 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.309
dollar we will not have the same allure
to it so one of the suggestions I have

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319
to it so one of the suggestions I have
 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.080
to it so one of the suggestions I have
to people is when something is free ask

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090
to people is when something is free ask
 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.330
to people is when something is free ask
yourself would I still do the same thing

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340
yourself would I still do the same thing
 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.420
yourself would I still do the same thing
even if it was costing me a penny or 10

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430
even if it was costing me a penny or 10
 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.580
even if it was costing me a penny or 10
a 10 cents and there's a range of those

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590
a 10 cents and there's a range of those
 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.110
a 10 cents and there's a range of those
things there's a range of things in

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120
things there's a range of things in
 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.940
things there's a range of things in
which we can read a paper or a book or

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950
which we can read a paper or a book or
 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.039
which we can read a paper or a book or
kind of have an idea but what are some

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049
kind of have an idea but what are some
 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.899
kind of have an idea but what are some
irrational behaviors that other people

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909
irrational behaviors that other people
 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.640
irrational behaviors that other people
are exhibiting and of course it's always

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650
are exhibiting and of course it's always
 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.440
are exhibiting and of course it's always
easy for us to see what other people are

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450
easy for us to see what other people are
 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.110
easy for us to see what other people are
exhibiting irrationalities and then use

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120
exhibiting irrationalities and then use
 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.240
exhibiting irrationalities and then use
it as a mirror and say oh I can see this

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250
it as a mirror and say oh I can see this
 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.819
it as a mirror and say oh I can see this
behavior I see that when I date I juggle

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829
behavior I see that when I date I juggle
 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.920
behavior I see that when I date I juggle
too many options I see that when I shop

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930
too many options I see that when I shop
 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.479
too many options I see that when I shop
I make this mistake I see when I make

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489
I make this mistake I see when I make
 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.429
I make this mistake I see when I make
these mistakes and let me think about

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:15.439
these mistakes and let me think about
 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.280
these mistakes and let me think about
how to prevent it so that's the first

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290
how to prevent it so that's the first
 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.250
how to prevent it so that's the first
hope the second hope is for things that

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260
hope the second hope is for things that
 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.470
hope the second hope is for things that
we would do that would prevent us from

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480
we would do that would prevent us from
 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.949
we would do that would prevent us from
getting into this mistake so for example

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959
getting into this mistake so for example
 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.629
getting into this mistake so for example
have you ever gone to lunch when you are

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639
have you ever gone to lunch when you are
 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.789
have you ever gone to lunch when you are
vowing to be on a diet and then the
