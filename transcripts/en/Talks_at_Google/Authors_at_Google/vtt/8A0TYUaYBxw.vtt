00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.280
MICHAEL HEBB: Welcome
to Death over Dinner.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.940
You might be asking yourself,
what could death and dinner

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.100
possibly have in common?

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.710
Or maybe you're wondering
why someone would even

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.130
want to talk about death,
especially over an otherwise

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.270
pleasant supper.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.010
Well, here's the deal.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.840
The way we die in
America, and now

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.230
in many other parts of the
world, is pretty messed up--

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.270
not just the fact that we die.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.759
End-of-life care
is far from ideal.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.400
And it causes a lot
of bankruptcies.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.070
Most people die in hospitals,
and they're really expensive.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.470
Yet 75% of America says
they want to die at home.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.470
And only 25% of us do.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.640
Regardless of where we spend our
last weeks, days, or moments,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.590
the thing we are
really missing is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.530
a straight-forward conversation.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.600
It's obvious if
you think about it.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.220
If you don't tell
your loved ones

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.490
what you want during your
last mile, you won't get it.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.340
Say, for example, you
wanted a vacation in Aruba.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.950
But you didn't tell anyone.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.250
And your well-meaning
family booked you a long,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.190
costly ticket to Antarctica--

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.170
not what you wanted.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.090
The default when
it comes to dying

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.650
is also very expensive and,
like Antarctica, most likely

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.060
not what you wanted.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.190
Not telling your loved
ones what you want only

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.150
makes everything a lot harder
for everyone emotionally

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.620
and logistically.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.100
They're already going to be
devastated by losing you.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.020
On top of that,
imagine having to make

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.320
a seemingly endless
list of decisions

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.820
and to make them immediately
during your grief.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.070
So we came up with
a simple solution--

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.330
dinner and conversation,
just talking to each other

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.780
openly, directly, authentically.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.380
Since we launched, there have
been over 100,000 dinners

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.670
in 30 countries.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.530
It seems these two things
go together quite nicely.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.730
So what happens
at a death dinner?

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.590
It all begins with our website.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.440
You tell us why you're
interested in having a dinner.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.539
And when you select
an intention,

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.140
we magically create a
script for your evening.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.440
In this script, you will find a
series of thoughtful questions

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.980
for everyone who comes to
dinner to consider an answer.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.520
If you don't like a particular
question, don't answer it.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.670
And that's about it.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.980
But here are a few pointers.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.450
Don't surprise people.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.040
Pizza night-- surprise!

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.330
Death dinner.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.860
No.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.680
Don't hog the talking stick.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.824
Put that phone away.

00:02:35.824 --> 00:02:37.740
No one needs you to be
checking your Instagram

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.410
while they are talking about
how they want to be remembered.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.210
Make something simple.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.560
Light some candles.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.660
Create the right ambiance.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.510
Give yourself plenty of time.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.220
Make I statements.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.620
This is not an
opportunity to argue.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.050
There are no experts in death.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.000
Listen deeply.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.297
Say something you're
afraid to say.

00:03:00.297 --> 00:03:02.380
It is the quickest way to
get closer to the people

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.910
in your life.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.850
When you're done, maybe you
want to take some next steps

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.280
and put a few things in writing.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.810
Our goal is to change the way we
die one conversation at a time.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.356
Join us.

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:15.730
DAVID LEVIN: Well,
please join me

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.646
in giving Michael Hebb
a warm welcome as he

00:03:17.646 --> 00:03:20.020
talks about his book "Let's
Talk about Death over Dinner"

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.050
MICHAEL HEBB: Hey, everybody.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.465
Thanks for coming out.

00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:32.840
DAVID LEVIN: So I'd like to
talk about just breaking down

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.423
the title of the book because I
think you put a bit of thought

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:36.360
into it.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.940
First of all, why dinner?

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.310
MICHAEL HEBB: Why dinner?

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.480
Well, that's going to--

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.680
do you mind if I do a
little tangential answer?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.690
So my background is
actually as a designer.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.070
And I studied architecture.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.490
And I started by--

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.690
my interest in
architecture wasn't so much

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.450
because I was
fascinated by buildings

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.810
and the formal
architecture and wanted

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.110
to create something
of great beauty.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.820
But I was really inspired by
how to craft, how to design,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.310
how to shape human experience.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.180
And at the time when I went
to school 20 years ago,

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.209
UX wasn't a thing
that we talked about.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.140
If you were interested in
creating human experience,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.790
architecture was one of the
more obvious places to go.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.110
And so I became really
interested in how

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.350
you create buildings, gathering
places that would really

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.530
have a transformative
effect on the people who

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.790
came into these buildings.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.840
And so I spent a
bit of time creating

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.670
some guerrilla
architecture, which

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.940
we can go into if we want.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.320
My first project-- actually,
an architecture firm that we

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.190
created--

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.280
a lot of the work
we did was illegal.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.980
And we started a project called
City Repair because we decided

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.800
we wanted to repair the city--
it was Portland, Oregon--

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.150
in the way that we saw fit,
not necessarily the way

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.620
that the city saw that
it needed to be repaired.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.950
And so we started doing things.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.620
And again, we're going to
maybe just put a pin in this

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.940
and come back to it if
there's interest around it.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.540
But we started intervening
in the city in the ways

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.470
the city got really
pissed off at.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.320
And we were breaking the law.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.050
And through that, though--

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.390
and a lot of these
early interventions

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.075
were about creating spaces for
people to gather and connect.

00:05:42.616 --> 00:05:44.550
That was our focus of the UX.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.280
How do we get people
to create space

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.060
where they have an authentic
connection, gathering,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.410
and experience?

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.230
And so eventually, after
several years of iterating,

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.500
I realized that
architecture is very--

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.400
it's a very costly, inefficient
way to create experience.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.760
Obviously, code has become a
much cheaper, more accessible

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.940
way to create experience.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.500
It resides on very expensive--

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.530
less and less so--

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.190
devices.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.330
But nonetheless, it seemed
very unwieldy to have

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.170
to go and raise money or
have a client that you happen

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.000
to either be aligned
with or not aligned

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.260
with who wants to create a thing
so that somebody could have

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.170
an experience in the physical
space that would impact them

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.170
emotionally, spiritually.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.040
And then I realized
that the dinner table

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.550
is readily available and
readily underutilized.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.050
Most people don't
know why they have

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.790
a dinner table in their house.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:56.160
It's one of those almost
leftover functionalities.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.000
What is this?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Is this for mail?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.850
Is it for my kids
to do homework on?

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.550
Because 20% of
meals in the United

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.900
States are eaten in the car.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.380
And now you add to
that, how many meals

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.850
are eaten at the desk?

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.670
How many meals are eaten
on a couch in front of TV?

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.380
Or more likely,
the larger number

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.110
now is in bed with Netflix.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.540
And so you start
to see that here

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:26.370
is this thing, this
object, that most of us

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.810
have in some
iteration or another.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.290
And it's not getting used.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.840
And it happens to be in many
ways the first architecture.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:41.190
So if we go way back,
shelter was almost a given.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.150
We found ways to stay
safe and have shelter.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.490
The fact that at
some point we decided

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:54.330
to create a space to share
food and to share culture

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.170
and built this thing, whether
it was low to the ground

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.450
or at the height that
we tend to use now,

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:06.820
is a pretty remarkable jump
in the human experience.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.410
It also corresponds, to
some extent, with the fact

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.070
that cooking is what,
in fact, made us human.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:19.230
So Darwin got a lot of things
right as far as we know so far.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:24.120
He apparently didn't get
the leap from the ape

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.360
to man, the missing link, right.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.850
Richard Wrangham is one
of the lead biologists

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.860
and evolutionary
biologists at Harvard.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.500
And he's kind of disproved
Darwin's missing link

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.179
argument, which
was that we started

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:45.180
to eat very large mammals.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.930
And so we started hunting for
larger and larger mammals.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.570
We had a wealth of protein.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.370
And all of sudden, we made this
transformation from ape to man.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.240
So Wrangham has gone back
through and proven to--

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.980
as far as we know for
now, it's actually

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.050
the concentration of calories,
which happens when you cook.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:15.590
So apes have big bellies, really
big jaws, and small brains.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.770
And they chew seven hours a day.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.610
We chew 24 minutes
a day on average.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:28.160
And that's because we outsourced
all of this huge belly.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.610
Because if you're eating roots
and hard-to-digest things--

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.260
a cow has four bellies, right?

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.660
So apes have these big bellies.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.460
And then all of a sudden, the
innovation of cooking over fire

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.370
to concentrate calories and
make calories more readily

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.020
digestible--

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.950
a few things happen.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.600
The belly gets smaller.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.070
There's a bunch of new energy,
a new energy source that's

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.510
available in the body.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.815
Where is that going to go?

00:09:55.815 --> 00:09:58.190
And then the jaw, because
we're not chewing all the time,

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.300
thins.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.580
So you have a natural situation
where there's an opening.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.140
It's available for rent.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.210
Space shows up in our heads.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.730
And it gets filled with
much larger brains.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.540
And then you have the advent of
language and-- human language.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.824
I think that apes probably have
a very sophisticated language.

00:10:17.824 --> 00:10:20.240
And all of this happens around
the same time, most likely,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.450
that we're eating
together at tables.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:28.230
And so for me as a
designer, I was like, well,

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.800
I don't have to go
and build something.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.220
I can use what's already
there, again, like code.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.240
It's just sitting there.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.530
It's pretty much free.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.760
People have forgotten
how to use it.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.970
And so I can start
to use the table

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.680
in really imaginative ways.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.460
And so that's kind of
how the table side of it

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.947
came into place.

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:50.030
And I've been having dinners
for the last 25 years

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.855
around every topic imaginable.

00:10:52.855 --> 00:10:54.230
DAVID LEVIN: So
you had this idea

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.087
of having the dinner
around a table,

00:10:56.087 --> 00:10:58.420
bringing people together,
getting them out of their beds

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.336
from watching Netflix.

00:10:59.336 --> 00:11:01.655
And you decide a great way
to do this is bring them

00:11:01.655 --> 00:11:04.520
on the cheery topic of death.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.190
Why death?

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.070
MICHAEL HEBB: So
I didn't start off

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:15.260
with such a, quote unquote,
"morbid" centerpiece.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.500
At first I was just interested
in getting people back

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.970
to the table and
making it joyful.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.570
And I started a
project in Portland

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.690
called Family Supper with
my then-partner Naomi

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.760
Pomeroy, which at the
time was considered

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.790
the first pop-up
restaurant supper

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.760
club of this new
generation of supper clubs.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.790
And so we start inviting
people to our living room,

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.580
turned our living room
into a 21-foot table

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.700
that I could put
together quickly

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.400
and while still
wearing my daughter

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.110
in a Baby Bjorn,
which was really

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.450
a big part of the
design model of it.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.880
It was like, what
can we do and still

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.380
have August in the carrier?

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.320
And so the table had to be
very easy to put together,

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.850
made of hollow core doors.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.040
We invited people over.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.600
We didn't have any money,
so we couldn't buy chairs.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.750
So the first was,
dinner is free,

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.530
but you have to bring
a chair and leave it.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:15.230
And then we were
like, next one we're

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.230
going to have you bring
plates and leave it.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.890
But then the aesthetic
part of my brain

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.020
was like, I could deal
with mismatched chairs.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.080
But I couldn't deal
with mismatched china.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.280
and I was like, Ikea just
opened up in Portland.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.130
Hold on the plates.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:36.150
So the first dinners
were just joyful.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:41.300
And I got to see the incredible
connection that was happening.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.360
And Portland was
having a real moment.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.500
It's kind of the moment that
led to the now "Portlandia"

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.140
that we all know and some love.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.250
But The Decemberists
were just starting

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.280
and having their first shows
at some of these dinners and.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.690
Gus Van Sant would show up.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:01.910
And Miranda July
was at the table.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:06.060
You had this real
incredible collaboration

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.800
and coming together of
brilliant thinkers in Portland

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.320
at these dinners
we were throwing.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.670
And that felt good
for a little while.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.630
And then I got really
inspired by the work

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:22.070
of Gore Vidal, who was
one of the great thinkers

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.360
of the last 50 years.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.710
And he challenged me to
think about these dinners

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.370
as being a modern symposium,
in a sense going back

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:36.620
to the dinners that Socrates
and Plato and Aristotle

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.720
and many of the leaders in
the classical period in Athens

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.050
hosted, which on one hand
looked like dinner parties.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.210
On the other hand, they
gave us the justice system

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.530
and democracy.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.690
And a lot of the most
powerful ideas we have

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.270
came from these dinners
within the classical period.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:14:00.590
And so the idea was, what
can a dinner conversation do?

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.940
How deep can it go?

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.190
How much can it impact culture?

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.740
So I went from this
idea of just inviting

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.250
people back to the
table to seeing,

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.720
how much impact can we have?

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.200
And how far can you
take the conversations?

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.790
What terrain?

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:17.600
What's off limits?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.920
What's taboo?

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.940
What's really impactful?

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.530
And so I started having
really disruptive or difficult

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:25.460
conversations--

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.370
homelessness, wealth
equity, and bringing the 1%

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:36.890
together to talk
about wealth inequity.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:41.450
I did a dinner with
the president of Rwanda

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.700
and the former president
of Ireland, Mary Robinson,

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.430
to talk about ending
genocide at the same time

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.020
that Kagame, the
president of Rwanda,

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:53.750
was being labeled and
called out as a genocidier,

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.470
as an agent of
genocide, himself.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.330
And I decided that we were just
going to invite him to a dinner

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.960
to talk about what it would
look like ending genocide

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.010
in our lifetime.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.690
What if there was no more
genocide on this planet?

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.810
How would we get there?

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.120
Maybe he's an expert.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.130
From what side depends on--

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.480
but let's just ask him.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.270
And so he did that with
the Clinton Foundation.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:22.520
And it turned out that three
years after the dinner, Mary

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.200
Robinson and Kagame are working
together now all of the time.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.000
She's the chancellor
of the Great Lakes

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.560
region of Eastern Africa.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.700
And so a dinner conversation--

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.350
if it's potent enough
and it's brave enough--

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.762
can actually create a
deep enough relationship.

00:15:41.762 --> 00:15:43.220
The beginning of
their relationship

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.906
happened at that dinner.

00:15:45.906 --> 00:15:47.780
And I don't know all of
the in-between steps.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.100
But to see it many years later--

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:55.940
so I kind of got that an
individual dinner in itself

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.460
can change the shape of things.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.920
But I also learned
that the more difficult

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.930
the topic matter,
the more vulnerable

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:08.660
it pushed people into, the
more vulnerable the terrain,

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.420
the more they got to know
themselves at the table.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.950
People surprised themselves.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:13.670
I saw it happen.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:17.570
And it's really lovely to be
in the presence of someone

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.370
surprising themselves.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.740
It's one thing when
people are just repeating

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.080
that ongoing loop of things.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.420
You know when you're going
about to go on a date

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.034
or see a friend,
and you're like,

00:16:28.034 --> 00:16:29.450
I'm going to tell
them about this.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.590
And then I'm going to
tell them about this.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.750
And you're kind of rehearsing
what you're going to say.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.700
And then you say it.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.241
And it doesn't really
feel that good.

00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:38.300
You're like, no, I didn't
really have a real experience.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.420
I started to get interested
in dinners and topics

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.874
where people were
like, I just said that.

00:16:43.874 --> 00:16:45.040
I've never said that before.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.790
Or their spouse would
be like, I've never

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.170
heard-- we've been
together for 30 years,

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.830
and you've never
told me this thing.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.290
So that was the area--

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.900
I started to see that
the table is really

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.530
good at that space of
getting to know ourselves,

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:02.240
connecting people, and where
we surprise ourselves as well.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.839
And death ended up being the
strongest medicine-- this thing

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:10.050
that we avoid so much in our
culture for so many reasons,

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.260
some of them very silly.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.520
But the fact that we
have avoided this topic,

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.500
bringing it back to
people, and giving it

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.740
kind of like a gift,
not a challenge--

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.690
not something dark,
but it's a gift

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.194
to actually talk about this.

00:17:27.194 --> 00:17:29.360
Those were the most powerful
dinners I've ever done.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.660
And then I wanted to
create a digital platform

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.570
where everybody can have
that experience, not just

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.060
this rarefied group
of individuals.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.890
DAVID LEVIN: So you
talked about how

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.807
people have these moments
where they surprise themselves.

00:17:42.807 --> 00:17:44.390
Can you tell us a
little bit about how

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.820
that happens with
death or where they

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.059
talk about death over dinner?

00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:49.100
MICHAEL HEBB: Yeah, sure.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:55.700
So we used to get reminded
about death all the time.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.430
For one, people
would die younger.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.670
They would die
more unexpectedly.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.260
We would see dead bodies.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.300
We would see people dying.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.940
We hadn't overmedicalized death.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:17.430
Our rituals around death and
dying were more confronting.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.870
Now you almost never see a body.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:25.460
And it feels almost a
sterilized ritual around--

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.440
am I at a funeral?

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.540
I couldn't tell.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.700
So there's a lot
of things that have

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:38.980
taken this conversation of
death or this engagement

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:43.600
with our mortality
out of our purview.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.320
And religion likes to
use memento mori as well,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.470
have us coming to terms
with our mortality.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.000
And religion
doesn't play as much

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.200
of a role in people's
lives anymore.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.360
So for the whole
of our existence,

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.170
we've been in an
ongoing confrontation

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:03.670
with our mortality.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.210
And now we've medicalized
and sterilized and distanced

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.920
ourselves from this fact.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.550
In fact, a lot of people
are fascinated, especially

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:16.540
in the tech space, in this
idea of curing or defeating

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.692
death, which is fine.

00:19:18.692 --> 00:19:19.900
That's not a value statement.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.510
But it's just a
sign of the times

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.360
that we're not confronting it.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:32.050
And so there's such
tremendous opportunity

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.470
when you bring this
thing that we all share,

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.860
this thing that really
touches one of the most

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.210
beautiful places in us.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:42.910
Because when you
talk about the fact

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.880
that you're mortal, that
it eventually will end,

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.900
it's not that that needs
to be dark or scary.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.610
That also just will
very quickly put

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.100
into perspective what's
most valuable to you,

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.220
what your priorities are.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:55.720
OK.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.850
So it's going to end.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.670
What do I want to
do while I'm here?

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.980
Am I operating with
some hidden bias?

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:04.930
We all have biases.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.200
We all have hidden
biases, invisible biases.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.600
Most of us have
biases around the fact

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.020
that we're going to die.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:16.150
So am I operating
within a hidden bias

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:21.370
that doesn't have me deeply
appreciate the limited resource

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:26.260
that life is, how important
the relationships are?

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:32.740
It's kind of grossly animated by
a bucket list, which is great.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.810
But why not every day?

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:39.940
And so when you see
people together delving

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.700
into these canyons
that we've determined

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:47.910
are dark but, in fact,
are filled with vitality,

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:52.240
you see them see parts
of themselves they don't

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.710
get access to all the time.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.050
And that's why we
educate ourselves.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.080
We educate ourselves
because we get

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.840
in touch with parts of ourselves
that we didn't have access

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.590
to before we were educated
or we didn't have access

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.000
to experiences.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.300
So this kind of enrichment--

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.270
there's incredible
information about life

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.240
and yourself in the
terrain that is called

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.520
death and end of
life, whether you've

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:23.365
been given permission or a
good invitation or somebody

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:30.010
has led you through that in a
way that's exciting to you--

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.179
most likely not in our culture.

00:21:32.179 --> 00:21:34.220
DAVID LEVIN: We're going
to go on with questions.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.275
But if you have any questions,
just come to the microphone.

00:21:36.275 --> 00:21:38.650
As you all come up, I'll
start calling you all in

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.500
to join in the conversation.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.060
But real quickly,
I'll bounce off

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.350
a topic you just touched on.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.600
You were saying about how
the conversation about death

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.680
can lead to, in a way,
clarifying your life somewhat.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.172
What are some questions that
you had that relate to that?

00:21:53.172 --> 00:21:54.880
MICHAEL HEBB: Some
questions that I had--

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.080
DAVID LEVIN: Or some
questions that you have

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.679
that people could talk about.

00:21:57.679 --> 00:21:58.970
MICHAEL HEBB: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:03.810
So what happens
at a death dinner,

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.420
as people are very curious.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.470
They want to have
a preview of it

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.590
before they jump
in for that swim.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.140
And I think that the
book actually gives you

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.410
a pretty good experience without
having to be at a dinner.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:24.250
But one such question that is
more deep end of the pool is--

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.360
I ask people frequently
at these dinners,

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.780
let's imagine that you only
have 30 days left to live.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:37.090
What is your immediate emotion?

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.220
You can't change the prognosis.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.970
You can't change the fact that
you're going to die in 30 days.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:44.770
Are you angry?

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.570
Are you strangely peaceful?

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:47.410
Are you nervous?

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.660
Are you anxious?

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.339
And then how are you going
to spend the next 30 days?

00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:54.380
What are you going to do?

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.230
Are you the type of
person that's like,

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:00.250
I'm going to go to the
Seven Wonders of the World?

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:01.840
Or some people--

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.700
I'm going to do precisely what
I'm already doing every day.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.880
I wouldn't change a thing.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.755
Or, I'm going to write
letters to my children

00:23:08.755 --> 00:23:16.800
or my grandchildren or
whatever for posterity.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.810
Maybe you think that everybody
wants to have letters from you.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.530
And what are the
things that you value

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.514
when you think that you
have such a limited time?

00:23:27.514 --> 00:23:28.930
What does your
last day look like?

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.400
What does your last
hour look like?

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.120
Who's around you?

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.680
How are you feeling?

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.110
There's not a lot
of people asking you

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:40.330
this question in modern
life that we're living.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:45.220
And when you see someone
go through those emotions

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:51.790
and encounter and confront
this, quote unquote,

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:57.400
"grim reaper," you really
get down to the core of them.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.102
You can't really hide
from that question.

00:24:00.102 --> 00:24:02.560
And people will-- if they don't
want to answer, they don't.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.470
But I've actually never had a
situation where someone doesn't

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.575
want to freely walk
into that space

00:24:08.575 --> 00:24:09.700
and get to know themselves.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.950
So they may walk away.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:15.339
And they're like, I
need to have children.

00:24:15.339 --> 00:24:17.380
I didn't think that I was
going to have children.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.546
And I had this death dinner.

00:24:18.546 --> 00:24:20.380
And now I know I need
to have children.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.490
Or, I'd never thought that I
could take care of even a dog.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:26.740
But now I'm going to get a dog.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.010
One of the other questions is--

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.230
you're in a major earthquake.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.360
You know you're not
going to make it out.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.450
If you had one
phone call to make,

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.720
if you had this little window
and you had one phone call,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.160
is it an apology?

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.040
Is it a regret?

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.770
Is there something--
who would you

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:46.780
call if you had one call left?

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.900
And what would you say?

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.430
And why haven't you said it yet?

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.280
There's a lot.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.890
We could spend a couple
hours psychologically just

00:24:55.890 --> 00:25:00.330
unpacking that basic question.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:04.150
And your therapist probably
isn't going to ask you this.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.150
It would be a little bit
intense if you lay down

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.150
on your therapist's couch and
they start asking the questions

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:10.880
that I ask.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.620
You might not see
that therapist again.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.372
But we've created the
blameable third party.

00:25:17.372 --> 00:25:19.080
Imagine if your
therapist also wanted you

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.580
to play Cards Against humanity.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.960
You'd be like, uh-uh.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.560
You should have
your license pulled.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.010
So there's this thing where
if we create a death dinner

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:33.520
and it becomes this trend like
a board game, and it's fun,

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.599
and you can step into it,
and you can blame us--

00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:37.140
I don't know.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.120
The script's right here.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.750
Cards Against Humanity wants
me to say this thing aloud.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.280
I guess I will.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.560
So we become a
blameable third party

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.552
so that you can have
a deep experience

00:25:48.552 --> 00:25:50.260
and connect with the
people in your life.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.926
And there's a bunch
of practical reasons

00:25:51.926 --> 00:25:54.300
why you want to know these
things about yourself.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.310
You want to know them
about your loved ones.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.410
You want them to
know what you want.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.062
Because if they don't know
it, it's not going to happen.

00:26:01.062 --> 00:26:02.520
DAVID LEVIN: So we
have a question.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.770
MICHAEL HEBB: Yeah, of course.

00:26:07.004 --> 00:26:09.170
AUDIENCE: What do you think
caused under-utilization

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.650
of the dinner table over time?

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:11.904
MICHAEL HEBB: The what?

00:26:11.904 --> 00:26:14.070
AUDIENCE: The under-utilization
of the dinner table.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.270
MICHAEL HEBB: The
under-utilization?

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.990
DAVID LEVIN: Of the
dinner table, yeah.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.781
MICHAEL HEBB: Yeah.

00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:22.530
I think a lot of things
led to us not knowing

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.110
how to eat together.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:31.140
The glorification of mass
produced and industrialized

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.180
food.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.200
The science of food.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:42.540
How exciting it was to
move from the albatross

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.060
to being almost like
a beast of burden that

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:50.130
had to cook, that that was a
lowly thing that you would have

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:54.540
to grow your own food
and then have to cook it,

00:26:54.540 --> 00:27:03.420
this miraculous thing that
it's in a can, some sort

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:10.320
of plastic packaging that, in
fact, will kill us we found.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.690
The fact that we glorified
convenience and technology

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:20.800
without thinking about
what makes us human,

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.760
what gives us joy.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.750
If we're connected to
where food is grown,

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.700
we have much more gratitude.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.070
We're also getting much
higher nutrients, especially

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.630
if we're building soil.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:37.730
And then if we're learning
how to prepare that food,

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:41.940
the fact is the food is going to
have much more nutrient value.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.090
Because if somebody you love
is cooking it for somebody else

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.250
you love, more
likely that you're

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.340
going to sit down and share
that food over a conversation

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.620
because somebody has
invested time and energy.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.999
Whereas if I just pick up
Uber Eats and order something,

00:27:55.999 --> 00:27:57.540
it doesn't really
feel like an insult

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.930
to sit down with the
next episode of "Narcos"

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.570
or whatever, which
I'm totally down with.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.510
I did that last night.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:10.950
But we're living
in a culture where

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:16.855
I believe that antidepressants
are the most prescribed pill

00:28:16.855 --> 00:28:17.730
in the United States.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.500
So why?

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.740
Why are we depressed?

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.510
We're looking for meaning.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:33.480
Where can we inject more meaning
or lean in towards more meaning

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.770
or create more
meaning in our lives?

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:39.630
One thing for sure is knowing
where our food comes from,

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:44.370
having a meaningful
relationship to how it's grown

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.980
and how we prepare it
and how we serve it,

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.970
and then connecting with other
humans in our lives over it

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:56.970
has worked for a long
time for humankind.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:02.880
So I think that it's a little
bit like the opposite of--

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.120
what's the inverse
of an exponential?

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.057
AUDIENCE: Logarithmic.

00:29:07.057 --> 00:29:08.140
MICHAEL HEBB: Logarithmic?

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.420
OK, see?

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.710
I'm glad I'm here.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.720
So there's like a logarithmic
relationship to forgetting

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.595
these type of skills.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:18.570
And they're really hard.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:22.050
It would be hard to have
them grow, once again,

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:26.220
because a few generations
in of not knowing

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.519
the importance of
sitting at a table

00:29:28.519 --> 00:29:30.060
together or cooking
our food together

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.240
or having meaningful
conversations over that table--

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.160
it's almost completely gone.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.200
It becomes a relic.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.166
DAVID LEVIN: Yeah.

00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:40.540
I think we have
another question.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.950
MICHAEL HEBB: Yeah, of course.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.290
AUDIENCE: So if I want to
talk about death over dinner,

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:47.020
who should I invite
to the dinner?

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.350
And have you noticed
different responses, say,

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.890
if I'm with some of my friends
versus my family, parents,

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.667
children, spouse?

00:29:58.667 --> 00:30:01.000
Are there different themes
that come up or [INAUDIBLE]??

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.300
MICHAEL HEBB: Totally.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:02.800
Yeah.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.220
So who should you
invite to dinner?

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.670
Well, in the video, the idea
is you don't surprise people.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.380
There is a great process
of self-selection

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.290
around this conversation
and these dinners.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.800
Some people aren't ready.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.800
You might be like, I tried
to talk to my spouse.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.380
And she or he says no.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.370
My parents absolutely
are not into it.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:30.090
My friends seem like
they're more willing.

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.727
So let me start there.

00:30:32.727 --> 00:30:34.810
The thing is, you will
have a completely different

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.210
conversation with your friends
than you will with your spouse

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.710
than you will with your parents
than you will with your kids

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.500
if you have them.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.980
And each one of them are
valuable for different reasons.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.682
Your friends is
really about getting

00:30:47.682 --> 00:30:50.140
to know each other better and
connecting with your friends.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.904
You'll get a profound
connection with whoever you

00:30:52.904 --> 00:30:54.070
sit down at this table with.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.750
I've seen complete
strangers become

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:59.530
lifelong friends in three
hours because the topic is

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.640
so unusual.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:07.257
So the other thing to know about
when you're inviting somebody

00:31:07.257 --> 00:31:09.340
and it seems like they're
not interested in having

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.006
this conversation--
you're in this room.

00:31:11.006 --> 00:31:13.510
You have some interest
in this conversation.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.580
But maybe the people
around you in your life

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.870
don't have as much interest.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.510
And it seems like they don't
want to talk to you about it

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.830
if you've tried.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.390
So the thing about
this conversation

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:26.890
is we're not good at rejection.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:31.750
Sometimes I say if
we were as good at--

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.160
how does it go?

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.640
If we looked at it like
courtship and getting a job

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.090
and we treated death
conversation the same

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.490
as we treat those things,
we would never find love.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:46.030
And we'd never get a job
because those things take

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:49.990
all our creativity and
tenacity to have happen.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.000
You're in this room
because you're tenacious.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.820
Because you're on this campus,
you've got a job at Google

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.310
because you've probably
had a bunch of rejections

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:59.500
along the way to get here.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.290
And you've just persevered.

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:05.920
Now, if you want to know
how the people in your life

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.890
want to be remembered,
what they want

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:12.707
have to happen to their
body, all of these things--

00:32:12.707 --> 00:32:14.290
what they want their
last days to look

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:17.670
like-- you can find it out.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.580
The trick is, it's
not about them.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.270
They won't talk because
everybody who is alive

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.610
is having a conversation in
their head about the fact

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.200
that they're going to die.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.460
Everybody knows it.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.250
They got the press release.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.050
Completely clear.

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:36.060
Now, there might be
certain layers of denial.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.020
Or they don't want to
talk to you about it.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.950
And so instead of
being like, they

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:42.420
don't want to talk
about it-- no,

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.590
they don't want to
talk to me about it.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:48.720
So how do I have to
shift my way of being

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.270
so that the people
in my life want

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:55.110
to talk to me about this thing
that's so important to them?

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.534
And so it shifts from
this blaming mentality

00:32:57.534 --> 00:32:58.950
that we usually
have-- people have

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:00.396
around parents, especially.

00:33:00.396 --> 00:33:00.895
I get it.

00:33:00.895 --> 00:33:02.670
They're triggering.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.850
Or spouses-- I get
it, also triggering.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:11.140
But they do have a conversation.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.720
How do you get invited into it?

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:20.590
I mean, if you want
to try out a dinner,

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:22.680
send an invite
out to 20 friends.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.460
You'll probably get
five or so that'll bite.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.480
Maybe you'll get none.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.840
And maybe you'll be
like, I need new friends.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.220
I'm sure they're fine.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:36.030
But the other thing
is, just go gently.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:38.680
The culture is changing
around this topic.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.800
There's a lot of people
doing amazing work.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.620
And so the literacy level
about end of life and dying

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:47.400
is literally rising
up every day.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.460
The system is getting
more and more intelligent

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.650
and connected and acceptable.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.660
When we started this
seven years ago,

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.480
there were no articles
about death and dying.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.660
Once a month there
might be a minor piece.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:05.850
If we did a search right now
about death and dying and then

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.460
looked at it-- you guys
could do this pretty easily--

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:13.530
looked at it historically
about the amount of pure media

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.929
and the amount of
front-page news

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:21.707
all across the world right
now, we have a sea change.

00:34:21.707 --> 00:34:23.790
And there's a lot of people
doing incredible work.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.760
So when you're inviting
people into the conversation,

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.460
you're inviting them into a
higher and higher literacy

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.610
rate.

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.520
And so that's why
I do this work-- is

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.170
to increase the literacy.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.872
Literacy increases empowerment.

00:34:35.872 --> 00:34:37.830
When people feel empowered,
they make decisions

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.020
that more are aligned
with their true selves.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.159
People are happier.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.080
The world's happier,
environment's

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.650
better, all of these things.

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.706
So that's kind of
how I break it down.

00:34:47.706 --> 00:34:49.830
DAVID LEVIN: So we mentioned
relatives and friends.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:51.795
But does it even have to
be with people you know?

00:34:51.795 --> 00:34:53.336
I mean, I guess you
have to know them

00:34:53.336 --> 00:34:54.692
well enough to invite them.

00:34:54.692 --> 00:34:55.650
MICHAEL HEBB: Yeah, no.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.010
I think that you guys could
do death over dinner, death

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:01.360
over lunch here quite easily.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:05.000
There's a lot of corporations
that do, actually.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.450
And the fact is you will know
the people you sit down with.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:15.630
You will feel connected to them.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:18.060
When we created
deathoverdinner.org,

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.390
the platform, I knew I
didn't have the bandwidth

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:25.440
to manage a community.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.020
As you sure well
know, the amount

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:31.520
of resource to properly manage
a community and serve them

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.400
is tremendous, especially
in digital work and scale.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.630
And so when we created
Death over Dinner,

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:42.120
we built it for $11,000 that
we raised from an Indiegogo

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.140
campaign.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.990
And for five years, that was
the only funding we had--

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.950
so $11,000.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.955
Civilization, this incredible
design firm in Seattle

00:35:50.955 --> 00:35:52.890
who just won the
Cooper Hewitt Award

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:57.340
for design agency of the year--

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.580
they pitched in a
bunch of free time.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.980
We built this thing together.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:06.480
It ran with a $0 annual
budget for five years.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.700
At a conservative count,
there's been over--

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.110
this video is old now--

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.880
200,000 dinners.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.710
This means a million
people have sat down

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:18.844
and had this conversation
for literally $11,000.

00:36:18.844 --> 00:36:20.760
You think about a million
people having a two-

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.960
to three-hour experience.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:30.360
So it worked, this
idea meeting its time.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.060
But we realized
that we didn't have

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.240
the resources to engage
a community and say,

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.670
here's a dinner happening.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.830
It was all like, hey, if
you want to do a dinner,

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:43.290
just like a board
game, here it is.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.340
It's on you.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.330
Make it happen.

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:47.280
So that was our model,
really, just because

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.120
of the lack of resources.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:48.490
DAVID LEVIN: Yeah.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.010
So you talk about
lack of resources.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:51.600
In other cases, I
think I've heard

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.440
you refer to the website and
its presentation as a gift.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.880
Why is that important to
you that it's like a gift?

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.050
MICHAEL HEBB: Yeah.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.800
I mean, there's been
lots of opportunities

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.175
to transactionalize it.

00:37:01.175 --> 00:37:03.300
People are like, well,
we're going to sell tickets.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.383
We can maybe sell tickets.

00:37:04.383 --> 00:37:06.970
Or insurance companies-- do
you want to partner with us?

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:11.580
And what a great way to
sell some life insurance.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.710
Sure.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:14.250
No.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:17.143
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:23.720
The thing about
transactions is that they

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.130
don't necessarily,
by their design,

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.230
bring people closer together.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:30.200
That's not the nature
of a transaction.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.510
A transaction
intentionally creates

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.040
a little bit of a boundary.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.539
You know what you're
getting for it.

00:37:35.539 --> 00:37:37.492
Somebody knows what
they're giving you.

00:37:37.492 --> 00:37:38.450
That's great and clear.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.230
Gifts are messier.

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.740
They're more human.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:50.660
Gifts are intended to
obligate people in some way.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.170
Warring tribes would
give each other gifts

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.700
as this way of obligation.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.180
Gifts stay in some
level of circulation.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.220
That's kind of just their DNA.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.390
There's a DNA of a gift.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.370
And there's a DNA
of a transaction.

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:06.380
Lewis Hyde writes about
this really brilliantly.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:12.170
And he was one of the people
who inspired Lessig and the--

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:16.970
what's the open source that
Lawrence Lessig started?

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:20.240
What is it?

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.506
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:21.506 --> 00:38:22.380
MICHAEL HEBB: No, no.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.838
But he is involved
in that as well.

00:38:23.838 --> 00:38:27.085
I was thinking of the commons--

00:38:27.085 --> 00:38:28.210
AUDIENCE: Creative Commons.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:31.170
MICHAEL HEBB: Creative Commons,
yeah, inspired in great part

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:37.350
by Lewis Hyde's work around the
DNA of transaction versus gift.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:42.720
And I really wanted
this to be really clear

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.290
that no one was
enriching themselves,

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.890
that people were actually
doing the opposite of enriching

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:53.910
themselves, that they felt
so passionately about this

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:58.500
that they were going to
risk their good name.

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.469
When I first came
up with the idea

00:39:00.469 --> 00:39:02.760
and called a bunch of friends
in the health care space,

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.220
they're like, no.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.010
You're crazy.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.200
It's not going to work.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.880
Everyone's going to
think you're insane.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.300
You can't death and dinner.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.210
And now we're partnering with
the Cleveland Clinic, which

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:17.970
is one of the most
reputable health care

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:19.480
systems in the world.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.020
And they were building
the medical edition

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:24.960
with the Cleveland
Clinic and probably 1,000

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.790
medical partners.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.830
And I'm lecturing
at Sloan Kettering

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.390
and partnering with
Sloan Kettering.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:33.090
So in about a
month, we've entered

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.390
into the oncology space,
the terminal illness

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:38.400
space, which would not let
you into this conversation.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.374
Death and cancer?

00:39:40.374 --> 00:39:41.790
They're just not
in the same room.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.310
We're going to beat cancer.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:46.290
And I was like, the
elephant is in the room.

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:48.900
People who have a stage four
terminal diagnosis-- they

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.120
are thinking about the
fact that they might die.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.060
Let's give them the
opportunity to talk about it.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.430
And I got a big
no for many years.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.620
And now I'm getting,
what a great idea.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.310
Where have you been
our whole lives?

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:01.997
It's like, OK, yes.

00:40:01.997 --> 00:40:02.580
It's changing.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.290
But for me to be
able to get access

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:11.760
to work with the Cleveland
Clinic and Sloan Kettering,

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.830
it had to be a gift.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:17.104
If I was an entrepreneur
who had this idea,

00:40:17.104 --> 00:40:18.270
we wouldn't be sitting here.

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:19.831
And there wouldn't be a book.

00:40:19.831 --> 00:40:21.830
DAVID LEVIN: You talked
about sending that email

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:22.650
to 20 of your friends.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:24.335
I think at one point you had
this time when you sent out

00:40:24.335 --> 00:40:25.830
an email to a lot
of your friends.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:29.790
It resulted in you attending
your own funeral, I think.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:31.980
Can you tell us a little
bit more about that?

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.730
How did it happen?

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.521
MICHAEL HEBB: Yeah.

00:40:33.521 --> 00:40:35.530
Careful what you ask for.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:40.590
So I had just broken up with the
love of my life, so I thought.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.930
And I was really depressed.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.890
And I was about to turn 40.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:49.810
And the first thing
I thought was,

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.930
I'm going to be alone
on my 40th birthday.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:53.716
And here's this great reckoning.

00:40:53.716 --> 00:40:55.590
And I'm going to think
about what a failure I

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.987
am romantically.

00:40:57.987 --> 00:40:59.070
And I'm going to be alone.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:03.120
And so I sent out an
email to about 50 friends

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.829
saying, hey, in two
months I'm turning 40.

00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:08.370
I don't know where
we're going to be.

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:10.050
But I'm going to be somewhere
in the northern coast

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:10.830
of California.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:11.640
Save the date.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.840
Tell me if you can come now.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.210
I need to know.

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.680
And I got 40 yeses.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.630
I'll be there.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:19.350
Immediately I was
like, whew, I'm not

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.930
going to be alone on my 40th.

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:26.050
And then about a week
later, a friend--

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:29.830
because now there's this list
with all of these people on it.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:34.230
Even though I was like, don't
reply all, he breaks that rule

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:38.290
and says, hey, so Mr.
Death is turning 40.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:41.970
Let's go ahead and
celebrate his great turn

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:45.120
by throwing him
a living funeral.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:52.020
And at that point, somebody has
called out an amazing challenge

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.880
to me in front of everybody.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.931
And I can't be like,
that's a terrible idea.

00:41:55.931 --> 00:41:57.180
I actually was broken hearted.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.263
That's why I'm doing this.

00:41:58.263 --> 00:42:00.790
And now I have to die.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:02.100
And so I was like, great.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:02.670
Yes.

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.530
Yeah, of course.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:05.130
We'll do it.

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:07.800
And it got really serious.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.590
It really built up
steam as it got closer.

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:12.390
And it turned into
the centerpiece

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:16.800
of this long weekend and a whole
day dedicated to preparations.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.020
I ended up being
ritually bathed,

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.870
anointed with oils,
dressed in white,

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:25.640
brought downstairs
with my eyes closed.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:31.020
I actually was blindfolded
downstairs into this courtyard.

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.930
And before I know
it, I'm being helped

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:37.710
into what I then
realized just by texture

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:43.110
and smell was my own
coffin and then picked up

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:47.520
by pallbearers whose breath
smelled like whiskey.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.970
It's funny-- the little details,
the whiskey on their breath.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:56.400
I was like, I'm definitely at
my own funeral slash Irish wake.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.710
And they're drinking
because they're

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:00.720
having a really hard time.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.260
They're not drinking because
they're day drinkers.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.892
They're drinking
because they're dealing

00:43:06.892 --> 00:43:08.850
with what looks like one
of their best friend's

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.230
bodies in a coffin.

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:13.260
And the whole thing makes
them incredibly uncomfortable.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:16.620
And so I get lifted
into this darkened room.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.880
It has one candle.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.040
And there's like
40 people in it.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.080
And a friend of mine--

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.580
I didn't know who
it was at the time

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.280
because I couldn't
recognize by her wailing--

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.510
starts losing it in the way
that you might pay somebody

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:31.380
to cry at your funeral--

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.800
[? keeners, ?] which is still
a thing all over the world.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.950
You can pay someone to cry.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:39.140
And what it helps is other
people have the emotion.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.250
But I wasn't paying her.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.480
And she couldn't control it.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.340
And it was this
incredible woman, Alex,

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:47.270
who just started wailing,
sobbing uncontrollably.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.090
And then it was very clear
that this was not a joke.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:52.424
Anybody who was still
kind of tongue in cheek--

00:43:52.424 --> 00:43:54.590
I mean, there might have
been some people there that

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:56.990
had ingested some psilocybin.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.200
But that probably just made
it even more intense for them.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:05.750
I wasn't ingesting psilocybin
that day, just so we're clear.

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:09.470
And so I'm laying
in this coffin.

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:16.070
And for three hours, my
friends air their grievances--

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.190
real grievances--
as if I were dead.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:21.830
I was like, I can hear you--

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:24.660
really where I had failed them.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:29.060
But then the harder part
was where they loved me.

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.010
I got to hear this.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:33.080
And I couldn't do
anything about it--

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.010
40 people that mean the most to
in your life feeling like they

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:40.850
can tell you in an unabashed
way how they feel about you

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:42.760
without you being
able to deflect it,

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:46.010
without you being able to
acknowledge them, nothing.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:47.480
I couldn't take it.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.130
And it made me
really uncomfortable.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:52.160
And my 15-year-old
daughter was there.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.710
And she got up on
the edge of my coffin

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:56.180
and started talking to me.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.350
You want to have an
emotional experience?

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:01.299
Have your 15-year-old daughter
attend your own funeral

00:45:01.299 --> 00:45:02.090
while you're awake.

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:06.480
And so ultimately, my
takeaways from it--

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.440
and so we created this
whole site, The Living Wake,

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.380
so that people, again, can
have a blameable resource

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.150
to throw these things.

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:15.400
Because a lot of people--

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.630
they're 80 or 90, or they
just want to play Tom Sawyer--

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:20.640
want to have these experiences.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.030
But they don't want to be
the person that comes up

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:24.530
with the idea and organizes it.

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:29.600
So livewake.com we produced
just for, again, a gift.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.880
But what I realized
from that experience

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:34.342
is I don't know how
to receive love.

00:45:34.342 --> 00:45:36.690
I got really good at giving it.

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:40.550
And then I also in
research about how we die--

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:42.980
there is an incredible
book called "How We Die."

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:48.410
And I learned that the
heart is essentially

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:50.370
two muscles on a timer.

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:52.850
It's two distinct organs.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:56.230
One of those organs
receives blood.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:58.340
It's what it does all
day, receiving blood,

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.050
oxygenating it.

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:03.159
And then the other half of
our heart distributes blood.

00:46:03.159 --> 00:46:03.950
That's all it does.

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:05.930
It just pumps blood all day.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.625
And then the timer--

00:46:07.625 --> 00:46:10.340
so you get pump pump, pump pump.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.380
Receive, give, receive,
give, receive, give.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.510
And a heart attack,
which is still

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:16.760
the number-one
killer in the world,

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.040
is an imbalance between
give and receive.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.250
It's an imbalance in that heart.

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:22.220
The timing is off.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.980
And I was like, OK, so
if I don't figure out

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.690
this side of my heart
that's receiving,

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:31.880
then I'm reducing my
lifespan, reducing

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:35.340
how much I can actually give if
I don't learn how to receive.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.570
And I'm going to die sooner.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:39.380
And so I got it
really hard that I

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.730
needed to learn how to
slow down and receive,

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:44.386
a pretty good lesson.

00:46:44.386 --> 00:46:46.010
DAVID LEVIN: You have
a ritual that you

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:47.510
begin these things
with and a ritual

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:49.100
that you end them with as well.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.220
At the end, I think you
have a ritual that everybody

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.250
says something that they really
appreciate about the person

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:56.840
to the side of them.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.100
And so I guess I'll end.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.750
And I'll say something that
I appreciate about you.

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:02.880
Thank you so much for
coming here to talk to us.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.150
And thank you for covering
this important topic,

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:08.840
spending the time to think about
important questions that can

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.640
help us learn more about life.

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.190
You have a quote in the
book from Kyoko Mori

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.530
that says, "everything
we say about death

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:17.270
is actually about life."

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:20.362
And I feel like the questions
you have in here really

00:47:20.362 --> 00:47:22.070
help us to think about
our life and think

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:23.310
about what's important.

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:24.590
Thank you very much
for coming here today.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:24.890
MICHAEL HEBB: Yeah.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:25.931
It's an honor to be here.

00:47:25.931 --> 00:47:28.540
