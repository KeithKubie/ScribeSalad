00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.975
Let's think for a second about why the domain for this function, the square root

00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:09.850
function, is not all the real numbers. Now you've heard a few lessons ago, about

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.540
how imaginary numbers allow us to take square roots of negative numbers but, and

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.230
this is super, super, super important If we only care about real solutions, then

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.645
taking the square root of some complex number is undefined. We want to be able

00:00:23.645 --> 00:00:27.563
to graph whatever input and output values we get from our function. And if we

00:00:27.563 --> 00:00:31.532
have numbers with imaginary components, we can't graph them on this kind of

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:36.523
graph. So knowing what you know about square roots, and focusing only on real

00:00:36.523 --> 00:00:41.043
solutions for g of x. What is the correct domain for the function g of x?
