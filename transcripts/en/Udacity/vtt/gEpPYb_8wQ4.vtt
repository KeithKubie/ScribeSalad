00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The status code is 302, and the location header was this URL:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
iana.org/domain/example.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Okay--I'll walk through how I found these answers,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and, hopefully, you did something similar.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So we go to our terminal, and we said example.com.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So let's make that request.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Telnet to www.example.com, port 80--okay--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
now we say GET/HTTP/1.0

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Host www.example.com--aha--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
nice simple response.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We can see our status code is 302, and we can see

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
our location header is right here, iana.org.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If that didn't work--you know--here's how you do it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Alright--so let's play around a little bit more,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so--we see that this is a redirect response because it was status code 302,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and it's saying the actual content is here.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Let's give a shot at making the request to find this,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
we're going to telnet to iana.org and make a request for this path,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and see how it goes--see if we can get a 200.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We make the request to iana.org, telnet to www.iana.org, port 80,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and then we say GET/domain/example, HTTP/1.0.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Okay--so here we are.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You can see where I telnetted into iana.org,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and you can see the request I made for /domain/example,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I used HTTP 1.0 again, and you can see the response. [Laughs]

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This is actually kind of funny.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So I responded with HTTP 1.0 status 200.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
This is actually a good example of the web not lining up exactly correctly.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But--that's how it goes.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Generally, this 1.1 should have matched this 1.0,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
but since these guys control the web I guess they can do whatever they like.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Okay--so--you can see the common headers, dates--you know--today,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[Laughs] actually, today for me--and the past for you.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
You can see the server header, Apache,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
you can see--this is an interesting header--last modified.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This page was last modified over a year ago.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is for caching purposes.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
This tells our browser that we don't need to bother

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
requesting this page again--you know--

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
we don't need new updates if it hasn't changed since this date.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Content type--this is typical--text HTML,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and below that, you see the content.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Pretty cool, huh?
