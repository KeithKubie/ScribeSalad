1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.120
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.300
But the Chelsea manning thing,

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.710
she was in solitary confinement when she was still a dude.

4
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:14.760
Does that count like a,
as her being like,
how does that tell you different study?

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.170
You say that you say Bradley or DC.
Chelsea when she hadn't changed yet.

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.940
I think we have to ask,

7
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:23.910
do you still say Bruce Jenner won the Olympics or do you say Katelyn?
Well,

8
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:28.020
Bruce won the Olympics.
No,
no,
no.
Kaitlin.
What does it say?
He's Caitlyn now.

9
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:30.120
You can't get it now.
You know.
If you dead name them,

10
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:32.210
you'll get kicked off of Twitter.
Dead.
Name Him.

11
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.650
Do you know that dead naming is no,
I've never heard of.
He didn't know.

12
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.100
So say if you'd become Joe Hannah reap.
Yeah.

13
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.320
If you decided at this stage of the game,
you know what?

14
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:44.520
Fuck cammies and transitions.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm wearing some time for Prius.

15
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.320
Yeah.
I'm just trying to get my legs waxed.

16
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.660
We got Reeves county detention complex and pesos.

17
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.740
Texas has a combined capacity of 3,763 prisoners in it's three seven complexes.

18
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.120
Wow.
So that's probably about as big as it gets.
Yeah.

19
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.300
At this dog that hard.
And you still can't get anything over 5,000.
Yeah.

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.580
So it's in the 30s 3,300 5,500 what about the world?

21
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.950
So if you,
you've changed your name with Joel [inaudible] rape and uh,

22
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.440
I started saying,
Hey John Reape what's it like wearing dresses?

23
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:18.780
Pretend you're a girl that's deadnaming you.

24
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.650
I deadnaming you cause it called you John,
because I choose name is Johanne rat.

25
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.360
Right.
But Bruce Bruce is the one who won the Olympic.
Yeah,

26
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:30.360
but that's his dead name.
Well,
that's what he was going to be an asshole.
John.

27
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.560
God,
you're so insensitive.
Can't believe this this day and age.

28
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.170
I'm gonna make you subscribe to the list.
[inaudible]
Bolano podcast show.

29
00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:43.110
Get your shit together.
Shit.
You need to get up in the times,
Bro.
So way behind.

30
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.990
I was just kidding about Melissa Moore.
I don't know what she's doing.

31
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.400
I don't either.
It was a good name though,
to throw around.
Oh yeah,
Alyssa Milano.

32
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.410
So because she has,
she's active on the Twitter sphere.
I believe so,
yeah.

33
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:58.020
She's very political.
Yeah.
She's always arguing with people.

34
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:01.500
I think that was one of them.
People,
you know,
they,
they booted Jon Woods,

35
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.510
you know,
Jon Woods,
the actor,
they booted him off the Twitter.
You can,

36
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.450
what's up naughty.
I don't think he did anything that big a deal.
Would it weigh,

37
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.670
first of all,
refresh my memory.
James Woods.
I'm sorry.
James Woods.

38
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.700
Jon Woods.
People probably be mad if they probably know this.

39
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.890
New York City's Rikers island has a population of 11,000 but I don't know if

40
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:25.650
that,
they're all prisoners are not.
What am I mean?

41
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:29.280
Like there's people that are vacationers.
Probably workers I live on.

42
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.290
People want cheap bread.
Might be half count as a do.

43
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.840
They really says it can accommodate up to 15,000 prisoners.

44
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.650
Verse 15,000 prisoners.
Okay.
How bout,
yeah,

45
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.810
now we're in the neighborhood is one of the Turkey that's got 10,900 wow.
Okay.

46
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:49.530
So that's about,
cause he gets,
that's a lot though.
If you go to a theater,

47
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.670
like if you did an arena like 15,000 peoples like Madison Square Garden,

48
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.380
that's all a lot of fucking criminals.
Yeah.

49
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.270
Got to Bhutan.
So the,
the Chelsea manning thing,
like now she's free,

50
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:07.450
but then she got locked up again for contempt to court.

51
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.300
But I think when she was locked up in solitary confinement,

52
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.530
they took away her clothes.

53
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.280
They wouldn't let her have closed because they thought she was suicidal.
Really?

54
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.010
I think that's just an excuse.
So when they,
okay,

55
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:22.000
so when the Kesha cold was a male?
Yes.

56
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.710
He's in a Bradley.
I'm trying to not dead.
They don't do it.
What?

57
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:30.230
So when Chelsea won the Olympics?
Yeah.
Um,

58
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.600
was that was,
was she on the Olympics?
I'm trying to do that.

59
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.540
Was he in a male prison?
That's a good question.

60
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.720
And then as a female,
does he go to a female prison?
That's a good question.
Okay.

61
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.820
I don't know.
Maybe that's why they put her in solitary.
Oh,
right,
right.

62
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.140
Protected from dudes.
I think then that's kind of a loophole that,
uh,

63
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.030
let's say if I know I'm going to prison and I got like a year before I get

64
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:02.590
sentenced,
I might just call it to get that sex judge.
Right.
So I'm with females.

65
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.640
Right?
I don't know.
Maybe I just get the sex change anymore.

66
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.700
You just have to identify.
Oh,
okay.
There you go.
I'm good.
