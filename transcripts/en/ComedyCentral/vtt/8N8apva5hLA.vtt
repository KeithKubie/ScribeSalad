00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:03.836
   - [Voiceover] The
   graffiti artist

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.406
known as Spanksy
has struck again.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:08.107
   Five nights in a
   row, he's targeted

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.477
   the outside wall
   of Potter Lumber.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.213
 - Yo, nice dick, dog!

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:15.782
   (laughing)

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:20.520
   (drumming)

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:21.788
(dramatic music)

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.556
- [Voiceover] Reports
have surfaced that owner

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.558
 Russ Harvey has stolen
 the profits of the

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:28.528
   softball tournament to
   benefit testicular cancer,

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.330
called Softballs for Sick Balls.

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:35.101
 And Spanksy has a
 hard message for him.

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:36.335 line:0%
  - It's pretty simple, innit?

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:37.737 line:0%
  Every day he doesn't
  donate the money,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.472 line:0%
   I'm gonna spray
   my (beeping) balls

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:41.307 line:0%
   on the side of his
   (beeping) wall.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.775 line:0%
 - [Voiceover] Frank,
 you wanna split a pie?

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:43.743 line:0%
  - Whatchoo doing
  saying my real name?

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:46.779
- Goddamnit, five nights
in a row with this.

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:48.247
 - Yes!

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.316
- You did keep the money, Russ.

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:53.786
  - T-shirts, jerseys,
  visors, bar tabs!

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.254
  My time isn't free, Johnny.

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:56.489
 - Yes!

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.691
- [Russ] And awareness,
we raised awareness!

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:00.326
  What's this dickbag
  ever done, huh?

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.727
  - Well, his blog
  says he raised over

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.163
 $1,000 for testicular
 cancer, so.

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:05.665
- I don't understand that word.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:06.766
 What's a blog?

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.501
   - It's an internet
   newspaper for fat ladies.

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.303
  - Speak to a representative!

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.804
  - Darrel, get off the phone.

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:13.306
  - Look, I'll stay the night.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.807
   If he comes back,
   we'll catch him.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.609
 - [Voiceover] Uh, that
 won't be necessary.

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:20.213
   We are investing in a
   third party security team.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.682
 - What? We don't have
 the money for that.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.083
  - There's plenty of
  money in the budget.

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:25.184
  - We need to use that money

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:26.752
  to get a new wide receiver.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:27.720
- Nope, that's a
different, you're having

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.322
   a different conversation.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.724
   - Look, let us handle
   the finances! Okay, John?

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:32.658
   - [Voiceover] I've
   just gotten word

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:33.759
 that we'll actually be hearing

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.561
  from someone inside
  the facility.

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:37.063
   - Yo, yo, yo, the funny
   thing is, there's a bunch

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.232
  of peckers inside
  that building, too!

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.199
   (laughing)

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:41.701
- Sir, I think you're bleeding.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.604
   (laughing)

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.839
  - I'm gonna stay the
  night, wanna hang?

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:48.374
   - Yeah, can I bring beer?

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:49.275
- Yeah!

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:51.210
   - Can you buy it?

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.478
 - Yes.

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:53.612
- [Voiceover] Say that
shit to my face, pussy!

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.448
  - Oh, it looks like some...
  - [Man] Come on, yeah!

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:56.115
- And they're...

00:01:56.148 --> 00:01:56.782
   (thumping)

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:57.683
   - Oh shit!

00:01:57.716 --> 00:01:59.785
   (laughing)

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:01.020
  - Did you get that?

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:02.622
 (electric guitar riff)

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:06.792
(sirens wailing)

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:08.261
- Alright, so go ahead.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.762
 - So anyway, this
 chick sneezes, right?

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:13.232
   She blows like $20 worth
   of coke into my ball hair.

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:14.467
  - Sounds like a fun wedding.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.736
- Well, it is for her
family, you've met her.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.438
(Spanish guitar)

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:20.372
   (laughing)

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.741
   - Seriously, dude,
   the president.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:25.077
  - Roosevelt, moron.
  He had Polio.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.646
It's a dangerous sport.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.281
   - No, that's Polo.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.715
   - No, water Polio.

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:31.784
 - You know nothing
 about fucking sports.

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:34.754
 - Alright, here we go,
 here we go, batter.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:35.521
   (cracking)

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:37.190
   (groaning)

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.591
   - Alright!

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:39.659
   (laughing)

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:40.393
   - Win every time.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:41.260
  - This one.

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:42.495
   - That's a vagina.

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:43.696
   - It's an armpit.

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.332
   (laughing)

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:49.235
   - Yeah, I'd still fuck it.

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:51.704
   - It's an armpit.

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:53.506
- Yeah.

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.608
   (sighing)

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:58.511
   (clanking)

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:06.686
   - Tommy, wake up!

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:15.028
  (jazz music)

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:20.600
 - Yo, you think it's Spansky?

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:21.701
- Oh, I hope so!

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:24.737
   (clanking)

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.673
   (laughing)

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:29.675
  - Oh shit, dude, it's Chief.

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:31.410
- Chief!

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:32.678
   - Chief, oh, that's right,

00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:34.513
  he cleans on Tuesday nights.

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:36.382
   (laughing)

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:37.183
 - Did you see that...

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:37.650
  - Yeah, it was good.

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:39.552
- Still got it.

00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:41.120
- Man, he's still goin'.

00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:44.757
   (sighing)

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.825
   - You can still smell it.

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:47.059
 - Yeah, man, listen...

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:48.327
 It was a whole stack just fell

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.762
  right on your
  head, to be honest.

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:50.763
 - Right on ya.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:51.530
   - Really?

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:52.765
- Yeah.

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:55.268
- Mmhmm. You're lucky
we were here, actually.

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.536
  - So, think of it that way.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.304
   - Thanks.

00:03:58.337 --> 00:03:58.871
   - You're welcome.

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:00.339
  - Don't mention it.

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:02.275
- Hey, I just don't get Spanksy.

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:04.210
   How many black British
   guys do you see in Delco,

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:06.679
   it should be so
   easy to stop them.

00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:07.680
- He's not black, Tommy.

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:10.683
He's got a blurred face.

00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:13.286
 - Yeah, I-I know
 he's got a blurred...

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.623
   You're not telling
   when I'm, dick.

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.292
   (sighing)

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:22.128
- Dude, like the biggest boards

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:24.597
  we have in this
  whole fucking yard.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.632
Pow, right on yer head!

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:27.800
   (laughing)

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:30.703
   - Yeah, I don't remember.

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:35.541
  (trickling)

00:04:35.574 --> 00:04:37.376
- Shit!

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:38.778
- What's a matter
buddy, you get it stuck?

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.246
- Shit!

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.548
  - Uh, don't worry about it.

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:43.516
  Look, I know this is
  gonna sound weird,

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.284
  but you just pour a
  little beer on it,

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:47.753
   comes right out of there.

00:04:47.786 --> 00:04:49.689
   - Camera!

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:50.790
  - Who cares?

00:04:50.823 --> 00:04:51.590
 - You don't
 understand, he's been

00:04:51.623 --> 00:04:52.658
 watching us all night!

00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:53.826
 - [Voiceover] It's an armpit.

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:55.661
   (laughing)

00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:57.396
  - [Voiceover] Yeah,
  I'd still fuck it.

00:04:57.429 --> 00:04:58.698
  (splatting)

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.666
 - He just wants to
 be part of the party.

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.402
 - Yeah, you know what?
 I've got an idea.

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:05.705
 Here you go, he wants
 to be part of it?

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:07.306
   He wants to be part of it?

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.375
  Hey Gordy, you wanna
  have a beer with us?

00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:10.509
   (grunting)

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:11.744
   (groaning)

00:05:11.777 --> 00:05:13.412
   - Alright, another
   one, another one.

00:05:13.445 --> 00:05:15.181
I almost got it.

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:17.450
  - Yeah, oh, come on.

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:18.784
  - Alright, alright.
  Last one, last one.

00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:21.420
 - No, no, no, no.
 Don't waste it, dude.

00:05:21.453 --> 00:05:22.121
- What?

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:23.322
   (crashing)

00:05:23.355 --> 00:05:24.357
- Yeah!

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.758
   (beeping)

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:26.459
   (laughing)

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:27.526
  - I gave you that eye-line.

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:28.728
  - Alright, come on.

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:29.662
   Now let's go throw
   the rest of those

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:31.497
 beers into these mouth holes.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.298
   - Alright.

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:32.865
- Ready?

00:05:32.898 --> 00:05:33.699
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:33.732 --> 00:05:38.638
(Spanish guitar)

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:46.645
   (gurgling)

00:05:46.678 --> 00:05:49.515
(muffled voice)

00:05:49.548 --> 00:05:52.284
 - Hey!

00:05:52.317 --> 00:05:53.819
   - He was driving.

00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:56.589
   (groaning)

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:57.823
  - Oh, shit.

00:05:57.856 --> 00:05:58.724
 - Yeah, look what else
 this jerk-off did!

00:05:58.757 --> 00:06:00.059
   (electric guitar)

00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:02.228
  - Aw, tits!

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:03.596 line:0%
  - We here at Potter
  Lumber would like to

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.632 line:0%
  announce that we're
  gonna donate $500...

00:06:06.665 --> 00:06:09.635 line:0%
  - I thought it was
  a thousand dollars?

00:06:09.668 --> 00:06:12.772 line:0%

  a thousand dollars.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:13.706 line:0%

Sorry about the mix-up,

 we are truly a family business

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:23.750
  and integrity is our
  highest priority.

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:30.022
 - Back to you, Steve.

00:06:30.055 --> 00:06:31.455
