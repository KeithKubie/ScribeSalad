00:00:00.715 --> 00:00:03.340
What I want to do in this video
is talk about the two main ways

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.380
that triangles are categorized.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.600
The first way is based
on whether or not

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.410
the triangle has equal sides,
or at least a few equal sides.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.180
Then the other way is
based on the measure

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.760
of the angles of the triangle.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.000
So the first
categorization right here,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.990
and all of these are
based on whether or not

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.340
the triangle has equal
sides, is scalene.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.560
And a scalene
triangle is a triangle

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.010
where none of the
sides are equal.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.730
So for example, if I have
a triangle like this, where

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.140
this side has length 3,
this side has length 4,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.960
and this side has
length 5, then this

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.100
is going to be a
scalene triangle.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.780
None of the sides
have an equal length.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.560
Now an isosceles triangle is
a triangle where at least two

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.240
of the sides have equal lengths.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.450
So for example, this would
be an isosceles triangle.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.780
Maybe this has length
3, this has length 3,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.970
and this has length 2.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.920
Notice, this side and
this side are equal.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.310
So it meets the constraint of
at least two of the three sides

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.350
are have the same length.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.340
Now an equilateral
triangle, you might imagine,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.170
and you'd be right,
is a triangle

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.530
where all three sides
have the same length.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.800
So for example, this would
be an equilateral triangle.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.756
And let's say that this
has side 2, 2, and 2.

00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:41.900
Or if I have a triangle like
this where it's 3, 3, and 3.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.110
Any triangle where all three
sides have the same length

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.330
is going to be equilateral.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.020
Now you might say,
well Sal, didn't you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.800
just say that an
isosceles triangle is

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.270
a triangle has at least
two sides being equal.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.460
Wouldn't an equilateral
triangle be a special case

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.340
of an isosceles triangle?

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.230
And I would say yes,
you're absolutely right.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.110
An equilateral triangle
has all three sides equal,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.900
so it meets the constraints
for an isosceles.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.440
So by that definition,
all equilateral triangles

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.730
are also isosceles triangles.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.480
But not all isosceles
triangles are equilateral.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.300
So for example, this
one right over here,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.560
this isosceles triangle,
clearly not equilateral.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.120
All three sides
are not the same.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.260
Only two are.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.140
But both of these
equilateral triangles

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.380
meet the constraint that
at least two of the sides

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.940
are equal.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.010
Now down here, we're going
to classify based on angles.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.620
An acute triangle is a triangle
where all of the angles

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.480
are less than 90 degrees.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:53.590
So for example, a triangle
like this-- maybe this is 60,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.090
let me draw a little
bit bigger so I

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.500
can draw the angle measures.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.290
That's a little bit less.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.650
I want to make it a
little bit more obvious.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.210
So let's say a
triangle like this.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.460
If this angle is 60 degrees,
maybe this one right over here

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.040
is 59 degrees.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.290
And then this angle right
over here is 61 degrees.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.900
Notice they all add
up to 180 degrees.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.470
This would be an acute triangle.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.235
Notice all of the angles
are less than 90 degrees.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.290
A right triangle
is a triangle that

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.630
has one angle that is
exactly 90 degrees.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.700
So for example, this right over
here would be a right triangle.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.260
Maybe this angle or this angle
is one that's 90 degrees.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.120
And the normal way
that this is specified,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.328
people wouldn't just do the
traditional angle measure

00:03:56.328 --> 00:03:57.580
and write 90 degrees here.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.540
They would draw the
angle like this.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.040
They would put a little, the
edge of a box-looking thing.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.230
And that tells you that
this angle right over here

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.570
is 90 degrees.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.450
And because this triangle
has a 90 degree angle,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.870
and it could only have
one 90 degree angle,

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.029
this is a right triangle.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.512
So that is equal to 90 degrees.

00:04:19.512 --> 00:04:21.970
Now you could imagine an obtuse
triangle, based on the idea

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.880
that an obtuse angle is
larger than 90 degrees,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.180
an obtuse triangle
is a triangle that

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.720
has one angle that is
larger than 90 degrees.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.275
So let's say that you have a
triangle that looks like this.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.820
Maybe this is 120 degrees.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.736
And then let's see,
let me make sure

00:04:46.736 --> 00:04:47.860
that this would make sense.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.260
Maybe this is 25 degrees.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.760
Or maybe that is 35 degrees.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.170
And this is 25 degrees.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.860
Notice, they still add up to
180, or at least they should.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.276
25 plus 35 is 60, plus
120, is 180 degrees.

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:08.900
But the important
point here is that we

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.950
have an angle that
is a larger, that

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.150
is greater, than 90 degrees.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.570
Now, you might be
asking yourself,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.530
hey Sal, can a triangle be
multiple of these things.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.620
Can it be a right
scalene triangle?

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.544
Absolutely, you could have
a right scalene triangle.

00:05:27.544 --> 00:05:28.960
In this situation
right over here,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.560
actually a 3, 4, 5
triangle, a triangle

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.140
that has lengths of 3, 4, and
5 actually is a right triangle.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.350
And this right over here
would be a 90 degree angle.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.670
You could have an
equilateral acute triangle.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.520
In fact, all
equilateral triangles,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.390
because all of the angles
are exactly 60 degrees,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.630
all equilateral triangles
are actually acute.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.530
So there's multiple
combinations that you

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.100
could have between
these situations

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.170
and these situations
right over here.
