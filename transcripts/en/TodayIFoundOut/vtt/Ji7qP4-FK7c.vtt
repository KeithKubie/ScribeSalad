00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.389
What Causes “Eye Floaters?”

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.609
For those who’ve never experienced the phenomenon
of “eye floaters”, they are little oddly

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.789
shaped objects that appear in your vision,
often when one looks at bright light such

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.240
as a blue sky.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.610
Their shapes vary greatly, but will often
appear as spots, cobwebs, or randomly shaped

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.040
stringy objects.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.080
These are not optical illusions, but rather
something your eyes are actually perceiving.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.920
There are a few different things that can
cause this, but in most cases these eye floaters

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.890
are caused by pieces of the gel-like vitreous
breaking off from the back portion of your

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.440
eye and then floating about in your eye ball.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.020
The vitreous humor, or often just “vitreous”,
is a clear gel that fills the gap between

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.780
your retina and lens, helping maintain the
round shape of your eye in the process.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.989
This gel is about 99% water and 1% other elements;
the latter of which consists mostly of a network

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.200
of hyaluronic acid and collagen.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.290
Hyaluronic acid ends up retaining water molecules.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.219
Over time though, this network breaks down
which results in the hyaluronic acid releasing

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.010
its trapped water molecules.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.269
When this happens, it forms a watery core
in your vitreous body.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.150
As you age, pieces of the still gel-like collagen/hyaluronic
acid network will break off and float around

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.880
in this watery center.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.880
When light passes through this area, it creates
a shadow on your retina.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.810
This shadow is actually what you are seeing
when you see the eye floaters.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.189
Children and teenagers usually don’t experience
these types of eye floaters as there must

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.829
first be some deterioration of the gel-like
substance in their eye creating the watery

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.000
core for these floaters to appear.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.619
However, they do still sometimes experience
a certain type of eye floater that often appears

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.670
more like a crystallized web across their
vision.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.539
These floaters aren’t found in the vitreous
humor like the aforementioned floaters.

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.149
Instead, they are found in the Premacular
Bursa area, right on top of the retina.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.399
These floaters are microscopic in size and
only appear as big as they do because of their

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.179
proximity to the retina.

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:00.109
Unfortunately, their microscopic nature makes
them almost impossible to treat in most cases.

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.280
Bonus Facts:
• Interestingly, if the eye floaters would

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.649
just stay still instead of floating around,
your brain would automatically tune them out

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.680
and you’d never consciously see them.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.950
Your brain does this all the time with things
both in and outside of your eyes.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.670
One example of this inside your eye are blood
vessels in the eye which obstruct light; because

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.350
they are fixed in location, relative to the
retina, your brain tunes them out completely

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.500
and you don’t consciously perceive them.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.870
The reason the floating specs never seem to
stay still is because floaters, being suspended

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.450
in the vitreous humor, move when your eye
moves.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.980
So as you try to look at them, they will appear
to drift with your eye movement.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.710
• The reason you can see floaters better
when looking at, for instance, a bright blue

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.450
sky, is because your pupils contract to a
very small size, thus reducing the aperture,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.370
which in turn makes floaters more apparent
and focused.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.280
• If you ever see a ton of floaters appear
out of no where, possibly with some light

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.190
flashes, you should get to an eye doctor immediately.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.070
There is a chance (1 in 7) that your retina
is about to detach from the back of your eye.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.120
If that happens, you have very little time
to get it fixed before it effectively dies

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.850
and you go blind in that eye.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.650
• “Light flashes” not caused by actual
light, also known as photopsia, will often

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.960
occur when the photoreceptors in the retina
receive stimulation from being touched or

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.420
from being torn.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.330
This produces an electrical impulse to your
brain, which your brain more or less interprets

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.700
as a light flash.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.960
This physical stimulation is often caused
when traction is being applied while the vitreous

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.970
detachment is taking place.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.410
The flashes should subside when the vitreous
finally detaches.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.740
These flashes will also often temporarily
occur when you get a sharp blow to the head.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.690
The sudden jarring causes pressure on the
retina; this in turn creates an electrical

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.800
impulse to the brain which the brain interprets
as a flash.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.220
Yet another potential cause of these flashes
is with migraine headaches.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.069
• Surgeries do exist for getting rid of
eye floaters, if they seriously hamper your

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.069
vision.

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:14.120
This is typically done by replacing the gel-like
substance in your eye with a saline liquid.
