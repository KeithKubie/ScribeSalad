00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:01.745
Voiceover: We've now thought a lot about

00:00:01.745 --> 00:00:03.139
the orange juice market,

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:05.012
at least at a firm-specific level

00:00:05.012 --> 00:00:06.211
within the last few videos.

00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:08.736
We talked about what
our average total costs

00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:10.072
and average variable costs

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:11.996
and marginal costs are,

00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:15.073
if we are running an orange
juice making business.

00:00:15.073 --> 00:00:16.619
Now let's think about what happens

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.877
at the market level.

00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:18.736
We're going to go back

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:20.076
to some of what we've
thought about in the past

00:00:20.076 --> 00:00:22.848
in terms of just supply and demand curves.

00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:26.080
This is the orange juice,

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:28.728
orange juice market,

00:00:29.558 --> 00:00:33.713
and let's just draw some
supply and demand curves

00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:34.375
right over here.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:36.098
This is going to be,

00:00:36.528 --> 00:00:38.811
this is going to be the price per gallon,

00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:43.875
price per gallon,

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:46.514
and let's say that this
right over here is $1.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.689
This right over here is 50 cents,

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:52.368
and this is 0,

00:00:53.537 --> 00:00:56.140
and let's say that this is the quantity,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.736
quantity,

00:00:57.736 --> 00:01:00.336
quantity in gallons per week,

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:02.139
and gallons per week.

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:03.479
We're going to talk about the entire

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:04.378
orange juice market,

00:01:04.378 --> 00:01:06.939
so this is going to be in
millions of gallons per week.

00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:13.418
Millions of gallons per week,

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:15.740
per week.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:24.741
That is, let's say this
is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:26.128
Let's just say, and I'm
going to simplify it

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:28.348
relative to what we saw in the last video.

00:01:28.348 --> 00:01:30.192
Let's just say that the supply curve

00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:31.923
for the orange juice market,

00:01:31.923 --> 00:01:32.964
and I'll be careful this time.

00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:34.907
This is the near-term supply curve,

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:36.645
or the short-term supply curve,

00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:37.802
looks like,

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:39.630
looks something like this.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.754
that is the supply curve.

00:01:41.754 --> 00:01:43.164
This is the entire market.

00:01:43.164 --> 00:01:44.810
These are all of the
orange juice producers.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.664
So to get them to produce
even that first gallon,

00:01:47.664 --> 00:01:49.277
it looks like they need about 20 cents

00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:50.372
for that first gallon,

00:01:50.372 --> 00:01:51.737
and then each incremental gallon,

00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:52.973
they need more and more money.

00:01:52.973 --> 00:01:55.212
The marginal cost of
that incremental gallon

00:01:55.212 --> 00:01:56.287
and for the market as a whole

00:01:56.287 --> 00:01:57.794
is going higher and higher and higher.

00:01:57.794 --> 00:01:59.367
They have to get oranges from futher away

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:01.663
and transport them further and further.

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:03.687
This right over here is the supply curve,

00:02:03.687 --> 00:02:06.160
or you could view it as the marginal cost,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.540
marginal cost curve.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.677
Now let's just draw an
arbitrary demand curve here.

00:02:12.138 --> 00:02:13.170
The demand curve,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.145
let's say it looks something like this.

00:02:15.805 --> 00:02:17.712
Let's say that's our current demand,

00:02:18.142 --> 00:02:20.524
that is our current demand curve,

00:02:20.524 --> 00:02:22.537
and then what I'm going to add to this

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:26.380
is I'm going to add the
price at which firms,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.803
the suppliers of the orange juice make

00:02:28.803 --> 00:02:31.229
are neutral with returns
to economic profit,

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.473
or when economic profit is equal to 0.

00:02:34.473 --> 00:02:35.894
Let's say right over here,

00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:38.221
which happens to be our
current equilibrium price,

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:40.226
this is the price,

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.975
so 50 cents per gallon,

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:45.076
this is the price at which
economic profit is 0.

00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:50.999
so I'll just write economic
profit is equal to 0.

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:51.999
I want to remind you,

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:53.939
economic profit being 0

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.204
does not mean that the
accounting profit is 0.

00:02:56.204 --> 00:02:58.526
People could be making
money at this price,

00:02:58.526 --> 00:03:00.104
it just says that they're neutral

00:03:00.104 --> 00:03:02.127
whether or not they should
be doing this business.

00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:03.746
That the amount of money
that they're making

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:06.277
is roughly comparable to
their opportunity cost

00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:09.145
to be doing other things.

00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:11.113
When I say economic profit is 0,

00:03:11.113 --> 00:03:13.028
sometimes that's called the normal profit,

00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:14.686
when economic profit is 0.

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:16.415
This is the price at
which people are neutral

00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:18.281
between shutting down and starting up

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:18.841
their business.

00:03:18.841 --> 00:03:20.555
If you have positive economic profit,

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:21.968
that means that more people

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:23.345
will want to go into this market

00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:25.130
and if you have negative economic profit,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.076
that means that people
are going to want to

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:29.326
essentially use up their fixed expenses,

00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:30.071
their equipment

00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:31.659
and any labor contracts they might have

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.209
and then go out of business.

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.561
This is where,

00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:36.555
this is that point right over there.

00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:38.848
Now let's think of a couple of scenarios.

00:03:38.848 --> 00:03:41.859
Let's say a research paper comes out

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.377
and in that research paper,

00:03:43.377 --> 00:03:44.169
for whatever reason,

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.405
we don't know if it
was well-done research.

00:03:45.405 --> 00:03:47.325
It says oranges are bad for you,

00:03:47.325 --> 00:03:48.708
for whatever reason.

00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:50.298
When the research paper comes out

00:03:50.298 --> 00:03:51.725
and says oranges are bad for you,

00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:53.144
what happens to demand?

00:03:53.144 --> 00:03:54.205
Well, at any given price,

00:03:54.205 --> 00:03:56.153
demand will go down.

00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:56.980
At any given price,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.165
demand will go down,

00:03:58.165 --> 00:04:00.155
and the new demand curve might look

00:04:00.155 --> 00:04:01.769
something like this.

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.168
Now, in the near term,

00:04:03.168 --> 00:04:04.944
we have a new equilibrium price,

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.741
and we have a new equilibrium quanitity.

00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:08.552
This was the old equilibrium price,

00:04:08.552 --> 00:04:10.020
the way I set that up,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.557
it just happened to be the price

00:04:11.557 --> 00:04:13.261
at which economic profit is 0,

00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:15.409
and this was our old equilibrium quantity,

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.541
a little over 3 million gallons a week.

00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:20.164
Now we have a new,
lower equilibrium price.

00:04:20.164 --> 00:04:22.229
We have a new lower equilibrium price.

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.540
I don't know, this looks
about 40 cents per gallon,

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.853
and we have a new lower
equilibrium quantity.

00:04:28.853 --> 00:04:31.040
Now, what happens at this price?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.950
Obviously in the near term,

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.330
people are willing to produce there

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.140
because that's where
their marginal cost is,

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.030
so, as we saw in multiple videos

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.074
that someone's willing to produce

00:04:40.074 --> 00:04:42.272
when the price is equal
to their marginal cost,

00:04:42.272 --> 00:04:44.187
or they're willing to
produce a quantity up to

00:04:44.187 --> 00:04:46.550
when their marginal cost is equal to

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.676
the marginal revenue,

00:04:47.676 --> 00:04:49.966
or the price that they're going to get.

00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:51.155
But, I just said

00:04:51.155 --> 00:04:52.733
that they need to be
getting 50 cents a gallon

00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:54.732
in order to make an economic profit.

00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:55.671
Now if they get, I don't know,

00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:57.508
this looks like about 40 cents a gallon,

00:04:57.508 --> 00:05:00.118
they're going to be
having an economic loss.

00:05:00.118 --> 00:05:01.853
So no profit.

00:05:02.422 --> 00:05:03.840
No profit there.

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:05.875
If there's no profit there,

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:07.905
it really doesn't make
sense for them to continue,

00:05:07.905 --> 00:05:09.603
or at least it doesn't
make sense for all of them

00:05:09.603 --> 00:05:11.687
to continue in that business.

00:05:11.687 --> 00:05:15.183
What's going to happen is that over time,

00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:17.044
it will make sense for
them in the near term

00:05:17.044 --> 00:05:18.534
to produce, to use up,

00:05:18.534 --> 00:05:19.829
they've already put in their cost

00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:20.671
for their equipment

00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:22.959
and maybe labor contracts
and whatever else.

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:25.535
But over time, when prices are this low,

00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:27.530
as people use up their equipment,

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.689
there's no incentive for
them to buy new equipment.

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:30.869
As the labor contracts expire,

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:32.367
there's no incentive for them to renew

00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:33.190
the labor contract.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.512
As those things expire,

00:05:34.512 --> 00:05:36.677
they're just going to
shut down the business.

00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:38.848
So as they shut down the business,

00:05:38.848 --> 00:05:40.430
as they shut down the business,

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.716
two things will happen.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.514
Quantity produced in
the market will go down,

00:05:43.514 --> 00:05:45.019
and the price will go up.

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:48.117
We will essentially move along this curve

00:05:48.117 --> 00:05:49.631
until we get to this point.

00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.451
That's the point,

00:05:50.451 --> 00:05:52.875
once the price is at 50
cents a gallon again,

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:54.205
then people are neutral now.

00:05:54.205 --> 00:05:56.700
They're not going to
shut down their firms.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.039
We're going to get to
this new equilibrium price

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.935
and equilibrium quantity in the long term,

00:06:02.935 --> 00:06:04.373
in the long term.

00:06:04.373 --> 00:06:06.373
Now let's think of another situation.

00:06:06.373 --> 00:06:07.835
Instead of a newspaper report

00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:09.204
saying that oranges are bad,

00:06:09.204 --> 00:06:10.828
let's say a newspaper report comes out

00:06:10.828 --> 00:06:12.680
saying oranges are very good.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.151
They make you live longer.

00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:16.113
They are the best thing that you can have.

00:06:16.113 --> 00:06:18.199
Well, then, at any given price,

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.128
you're going to have more demand,

00:06:20.128 --> 00:06:21.690
and so you'd have a demand curve

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.815
that looks something like that.

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:26.733
Then, you'd have a higher
equilibrium quantity,

00:06:26.733 --> 00:06:29.331
and a higher equilibrium price.

00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:30.929
And, people are going to be making,

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:32.381
since the price is higher,

00:06:32.381 --> 00:06:35.751
than the price at which
the economic profit is 0,

00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:36.737
people are going to be making

00:06:36.737 --> 00:06:38.583
very positive economic profits,

00:06:38.583 --> 00:06:41.093
which means that there's
a strong incentive,

00:06:41.093 --> 00:06:42.112
that people are neutral between

00:06:42.112 --> 00:06:43.299
shutting down the business

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:44.535
or starting up the business.

00:06:44.535 --> 00:06:45.410
At that point,

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.378
a lot of people are strongly motivated

00:06:48.378 --> 00:06:49.963
to enter into the business.

00:06:49.963 --> 00:06:51.223
What's going to happen is,

00:06:51.223 --> 00:06:52.529
more and more people are going to

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:54.100
get more and more equipment,

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.154
hire more and more people,

00:06:55.154 --> 00:06:56.149
and as they do that,

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:57.858
quantity is going to go up,

00:06:57.858 --> 00:07:00.873
and the price is going to go down.

00:07:00.873 --> 00:07:02.187
And so, over the long term,

00:07:02.187 --> 00:07:04.144
you're going to shift back to this line.

00:07:04.144 --> 00:07:05.731
Once the price gets down to that,

00:07:05.731 --> 00:07:08.039
then there's no reason
for more people to enter.

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:09.852
They're kind of neutral about it.

00:07:09.852 --> 00:07:12.064
What you see happening
is in the short term,

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:13.843
you would look at where the demand curve

00:07:13.843 --> 00:07:16.100
intersects with the
short-term supply curve,

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.342
but in the long term,

00:07:17.342 --> 00:07:19.245
you care where it intersects with this

00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:20.736
kind of horizontal line,

00:07:20.736 --> 00:07:24.687
which is the price at
which economic profit is 0.

00:07:24.687 --> 00:07:26.618
That's why you will hear,

00:07:26.618 --> 00:07:27.805
and this is kind of a more precise way

00:07:27.805 --> 00:07:29.383
of thinking about it than we've done

00:07:29.383 --> 00:07:30.533
in the previous videos,

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.740
this horizontal line right over here,

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.183
you could view this as the long run,

00:07:35.183 --> 00:07:37.182
the long run,

00:07:37.182 --> 00:07:39.936
long run supply curve,

00:07:39.936 --> 00:07:41.526
long run supply curve.

00:07:41.526 --> 00:07:43.158
That says look,

00:07:43.158 --> 00:07:45.421
pretty much whatever
we will always produce

00:07:45.421 --> 00:07:46.813
over the long run,

00:07:46.813 --> 00:07:48.638
we will always produce whatever supply

00:07:48.638 --> 00:07:50.070
is kind of necessary,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.806
given that people are neutral

00:07:51.806 --> 00:07:54.013
when it comes to economic profit.

00:07:54.013 --> 00:07:55.203
You go down here,

00:07:55.203 --> 00:07:57.547
yes, people will try to
use up their fixed costs,

00:07:57.547 --> 00:07:59.686
but once they used up their fixed costs,

00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:01.615
no incentive for them to stay in business,

00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:03.325
then some of them go out of business.

00:08:03.325 --> 00:08:03.945
Price goes up,

00:08:03.945 --> 00:08:04.691
quantity goes down.

00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:07.561
You get back to the long run supply curve,

00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:09.533
where that intersects
with the demand curve,

00:08:09.533 --> 00:08:10.942
or if the opposite happens.

00:08:10.942 --> 00:08:12.039
A lot of economic profit,

00:08:12.039 --> 00:08:13.270
a lot of entrance into the market,

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.363
price goes down, supply goes up.

00:08:15.363 --> 00:08:18.394
You get back to the long run supply curve.

00:08:18.394 --> 00:08:19.195
I guess you could say,

00:08:19.195 --> 00:08:21.196
you could go back to
where the new demand curve

00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:24.668
is intersecting the long run supply curve.
