00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:12.096
&gt;&gt;Karina: I'm going to ask a few of
you to share personal self evaluation

00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:13.766
of your technique in the craft.

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.856
&gt;&gt;Lilia: In general, I'd like
to have greater contrasts,

00:00:15.906 --> 00:00:17.716
clearer lines, darker lines.

00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:22.916
&gt;&gt;Cristina: Our role as teachers in
the arts is to help the students move

00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:26.696
from dependent learners
to independent learners.

00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:30.646
And that very naturally
translates to them being able

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:32.606
to critically assess their own work.

00:00:41.396 --> 00:00:44.046
&gt;&gt;Cindy: Students are attracted
to the school to study the arts.

00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:46.386
They're starting to understand the arts,

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:49.296
understand themselves,
it's very motivating.

00:00:49.636 --> 00:00:51.416
That's what the arts
brings to the learners.

00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:53.336
&gt;&gt;Karina: Lay out your prints.

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:55.466
Let's try to pick the
strongest one in the bunch.

00:00:56.196 --> 00:01:00.676
&gt;&gt;My goal is to get students to a
place where they can self appraise

00:01:00.676 --> 00:01:03.286
and self evaluate their work
in terms of its strengths,

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:05.326
and aspects that need improvement.

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:09.086
But to be able to do that in a way they
can sort of envision the solutions,

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:13.986
and until they can do that, they're
always going to rely on outside voices.

00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:16.466
&gt;&gt;Now the learning, again,
might just be an affirmation

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.746
of what you had been thinking,
it's just got confirmed.

00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:23.416
&gt;&gt;Cristina: We take that whole process
of assessing their own production

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.916
and we break it down into steps.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:30.276
&gt;&gt;Karina: I want to bring up a couple
of prints that former students have done

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:33.126
and a couple of mine working with
this intaglio drag point method.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:36.126
&gt;&gt;Cristina: Students need to
see examples of great work.

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:41.416
And then the teacher has an
obligation to be able to speak

00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:43.156
to what makes that work so great.

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:47.676
&gt;&gt;Karina: You're looking for
actually fuzzy, black, hazy line.

00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:50.996
&gt;&gt;Bringing in a few of my prints,
and a few college level prints

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:55.146
that approach this project shows
them physically what the quality

00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:56.676
of the final print should be.

00:01:56.676 --> 00:02:00.266
&gt;&gt;Seem to get this beautiful rich,
I think just gorgeous blacks.

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:01.146
These awesome--

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:04.056
&gt;&gt;Cristina: That's the first
component, is breaking down what it is

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:07.526
that makes a work great, and then
beginning to provide students

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:11.316
with a vocabulary so they can access
that material in different ways.

00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:14.246
&gt;&gt;Karina: You guys know that if
you say, "I like it, it's cool,"

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:15.526
what's the next thing I'm going to say?

00:02:15.746 --> 00:02:17.266
&gt;&gt;Student: What about it
is nice and what's cool?

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:18.816
&gt;&gt;Karina: What about it
is nice and what's cool?

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:20.556
So I'm going to ask you to substantiate.

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:23.236
&gt;&gt;Lilia: You really get
focused on vocabulary

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:26.236
and making sure you have those words,
so that when you go into a critique,

00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:31.396
you can not just say, "Oh, this
is kind of shady and strange."

00:02:31.396 --> 00:02:34.056
You can be like, "Oh, this
is very nice contrast."

00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:35.516
&gt;&gt;Karina: Why did you pick this one?

00:02:35.616 --> 00:02:35.966
&gt;&gt;Student: It's darker.

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:37.356
&gt;&gt;Karina: And?

00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:39.106
&gt;&gt;Student: It's clean as well.

00:02:39.436 --> 00:02:42.136
&gt;&gt;Cristina: We begin with
very fundamental vocabulary,

00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:44.666
so that by the time we
get to this point,

00:02:45.026 --> 00:02:47.066
their ability to verbally articulate

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:50.516
around their work comes more
naturally to the students.

00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:51.886
&gt;&gt;Karina: Why do you do critique?

00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:55.826
&gt;&gt;Student: Because you learn through
error and not through success.

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:56.906
&gt;&gt;Karina: Fabulous.

00:02:57.396 --> 00:03:02.426
&gt;&gt;As students are gaining an ability
to self assess, one crucial thing is

00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:06.406
to give each student a chance
to give constructive feedback.

00:03:06.856 --> 00:03:10.066
The Post-It note critique is a
way of having them all involved

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:11.806
and giving response to
everybody's piece.

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:16.196
They've all now responded to, let's say,
ten other people's works when they put

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.556
up the Post-It notes,
so they're exercising,

00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:21.536
even if they're not verbalizing
those comments.

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:24.666
&gt;&gt;Lilia: It's a really good
opportunity to get really good feedback.

00:03:24.846 --> 00:03:28.146
And when you can see patterns of
what is successful and unsuccessful

00:03:28.146 --> 00:03:30.746
in somebody else's work, you
can then apply it to your work.

00:03:32.396 --> 00:03:37.446
&gt;&gt;From my sticky notes, I got a
lot of "childish" and "exciting."

00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:42.336
SO I think I definitely got the
childlike presence that I wanted in it.

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:45.956
&gt;&gt;Karina: You help them bit by bit,
thought by thought, to get to a point

00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:49.066
of balanced self assessment,
where they know

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:51.846
where things lack or
need more adjustment.

00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:54.846
They can anticipate some of
these corrections on their own.

00:03:54.946 --> 00:03:58.056
&gt;&gt;Lilia: In terms of
improvement, I would have liked

00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:00.586
to get a greater sense
of its abandonment.

00:04:00.946 --> 00:04:03.566
&gt;&gt;Karina: Because at some point, some
of the students might just start to rely

00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:05.776
on themselves and their own
intuition and to trust that.

00:04:06.036 --> 00:04:07.456
So I think they're honing those skills.

00:04:08.366 --> 00:04:12.676
&gt;&gt;Cristina: The power of arts education
is that the student and teacher begin

00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:16.696
to recognize that every
student artist is unique,

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:18.976
and cultivate that student voice.

00:04:19.186 --> 00:04:21.866
I think it's a very powerful
tool for learning.
