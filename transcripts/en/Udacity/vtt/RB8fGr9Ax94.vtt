00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.875
So I actually read the Eyre Affair already, but it was really fantastic and I

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:08.354
want to read the SQL. So instead of deleting the Eyre Affair, I want to put

00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:13.124
the SQL, Lost in a Good Book, on my list in place of the Eyre Affair. What

00:00:13.124 --> 00:00:17.110
method should I use to replace the Eyre Affair with Lost in a Good Book?
