00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.360
Hello, I'm Hank Green!
Welcome to Crash Course Chemistry.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.920
Last time we left off with Mendeleev believing he had discovered a cosmic, mystic reality about the world,

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.990
but in fact he had discovered the effects
of his worst enemy: tiny invisible particles.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.020
Electrons, which are so marvelous and peculiar that it wasn't until 80 years after Mendeleev's 1st periodic table

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.980
that they were really understood by anyone and to this day still very, very few people understand them.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.160
But in like 10 minutes from now, if all goes according to plan, you will be one of those people. So let's do this.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.740
[Theme Music]

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.180
In 1865, before Mendeleev published his first
periodic table,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.660
a young chemist, and activist, John Newlands
published a paper on the periodicity of elements,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.979
comparing their repetition, at least the first
two rows of it, to a musical scale.

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.699
All do re me fa so la ti do and stuff.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.800
Maybe, he theorized, lithium was just sodium
but an octave higher.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.480
Maybe they were, in a sense, the same note.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.920
He delivered this idea to the Royal Academy, the most prestigious group of scientists in the world,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.040
and they basically laughed him off the stage.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.380
"Music is art and chemistry is science.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.980
Now describing science in an artistic way
might be a fine parlor trick for helping little

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.750
babies or women understand the work you do
but they have no place in the Royal Academy."

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.110
That's my impression.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.800
But there was no way of course of knowing
that it turns out John Newlands,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.550
when it came to the actual, functional, physical
reality behind the periodicity of elements,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.690
was more right than any of the scientists
who laughed him off the stage that day.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.880
And he never got to find out how right he
was.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.760
We didn't discover that his analogies were
barely analogies until long after his death,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.860
but it turns out that reality is like a kind
of music.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.520
And maybe you want to laugh me off the stage
right now but bear with me.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.260
Before quantum mechanics, scientists envisioned the atomic world as just a miniature macroscopic world.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.480
Electrons seemed to just be particles orbiting
around a nucleus.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.160
In fact, there was a great Dane...no Nick...other
kind of Dane... Niels Bohr, yes.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.860
Like certain other people I might name,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.420
he sometimes felt like he was in the shadow of his older, more successful brother, an Olympic soccer player,

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.989
while Niels' handwriting was so poor that
he had to dictate his PhD thesis to his mom

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.730
Nevertheless, he was an ingenious physicist.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.680
Now, you might remember a couple
of episodes back,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.739
when John Dalton determined that elements
only exist in discrete packets of matter.

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.139
Well, by Bohr's time the same thing was known
for the energy given off by electrons.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.020
That energy only came off in what ended up
being called "quanta" which is the root of the term
"quantum mechanics."

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.659
In 1913, Niels Bohr came up with a simple
model for describing these energy levels

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:52.049
for a single electron in hydrogen merely assuming
circular orbits.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.859
So there is some truth to the framework of
thinking of electrons as particles.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.900
However, when he or anyone else tried to apply this to more complicated atoms, they failed miserably.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.820
Long story short, electrons don't really behave like particles; they're better described as waves.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.260
So we've known for, like, fifty years that this is a an entirely inaccurate way of visualizing an atom.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.240
Nuclei, yeah, you can think of them as solid particles but not electrons. Electrons are wave-particle dualities.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.800
I think of them like resonance in the universe.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.550
And just like a single string producing multiple
notes on a guitar,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.570
an electron can exist in a number of different
harmonics.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.010
This isn't an analogy either, quantum physicists
actually talk about the harmonics of electrons.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.019
After a few years of trying to figure this
stuff out,

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.779
a couple of very smart physicists started
to look at electrons as waves, standing waves.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.900
This makes a lot of sense, even to us lay
guys.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.669
When you swing a telephone chord in a straight
line there are a discrete numbers of nodes,

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:55.400
depending on the tension and the frequency, or in better physics terms, "energy", you put into the system.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.980
The same thing happens to an electron
around a nucleus;

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.200
a standing wave is produced only at certain energy levels.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.640
Anything in between is not allowed.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.430
An Austrian physicist, Erwin Schrodinger,
who you may have heard of because of his cat,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.059
is the first guy who developed a mathematical model where the electron was assumed to be a standing wave.

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:17.880
Now, it is time to move a little bit into
the realm of metaphor here

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.700
because I'm gonna tell you how I think, how I think of electron shells and orbitals, not really how they are.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.880
The music of electrons is not simple music.
It's no three chord song;

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.060
it's like Beethoven but with more rules, hard
fast rules that can't be broken.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.440
In that way, at least, it's more science than
art.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.160
Electrons exist in orbitals a bit like the
individual notes on a keyboard.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.640
But the orbital's tone isn't complete until it has two electrons in it, and orbitals exist in shells.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.220
The first shell just has a single orbital,
an s-orbital, which can only fit two electrons.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.130
That's why the row of our periodic table only
has two elements.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.380
They play simple song those two and a song
that every other element will build upon.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.120
The second electron shell is physically larger
and thus can include more than just the s-orbital.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.980
A second sort of orbital with three different
configurations is added, the p-orbital.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.540
Instead of just being a single tone, the p-orbital
is more like a 3 part harmony with 2 electrons

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.830
in each part for a total of 6.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.240
Those 6 electrons of the p-orbital plus the 2 s-electrons are the eight electrons referred to in the octet rule:

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.620
the desire for most of the lighter elements to have 8 electrons in their outer shell, just like a musical scale.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.780
This is often described in terms of fullness or satiation, as if the atoms are devouring electrons.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.200
But I prefer to think of an incomplete electron
configuration as a cacophonous symphony

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.240
playing in different keys and at different
tempos.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.560
And the closer you are to harmony the worse it is, until one final note chimes in, that eighth note

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.010
and everything crisps into full resolution
a deep, complex tone emerges,

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.340
and the atom settles into complete harmony,
the harmony of the noble gases.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.050
That's just how I think of it.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.710
And just like with music, there's a bit of
notation to learn as well.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.130
It's important to know how to write out what
we call "electron configurations,"

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.300
a condensed way of showing exactly where all
of an atoms electrons are.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.620
First, we write the number of the shell, then the letter of the orbital, then the number of electrons in that orbital,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.060
and repeat until we run out of electrons.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.960
So for hydrogen, with just one electron it's
1s1. For fluorine it's 1s2 2s2 2p5.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.940
Now as we move to the third row, an interesting
thing happens;

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.360
the third shell adds a third kind of orbital: the five part harmony, with ten electrons, of the d-orbital.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.700
But you might be saying, "There's still only
eight elements in the third row.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.320
What's up with that, Hank?
It's all lies, I'm leaving!"

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.920
OK calm down, the atomic symphony composes
itself in peculiar ways.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.340
Because building the 3d orbital requires a
lot of energy,

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:48.740
electrons actually go into the s-orbital of the fourth shell, 4s, before going into the third shell's d-orbital.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.960
This is actually a trend that continues, and to remember it just write out the following on a piece of paper --

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.360
these are the orbitals we know and all the
shells that we've seen exist.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.540
To figure out what order to fill them in,
you just draw a diagonal line from the top right
to the bottom left as you go.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:13.860
So 1s first, then 2s, then 2p 3s, then 3p
4s, 3d 4p 5s, 4d 5p 6s, and so on.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.840
Armed with this knowledge you could write out the electron configuration for pretty much any element on the table.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:26.980
Iron, number twenty-six, would be 1s2 2s2
2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d6.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:32.960
Now there are a couple of elements that have weird electron shells, but you can just look it up on Google.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.220
An interesting thing about d-orbitals, and
the even bigger, more electron rich f-orbitals,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:43.160
is they don't really need to be filled quite
as much as the s and p's,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.100
because they're literally shielded beneath
the s-orbitals of the next shell.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:53.160
The s and p-orbitals I think of kinda like the trumpets and violins: it's really terrible when they sound bad,

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.080
but the base notes, deep and rich, hide a
bit underneath the rest of the orchestra,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.920
just like the d-orbitals literally hide underneath the
s-orbitals that have already filled above them.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.400
Yes these incomplete orbitals affect them,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.710
but because their shielded, these middle of
the chart elements are generally less reactive

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.070
and happier to bump electrons along from atom
to atom making them conductive,

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:18.260
or just hanging out together in big masses
of electron-sharing lumps of metal.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.200
So why are orbitals useful when it comes to
understanding how an atom is likely to react?

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.970
Well first, it really matters how much energy
is required to remove an electron from an

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.380
atom to form a positively charged ion.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.099
This energy is called "ionization energy."

00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:36.500
If there are several electrons being removed
this is a step-wise process,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.479
starting with the electron at the highest
energy level, or the outermost one.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.680
Since the outermost electron has the highest energy, there's the least energy necessary to remove it.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.100
More energy is needed to remove the second
furthest one out and so on.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.250
And of course when all the electrons in the
outermost shell are removed

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:55.620
there is a really large energy jump necessary to remove an electron from the next shell down

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.360
because that shell will be isoelectrically
analogous to a noble gas.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.700
Just like how atoms are isotopically the same when they have the same number of protons and neutrons,

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.260
atoms are isoelectrically the same when they
have the same number of electrons.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:12.960
And just like there's energy associated with removing an electron to form cations, or positively charged ions,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.640
there's energy associated with adding electrons,

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.340
usually to fill an orbital to achieve a stable
two or eight electron shell configuration.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.760
Just like with the ionization energy there's a discrete energy jump involved with the adding of an electron.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.840
That energy is called "electron affinity."

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.040
Now, you ready for the real mind melter? If
you're following along in your periodic table,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.580
which of course you aren't,

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.860
you may have noticed a little something interesting.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:40.500
On the left-hand side you have your s-orbitals
-- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven s.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.840
In the middle, you got your d's: 3d, 4d, 5d,
6d.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.520
And on the top right, 2p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 6p.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.840
And below of course, in the little island of the lanthanides and actinides, your f-orbitals: 4f and 5f.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.040
And so, with just a glance at your periodic
table you can work out electron configurations

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.320
and elemental stability and the fundamental,
physical reality of the elements.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.540
That's why this thing is so beautiful to me,

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.180
because when you get to know it, you see all
those flawed, competing harmonies,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.660
and the actions and reactions that occur because
of them,

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:19.420
changing their song into something more stable and powerful and eternal together, making everything.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:25.700
Now as I've gone through today's episode I've described electrons mostly in musical terms as vibrating waves,

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.920
harmonies in the fabric of the universe and
that's, indeed, how I like to think about them,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.800
but of course, that isn't a complete story.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.960
And I have gotten sick of people telling me
that the human brain is incapable of imagining
the reality of the subatomic.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:46.160
So I'm actually just going to serve a big
heaping pile of reality on you right now no matter how odd it turns out to be.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.400
There are, a number of everywhere-permeating
fields in our universe.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.779
One of those, is the electron field.

00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:57.460
In order for an electron to exist, there has
to be an excitation of the electron field

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:03.600
and we can describe those excitations as waves, just as a wave in the ocean is an excitation of the water.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.740
At any given moment, the electron can be anywhere
within the function of the wave.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:13.780
But waves are defined not by harsh boundaries, instead they're strong in some areas and weak in others.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.520
The strength of the wave at one certain point
in space determines

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.720
how likely it is that you will find an electron
there at any given time if you measure.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.940
And so if we're trying to understand reality,

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.920
we should not think of electrons as circling around the nucleus of an atom, like planets around a star,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:33.300
but instead as an excitation around the nucleus,
and the shape of that excitation is the orbital.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.080
Orbitals are precisely the reason that everything
exists.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.400
They are the root, and the key, and the nexus,
and the crux, and the keystone,

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.240
and every other metaphor of not just chemistry
but existence.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.280
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry. I hope it blew your mind.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.060
If you were paying attention you now know
about a poor young man who was laughed out

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:58.940
of a meeting of snotty scientists because of being far more correct then anyone could ever have imagined.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.600
About a great Dane whose incorrect model of
the atom was pretty amazing anyway.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.650
About electrons as music, and electron shells
and the orbitals they contain.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:12.260
How to write out electron configurations, what ionization energies and electron affinities are,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.000
and how the periodic table ties all of these
realities together.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.220
And with all that knowledge now in your head, you know more then 99.9% of the world about electrons.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.050
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by myself,

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:30.180
filmed and directed by Michael Aranda, who is also our sound designer, and edited by Nick Jenkins.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.760
The script was edited by Blake de Pastino
an Dr. Heiko Langner.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.840
Katherine Green was our script supervisor
and our graphics team is Thought Cafe.
