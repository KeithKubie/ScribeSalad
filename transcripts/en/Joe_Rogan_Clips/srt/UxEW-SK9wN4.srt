1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,390
Yeah. And I mean like I like
Tyron was man, there's a,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,050
there's this thing too where you,
you get to a point where you have to,

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,600
you're the guy who has to provide,

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,880
you're the guy who has
to hold up and it's not,

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,560
not necessarily people saying
you have to do it or you,

6
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:20,370
you feel that sense of responsibility,
you know? And, and in, in my family I,

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,060
I felt that I feel that
sense of responsibility.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,260
Like there's one that your family when
you were growing up. Yeah. And you know,

9
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,460
like I like when I say I
come from humble beginnings,

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,150
your like being raised in Nigeria like,

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,540
and it wasn't like the village
village where we lived in huts.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,950
We had a house but it wasn't really,
we didn't have plumbing, you know,

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,420
we had to go to the well or get water.
We electricity was rare.

14
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,880
That's a scarce thing,
you know?

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,600
And it's where we,
even when we came here,

16
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,970
when we immigrated here
yet life got a lot better.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,140
How old were you when you came here?

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,450
About eight years old and it was
hard to adjust to the school system,

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,050
you know, because kids
were kids. Kids are mean.

20
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,320
I haven't talked with the funny
accent and kids would tell you, hey,

21
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:09,990
why don't you say this to the
teachers? Hey, hey bitch, call her.

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,590
And I was always in the principal's office
because I had no idea what that means

23
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,910
and things like that. So the kids
are cruel. I had dealt with all that.

24
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,920
You know in English when you came here.
Yeah,

25
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:22,260
we spoke English but it pigeon English.

26
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:25,710
So we knew that in all were
colonized by the European.

27
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,930
So the English is the
word root of the words.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,830
Root words aren't from the European.
So we knew English,

29
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,210
but it's just our take on it.
Uh,

30
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,850
and so how much different is pretty
different? It's very different.

31
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:41,910
Like if I was talking with another
Nigerian, I was speaking patient English,

32
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,370
you would pick out words,
but it's a little different.

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,350
But can you say something in pigeon
English? Yeah. And like I said, nothing.

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,700
I right now we just sit down here
just talking to you. You're not,

35
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:54,610
so she's down just to talk just
a [inaudible] not be any tea.

36
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,060
That's how I was. Cool. Yeah, it does.

37
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,340
It if like me and Israel out of Tonya was
talking like it, it'll be mad cool. Oh,

38
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:06,960
right, right, right. Like we speak it
to each other. So going from that to,

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,010
you know, be in essentially raised and,
and, and going through school. And,

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,590
and one thing that, um, man, I haven't, I
really haven't ever shared with anybody,

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,500
you know, very, very few people know,

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,560
is that my father has been incarcerated
since 2009 and this is the first time

43
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:31,620
really out, um, you know, ever
talked about it like my dad was,

44
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:36,000
um, it goes through a test to just
adjust the system here, man. It's so, so,

45
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,810
so crooked and it's so backwards. Yes,
of course. We're fortunate. Like, ah,

46
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:44,340
there's so many things that we're thankful
for living here in this country that,

47
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:44,671
you know,

48
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:47,520
you can sleep at night in your house and
not worry about somebody breaking in,

49
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:50,700
robbing and killing you,
you know, for the most part.

50
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,930
And to where and we're thankful for that.
We're thankful for the opportunities.

51
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:59,780
But my dad was a businessman and
my dad built one of that, uh,

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,880
uh, a very, very big business in Dallas.

53
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,450
The owned like an ambulance company and

54
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,521
you know,

55
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:13,330
it comes to a certain point where
people just don't want you to be your,

56
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:17,170
you're an immigrant and you're succeeding
in a certain business there where it's

57
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:20,110
kind of like people don't care about it.
People don't want you to be there.

58
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,470
And you know,
I was one of those situations who,

59
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:28,120
where my dad hired the people that he
thought were the right people to do what

60
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:31,540
he didn't know the job to run his company.

61
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,410
While he can tend to a certain things
like us, like his family day to day,

62
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:40,411
different things I cared about to where
they run the company into the ground and

63
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,000
not because my dad was
the owner of the company,

64
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,990
they put it all on him even though
the people that were doing, you know,

65
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,860
the things that were really wrong and
the company admitted to doing the wrong

66
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:58,090
things. But what the court is saying is
that, oh, because you own the company.

67
00:03:58,091 --> 00:04:00,820
So ignorance is,
it's not an excuse.

68
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,360
So because of that we're going
to sentence you to 15 years.

69
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,700
So he got sentenced when
he didn't know crime.

70
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,740
It see the thing is the business again,
it, my dad owned the ambulance company.

71
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,120
An ambulance company.
Yes.

72
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,750
So it was a transportation for
emergency and non emergency. You know,

73
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,780
and one thing that he hired,

74
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,180
these are like the paramedics,

75
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,200
the EMS to run the company because these
people that, that know the business.

76
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,280
So he had people that he
hired from that acquired,

77
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:35,470
he acquired from a different company.
But you know,

78
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,320
one thing that I will say
is my dad's ignorance is,

79
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,010
is he didn't really do as research
well enough on the guys that he hired.

80
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,540
So you hire certain guys and now these
guys are running the business and these

81
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,990
guys are like, yeah, we're gonna make it.

82
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:51,250
We're going to help you
grow this business. Like any
business, man, fuck yeah,

83
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,800
I hired the right people. Yeah.
Help me grow the business.

84
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,660
So now they're helping. He's there
doing that. If he thinks, okay,

85
00:04:58,661 --> 00:04:59,441
I trust these guys.

86
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:04,230
They're taking care of the business and
the the most disappointing heartbreak

87
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:06,670
and thinking about the
businesses. My Dad, they're not,

88
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,190
they're not the one who does the billing,
the billing for the business.

89
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,300
They contract a difference as an
outside company to do the billing.

90
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,020
So it's not them doing it.
So they're doing the runs,

91
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,460
they're sending the notes to them.

92
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,490
This is the runs we did to you guys build
the government or whoever else to pay

93
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:27,310
us. My Dad's the owner. He has people
that are doing all this. He's not,

94
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:28,570
they're running the day to day.

95
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,380
So eventually they go
under investigation on,

96
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,750
we're investigating like I think maybe
like 15 patients or something like that.

97
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,730
I don't know the exact number.

98
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:44,410
I have 15 patients we're investigating
for these runs or whatever that would

99
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,090
build this building on them.

100
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,960
And so they put it all in your
investigation and they're like, okay.

101
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,040
After a while they come back
and they said, all right,

102
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,080
we'll give you your stuff back.
Like, we didn't really see anything,

103
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,350
but we'll give you your stuff back after
they shut it down for a little while.

104
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,530
So damn, now I gotta go back.
So my dad's like, ah, fuck it.

105
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,470
I'm getting out of the business.
They already killed my business for me.

106
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,400
So now I became one of the biggest
company. But you shut down for so long,

107
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:12,470
you've lost in what you've worked for.

108
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:16,130
So now he's getting rid of and getting
out of it. Then they come back later,

109
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,220
few years later for the same
thing that you've already said.

110
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:22,620
You're good here to have your stuff
back. They come back and said, no, we're,

111
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:27,350
we're going to prosecute you for this.
So now those guys,

112
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,620
I, and I've, I've seen it. This is
obviously how the feds work now,

113
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:32,270
those guys that you caught,

114
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:35,450
the EMS and these guys that
were clearly did rose was wrong.

115
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,830
You gave them a deal and say,
hey,

116
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,070
we caught you guys because those guys
started their own company doing the same

117
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:44,810
shit. So they get caught. Now
they're like, okay, we want that guy.

118
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,890
So you guys basically gave
him a deal to say, okay,

119
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:52,040
that guy was in on it and my dad's life,

120
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,010
and I guess they offered my dad a deal,
a plea deal,

121
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,620
which his lawyer didn't really tell him
about because he had a court appointed,

122
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,300
a lawyer, a lawyer. So he said, no,

123
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,410
I didn't do shit wrong. Why would I
take that deal? Which would have been,

124
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:08,960
I think maybe like five years was
the deal or something like that.

125
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,260
What does I know? I didn't do shit
wrong. Why would I take five years?

126
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:17,000
So he goes to trial and broke.
We've seen murderers,

127
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,600
we've seen all these people that are
defraud the government and like start more

128
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:27,740
hedge fund guys. Billions of
dollars get bill. They said no,

129
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:30,590
they wouldn't even grant him bail.
My Dad's a citizen,

130
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,870
like turn over his passport and
everything. They said, Nope,

131
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm not going to give you a bail.
We're going to hold.

132
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:37,670
You want to freeze all your accounts.
You can't really fight the case.

133
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,680
So you're stuck there and now
your family's left with nothing,

134
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,220
with nothing, no money
in the account, nothing.

135
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,750
And so my dad is deal with that and they
just threw the book at him and I'm like,

136
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,250
you know,
we'll give you 15 years.

137
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,230
And this was 2009 and he's
already been in for 10.

138
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,520
He hasn't been in for 10.

139
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:03,110
And one thing that
really killed me was um,

140
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,300
one thing, uh, it was a part,
a part in a trial where, um,

141
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,280
the lawyer would basically telling the
judge like, this guy's an upstanding guy.

142
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,470
No correct curd.
You know,

143
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:18,080
he has kids look at his kids
and how well they're doing.

144
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,490
His older son is in college.
The second one is in college.

145
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,530
The youngest is about to being in college.
These kids are all scholarships,

146
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:29,660
student athletes,
great student athletes.

147
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,190
And the one thing that killed
me was the prosecution was like,

148
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:39,191
the reason that is is because he was
defrauding the government from this money.

149
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,190
That's why they're in
college. And I was like, wait,

150
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,300
my dad is not paying for us to be in
college. We're all student athletes.

151
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,530
We earned these,

152
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,430
we worked hard earned scholarships
as far as to being college.

153
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,450
The defense didn't say that.
They even fucking say like,

154
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,080
you have a court appointed
attorney. I think he did. Yeah, Bro.

155
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,610
My Dad just got railroaded,
man. And it was like,

156
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,310
and it was so heartbreaking
to where you're telling them,

157
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:14,370
man that has raised his family,
raised his kids to, to work hard,

158
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,670
get to a place in life and you're telling
him that the only reason it's there is

159
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:21,780
because he cheated and it was just one
of those things that added a chip on my

160
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:25,740
shoulder at all, man. It,
there've been so many moments,

161
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:29,220
that attitude put chips on my
shoulder with everything that I like.

162
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:33,000
I've been through so much that I just
internalize and I compete with all this

163
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:37,350
energy and so two for that. You,
you telling my dad that? Yeah.

164
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,520
Like you're going to sit down and I just,
and,

165
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:43,620
and obviously of course I researched
more and more into that because I was so

166
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:47,400
heartbroken after that. Like money,
like you just going for what?

167
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:51,700
For how much you're saying not even up
to almost a million. They would, they,

168
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,110
they just piled a lot of money
on. They're like, oh, this,

169
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:58,440
this and that for a little over other
sane little over a million total,

170
00:09:58,441 --> 00:09:59,940
which is nowhere near that.

171
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:05,340
You gave him 15 years when
these guys had fun guys that,

172
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,640
that you found guilty for manipulating
these markets for billions.

173
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,430
You give him six months house arrest if
that and you're saying you're going to

174
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,320
give him 15 years. And I
started researching, I'm like,

175
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:24,321
a lot of these judges have stakes in
these prisons and to what they do is they

176
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,360
give a lot of time because they
get paid per prisoner. That's,

177
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,740
and we know that story about that
guy and um, Pennsylvania who was, uh,

178
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,330
who was a judge and he was doing that.

179
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:37,380
He was sending kids to generally he was
extending their sentences and giving

180
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:39,120
them sentences for nothing.

181
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:42,840
And it turned out he had been getting
paid by the person to seek a lot of them

182
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:43,651
down the river.
Yeah,

183
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:47,400
I heard a lot of them get kickbacks
and different things from that.

184
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:50,880
And so to put people there,
as you become more and more famous,

185
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:54,900
you can shed more and more light on this.
Yeah, man, it's your dad do for parole,

186
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,690
man. I don't, I don't even know. I
think soon listen to this podcast alone.

187
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,750
You talking about this could very well
bring someone forward that wants to help

188
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:10,290
you with the appeal. Yup, man. And my
mom, my dad actually wrote, cause when,

189
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,240
don't know Obama administration,

190
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:15,390
there was that whole clemency
deal when they were doing.

191
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,490
And my dad actually wrote a letter,
actually have that later.

192
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:18,301
I don't know where I put it,

193
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:22,920
but he wrote a letter to him and it
was when I read the letter, man, I, uh,

194
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,210
I can help a cry about it
because my, my dad, um,

195
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,420
it's my dad cares about his family so
much and when I go see my dad because my

196
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:36,870
dad is so proud of me and I'm,
and I'm so proud of him. I mean,

197
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:39,960
he raised us so well and um,

198
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,690
to go see him in there.
And I mean,

199
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:44,820
it's not like he's sitting
in the maximum security,

200
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:48,950
but for someone to tell you that you
can't go home to your family at night for

201
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,780
[inaudible], you've got an ear, you've
got to sleep. When we told you to sleep,

202
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,820
we got it. You got to eat when
we you to eat for 10 years.

203
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:59,710
And when you know I didn't do anything
wrong because I chose to say no,

204
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:02,380
I didn't do anything wrong. I'm not
going to take this sentence you give me.

205
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,730
They say okay fine,

206
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,600
you're going to sit in there for 15 years
and there's nothing you can do about

207
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,770
it. As a man. It broke my heart man.

208
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,230
And then when I think about it some I
just hold the name cause I, you know,

209
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:17,200
I try not to cry about it,
which I'm just like screw it.

210
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,940
I've have different situations that
happen in life. I'm like, you know, but I,

211
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,360
I ate that one up on the shoulder.
I put that chip on his eye.

212
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:27,490
You know what they're going to say that
the reason I'm here that was scholarship

213
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,930
is because my dad, they're saying my
dad got money. A little bit of money.

214
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,250
Are you serious? What about the freaking
hard work that I did to get here?

215
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:41,200
What about all the Times that I sat in
a fricking hotbox my bathroom upstairs

216
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:44,620
with a trash bag on because I knew that
I needed to get a pound off the next day

217
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:48,250
in order to be able to wrestle at this
JV tournament. What about all that,

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,060
you know, that didn't make any
difference, you know, the reason,

219
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:53,530
the only reason it was
there is because of that.

220
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,870
What about all the times my brother ran,

221
00:12:55,871 --> 00:13:00,010
worked hard to make national team when
he was playing soccer or my little

222
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:04,660
brother getting numerous scholarship for
a division one football everywhere like

223
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,160
that. What? So all that put a chip on my
shoulder, Joe, to where it was like, man,

224
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:12,160
I got to succeed at all costs. I
don't, I don't really care. And where,

225
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:15,940
where did this happen? Where was this
trial in Texas and Dallas, Texas.

226
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,720
Not the best place to have
the trial happen, but uh, uh,

227
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,930
it happened in an Amana and
put a sour taste in my mouth,

228
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:29,680
but um, cause he file an
appeal, um, and it follows them.

229
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,900
Peel one time they didn't even look at it,
man.

230
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,290
It was like one of those things where
it's like that judge, they put you there,

231
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:39,360
you're there. That was his domain.
They didn't even look at it like, hmm,

232
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,700
who care?
Cause I feel like you're using the system,

233
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:44,710
you're UFC welterweight champion.

234
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,640
But I think that they treated him like
that because you're an immigrant in the

235
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:53,500
system. Get in there and that's,
you know, and Joe led to wrap that,

236
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,150
put that on.

237
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,020
That's part of what this
next fight symbolizes to me
is the attitude that a lot

238
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:02,860
of people have towards immigrants as
people are forgetting that Americans or

239
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:07,630
immigrants from that conversation, the
last podcast. People are forgetting that.

240
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,110
Yeah.

241
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,890
And to where countries yet to where
people have this attitude towards we're

242
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,470
Americans. Go back to your country,
you know, you know, go back.

243
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:20,170
This is a free country. You
are this and that. People like,

244
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:23,620
I always heard that growing up,
I always heard that and I always I,

245
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:28,000
the more I research, I'm like, what? What
are you talking about? First of all, this,

246
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:32,200
this whole attitude when you walk
into a nail shop, get your hand, feet,

247
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:36,970
nails done. Who, the majority of the
people that run those nail shops, Asians,

248
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,240
I'm not saying all of them in the world,
in the country,

249
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:42,250
but the majority of them in Asians,

250
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,190
but there's a lot of people
that look down all of it. Like,

251
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:49,180
I'm not washing your feet. I'm not
going to do your nails. Nolan's people,

252
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:53,120
I take pride in that because that
provides for them in, they do that,

253
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,980
you know, but people, people condemn
it. That's not a job people want to do.

254
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,370
When you go to these
hotels and certain things,

255
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:04,820
who are the main people that are the maids
that clean up the hotels? A lot of um,

256
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,683
immigrants.

257
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,810
We take pride in them because now we're
in the country in a better place where

258
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:10,160
we can provide for families.

259
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,230
Those are jobs are a lot of people
so called Americans, the whole Colby,

260
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,550
Covington, whole persona
art. Like I'm above that.

261
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,930
I'm above that. That's the
persona. But then at the same time,

262
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:28,010
people now want to cry. All the here
taking our jobs. Let's build a wall.

263
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,430
Let's keep them out. They're taking
our job. No, they're providing,

264
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,290
they're helping this
country get to its height.

265
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,320
The fact that you could come here
and have someone do your nails,

266
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,420
so will clean your
house and wash your car.

267
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:42,050
Someone do all this for you is part
of what makes America so great.

268
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:45,710
One of the greatest nations in
the world and the fact that they,

269
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,950
we want to build a wall. You want to keep
these people out. You can't come here.

270
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,290
You can't bring your culture,
your stuff here.

271
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,120
It just saddens me and it upsets
me as part of what this fight,

272
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,750
when it happens is fight represents
for me because I feel like that's the

273
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:04,280
attitude that this young man has. He's
entitled to, I'm, I should be UFC champ.

274
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,170
You're soy boy.
You know you can't,

275
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:08,690
you don't want dessert or you can't
hang with me. Boy, that's his attitude.

276
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,740
You can't do this boy, first of all,
who's your boy? I'm a grown ass man.

277
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:16,730
Don't fucking talk to me like that.
And that's the attitude that he has.

278
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,020
I'm entitled to this. I mean, I should
be the champion because I am this way.

279
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,800
I'm American. I'm this. And Ah, Bro,

280
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,770
we're all American here.
And so this fight is greater than just,

281
