00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
It's always good to start video off with a bang and there could hardly be an easier way

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.500
of doing that than with this stuff.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.200
What we have here is a contact explosive called nitrogen triiodide.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.400
It's a highly unstable substance
that detonates when disturbed.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.300
Now you might have heard of nitroglycerine which is another kind of contact explosive which goes off when you hit it with a hammer.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.300
but this stuff is in a league of its own. Even something like a mosquito landing on it will set it off.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.100
Now the reason this compound is so unstable is all to down to how it's put together.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:46.200
It's nitogren triiodide so we have a nitrogen atom - this is a trivalent atom. That means it likes to form three bonds with other atoms.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.800
So when we bring it together with iodine, it forms bonds with three iodine molecules,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.500
and they all go on this side of the nitrogen atom because of the way the nitrogen's electrons are arranged. So the iodines all

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.299
go on over here. And you can kind of see that there's a bit of a problem here which is that

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.460
there's not a lot of room for all these iodine atoms,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.150
they're much bigger than the nitrogen atom and so
they're all kind of squeezed together

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.799
and all repelling each other. And this creates something called bond strain or steric strain,

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.640
which makes the whole molecule less
stable than you'd expect it to be given the components

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.750
Now chemists would say that this
results in a low activation energy for

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.770
the decomposition of this molecule.
Everyone else would probably say that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.500
it is liable to fall apart.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.700
One of the characteristic products of this reaction is the beautiful plume of purple iodine gas.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.700
And you can see this again if I chuck this tiny piece of solid iodine onto this hot plate.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.100
This iodine is formed along with nitrogen gas as a result of all those triiodide molecules falling to pieces and
recombining into a different arrangement.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.759
This recombination releases all of
the energy, setting off more triiodide molecules, and more and more

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.630
in a chain reaction that races through the
rest of the substance, decomposing all of the molecules

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.900
and releasing a huge amount of energy in a
tiny fraction of a second.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.200
Now we filmed the same reaction with a high speed camera to see just how fast it really is

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.600
Here at 37,000 frames a second

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.100
And again at a whopping 59,000 frames a second

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.100
Even at this highest frame rate, we can see that the reaction occurs across just a couple of frames

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.500
To go that fast, the shockwave that's propogating through the reaction must be travelling at a couple of miles per second.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.300
That translates to around 7,000 miles an hour and that's actually about what we would expect to happen

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.300
because after all this is the propogation of a disturbance.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.690
In other words, it's the movement of a sound wave

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.470
As this acoustically propagates a reaction,
we should expect it to proceed at about the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.140
speed of sound. 
Not the speed of sound in air but the much faster speed of sound in the solid NI3 crystals.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.400
The speed of sound in solids is
generally in that ballpark - a few thousand miles an hour.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.700
Finally, when we played back the slow motion footage, there was one other thing that we saw.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.400
If you look carefully you can see, maybe just for a frame or two, that the triiodide flashes as it detonates

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.600
And you can see this on both of the videos.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.550
Now I'm not sure exactly what the cause of this is. It happens far too fast to see with a normal camera, or with the naked eye

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.570
I suspect it might be a result of all
that heat being produced by the release of

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.400
such an enormous amount of energy in
such a small space and short period of time.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.160
And then that heat dissipates incredibly
quickly as the gaseous products expand.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.510
But maybe not though - if you have an
alternative explanation or some

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.940
suggestions for how we might investigate
this then drop in the comments below.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.800
Otherwise that's all for now and I will
leave you with a triiodide super montage
