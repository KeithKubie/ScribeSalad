00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.130
Let A and B be two distinct
points on the parabola

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.960
y squared is equal to 4x.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.770
If the axis of the parabola
touches a circle of radius r,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.600
having AB as its
diameter, then the slope

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.309
of the line joining
A and B can be.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.900
So let's draw this.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.000
So let me draw my axes here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.360
That's my y-axis.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.520
And here is my x-axis.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.250
And then the parabola y
squared is equal to 4x

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.450
would look like this.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.755
Something like that.

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:35.869
That would be in
the first quadrant,

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.660
and then it would be
symmetric around that.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.010
It would look like that.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.160
So this would be y
squared is equal to 4x.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.080
Or if I just focused on
this top part over here,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.300
I could take the principal
root of both sides.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.600
And I get y is equal to 2
times the square root of x.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.540
Just taking the square
root of both sides,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.090
the square root of 4x is 2
times the square root of x.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.260
This down here would be y
is equal to negative 2 times

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.150
the square root of x.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.500
So the positive square root,
the negative square root

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.560
of both sides.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.920
But this one defines this
whole parabola implicitly.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.870
And then they say, they
tell us that if the axis

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.820
of the parabola--
that's essentially

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.210
the x-axis in this drawing--
if the axis of the parabola

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.810
touches a circle of radius r
having AB as its diameter--

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.670
So let's take two
points on this parabola.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.890
So let's say that
that is point A,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.440
and let's say that
this is point B.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.460
It is the diameter
for some circle.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.930
So that's the diameter
for some circle

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.860
that just touches this axis.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.410
It'll just touch on here.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.380
So let me see how well
I can draw that circle.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.560
Obviously, this will
not be an exact drawing.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.000
But let me try my best to draw
the circle under question.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.150
So the circle will
look-- I can do a better

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.570
job than that-- the circle
will look like that.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.430
That's my best shot at it.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.389
And then it has a radius r.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.330
So if we say the
center of the circle,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.930
and obviously the
diameter will go

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.680
through the center
of the circle,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.910
this distance right here is r.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.280
So another way to think
about it, this y value

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.800
right over here,
that y value is r.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.600
Now, let's think a little
bit about the center

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.440
of this circle.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.273
Because maybe with the
center of the circle,

00:02:34.273 --> 00:02:36.670
we can relate the A's
and the B's to the r's.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.340
So let me define A and B. So
let me define the point A. Let's

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.200
say the point A,
just for convenience,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.780
let's make x is equal
to lowercase a squared.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.730
If x is lowercase a squared,
then the square root of that

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.730
is a times 2.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.660
Then y will be 2a.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.480
So this right here is
the point a squared 2a.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.730
And let's make B the point
using the same logic.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.849
Let's just say that's
lowercase b squared.

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.140
And I'm doing that so that
when I take the square root,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.973
it'll become simple.

00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:16.110
So the square root of b
squared is b times 2 is 2b.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.200
Now, let's get the
coordinates for the center

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.424
of that diameter.

00:03:20.424 --> 00:03:22.090
Now, the center of
that diameter is just

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.960
the midpoint of this
point and that point.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.070
So let me write it down here.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.810
The midpoint of
the points A and B

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.360
is going to be equal to the
average of the x values,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.860
a squared plus b squared over
2, and the average of the y

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.480
values.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.690
So this will be 2a plus
2b, all of that over 2.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.740
And of course the 2s cancel out.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.620
And so this is going
to be a plus b.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.530
That is the y value
of the midpoint.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.910
So this point right
over here is going

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:08.200
to be a squared plus b
squared over 2 comma a plus b.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.360
Now, we just saw that this
height right here is r.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.680
So a plus b, this y value right
over here is also equal to r.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.450
This is equal to a plus b.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.050
Write the y value in
between 2a and the y value

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.440
in between 2b right over here.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.940
2b.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.060
This is a plus b.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.390
So just like that,
we were able to get

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.010
a relationship
between a, b, and r.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.210
So we know a plus
b is equal to r.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.150
Now, let's try to find the
actual slope of this diameter.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.540
That's what they want to ask us.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.400
The slope of the line
joining a and b can be.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.450
So let's figure out the
slope of this actual line,

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.920
and let's see if
we can relate it

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.869
to r in some way maybe
using this information.

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:58.160
Because all the answers they
give us are in terms of r.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.430
So we need to have an
answer in terms of r.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.310
So the slope is going to be
change in y over change in x.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:15.470
So 2a minus 2b over a
squared minus b squared.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.690
This is equal to 2 times
a minus b over a plus

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.650
b-- this is just a difference
of squares-- a plus b times

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.846
a minus b.

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:27.190
The a minus b's cancel out.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.710
The slope of the
diameter, the slope

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:37.360
of the line that we care about
is going to be 2 over a plus b.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.650
It's 2 over a plus b.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.800
Now, that's clearly
not one of the answers.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.610
We need our answer
in terms of r.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.870
But we just figured
out the y-coordinate

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.230
of the midpoint,
which was a plus b.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.850
That is equal to r.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.760
So this is the
same thing as 2/r.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.070
So the slope of this line
right over here is 2/r.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.370
Now, you might be tempted
to say OK, the answer is

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.979
C. And I actually probably
should have told you

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:11.770
this at the beginning
of this video in case

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.240
you wanted to pause it
and try it yourself,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.860
is that this is actually
a multiple correct answer

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.360
problem.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.401
So you could actually have
multiple choices here.

00:06:20.401 --> 00:06:23.012
So we want to make sure that
this isn't the only answer.

00:06:23.012 --> 00:06:24.220
And it's not the only answer.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.730
Because we could have put
a here and b here and drawn

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.885
the circle like this.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.380
Essentially the
exact same circle,

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.920
but in the fourth quadrant.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.934
So I could have drawn
the circle like this.

00:06:38.934 --> 00:06:40.350
And then I would
have been dealing

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.924
with the slope of this
diameter would be in question.

00:06:42.924 --> 00:06:44.590
And you can see
everything is symmetric.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.030
It's just flipped around
the axis of symmetry.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.990
It's flipped around the x-axis.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.402
Whatever is the slope up
here, the negative of it

00:06:51.402 --> 00:06:52.860
is going to be the
slope over here.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.600
So this is also a
potential slope.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.550
So if this is 2/r, then
this slope over here

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.790
is negative 2/r.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.990
So this is also an option.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.500
And just based on the
reasoning we just did,

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.090
you could have ruled
out two of these.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.425
If you knew that
this slope is a,

00:07:12.425 --> 00:07:14.800
or if you know that this
slope up here is going to be,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.015
I don't know, if this slope
up here was going to be r,

00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:20.140
then the slope over here
is going to be negative r.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.570
If the slope up here is
going to be a plus b,

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.510
this slope would be
negative a plus b.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.420
So you know that you would
have to have two answers that

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.650
are the negative of each other.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.066
So when you look at just the
choices, you could have said,

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:33.030
oh, it's either going to
be A and B because they're

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.036
the negatives of each other,
or it's going to be C and D.

00:07:37.036 --> 00:07:38.410
So you could have
ruled out-- you

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.690
could have either just picked
these two or these two.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.275
So you had a 50/50
chance of guessing.

00:07:42.275 --> 00:07:43.400
But we don't want to guess.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.520
We want to solve it.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.480
And we just did.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.990
Anyway, hopefully
you enjoyed that.
