MARTIN OMANDER: Hi, my
name is Martin Omander,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.870
and I welcome you to
Google Root Access,

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.260
the show featuring
actionable startup advice.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.070
My guest today is
Nathan Beckord.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.400
Welcome on the show, Nathan.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.941
NATHAN BECKORD:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:19.560
MARTIN OMANDER: So you're a
co-founder of Foundersuite.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.420
And could you tell us
about your startup?

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.880
NATHAN BECKORD: Sure.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.963
Foundersuite is a collection
of productivity tools

00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:25.030
for entrepreneurs.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.055
We have five web
apps and a collection

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:29.260
of about 80 templates,
spreadsheets,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.240
documents for entrepreneurs.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.947
And the way it came about
is for the past 10 years

00:00:33.947 --> 00:00:36.030
or so I've been consulting
with start-ups, usually

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.790
in a finance or
biz dev capacity,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.100
and I saw common repeating
mistake start-ups were making,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.849
common needs start-ups needed.

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:48.640
You know, I worked with
about 150 companies

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.340
and just saw a lot of patterns
of success and failure

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.270
and built spreadsheets
and templates

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.110
to help them through common
operating and financial

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.970
activities.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.790
And then from that,
turned that into what

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.331
we have today, which
is Foundersuite.

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:01.620
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh great.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.930
So you are a startup for
start-ups, a meta-startup,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.310
if you will.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.350
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.410
MARTIN OMANDER: How's business?

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.785
NATHAN BECKORD:
Business is good.

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:12.930
Yeah, we launched
in June of 2013

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.590
and we're up to over 4,500
start-ups on the platform now.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.160
We're adding about 20
to 25 start-ups a day,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.639
so things are rockin'.

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:22.680
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh great.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.560
Congratulations.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.244
So you say that
you've seen many,

00:01:28.244 --> 00:01:30.660
many start-ups and you've seen
things that work and things

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.480
that don't.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.240
What's one of the main
challenges that start-ups

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.250
could do better at do you think?

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.840
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah, you know
fund-raising is the perennial

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.076
challenge of strat-ups--

00:01:42.076 --> 00:01:43.200
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, indeed.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.158
NATHAN BECKORD: One that
a lot of entrepreneurs

00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:47.400
do poorly or wrong.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.410
And you can actually hurt
yourself if you do it wrong.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.350
I see a lot of start-ups
that take the spray and pray

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.020
approach, right?

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.190
They put together a pitch or
sometimes a business plan,

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.630
and they just blast it
out to every VC email

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.660
address they can find.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.340
Or they're pinging
people through LinkedIn

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.710
that have no relevance
to what they're doing.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.780
The spray and pray
approach doesn't work.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.017
Not only is a not going
to get you meetings.

00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:14.100
It's completely ineffective,
but it could actually

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.058
come back and hurt you.

00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:18.597
If you do eventually find a
warm introduction to an investor

00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:20.930
and they see that they've
added you to their spam filter

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.139
before, you know it could
be a signal that you really

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.596
don't know what you're doing,
that you didn't take the time

00:02:25.596 --> 00:02:27.780
to learn how the fund
raising process works,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.720
and that you were just
spamming investors.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.340
So instead, we really
champion a very laser focused,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.750
targeted approach
to fund raising.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.010
This means finding
the right investors

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.470
by geography,
location, and stage.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.080
It also means finding the warm
connection into those investors

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.970
that you've identified.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.670
As one example, in
our investor CRM tool,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.960
we have a LinkedIn plug-in,
a plug in to engines API.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.570
So if I'm trying to
reach Mark Andreessen,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.000
he's on my targeted
list, I can see

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.910
who can connect me
to Mark Andreessen.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.770
So that's one example of
how people do it wrong

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.090
and how they can do better.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.560
MARTIN OMANDER: Do it better.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.380
Great.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.980
So you said-- you mentioned
sort of the Trinity of location,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.750
stage, and industry.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.442
Could you tell me a
bit more about that?

00:03:18.442 --> 00:03:20.150
What's the right way
to think about those

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.169
if you're in startup?

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.460
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah, you know.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.300
This is pretty
common sense stuff,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.170
but it's still something
that a lot of entrepreneurs

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.540
in their hunger to
raise money do wrong.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.370
First is industry.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.995
Right, this should
be pretty intuitive,

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:36.250
but if you're a
fin tech start up

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.590
you should be
looking at investors

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.010
that have a stated preference
for financial technology.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.350
If you're a mobile app or a
social, if your to B to B or B

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.630
to C, obviously if you're in
medical devices or something

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.550
else, you should
really be filtering out

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.740
any investors that
don't specifically

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.020
play in your space.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.930
That's the industry.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.150
The stage is something that I
see people do wrong sometimes.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.230
They'll identify a
fin tech investor

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.230
but that fin tech investor
does B or C rounds, later

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.644
stage investing, whereas they're
really at the C or A round.

00:04:11.644 --> 00:04:14.060
You know, they might take a
meeting just to kick the tires

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.670
and hear what you're
doing, but it's

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.711
very unlikely they're
going to investment in you,

00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:20.540
because their fund has
a charter to invest

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.220
in a certain stage of business.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.010
So getting the stage
right, whether it's

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.560
C series A or
later is important.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.000
And then finally location.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.920
Most investors are pretty
specific about this.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.650
If you're in Boston
and New York,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.100
you invest in start-ups
in your local area.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.160
Silicon Valley holds true.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.920
Some investors will play
outside their sandbox,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.906
but a joke I heard yesterday
at a conference, actually

00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:45.280
I can't claim
credit for this, is

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.330
that most investors
want to invest

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.912
within one Tesla
charge of their office.

00:04:49.912 --> 00:04:51.120
MARTIN OMANDER: That's great.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.780
NATHAN BECKORD: That's
getting the location right.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.710
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.418
Yeah, it's funny.

00:04:54.418 --> 00:04:56.690
I remember in the
late '90s the pundits

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.939
were talking about
the death of distance.

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:59.980
Distance wouldn't matter.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.581
But you're saying
it matters a lot.

00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:03.330
NATHAN BECKORD: Still
matters a lot, yeah.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.579
MARTIN OMANDER: Still matters.

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:08.850
So this is really helpful as
far as finding investment.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.900
Does this, what you just
mentioned about industry

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.360
and stage and
location carry over

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.915
into other parts of
what a startup does?

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:18.540
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah
it certainly does.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.050
I think media relations
and PR is very analogous.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.700
If you're looking to get people
to write about your startup,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.283
you're looking to
get coverage, you're

00:05:28.283 --> 00:05:31.122
looking to get attention
as most entrepreneurs are,

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:33.050
you know again,
doing it wrong is

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.210
finding a list
online somewhere--

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.884
and you see these
published sometimes--

00:05:36.884 --> 00:05:38.300
of email addresses
of journalists,

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.160
and blasting a press release
out to all those lists.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.660
You're going to piss them off.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.410
Journalists hate it
when they get spammed.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.380
And again, they know when
they're being spammed.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.590
A better, more
appropriate way to do it

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.850
is to find journalists,
to find publications

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.460
that cover your space,
and then to narrow down

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.560
further to the journalist whose
beat it is to cover your space.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.710
And then ideally, if
you can also figure out

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.580
what they're currently
writing about,

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.850
their editorial
calendar, that's golden.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.620
We try to enable some of
that with our media CRM tool.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.490
We pull in their
Twitter streams, right?

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.920
So if a journalist is putting
out to their followers

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.500
that they're looking for
an expert in security,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.729
or internet of things, you
know that's a great time

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.270
to pitch if that's
what you're doing.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.728
So kind of tracking
and following--

00:06:26.728 --> 00:06:28.494
MARTIN OMANDER: So
they actually tell us

00:06:28.494 --> 00:06:28.710
what they're looking for.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.270
NATHAN BECKORD: They often do.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.790
Yeah.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:30.800
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh that's great.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.740
NATHAN BECKORD: And
so that's perfect.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.890
That's the exact right
time to be pitching them.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.110
And then finally one other
little bit of advice there.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.530
To the extent you can pay
it forward to a journalist

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.330
and build a relationship in
advance of pitching them,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.400
that's great too.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.872
If you can give them a
scoop, some breaking news,

00:06:46.872 --> 00:06:48.580
I mean that's what
they live and die for.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.867
If you can get them
a tip or anything

00:06:50.867 --> 00:06:52.950
you can do to help them
out in advance of pitching

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.479
will go a long way when it's
your time to pitch them.

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:56.520
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh I see.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.290
Great.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.270
So we are here in the
middle of Silicon Valley,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.029
and a lot of your start-ups
are in Silicon Valley.

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:06.070
Many of our viewers,
perhaps most of our viewers,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.800
are not here.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.640
What should you do if you're
not in a place where there's

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.310
a lot of media
outlets or investors,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.550
or if you find that there's
nobody covering your industry?

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.970
NATHAN BECKORD: Yeah.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.650
If there's no uncovering
industry or there's no nearby,

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.350
obviously you could pivot.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.452
You could change
what you're doing.

00:07:28.452 --> 00:07:29.910
I don't necessarily
recommend that.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.400
You could move, of course.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.540
We see just a flood
of U-hauls coming

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.230
into Silicon Valley
in recent years,

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.470
and I'm sure you've
seen that too.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.720
Or what I see a lot of start-ups
do, especially ones that maybe

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.290
are based abroad, in
Australia, or Europe,

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:51.050
or elsewhere, or Asia, they'll
have one or two people here

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.050
to really be the scout
in the Valley, right?

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.660
To be the one that's going up
and down Sand hill Road or 2nd

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.250
Street corridor in San
Francisco talking to investors.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.120
You know, with journalists I
don't think location matters

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.900
quite as much, but
it's still always great

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.435
if you can ping a
journalist and invite him

00:08:09.435 --> 00:08:10.550
to coffee or something.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.702
I did that two weeks ago and
got a guy, a writer from Inc.

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:15.660
to come out and meet for
beers at Thirsty Bear.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.180
It was great.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.263
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, great.

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:18.310
Yeah.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.690
NATHAN BECKORD:
And then finally,

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.106
if you can't find anyone who's
really covering your space,

00:08:22.106 --> 00:08:25.760
or investors that declare
their interest in your space,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.330
that's not necessarily
a bad thing.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.530
If you're doing
something really so

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.330
unique that no one's
following it yet,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.090
that could be a huge advantage.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.400
Journalists and investors are
always looking for the outlier,

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:38.900
right?

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.950
They're looking to break news.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.790
They're looking for that unique
different thing, not the nth

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:49.340
iteration of a social
photo sharing app, right?

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.740
So play to your stengths.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.280
If you have something truly
unique, that can go a long way.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.390
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh great.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.390
Well thank you so much
for coming in and sharing

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.070
your experiences with
us today, Nathan.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.160
NATHAN BECKORD: Thank you
very much for having me.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.089
Appreciate it.

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:01.880
MARTIN OMANDER: We hope
you found something

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.390
you can use in your startup.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.690
Your input matters.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.300

comments below.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.070

See you next time.
