Ember gets a speed
boost with Glimmer,

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.820
and we explore new
forms of storytelling

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.310
for the collective intelligence.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.210
I'm Rob Dodson.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.956
This is LazyWeb.

00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:11.054

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.170
Ember's new rendering engine
Glimmer is now in Canary.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.090
Inspired by React's
Virtual DOM, Ember

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.710
attempts to improve upon
things by only dipping bindings

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.164
instead of the entire DOM.

00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:23.830
According to the team,
this dramatically

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.329
improves performance on
benchmarks like DBMonster.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.620
You can follow this guide to
learn more about migrating

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.549
to Glimmer in Ember 2.0.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.140
Let's explore storytelling for
the collective intelligence.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.580
Senongo Akpem, creator of
the Pixel Fable project,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.900
describes the process of
creating nonlinear stories

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.684
utilizing modern technology.

00:00:41.684 --> 00:00:43.600
He codifies and demonstrates
several examples,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.880
including extra narratives like
an "An Idea Lives On," parallel

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.620
narratives featured in "Project
Moon," and micronarratives

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.330
illustrated by his own
site "Lost Nigeria."

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.750
Do websites need a diet?

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.830
Scott Jehl tweets that
the average web page now

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.610
weighs over 2 megabytes with
62% of that coming from images.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.390
Projects like "What
Does My Site Cost"

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.882
demonstrate this can translate
to serious money for users.

00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:09.590
New standards like
picture and source set

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.960
can help combat the problem,
but it's up to developers

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.380
to start leveraging them.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.170
Firefox 38 hits
stable this week,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.400
and with it comes a
number of improvements.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.282
Best highlighted on
the Mozilla hacks blog,

00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:23.740
the new release contains support
for both picture and image

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.510
source set, web
sockets in Web Workers,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.950
BroadcastChannel that post
messages to all open tabs,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.329
and some bonus
Dev Tools goodies.

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.745
You can check out the developer
release notes over on MDN.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.860
Chrome on Android now
has a Dev channel.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.960
Detailed on the Chromium
blog, the new Dev channel

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.460
allows developers
to test their site

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.110
using an early version of
Chrome to find bugs and try out

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.550
cutting edge features.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.590
The new channel is updated
at least every week

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.880
and is already available
on the Google Play Store.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.580
Programmatic Copy and
Paste is coming to Firefox.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.430
A recent intent to
implement and ship thread

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.230
indicates that Firefox will
add support for Copy and Paste

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.740
via the exec command method
in response to user action.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.890
Similar behavior is already
supported in Chrome 43,

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.032
IE10, and Opera 29.

00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:10.490
To learn more about
Copy and Paste,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.930
you can check out this
article on HTML5 Rocks.

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:16.650
That's it for this week, folks.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.510
Take a deep breath,
enjoy the visuals,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.540
and to all you LazyWebbers out
there, thanks for watching.
