00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.346
Let's get back to our more serious example about using exceptions and remember

00:00:05.346 --> 00:00:10.017
what we're doing is opening a file to write, writing some things into it.

00:00:10.018 --> 00:00:14.528
Catching the IO errors and then we're doing some other things. Which we haven't

00:00:14.528 --> 00:00:18.094
done anything other than print now. There's one problem with this code and

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:21.275
that's that we're closing the file. You might not notice this when you run it.

00:00:21.276 --> 00:00:25.247
But, if we're a responsible programmer, we need to remember to close the files

00:00:25.247 --> 00:00:29.352
that we opened. So, let's make that a quiz. Where should we close the file? I've

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:35.918
given you four choices, either within the try, within the except handler, after

00:00:35.918 --> 00:00:39.773
the try block, or none of the above really work.
