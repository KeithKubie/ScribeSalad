00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.179
So Greg and I have been in a relationship for over 10 years now

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.080
And we've always wondered whether or not you could

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:12.780
scientifically evaluate how compatible we are or others actually are. And it turns out that researchers are doing just that. They are looking at couples biology

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.500
neurology and genetics to figure out how compatible they actually are. So we decided to take this test and find out if we're actually

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.260
meant to be together. The company that does this is called Instinct Chemistry which starts by taking a swab of DNA

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.750
We're going to analyze our oxytocin levels,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.590
serotonin receptors, HLA genes and dr4 genes

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.730
Oxytocin is often called the love hormone

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.820
and is related to bonding affection and empathy. There are actually two versions of the oxytocin receptors

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.019
gene: the A and the G variant. If you have the G variant it means that the

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.610
Oxytocin fits in perfectly to the receptor. So when you're stimulated by it you have a big response

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.200
but if you have the A variant it's kind of like a lock-and-key that doesn't quite fit

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.159
perfectly and so the response is actually a lower stimulation from oxytocin. The oxytocin receptors

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.579
related a lot to empathy. There's affection, but it's also

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.340
how well you are able to interpret how the other person's feeling. Okay. You are actually

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.420
G. Oww!

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.600
Okay, and you are actually the A. You're the A.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.100
A. So, what does that mean? Does that mean I'm flustered, it's hard for me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm literally forgeting about everything what we were talking about.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.000
You don't get the same kick out of those moments that would release oxytocin. Yeah but I think I'm empathetic. No you are, I'm sure it doesn't mean you're not.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Although like seriously f*** you.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.200
If you are a thinker it's good to sort of communicate verbally a lot about what you're thinking because it may not come across as serious.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.000
Ow my god are you serious. That's his f****** thing.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.519
I'm always like I want to talk about this,  and your like, you always want to talk about this.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.500
That's crazy! Exactly, a listener would be more reading the emotion reading, reading the situation. Yeah. They don't need the language to interpret whats going on. Oww... Yeah makes sense.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.828
So we give this combination the thinker in the listener at 75 percent.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.150
And that's because I mean you were saying that you're very good at talking and expressing your emotions.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:09.800
But in some cases the thinker is not. I think there is a party that thinks you could problobly, maybe be better off with a listener sometimes. Maybe, maybe?

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.330
Many of you are probably wondering if the fact that Mitch and I are gay is going to affect our results so we actually

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.700
asked Dr. Seabrook

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.319
what she thought. A lot of the research that has been done has been on

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.530
Heterosexual couples. What we find is that there is a similar trend?

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.000
So I wouldn't take your results and throw them out the window. They are meaningful.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.600
If a gay couple contacts us and says they want to take the test we subsidize the edge late

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.959
Because there isn't a lot of that research out there

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.479
It's true like this is something that could be so heteronormative

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.500
And it's just nice to know that brilliant scientists are not making it fully that way.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.940
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that contributes to feelings of happiness and well-being and we each have two alleles for the serotonin transporter

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.149
gene. If you end up having both short alleles

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.390
you're actually worse at having your cells reuptake serotonin, which ultimately characterizes you as more emotional.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.549
Which means you feel things way more strongly?

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.489
Whether or not they're good or bad in both directions. If you have long long or long short allele combination

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.659
You're actually much more even-tempered and practical. Okay, so what do you think you think you're lying?

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.509
I'm lying because I feel like a lot of times in relationship, I'm like, okay

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.769
let's look at the bigger picture and let's chill out, and I think that you're short cuz they're like your firey.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.519
And you would feel really good, too

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.019
Yeah

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.358
I feel like if you had to be one or the other like I I definitely like identifying more as a short

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.400
and I feel like you are long. Okay let's find out. You both carry long and short, you both are heterozygotes.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.300
Okay, so you are actually both practical. Okay? Oww... I'm sorry

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.500
So we're hetero in this case. Yeah, it's the only time someones ever told me that. We gave you a 100% on that. Yeah girl!

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.589
Everyone has HLA genes and they control the makeup of the bacteria on your skin.

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.828
HLA fragments are also involved with the formation of your odor because they are in your sweat, and your saliva as well

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:02.549
So we actually sniff out diverse bacteria and diverse genes in our lovers so that the offspring that we create will have a more diverse

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.909
Immune system so as a side note obviously Greg and I aren't gonna our own biological offspring together

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.910
But scientists are actually finding that the same mechanisms that affect attraction in straight couples are actually applicable to gay couples as well

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.459
So the better somebody smells to you the more likely they are to have different genes and the more likely you are to have that

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:27.379
physical attraction with the person, The average couple when they take this test scores between about seventy-five and eighty-four percent on compatibility.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.500
Okay, so you guys actually scored?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.700
Seventy-six. Oww...okay, okay! We're an average couple. That's better than having to leave you.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.039
Next up was our dopamine receptor 4 gene. There are two common variants in this gene either

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.909
Seven are or four are if your seven are it means that you are more risky

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.410
You're more likely to jump out of a plane and go skydiving or gamble or have an affair

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.480
It's actually known as the promiscuity gene

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.729
But if you are a four are you are gonna think before you act you are way less risky.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.390
Okay. So neither of you are seven are plus. Okay. That's kind of what I thought

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.720
Yeah, we're not as I was like impulsive yeah

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.980
I'm not that promiscuous

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.020
And we're just like you know we sit at home and like we want a golden retriever for a compatibility score

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.290
We actually give that a 75% a seven are pluses brings the excitement in there that is nice actually

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.450
that's why we never leave the house.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.400
And I feel like the risky behavior was probably just cuz we were young. And we're not yound any more. We should drink so much more, it was alcohol.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:44.300
So we should drink more, okay thank you. Okay so, are we compatible. I don't feel like we're breaking up today. No, overall compatible, right? Yes, so overall you are the average couple.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.679
Can't hope for anything better, it's great to find out that we are averagely compatible

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.609
But I think the most important thing that we took away from this is it felt a lot like therapy we were able to learn

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.490
about ourselves from a physiological and mental level

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.980
And we're able to relate in a different way as to why maybe we argue or as to why maybe some parts of our relationship?

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.659
Are harder at certain times it was really nice to be in an environment where they were looking for queer people

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.669
And they really want us to be a part of it

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.749
And we did feel like it definitely made a lot of sense to us and that is important

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.429
We really want to thank the instant chemistry kit team it was such a cool experience for us, so definitely check it out

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.080
We'll put links in the description for you

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.669
Go do it, make sure subscribe for more videos, and we'll see you next Thursday for a new animated video. Peace!
