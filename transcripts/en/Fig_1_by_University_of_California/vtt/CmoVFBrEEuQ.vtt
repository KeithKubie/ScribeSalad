00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.040
The iron in your blood

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.770
the silicon in your computer, the oxygen
that we breathe, all of those

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.070
elements were actually synthesized inside
stars.  Stars form from the collapse of a

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.599
cloud and

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.619
basically as soon as fusion starts
taking place (hydrogen to helium)

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.630
the star finds peace and finds stability

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.220
and that's what we call the stars the
main sequence and it spends the

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.529
majority of its time

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.779
and then depending on its mass you can
actually

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.519
start fusing heavier and heavier
elements.  Thats in fact

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.090
what keeps stars fighting against gravity

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.980
the fact that as they fuse elemtns
actually those reactions generate heat

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.289
but of course once you start off using
progressively heavier elements and you

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:44.269
get into iron

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.010
those reactions can no longer give you
heat at that point the star has lost

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.490
its battle against gravity and has no
other fate but to collapse

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.740
