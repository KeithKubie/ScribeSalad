00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.570
Look at the diagram below, then
answer the following question.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.970
What type of angle is the angle
highlighted in the green below?

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.810
So it looks like
two anteaters going

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.520
after an ant right over here.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.695
And this anteater is
going straight down,

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:15.070
or at least on my
screen it looks

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.320
like it's going straight down.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.840
And this anteater's going
straight to the left.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.454
And so it looks like this
one's going straight down,

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.870
this one's going
straight to left.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.474
It looks like this is a right
angle or a 90-degree angle.

00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:28.390
And so if I have to pick
between any of these,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.640
it looks most like
a right angle.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.360
It looks like this is
exactly going down,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.000
and this is going
exactly to the left,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.370
that this is a
90-degree angle here.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.770
If this was an acute angle,
then the angle between them

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.870
would be smaller.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.420
So maybe this top
one would be coming

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.760
in from this direction
right over here.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.567
If it was obtuse, this
angle would be larger.

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:48.150
So let's just check
our answer and try

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.770
to do a few more of these.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.450
Which of the angles labeled
in the diagram below

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.200
are acute angles?

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.340
So just as a reminder, an acute
angle is less than 90 degrees.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.670
So let's see, A and C both
look larger than 90 degrees.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.910
But B and D both look
less than 90 degrees.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.380
So I'll go with B and D
are the acute angles here.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.830
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.280
What type of angle is the angle
highlighted in green below?

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.990
Well, this angle is
less than 90 degrees.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.830
If it was equal to 90
degrees, this thing

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.170
would come out like this.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.680
So this is clearly
less than 90 degrees.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.801
This is an acute angle.

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:35.800
Let me just do one more.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.674
This is a lot of fun.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.000
Select a symbol from
the drop-down menu

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.710
to complete the
following statement.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.540
Then answer the question below.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.135
Angle A is less than 90 degrees.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.480
What type of angle is angle A?

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.130
So angle A, it's
less than 90 degrees.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.390
So an angle less than 90
degrees is an acute angle.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.070
If it was exactly 90 degrees,
it would be a right angle.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.320
If it was larger
than 90 degrees,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.590
it would be an obtuse angle.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.840
So I will go with acute angle.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.780
And we got it right.
