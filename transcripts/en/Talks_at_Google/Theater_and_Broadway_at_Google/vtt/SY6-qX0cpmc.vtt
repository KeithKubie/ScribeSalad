[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.380
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Thank you
guys so much for being here.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.713
ARI AFSAR: Thanks for having us.

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:10.480
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
This is Ari and Joseph.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.479
Please welcome them with
a warm Chicago welcome.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.295
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:16.580
ARI AFSAR: I get chills
even still watching it.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.955
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
Do you, still?

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:18.621
ARI AFSAR: Yeah.

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:20.640
KELLIE FITZGERALD: I
know, it's amazing.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.880
And Emily's intro
was so fantastic.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.100
I'm not going to do the
traditional 'tell me about

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.040
yourself, tell me about
how you got here.'

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.650
I want to do a little different
spin on the opening question,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.409
if you guys don't mind.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.640
JOSEPH MORALES: Sure.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.090
ARI AFSAR: Cool.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.610
KELLIE FITZGERALD: So in our
opening song of "Hamilton,"

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.770
we learn about
everything that happened

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.430
Alexander Hamilton leading
up to his arrival to America.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.560
If you were to have
an opening song that

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.890
told us about everything
that it took for you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.278
to arrive at "Hamilton"--

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:51.215
ARI AFSAR: That's a
really hard question.

00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:52.195
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
--what would be included?

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:54.340
JOSEPH MORALES: Like a
song that already exists?

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.140
KELLIE FITZGERALD: No, no.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.473
What would be included in your--

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.306
ARI AFSAR: You have
to start rapping now.

00:00:58.306 --> 00:01:00.194
JOSEPH MORALES: [CLEARS THROAT]

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:01.575
Oh, man.

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:01.830
ARI AFSAR: You go.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.990
KELLIE FITZGERALD: We just want
to know what you did before you

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.126
got here, to this moment?

00:01:05.126 --> 00:01:06.000
JOSEPH MORALES: Sure.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.470
So my dad was in the military.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.740
And we moved around a bunch.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.400
And I was never the
kid that was wanting

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.540
to be in the spotlight--
didn't sing ever, didn't dance.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.230
My sister was a dancer but--

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.290
I would go watch her
classes, but never really

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.577
had a desire to do it.

00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:27.910
When we started moving around,
it was really hard for me

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.070
and I didn't know
how to meet people.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.880
I was super introverted.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.470
I decided to audition for
my sixth grade choir show.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.900
They were doing
"The Jungle Book."

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.090
I was like, well, I can
meet people super fast.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.380
I'll just try it.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.050
And that's literally
how it started.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.200
I mean, it was just
because I was just

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.682
so thankful to have
friends that were like me.

00:01:51.682 --> 00:01:52.890
I mean, I just stuck with it.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.890
And then, when I
graduated in high school,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.390
and it was time to decide what
college I was going to go, to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.840
or what I wanted to do,
and it was like, well,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.950
I might as well just
keep doing this.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.616
And that's, really,
how it fell into it.

00:02:01.616 --> 00:02:04.254
I mean, I didn't want
to do this at all.

00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:05.920
Never-- not that I
didn't want to do it,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.290
it just wasn't on my radar.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.500
ARI AFSAR: Yeah.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.500
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Yeah.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.541
And then, what kind of
roles or monumental things

00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:13.290
happened along the
way, before "Hamilton"?

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.950
JOSEPH MORALES: So,
I did a lot of--

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.790
I did a lot of cool
projects, but the thing that

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.910
really, kind of, started things
was doing Lin's first show,

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.900
"In the Heights."

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.370
I did the first national tour.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.090
I played Usnavi.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.980
And that's how I kind of
got to know Lin and Tommy

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.354
Kail, our director,
and Alex, who

00:02:28.354 --> 00:02:30.150
were the same exact
team as "Hamilton"--

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.640
Andy, who choreographed
"In the Heights."

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.830
So that's kind of what
opened a lot of the doors.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.372
I mean, before that,
it was a hustle.

00:02:37.372 --> 00:02:38.829
I mean, I did a
lot of cool things.

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.920
I did like the original
cast of "Rock of Ages,"

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.000
and "Bombay Dreams."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.690
ARI AFSAR: You were
in the original?

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.740
JOSEPH MORALES: Mm-hmm, in LA.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.990
ARI AFSAR: I didn't know that.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.220
JOSEPH MORALES: Yeah.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.890
KELLIE FITZGERALD: You
guys are learning--

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.723
ARI AFSAR: Learning.

00:02:47.723 --> 00:02:49.005
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:49.880
JOSEPH MORALES: Yeah.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.380
Yeah.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.490
So I mean, but really, I
mean Lin changed my life--

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.302
absolutely, 100%.

00:02:54.302 --> 00:02:54.802
Yeah.

00:02:54.802 --> 00:02:55.718
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Mm.

00:02:55.718 --> 00:02:56.370
That's awesome.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.486
How about you, Ari?

00:02:57.486 --> 00:02:59.130
What's your opening song?

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.740
JOSEPH MORALES:
[HUMS "ALEXANDER HAMILTON"]

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.442
ARI AFSAR: How does a--

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:05.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.440
I don't know how--

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.800
So I come from--

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.425
I think part of the huge
thing is my parents,

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:12.300
where they come from.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.910
My dad is an immigrant
from Bangladesh

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.150
and my mom grew up
in "the slums"--

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.960
that's not a right
word-- but of San Jose.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.490
And then they created
this life for me that is--

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.930
was incredible.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.640
And so I look a lot
to be my parents--

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.810
I'm an only child.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.370
I see the struggles
that they had.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.580
And they really
instilled in me that you

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.924
must be able to love what
you do, every single day.

00:03:39.924 --> 00:03:41.340
So my dad grew up
from Bangladesh,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.950
was the first of his country--

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.912
first of his family to come
over to the United States,

00:03:45.912 --> 00:03:48.120
came for the school visa,
got his master's and became

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.050
an engineer.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.080
My mom went back to
get her law degree

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.080
when she was 40 years
old, because that's

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.070
something she had always
been passionate about.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.580
And so my mom is an attorney,
my dad's an engineer,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.290
and they birthed this kid who
is like, (SING-SONG) music!

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.950
And they're like, what
do we do with this?

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.950
And so actually one of
the biggest things for me

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.270
is they instilled in me
that I must love what I do,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.700
but I also came from a very
South Asian household, where

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.279
I didn't really do
theater in school.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.019
I was academics, all the way.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.320
I was a biology major
at UCLA for two years

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.747
before I switched and realized
what I really wanted to do.

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:26.580
And so that was also a
real struggle for me,

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.840
is believing in myself, because
I like the stability that

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.169
comes with being a bio major.

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.960
There is no stability
in that unless you're

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.835
going to be a doctor,
and that's seven years,

00:04:38.835 --> 00:04:40.260
and who wants to do that?

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.170
So I think that was like
a huge struggle for me,

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.690
is finally, really
believing in myself.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.190
And so this was kind of--

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.950
I put it out into the
universe the last year,

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.920
that I was going to
be pursuing this,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.150
because I was a voice teacher.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.710
I taught coding to
under-resourced kids.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.320
I was doing many different types
of jobs and I was sick of it.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.860
And then I made a very
whimsical decision

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.422
to go to New York for a few
months during this year,

00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:13.380
because I was like, well,
this is the last year

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.050
before I get a full-time job.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.774
And this was the
full-time job I got.

00:05:19.774 --> 00:05:21.190
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
That's amazing.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.023
ARI AFSAR: So, yeah.

00:05:22.023 --> 00:05:23.480
And then, like,
milestones in it--

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.938
I was on "American
Idol" when I was

00:05:24.938 --> 00:05:28.691
16, which was the best and
worst experience of my life.

00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:30.440
One thing that I did
really gain from that

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.570
was getting a thick skin.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.040
I cried on national television
and they replayed it,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.250
and I still wanted to
do music after that.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.710
I'm like, OK, that means
that I really want this.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.020
I got two years of
college paid for at UCLA

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.830
by being top ten
at Miss America.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.380
When I was-- after
freshman year of college--

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.960
so they were some huge
things that I accomplished,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.110
which is awesome, but my
biggest goal was to have a job,

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.150
to make money off of
doing what I wanted,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.960
and be, like, comfortable.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.530
And so at age 25,
this is the first time

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.987
that I got that,
which is awesome.

00:06:04.987 --> 00:06:07.070
I mean, like, yeah, what's
bigger than "Hamilton"?

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.982
Like, so--

00:06:07.982 --> 00:06:10.481
KELLIE FITZGERALD: And the role
you play in "Hamilton," too.

00:06:10.481 --> 00:06:13.297
Would you guys tell everybody
about who you play in the show?

00:06:13.297 --> 00:06:14.630
JOSEPH MORALES: I play Hamilton.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.090
I wasn't this guy.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.370
I'm the alternate.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.336
So I play Hamilton on Sundays.

00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:20.210
So there's two of us.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.740
There's Miguel
Cervantes, and then I

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.620
play Hamilton on Sundays.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.560
ARI AFSAR: And I play
Eliza Schuyler, who

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.160
then becomes Eliza Hamilton.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.740
And I think--

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.528
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:33.354 --> 00:06:34.770
JOSEPH MORALES:
Tickled-- tickled.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.603
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
That's really delightful.

00:06:36.603 --> 00:06:37.560
ARI AFSAR: Well, I--

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.420
that's hilarious.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.164
It's also-- it's just so funny,
because no one knows Eliza.

00:06:42.164 --> 00:06:43.580
JOSEPH MORALES:
Well, now they do.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.880
ARI AFSAR: I mean,
before the show.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.670
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Now they do.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.620
ARI AFSAR: No, now they
do, yeah, yeah. yeah.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.240
But like, also, you need to see
the show to know who she is.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.830
And so I think that's also the
biggest things-- when they're

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.913
like, oh, who do you play?

00:06:50.913 --> 00:06:52.490
And I'm like, oh,
Eliza Schuyler.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.420
And they're like--

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.140
Hamilton's wife.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.940
And they're like,
oh, now we know.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.240
But I think that was the
coolest thing, too, is I joke

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.060
and I say that I needed to have
booked the show in order to see

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.840
the show.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.750
Because I-- in my audition
with Tommy Kail, he's like,

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.170
have you seen the show?

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.260
And I'm like, no dude.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.380
I've been trying every single
day to get a lotto ticket.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.421
It's not going to happen.

00:07:12.421 --> 00:07:14.360
And so then, I finally
booked it and then

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.627
I finally saw the show.

00:07:15.627 --> 00:07:17.960
But it was weird, because the
first time I saw the show,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.510
I knew I was going
to be playing Eliza.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.610
And I saw Phillipa
Soo, who's incredible,

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.040
but more so than just the
performer-- the character.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.170
She is a badass shero,
especially of the 18th century.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.260
And so being able to see
that was really intimidating,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.234
but also like,
such an honor to--

00:07:35.234 --> 00:07:36.650
Lin, from the very
beginning, knew

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.320
that he wanted to end the
show with Eliza, and--

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.980
spoiler alert.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.520
And I think that is just the
coolest thing, because they're

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.191
shedding light on women.

00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:49.190
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Yeah.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.773
I actually have a
question I was going

00:07:50.773 --> 00:07:53.377
to wait until much later to
ask, but that's a perfect segue.

00:07:53.377 --> 00:07:55.460
ARI AFSAR: Women empowerment
always will come up--

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.460
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Yeah.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.350
We-- well, we--

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.270
Emily and I, actually,
have had conversations

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.520
about the lyrics of
the show, as fans do.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.580
And one thing that
we talked about

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.320
was the fact that when
you meet Angelica,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.320
she says, "I'm the
oldest and the wittiest

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.010
and the gossip of
New York City-iest."

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.840
And it would have
been such a lob

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.400
to say she was the prettiest.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.540
It fits right in.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.400
But, like, Lin made
a conscious decision

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.470
to focus on the
minds, the ambition,

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.490
and the accomplishment
of the women in the show.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.874
And so I was going to ask you--

00:08:21.874 --> 00:08:22.790
ARI AFSAR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.130
KELLIE FITZGERALD: --how did
you prepare for this character

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:25.659
differently?

00:08:25.659 --> 00:08:27.200
Or how did you think
about the impact

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.660
that this character would
have on women and girls

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.210
and boys and men who
would see the show?

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.770
ARI AFSAR: I mean,
it's history--

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.210
that's the coolest part.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.890
This is not fictitious.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.380
He's pulling from real life.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.109
And the fact that we are
shedding light on real women--

00:08:42.109 --> 00:08:43.525
JOSEPH MORALES:
Making them human.

00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:44.280
ARI AFSAR: Yeah.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.946
JOSEPH MORALES:
[INAUDIBLE] really cool.

00:08:45.946 --> 00:08:47.420
ARI AFSAR: Of these--

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.170
these women were-- are
here now and were there

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.840
in the 18th century.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.960
So I think that that's cool
is, we're always powerful.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.830
But it's whether or not the
world is going to see that.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.122
And so we're still 76
cents to the dollar?

00:09:01.122 --> 00:09:03.080
So we're still going to
be fighting and pushing

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.956
in order to make sure
that we are above equal

00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:06.330
in order to get
that equilibrium.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.470
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Mm-hmm.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.500
It's a very powerful
portrayal of women,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.750
and done in a way that
stories about that

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.040
time, of our country,
doesn't typically highlight.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.050
ARI AFSAR: Exactly.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.070
KELLIE FITZGERALD: So, OK, a
more lighthearted question.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.110
We'll start with you, Joseph.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.026
If could play any other
character in the show,

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.377
who would you pick?

00:09:21.377 --> 00:09:22.710
ARI AFSAR: Is it male or female?

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.210
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
It can be either.

00:09:27.178 --> 00:09:29.070
JOSEPH MORALES: Hmm.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.538
ARI AFSAR: Have you
not thought about this?

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:34.005
JOSEPH MORALES: I'm pretty busy.

00:09:34.005 --> 00:09:36.338
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Has no one
ever-- no one's ever asked

00:09:36.338 --> 00:09:39.370
you this question before?

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.930
JOSEPH MORALES: I would love to
take a crack at Burr, for sure.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.410
And my original offer
was actually to do both,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.710
but they ended up
needing a king, more.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.090
So I actually do cover the king.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.962
I went on for the
first time last week.

00:09:52.962 --> 00:09:55.840
ARI AFSAR: (DEEP
VOICE) Incredible.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.640
JOSEPH MORALES: Oh.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.510
Talk about facing
your fears, you guys.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.510
But Burr-- now that I'm
settled into Hamilton,

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.000
I feel like Burr would be a
really fun character to play.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.900
I mean, he's so--

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.472
they're both a part
of me, I think.

00:10:09.472 --> 00:10:11.430
Sometimes I'm a Hamilton,
sometimes I'm a Burr.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.350
I think that's why people
relate to the show.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.150
I think sometimes you're like,
oh, I'm the "Wait For It."

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.100
And other times, you're like,
screw that, I'm going for it.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.390
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Yeah.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.157
JOSEPH MORALES: It'd be
exciting to play both.

00:10:21.157 --> 00:10:22.740
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
That's interesting.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.115
We had a conversation
about this,

00:10:24.115 --> 00:10:26.310
because I left the show so
fired up, and being like,

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.110
I need to be more like Hamilton.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.152
And then I talked to
somebody, and he said, well,

00:10:30.152 --> 00:10:32.651
I left the show being like, if
everybody were like Hamilton,

00:10:32.651 --> 00:10:34.050
this world would be a disaster.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.210
We need Burrs.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.830
Burrs are dependable.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.424
Is there a character you like--

00:10:39.424 --> 00:10:41.340
ARI AFSAR: Well, I was
going to say Burr, too.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.980
But now it's not as
cool of an answer.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.800
So, I mean, he--

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.080
I think the best song
is "Wait For It."

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.030
I love "Wait For It."

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.430
And I love just being
in the surround,

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.960
and being a part of that magic.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.550
Yeah.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.300
That's my answer.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.650
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Do you--

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.900
so you kind of answered this
question already, Joseph.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.750
But Ari, do you relate to one of
the characters more personally?

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.681
Like, are you more
Hamilton or more Burr?

00:11:07.681 --> 00:11:08.764
ARI AFSAR: [CLEARS THROAT]

00:11:08.764 --> 00:11:10.690
JOSEPH MORALES:
Can I answer that?

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:11.845
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:12.650
ARI AFSAR: On me?

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:13.230
JOSEPH MORALES: No, yeah.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.460
ARI AFSAR: I want to hear.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.280
JOSEPH MORALES: You're
definitely a Hamilton.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.360
ARI AFSAR: I think--
yeah, I think--

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.234
JOSEPH MORALES: 100%.

00:11:17.234 --> 00:11:19.240
ARI AFSAR: But I
think I'm an Eliza.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.710
JOSEPH MORALES: Sure.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.180
ARI AFSAR: Let's
talk about the women.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.377
I'm just kidding.

00:11:24.377 --> 00:11:26.710
KELLIE FITZGERALD: I would
love-- especially, the impact

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.751
of the original cast and
the original cast album,

00:11:28.751 --> 00:11:31.450
like, a lot of people walk
into the show knowing the tone

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.220
and how things are
saying and portrayed.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.845
I'd love to hear how
you guys have each

00:11:34.845 --> 00:11:36.400
made the characters your own.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.900
And Ari, honestly,
one of the things

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.691
I noticed when I saw
the Chicago production

00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:41.920
is when you sing Burr--
or when you sing "Burn,"

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.135
you are pissed.

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:44.164
And I like that.

00:11:44.164 --> 00:11:44.830
ARI AFSAR: Yeah.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.960
KELLIE FITZGERALD: And I think
Phillipa was a little more hurt

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.270
in her portrayal in "Burn."

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.295
And I liked the way--

00:11:49.295 --> 00:11:50.920
I think you kind of
made that your own.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.450
So are there any
other conscious ways

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:53.930
you guys have made the
characters your own?

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.180
JOSEPH MORALES: Well, I think
it came from the creative team.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.920
The creative team, from the
very beginning, was like,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.500
we're not hiring you to be
a replication of anyone.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.960
If I ever tried to be
Lin-Manuel, I would fail.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.240
I mean, he's-- I
mean, he's amazing.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.280
He's his own thing.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.320
So I think they were
very clear that they

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.414
wanted us to bring whatever
colors we had into the roles.

00:12:12.414 --> 00:12:14.830
And we were just talking to
John Gilmore, our press agent,

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.470
who was just in San
Francisco, and he

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.700
saw their new production.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.741
He was just talking about
how it's the same show,

00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:21.550
but so different.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.590
Nobody's trying to try to
duplicate anything, which

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.245
I think is really special.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.050
I just think through the
process, it was just--

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.325
in rehearsals, it was just
how can we make this--

00:12:36.325 --> 00:12:38.200
ARI AFSAR: We don't even
have the opportunity

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.425
to duplicate it.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:40.300
You know what I mean?

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.430
We saw it one time with
the OBC, and sat a few--

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.990
there's no real way for
us to even try to do that.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.610
And beyond us being ourselves
and being cast to be ourselves,

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.410
every show is different.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.100
So one time I can do
something with Joseph,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.540
and that fuels me to be
really upset during "Burn."

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.110
Or sometimes I'll be bawling
during "It's Quiet Uptown."

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.170
or I'll be really pissed
off and there's anger-- so,

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.230
it's like, every day.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.250
And what happens during
our life, like, effects it.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.010
JOSEPH MORALES: And it's super
cool to work on a show where

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:15.640
it's--

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.040
Lin has just put it all there.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.990
We just have to
open our mouths--

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.050
the material works.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:26.710
I think they did a good job
of casting the right essence

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.830
and whatever the character
needs, but the words--

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.510
I mean, the work is all done.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.780
It's like the hardest and
easiest job I've ever done.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.280
Because physically,
it's exhausting,

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.844
but it's all there
for you, every night.

00:13:39.844 --> 00:13:42.010
KELLIE FITZGERALD: That's
interesting you brought up

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.240
physically-- it's exhausting.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.570
We're big fans of fun facts here
at Google, if you can't tell.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.250
And somebody also from Chicago--

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.160
Nate Silvers, he did this
really interesting analysis

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.090
of the show.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.330
And so he did an
analysis and found

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.450
that "Hamilton"
has 20,520 words,

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.120
and averages 144
words per minute.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.440
But here's the fun fact--

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.840
it clocks twice as
many words per minute

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.960
as its closest competitor,
which is "Spring Awakening."

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.759
ARI AFSAR: Oh.

00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:09.550
I didn't know that.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.091
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
So I would-- yeah.

00:14:11.091 --> 00:14:14.650
I would love to hear what
it takes to train for it?

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.010
Like, how do you train for that?

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:17.230
And then also, how do
you build the endurance

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.930
to do it so many nights a
week, so many days a week?

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.970
JOSEPH MORALES: How
did I train for it?

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:28.380
It's repetition and
having the passion to work

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.630
hard enough for it, I think.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.820
I wanted this so bad.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.400
The job before this, I was
on a show called "If/Then."

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.900
I was on the tour
and I was a swing.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.990
And I had a lot
of time offstage.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.570
And so I started
auditioning for "Hamilton."

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.714
And I just started using my time
offstage to learn the material.

00:14:48.714 --> 00:14:50.130
And then once I
booked "Hamilton,"

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:55.620
I had three months of "If/Then"
before I started at "Hamilton."

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.970
And every day, I would
just spend those two hours

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.476
that I was at the theater just--

00:14:59.476 --> 00:15:01.350
I would write all my
lyrics down seven times.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.274
I don't know why I do that,
but it's from my whole life.

00:15:04.274 --> 00:15:05.190
That's how I memorize.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.390
I write everything
down seven times.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.610
ARI AFSAR: It's not
eight or or six?

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:08.940
JOSEPH MORALES: Seven--
I read somewhere

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.815
that if you write
something down seven times,

00:15:10.815 --> 00:15:12.200
it's in your memory somewhere.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:18.300
And so I don't know if
it's true, but it works.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.930
And so I have
notebooks of just--

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.270
I've written everything in
"Hamilton" down, seven times.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.120
And that's how-- I get so
comfortable with the material

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.699
that I can--

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:30.990
so that I can get free with it.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.310
That's kind of my process.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.690
I'm not really technical.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:35.730
I didn't go to
school for acting.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.570
I've always just kind of
done what feels right.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.170
But for me, to
get to that place,

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.000
I need to know it so well that
I can just let everything go.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.640
So that's kind of my process.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.632
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
How about you, Ari?

00:15:46.632 --> 00:15:48.090
ARI AFSAR: I don't
rap in the show,

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:53.880
so I have a very different
experience with the material.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.920
I think it's very--

00:15:57.432 --> 00:15:59.140
I don't know how to
answer this question.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.223
How to-- preparing for it.

00:16:00.223 --> 00:16:05.460
I mean, I think the main thing
is kind of-- we already touched

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.430
about it a little bit.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.260
I was really intimidated
by the character,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.990
and like, continuing to
portray such a legend,

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.870
and also introducing
this individual.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:18.790
So studying the book, knowing
the Ron Chernow book--

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.605
no, I think most people came
in off-book when we started

00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:22.730
the first day of rehearsal.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.895
So really make sure it was in
your blood and in your body.

00:16:26.895 --> 00:16:29.020
You don't You don't time
to think about the lyrics.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.603
ARI AFSAR: No.

00:16:29.603 --> 00:16:32.225
So you're just working
when you're in rehearsal.

00:16:32.225 --> 00:16:33.100
JOSEPH MORALES: Yeah.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.110
KELLIE FITZGERALD: So since
you've written down everything

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.790
from the show
seven times, what's

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.245
your favorite lyric in the show?

00:16:38.245 --> 00:16:39.370
JOSEPH MORALES: It changes.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.730
There are things that I--

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.130
I think one of my favorite
raps is the "We Know,"

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.690
when they confront him, and--

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:50.590
it's just so fast, so
intricate, and just kind

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.580
of spills out of your mouth.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.890
But it changes, like, sometimes
I'm really into "Hurricane,"

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.390
sometimes--

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.473
I mean, always "Yorktown."

00:16:59.473 --> 00:17:03.550
"Yorktown" is always super fun.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.369
There's so many great songs.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:06.641
It's really hard to answer.

00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:08.349
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
You talked about being

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:09.244
kind of in the scene.

00:17:09.244 --> 00:17:10.660
Is there a favorite
scene of yours

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.390
in the show, whether it's
your scene or one that you're

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.030
in the choreography of?

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.490
ARI AFSAR: I love watching
"Room Where it Happens."

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.630
Because that, to me, is
the transformation of Burr,

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.160
and then we get
to be a part of it

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.540
and comment on it in our own
way, as Eliza, or as whomever

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.400
you're playing.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.710
So that's really cool is
to be behind the scenes,

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.550
but continuing to
be in character.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:41.260
Something that I am
a part of physically,

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.800
downstairs, I love
"That Would Be Enough,"

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.310
because every day
it changes in terms

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:52.010
of the development of
our love for each other,

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.070
or not love for each other.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.210
Every day it changes.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.460
KELLIE FITZGERALD: So I think
about these characters--

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.650
it's hard not to
think about the show

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:00.970
in today's political climate.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:01.870
ARI AFSAR: Mm, of course.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.286
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
And if you guys

00:18:03.286 --> 00:18:07.140
were to be your character in
today's political climate--

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.150
Hamilton, Eliza-- how do
you think they would behave?

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.390
What would their
involvement be if you were

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.910
to put them in today's world?

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.030
ARI AFSAR: Well, I'm really
inspired by this show.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.370
And I think the
only way that I know

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.630
to deal with what the hell is
going on is to work towards it.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.610
And I think that Chicago--

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.110
we've had the
luxury to figure out

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.970
what our voices
are as individuals

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.400
inspired by our characters.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.920
And Chicago is so
receptive of it.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.750
So just earlier this week,
me and Miguel's wife,

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.100
Kelly Cervantes, produced
a benefit concert donating

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.910
to the ACLU with members of
"Hamilton," with a member--

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.660
with the lead of "Aladdin,"
and with local artists--

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.045
Malcolm Woods-- Malcolm
London and Jamila Woods,

00:18:55.045 --> 00:18:55.920
which was incredible.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.610
And we ended up raising--

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.818
I don't know the final number
yet, so I can't say it.

00:18:58.818 --> 00:19:01.920
But bringing art,
individuals of art--

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.280
we had artists like JC Rivera,
who had a gallery donating.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.130
All these local
Chicagoans coming together

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.630
to fight for one cause was
breathtaking and remarkable,

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.672
and something I will
remember the rest of my life.

00:19:15.672 --> 00:19:17.130
So I think that's
the coolest part,

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:21.030
is being able to do the show and
continuing that type of legacy

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:21.990
outside of the show.

00:19:25.595 --> 00:19:27.720
JOSEPH MORALES: I think
Hamilton would be horrified

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.490
about this political climate.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.705
I'm not sure he does fit in.

00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:33.080
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
I was thinking

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.790
about Hamilton and Twitter--

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:38.240
what that would be like,
because he just ran his mouth.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.762
And then he would be able
to publicly run his mouth.

00:19:41.762 --> 00:19:43.220
JOSEPH MORALES:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:43.700
I don't know how things
would pan out for him--

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.324
ARI AFSAR: I think
it'd be a bad thing.

00:19:45.324 --> 00:19:47.250
JOSEPH MORALES: --in this world.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.230
Yeah.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.650
ARI AFSAR: Well, some people
are successful with [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:54.399
KELLIE FITZGERALD: So
what about if you could--

00:19:54.399 --> 00:19:55.940
what about if you
guys could sit down

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.930
to dinner with your character?

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.513
What would you like
to ask them about,

00:19:58.513 --> 00:19:59.930
that maybe could help you--

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.150
you have a curiosity about
as you're portraying them?

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.316
What would they think or do?

00:20:03.316 --> 00:20:05.030
What would you ask them about?

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.196
JOSEPH MORALES: I'm really--

00:20:06.196 --> 00:20:08.510
I think why I love playing
Hamilton so much is just

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.220
his quiet confidence.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.910
I mean, not so quiet all the
time, but just the confidence.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.220
Never questioning himself--
for better or for worse--

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.040
he hurts a lot of people and
in the process of it all,

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.920
but just that confidence.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:28.820
The ability to just speak his
mind and not apologize for it.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.980
I want to know where he
gets that from, and just

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.130
the energy, the nonstop energy.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.830
Which is the same thing that
really fascinates me about Lin.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:40.730
I mean, I think that's why
Lin really, really connected

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.200
with Hamilton's stories.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:47.680
I think they share a
lot of the same DNA.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.970
And that's something I don't
naturally connect with,

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:54.706
but it's thrilling to pretend.

00:20:54.706 --> 00:20:56.330
Yeah, so that would
be my conversation.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.260
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Mm-hmm.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.051
How about you, Ari?

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:04.610
ARI AFSAR: Questioning
everything that happened to her

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.620
and continuing to
find the strength

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.230
to continue his legacy--

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.820
I'm not sure I would have
been able to do that.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.370
And I think that,
especially during that time,

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:20.330
women had to deal
with a lot of stuff--

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.560
negative stuff,
thrown their way.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.210
And so how she continued
to take the high road

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:30.890
and realize the importance of
his story, and of their story.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.132
And also, I think
then, beyond realize--

00:21:33.132 --> 00:21:35.090
I think, my-- actually,
in the question, what's

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.720
your favorite line in
the show, is she says,

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.190
will they tell our story?

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:43.590
And then at the very end
is will they tell my story?

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.510
And I make sure to like
exaggerate the 'my' so people

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.750
hear how she has really
transitioned and changed,

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.060
because I think that's the
final turn turning point,

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.570
and then the show is over.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.360
So trying to figure out
where she found the strength

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.190
to be able to realize that
all the differences they had,

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.149
the story was bigger
than both of them.

00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:08.440
KELLIE FITZGERALD: And the
power of forgiveness, like--

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:08.800
JOSEPH MORALES: Sure.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.230
ARI AFSAR: Yeah.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.460
I couldn't--

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.280
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
Just unbelievable.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.870
JOSEPH MORALES: I lied, I
do have a favorite line.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.760
It's when Burr says at
the end of the show,

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.930
after he kills
Hamilton-- spoiler alert.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:19.377
ARI AFSAR: Well, that's history.

00:22:19.377 --> 00:22:20.960
JOSEPH MORALES: I
was too blind to see

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.510
the world was wide enough
for both Hamilton and me.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.990
And I think that's the
foundation of the show,

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.690
that's--

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:29.267
no matter what you believe
in, the world is wide enough.

00:22:29.267 --> 00:22:30.350
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Mm-hmm.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.150
And that's a great
moment for now.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.430
A reminder for now, as well.

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.496
JOSEPH MORALES: Exactly.

00:22:33.496 --> 00:22:35.015
I think that's why people
really resonate with story

00:22:35.015 --> 00:22:36.015
at this particular time.

00:22:36.015 --> 00:22:37.639
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
I want to give folks

00:22:37.639 --> 00:22:39.520
a chance to line up
and ask some questions.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.750
We will have a few minutes
for audience questions.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.210
And if that clock is right,
we have like, 12 minutes

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.256
for audience questions.

00:22:46.256 --> 00:22:48.380
And let me see what else
I have here, for you guys.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.739
Do you guys know-- so you were
there during tech in Chicago.

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:56.030
The theater's a lot bigger
here than it is in New York.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.030
What adjustments did they make
to the like, actual production

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.310
to accommodate the larger
audience size, the larger

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.615
stage?

00:23:01.615 --> 00:23:02.060
JOSEPH MORALES: We
didn't do anything.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.710
ARI AFSAR: We actually had
a small-- we have a smaller

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:04.640
stage than Broadway.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.420
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Oh,
you have a smaller stage,

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.330
but a bigger theatre?

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:07.220
JOSEPH MORALES: It's just high--

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.928
the way the Private
Bank is, it's higher.

00:23:08.928 --> 00:23:11.262
There were more tiers, so
really everyone's as close up,

00:23:11.262 --> 00:23:12.178
but you're just high--

00:23:12.178 --> 00:23:14.780
ARI AFSAR: Yeah, you're looking
up to the final-- it's crazy.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.100
So you don't look
up to the last row.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.470
JOSEPH MORALES: So more seats,
but just as intimate I think.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.830
ARI AFSAR: Yeah.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.430
But I mean, yeah.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.200
A little bit of staging
differences because the stage

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:21.740
is a little bit smaller.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.530
So our numbers are a little
bit different than Broadway.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:25.090
But nothing--

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:25.910
JOSEPH MORALES: You're
going to get the same show.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.590
They didn't really
change anything.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.590
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Yeah.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.100
Awesome.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:29.813
Go ahead.

00:23:29.813 --> 00:23:30.600
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.152
So I mean, I think,
to some extent,

00:23:32.152 --> 00:23:33.860
"Hamilton" is just
lightning in a bottle,

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.776
but if you had to pick
another historical time

00:23:35.776 --> 00:23:40.130
period or historical personality
to do a similar take on,

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.700
with hip-hop and modern
vision of history,

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.938
what other time period or
personality would you pick?

00:23:46.938 --> 00:23:50.450
ARI AFSAR: Oh, that's
a good question.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.797
Can we can we dial
in to Lin on this?

00:23:53.797 --> 00:23:55.380
JOSEPH MORALES: Can
we phone a friend?

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.340
ARI AFSAR: Yeah.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.590
That's what I was thinking of.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:58.220
JOSEPH MORALES: I don't know.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.780
I mean, not now, I think we'd
have to wait a couple of years.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:04.841
But I think a musical about
Obama would be amazing.

00:24:04.841 --> 00:24:05.840
ARI AFSAR: And Michelle.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.334
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Mm-hmm.

00:24:07.334 --> 00:24:08.292
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:24:08.292 --> 00:24:09.824
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
Yes, for sure.

00:24:09.824 --> 00:24:12.987
For sure.

00:24:12.987 --> 00:24:13.820
JOSEPH MORALES: Lin?

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.319
Lin?

00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:18.370
KELLIE FITZGERALD: We have
some questions from Googlers

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:19.235
here, too, so.

00:24:19.235 --> 00:24:20.860
I thought I'd paid
attention in school,

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.140
but I was surprised at some
of the US history tidbits

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.130
throughout "Hamilton."

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.770
What was the most
interesting history fact

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.142
that you guys learned?

00:24:28.142 --> 00:24:30.600
JOSEPH MORALES: I don't remember
Hamilton in school either.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.725
And I think that's what's--

00:24:31.725 --> 00:24:33.112
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.190
ARI AFSAR: Most people
think he was a president.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.440
JOSEPH MORALES: I think
that's what's incredible also,

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.439
is that it's getting kids
interested in history.

00:24:40.439 --> 00:24:42.520
And it's bringing
this black and white--

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.180
whatever-- off the
page and coloring it.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:47.881
And--

00:24:50.009 --> 00:24:51.550
ARI AFSAR: I remember
five years ago,

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.110
people were talking about--

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:56.740
they wanted to switch Alexander
Hamilton off the $10 bill

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.057
to Harriet Tubman, right?

00:24:58.057 --> 00:24:59.140
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Mm-hmm.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:24:59.500
JOSEPH MORALES: Yeah.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:24:59.810
ARI AFSAR: That's what we--

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.400
JOSEPH MORALES: And "Hamilton,"
the show, changed that.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:02.800
ARI AFSAR: Changed that.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.150
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Yes.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:03.360
JOSEPH MORALES: That's crazy.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.480
ARI AFSAR: And now,
we're like, oh, he's--

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.364
and I think actually,
the coolest part--

00:25:06.364 --> 00:25:07.780
a little bit about
him is the fact

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.580
that he accomplished
so much, but they

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:13.670
don't revere him as being
the best person in the world.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:15.670
They talk about the good,
the bad, and the ugly,

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.710
and that, really,
is what happens

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.700
when you're trying to do
bigger things than yourself.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.860
That it's not always going
to be a perfect story.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.120
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Yeah.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.220
My husband won't
spend $10 bills.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.182
He like, hangs on to them now.

00:25:29.182 --> 00:25:30.640
ARI AFSAR: Well,
when we sign them,

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.570
I'm like, but isn't
that defacing money?

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.470
Are you sure you want
to sign your $10 bill?

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:35.470
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Yeah.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:36.940
He saved the $10--

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.250
the show saved Hamilton
on the $10 bill.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:39.530
ARI AFSAR: That's cool.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:40.120
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Go ahead.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.465
We have a couple more
audience questions.

00:25:41.465 --> 00:25:41.865
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:41.865 --> 00:25:43.720
Tell us a little bit
about your experiences

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.270
on Wednesday afternoons
with "Hamilton" EduHam.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.260
JOSEPH MORALES: Oh man.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.740
So we do-- it's
called EduHam and they

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.720
work with Title I schools.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.010
In Chicago alone, 20,000
kids-- sophomores-- in Chicago,

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.080
will see the show for $10 each--

00:25:59.080 --> 00:25:59.970
ARI AFSAR: A year.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.477
JOSEPH MORALES: A year.

00:26:01.477 --> 00:26:02.560
And every company does it.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.230
So it'll be 20,000 in New
York, 20,000 in San Francisco.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.240
They'll do it on tour, as well.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.790
The kids study
Hamilton for like,

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.770
three months before
seeing the show.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.380
They put together
their performances

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:18.490
to do for us in the morning,
and then that afternoon, we

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.650
perform the show for them.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:26.495
And it's 2,000 of these
excited, incredible kids.

00:26:26.495 --> 00:26:28.370
I mean, the future, who
would never otherwise

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:29.710
be able to see the show.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:30.370
It's--

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:31.994
ARI AFSAR: And that's
what's important.

00:26:31.994 --> 00:26:33.920
I mean, the show's
really expensive to see.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.119
JOSEPH MORALES:
They're like, yeah.

00:26:37.119 --> 00:26:39.243
KELLIE FITZGERALD: People
are sort of like, uh-huh.

00:26:39.243 --> 00:26:41.930
ARI AFSAR: It's really expensive
and difficult to get a ticket,

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.950
like I've experienced, as well.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:46.220
So I think that those
are the people that

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.860
need to be seeing the show.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.770
And I'm really grateful that we
have the opportunity, because

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.810
of the people that are
also sitting right here.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:55.100
JOSEPH MORALES: And it's
something our producers

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.720
really, really care about.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.310
I mean, it was all
they're doing, so.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.880
And we also have the lottery,
which they've doubled.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.630
I mean, we do--

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:03.380
I think we have--

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:03.695
ARI AFSAR: 40.

00:27:03.695 --> 00:27:04.570
JOSEPH MORALES: Yeah.

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:05.120
AUDIENCE: 44.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:05.480
ARI AFSAR: Four.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.640
JOSEPH MORALES: 44, which
is more than most shows,

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.140
for $10 a ticket.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:13.080
ARI AFSAR: And you get to see
the spit off of the actors--

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.900
and feel it, probably.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.510
KELLIE FITZGERALD: So that's
actually a really great segue.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.280
We have a very
exciting announcement.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:24.230
Google is going to be sponsoring
an EduHam on April 26th, so--

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:25.632
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:27:25.632 --> 00:27:27.590
KELLIE FITZGERALD: So
yeah, it's very exciting.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.710
I think 20--

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.640
22 CPS schools will
be in attendance

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.670
on that day-- about
22 CPS schools.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.950
You guys already
heard, the program

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.130
itself is really phenomenal.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.820
The students, right now, are
studying Alexander Hamilton

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.000
and planning their performances.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.750
They'll actually face
off in their schools

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.850
and then decide who gets
to go on stage that day,

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.230
which is super awesome.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.114
They'll do a Q&amp;A with
the cast and then

00:27:51.114 --> 00:27:53.280
they'll get to stay that
afternoon and see the show.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.170
And the exciting part
of the announcement

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.990
is that the "Hamilton" folks,
here, in the front row,

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.060
have offered Googlers
the opportunity

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.980
to get any no-show
tickets on that day.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.910
So if there are any
empty seats, there

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:10.080
is a lottery that you can
enter and go/shy/Hamilton.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.090
And you will find
out that morning

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.490
if you get a seat or not
in the afternoon matinee.

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:17.760
So very special thanks to Rob
and our Community Relations

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.420
Team, who's working with the
Gilder Lehrman Foundation--

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.970
thank you, I knew I was
going to mess that up--

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.370
on this amazing program
and super excited to be--

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:27.495
to be a part of it.

00:28:27.495 --> 00:28:29.820
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:28:33.405 --> 00:28:35.780
AUDIENCE: You guys mentioned
how the show is exhausting--

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.950
a three hour show, you
perform eight times in a week.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.340
You've already been doing it
for months with no end in sight.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.370
How do you guys
prevent yourselves

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.560
from just going
through the motions?

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.130
How do you find energy in
every single performance

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:54.560
to sustain you for the whole
entire week, month, etc.?

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.190
ARI AFSAR: Coffee.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:00.250
So I'm going to be coming
to Google and going to--

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:01.540
what was his name again?

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:01.900
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Carter--

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:02.260
ARI AFSAR: Carter--

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.460
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
Connor, Connor.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.572
ARI AFSAR: Connor and get
those lattes every day.

00:29:05.572 --> 00:29:06.280
They are so good.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.780
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
They are so good.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.210
ARI AFSAR: I think one thing--

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.540
in the very beginning,
it was really difficult,

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.560
because this was my first
time doing eight shows a week.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.900
So that was hard to
be able to figure out

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.110
what's my vocal regimen?

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.650
But I think one thing
that I've learned the most

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.650
is because I have been
doing eight shows a week,

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.890
I'm very much a
perfectionist, and every show

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.060
needs to be so perfect.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.400
And that's the
mentality that I've had.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.730
And I've had to let that go.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:34.780
I cracked last night.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.940
And I was telling
Joseph, two months ago, I

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.560
would have come
off stage, crying.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.320
And that's what happened the
first time that I cracked.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.650
And during "Satisfied," I
was crying the entire time.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.762
And this time I was like,
well, that's live theater.

00:29:47.762 --> 00:29:48.470
Got to let it go.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.080
JOSEPH MORALES: It really is.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.130
And with this show, I mean,
there's just so many words

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.870
and there's so much
to do, you're just--

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.120
if I get through a show
without messing up, I'm like,

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.775
oh, it's coming.

00:29:56.775 --> 00:29:58.400
I don't know when
it's going to happen,

00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.200
but it's going to happen.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.580
But it's been the
biggest lesson.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.610
And I think that if you
asked anybody in the cast,

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.160
they would tell you that just
being able to just let go

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.450
and not take it so seriously.

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.150
Take your job so seriously,
but just have fun with it

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:11.080
at the same time.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.981
That's so liberating.

00:30:11.981 --> 00:30:13.480
ARI AFSAR: It's
more about the story

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.290
than it is about vocal
perfection or lyric perfection,

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.850
or any type of perfection.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.765
You want to feel the
actors being together--

00:30:22.765 --> 00:30:25.090
JOSEPH MORALES: And that's
how I think we get through,

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:26.410
I think is just staying
present with each other.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.160
If I don't feel like
I have enough energy,

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.190
I just like, focus into
Ari, and some I get it.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.648
ARI AFSAR: And then
I start crying,

00:30:31.648 --> 00:30:33.765
and I'm like, what
are you doing to me?

00:30:33.765 --> 00:30:36.892
The last night we performed,
I was tearing up at

00:30:36.892 --> 00:30:37.850
"That Would Be Enough."

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.850
And I had never experienced
"That Would Be Enough"

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:40.349
that way.

00:30:40.349 --> 00:30:42.790
And that's the
coolest opportunity,

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.130
is to be able to
experience and share

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.387
a different story every night.

00:30:46.387 --> 00:30:48.220
JOSEPH MORALES: And the
audience helps, too.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.900
I mean, the audience
is-- you're tired

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.940
and then you get out there
and the audience is just crazy

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.450
and gives you the
energy that you need,

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:54.366
which is really great.

00:30:55.742 --> 00:30:57.950
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Oh, we
got little ones at the mic.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:58.400
ARI AFSAR: Hi.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.441
JOSEPH MORALES: Hi, guys.

00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:01.370
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Like,
they're down there.

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:02.210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:03.515
My name is Hanson.

00:31:03.515 --> 00:31:04.940
ARI AFSAR: Hi Hanson.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.442
AUDIENCE: And how do you
get ready for the kiss?

00:31:08.442 --> 00:31:09.404
ARI AFSAR: Oh!

00:31:15.102 --> 00:31:16.560
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
That is amazing.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.640
ARI AFSAR: Oh my god.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.850
So, OK, I'll tell a
really funny story.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:24.011
During rehearsals, I was
really nervous about the kiss,

00:31:24.011 --> 00:31:26.010
because I didn't know
when it was going to come.

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:27.540
When were we going
to start kissing?

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:31.650
Because-- and so I
pulled our director aside

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.140
and I was like, I'm not
making a big deal about this,

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.600
but when do we kiss?

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.250
When is it actually
going to happen?

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.260
And then Tommy,
completely embarrassed me

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.600
and made a big deal about it.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.016
So-- I don't--

00:31:45.016 --> 00:31:47.722
So, just doing it, I guess.

00:31:47.722 --> 00:31:52.550
I don't-- I have a huge
crush on Joseph, so--

00:31:55.785 --> 00:31:57.709
JOSEPH MORALES: [CLEARS THROAT]

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:02.930
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
The kid's like, I

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:03.980
don't think I got an answer.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.855
JOSEPH MORALES: Yeah.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.060
AUDIENCE: Why do you think
Alexander Hamilton was

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.064
wearing his glasses
on the-- duel he died?

00:32:14.064 --> 00:32:15.036
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Ooh.

00:32:15.036 --> 00:32:16.010
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:17.926
JOSEPH MORALES: Why is
everyone looking at me?

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.210
Why was he wearing his glasses?

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:29.390
I don't-- for me, and this is
a conversation I've had with

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:30.290
the director--

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:33.170
did Hamilton go, knowing
that he was going to die?

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:38.540
Did he think that
Burr would pull out?

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:43.930
I think that he meant
serious business.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:48.510
But I think he was prepared for
it to go in either direction.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.600
And I mean, which is why he
wrote Eliza before leaving.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.110
And I think he hoped that it
would turn out differently,

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.385
but he believed in the legacy.

00:33:01.485 --> 00:33:03.360
ARI AFSAR: So why was
he wearing his glasses?

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.330
He was prepared.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.205
JOSEPH MORALES: He wanted
to-- he wanted to--

00:33:09.205 --> 00:33:10.122
yeah, he was prepared.

00:33:10.122 --> 00:33:11.871
KELLIE FITZGERALD: I
think one of the best

00:33:11.871 --> 00:33:13.392
things about the
show is not only

00:33:13.392 --> 00:33:15.975
do you learn about history that
you might not have been taught

00:33:15.975 --> 00:33:17.599
in school, but you
leave with questions

00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:19.510
that you have a hunger
to explore more,

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.760
and long conversations
about like,

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.110
did this really
happen intentionally,

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.070
was it not intentional?

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.445
ARI AFSAR: And
you can Google it.

00:33:26.445 --> 00:33:28.180
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Yes.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:28.930
Thank you.

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:32.266
Excellent.

00:33:32.266 --> 00:33:33.218
Go ahead.

00:33:33.218 --> 00:33:35.470
AUDIENCE: One of my favorite
things about "Hamilton"

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:37.840
as a musical is how
deep the lyrics are

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.160
and how many layers they have.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.110
So they're inspired
by so many things,

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:42.670
they have double meanings.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.374
Do you have favorite
segments of songs or lyrics

00:33:45.374 --> 00:33:47.290
where you've like,
realized the deeper meaning

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.450
or really love the reference
that Lin is making?

00:33:52.792 --> 00:33:55.000
ARI AFSAR: I don't know if
it's like, deeper meaning,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.150
but I love how many times
that things are repeated

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.470
and then they have a
completely different context.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:04.984
So "History Has Its Eyes on
You" is in the very beginning,

00:34:04.984 --> 00:34:06.900
and then introduced in
a very different scene,

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.219
and it makes you think
about it very differently.

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:14.280
So that type of repetition
is really beautiful,

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.609
because a lot of times
repetition is repetition,

00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:18.900
but it's really just placing
it at a different location

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.530
and then meaning something
completely different.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:21.600
And I think the
coolest thing, also,

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.183
is that everybody
takes away something

00:34:23.183 --> 00:34:25.739
very different by the
exact same lyrics.

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:28.440
So it's your personal
experience that

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.749
changes the meaning for you.

00:34:29.749 --> 00:34:30.832
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Mm-hmm.

00:34:30.832 --> 00:34:34.030
Were you guys big hip-hop
and rap fans before the show?

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:37.783
Did the influence of that music
inspire you as you prepared?

00:34:37.783 --> 00:34:40.199
ARI AFSAR: I mean, I didn't
know that it was the "10 Crack

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:44.310
Commandments," so I had
to do research on that.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:47.760
So in terms of knowing
all of the references, no.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.489
But I think it
inspired my musical--

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:52.390
my Spotify playlist
is very different now.

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:53.473
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Mm-hmm.

00:34:53.473 --> 00:34:54.655
How about you, Joseph?

00:34:54.655 --> 00:34:55.530
JOSEPH MORALES: Yeah.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:58.080
I mean, it just gave me
a deeper appreciation

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.040
for that whole world, the
freestyle world, the rap world.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:07.580
I didn't necessarily listen
to it on my own, but yeah.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:11.902
It's pretty incredible what
they do, and what Lin does and--

00:35:11.902 --> 00:35:12.860
ARI AFSAR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.370
JOSEPH MORALES: Yeah.

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.203
I mean, "Heights" was
kind of my first intro

00:35:15.203 --> 00:35:18.690
into that whole world.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.526
Yeah, it opened my eyes, because
I never really listened to it.

00:35:21.526 --> 00:35:24.150
KELLIE FITZGERALD: We were lucky
enough to have Jeremy McCarter

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:27.631
here, who co-wrote the actual
show book with Lin, and--

00:35:27.631 --> 00:35:29.130
ARI AFSAR: Because
he's a Chicagoan.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:29.850
KELLIE FITZGERALD: He is, yeah.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:31.680
He spoke right
before the holidays.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.629
And it was very interesting
to talk with him about how

00:35:34.629 --> 00:35:36.420
he wanted this-- they
both wanted this book

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.850
to be different than your
typical coffee table show book.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.980
And he didn't realize until
sitting down with him,

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.900
how deep all of the
references went.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.970
So the annotations
in that book are

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.140
so fun to read on their own.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.420
And I have formed playlists,
just like you guys said.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.045
Oh, I should listen
to these songs that

00:35:51.045 --> 00:35:52.350
are just in the annotations.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.470
We probably have time
for two more questions.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:55.166
Go ahead.

00:35:55.166 --> 00:35:55.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.105
Coincidentally,
we're actually going

00:35:57.105 --> 00:35:57.885
to go see the show tonight.

00:35:57.885 --> 00:35:58.926
JOSEPH MORALES: Oh, nice.

00:35:58.926 --> 00:36:02.529
AUDIENCE: Any advice
for a first-timer?

00:36:02.529 --> 00:36:04.320
ARI AFSAR: So are you
like a real Hamilfan?

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.160
AUDIENCE: I'm about to be.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.210
ARI AFSAR: So you
didn't listen--

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.460
you didn't listen to anything?

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.264
AUDIENCE: No.

00:36:11.264 --> 00:36:12.210
I haven't.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:12.735
ARI AFSAR: That's a choice.

00:36:12.735 --> 00:36:14.151
JOSEPH MORALES: I
think it's cool.

00:36:14.151 --> 00:36:17.285
I think watching it, not really
knowing, just watching the show

00:36:17.285 --> 00:36:18.660
and then going
back and listening

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.016
to it is the way to do it.

00:36:20.016 --> 00:36:21.390
That's how I
discovered the show.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.794
I saw it first and then got
obsessed with the album.

00:36:23.794 --> 00:36:24.710
ARI AFSAR: It's just--

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.376
then, I would recommend
seeing it again.

00:36:29.724 --> 00:36:30.390
No, but I mean--

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:32.556
I mean, obviously, the
tickets are really expensive.

00:36:32.556 --> 00:36:37.590
But I mean, there's so
much information to absorb.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.360
My parents have
seen it five times.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.540
And every time that
they see it-- granted,

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.790
their daughter's in the show--

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:46.170
but like, there's like,
different things that they pick

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:49.724
up on because the choreography
is making a message,

00:36:49.724 --> 00:36:52.140
the lyrics are making a message,
the actors are making a--

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.520
JOSEPH MORALES: There's a
whole world going on upstairs

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.480
on the second level.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.340
ARI AFSAR: And I envy--

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.610
tell them what my
designated role that I have.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.850
JOSEPH MORALES: Oh, she is--

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.840
ARI AFSAR: You can be
a little more excited.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.340
JOSEPH MORALES: This is
also self-appointed--

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.042
ARI AFSAR: No!

00:37:07.042 --> 00:37:08.310
No, it was not.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.297
I am the surround dance captain.

00:37:11.297 --> 00:37:13.630
JOSEPH MORALES: Which means
she's in charge of everybody

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:16.590
else's choreography on the
second-- on the top level--

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.795
"in her mind."

00:37:17.795 --> 00:37:20.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.860
ARI AFSAR: Stephanie, our
associate choreographer

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.100
appointed me as that.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.990
I don't get extra money for it.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.830
It is on my resume.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.879
So I challenge you to look up
at the surround once in a while.

00:37:35.879 --> 00:37:37.670
JOSEPH MORALES: No,
it's pretty incredible.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:38.950
I get to watch the show
a lot because I'm not

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.230
on all the time, and
there are still things

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.000
that I'm catching up on top.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.840
I mean, it's so
specific, so thought out.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.661
So just try to take
in what you can, and--

00:37:48.661 --> 00:37:49.660
ARI AFSAR: See it again.

00:37:52.447 --> 00:37:53.780
KELLIE FITZGERALD: And enjoy it.

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:53.970
ARI AFSAR: Yeah.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:55.136
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Go ahead.

00:37:56.529 --> 00:37:58.570
AUDIENCE: First of all,
I want to thank you, Ari,

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:01.960
for making my husband cry
three times during the show--

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.380
just phenomenal.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.130
ARI AFSAR: I mean,
those lyrics are just--

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:06.213
AUDIENCE: They're amazing.

00:38:06.213 --> 00:38:08.610
You guys are just top-notch,
and thank you for that.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.590
And I wonder what you tell to
the children in the schools

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:14.890
that you work with and what
you would say to my children

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:18.070
for how to get to the
place that you're at?

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.630
Because there's local
theater, which is great.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.720
And then there's local
teachers, but what's

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.955
in that gap between
those who kind of stay

00:38:24.955 --> 00:38:26.830
at the local theater
and those who

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:28.240
can get to where you are at?

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.510
And what suggestions might
you give for students

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.500
who really want to--

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.458
ARI AFSAR: Well, I think
everybody's experience

00:38:34.458 --> 00:38:35.810
is completely different.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:41.440
So my advice is to not be so
focused and narrow-minded,

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.860
and put your marbles up into
a lot of different baskets,

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.020
and just really love
everything that you're doing,

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.850
because you will be surprised.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.120
Before this show, I
was working on my EP--

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:52.840
I'm a songwriter.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.480
And so that's where my
mind was at completely.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.100
And then I just went, well, let
me just try-- just being open.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.390
So being open, but also what's
opportunity-- like prepare--

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:02.710
or what's the statement?

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.169
What's-- preparedness
and luck is opportunity?

00:39:05.169 --> 00:39:07.210
So making sure that you're
prepared in everything

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:09.610
that you love to do.

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:13.210
That's-- I wish I could tell
my 13-year-old self that things

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.002
are going to be OK.

00:39:14.002 --> 00:39:15.001
JOSEPH MORALES: Totally.

00:39:15.001 --> 00:39:17.350
And just to have fun and
not take it so seriously,

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:18.310
but work hard.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:19.160
ARI AFSAR: Yeah.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.035
JOSEPH MORALES: Yeah.

00:39:20.035 --> 00:39:23.830
I went through a
really tough period

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.900
where I was just kind of empty.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.070
And somebody told
me, have fun or quit.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.300
And that really kind of
flipped a switch in me.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.304
It was like, if I
don't love doing this,

00:39:34.304 --> 00:39:36.220
and if I'm not doing it
for the right reasons,

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.590
if I'm not willing to die
trying, do something else.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.260
Yeah

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.218
And I think if you have
that kind of mentality,

00:39:41.218 --> 00:39:43.540
where you're just doing
it because you love it,

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:47.260
and you continue the work
and you stay in class,

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.790
I mean, the work never ends.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.924
You just got to be willing to--

00:39:50.924 --> 00:39:52.090
ARI AFSAR: You're going to--

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:55.417
yeah, and you're going to find
what you're passionate about.

00:39:55.417 --> 00:39:57.250
I wanted to be better
at piano, for example,

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:58.480
but I never practiced.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.000
Whereas singing and acting,
I would be in classes

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.030
or I would be picking
up extra shifts

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.844
so I could pay for
my acting classes,

00:40:05.844 --> 00:40:07.260
because I just
loved it that much.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.884
And I think that's
just really telling.

00:40:12.157 --> 00:40:13.990
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Other
audience questions?

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:19.110
So we already talked
about this first one here.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:22.070
Oh, thank you.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:24.120
Can you scroll up just
a teeny bit, sorry?

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:24.680
Sorry.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.709
I saw-- OK, there we go.

00:40:25.709 --> 00:40:27.250
Oh just-- they're
question went away.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:27.890
ARI AFSAR: It looks like
it was hand-activated.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:29.140
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.880
ARI AFSAR: Oh wow,
it's not, but--

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.490
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
Sorry, I wish--

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:32.750
I wish you guys could see this.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.208
It would be a lot
more entertaining

00:40:34.208 --> 00:40:35.920
if you knew what we were doing.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:36.980
JOSEPH MORALES: Well,
I think, keep going.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:38.480
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
Yeah, keep going.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.638
There's a question for Joseph.

00:40:43.886 --> 00:40:44.520
There you go.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.061
There you go.

00:40:45.061 --> 00:40:45.710
There you go.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:46.585
ARI AFSAR: Joseph Morales!

00:40:46.585 --> 00:40:48.959
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Who else,
Joseph-- yeah, it's yelling.

00:40:48.959 --> 00:40:50.150
It's shouting at you.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:52.655
Who would be an unsung
historical figure

00:40:52.655 --> 00:40:53.270
who deserves--

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:54.020
JOSEPH MORALES: Unsung?

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:54.250
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Yeah.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:54.750
Yeah.

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:56.630
Pun-- I love puns and wordplay.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.850
Who deserves the "Hamilton"
treatment in history?

00:40:58.850 --> 00:40:59.640
Well, we already said, Obama.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.360
JOSEPH MORALES: I
guess, maybe Bernie.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:01.755
ARI AFSAR: He's not unsung.

00:41:01.755 --> 00:41:02.470
AUDIENCE: Aww.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.945
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.772
JOSEPH MORALES: Just me?

00:41:12.772 --> 00:41:14.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:16.120
ARI AFSAR: Hashtag #ImWithHer.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.244
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:18.244 --> 00:41:19.660
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
We could really

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.790
take this panel in a
different direction now.

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:22.070
JOSEPH MORALES:
Yeah, I mean, I would

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.950
like to see both of
those musicals, actually.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:26.464
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
This is my style.

00:41:26.464 --> 00:41:28.380
ARI AFSAR: I just imagined
the Bernie musical.

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.100
KELLIE FITZGERALD: You
know that really famous--

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.648
ARI AFSAR: Another
old white man.

00:41:34.648 --> 00:41:35.975
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:35.975 --> 00:41:37.600
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
That famous question

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.739
about who would play you in
the movie/musical of your life?

00:41:40.739 --> 00:41:43.030
Who would play Bernie in the
movie/musical of his life?

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.572
ARI AFSAR: Oh, well, the
guy who played him on "SNL."

00:41:45.572 --> 00:41:46.780
Why am I forgetting his name?

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:47.270
AUDIENCE: Larry David.

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:48.330
JOSEPH MORALES:
Who played Bernie?

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:49.280
ARI AFSAR: Blah, blah, blah.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.321
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Oh,
Larry David did, actually.

00:41:51.321 --> 00:41:52.810
Everybody's like, Larry David.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:53.994
ARI AFSAR: Larry David.

00:41:53.994 --> 00:41:54.910
KELLIE FITZGERALD: OK.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.035
So yeah, you guys have had
a couple of Aaron Burr's

00:41:57.035 --> 00:41:58.255
come in and out of the show.

00:41:58.255 --> 00:41:59.650
JOSEPH MORALES: Oh, Joshua
Henry is incredible.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:00.983
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Yeah, Joshua.

00:42:00.983 --> 00:42:01.990
ARI AFSAR: Amazing.

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.610
He's incredible.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:05.230
He started the
show with us, so we

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:09.310
were and six weeks of
rehearsal with Joshua Henry.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:12.940
So he feels still, like a
part of the Chicago family.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.980
But Wayne is incredible
and it's been--

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.970
and I'm a huge Wayne fan.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.890
Everybody in this
front row knows

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:25.180
how obsessed I was with
Wayne I was before he came.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.800
And then he ended up being the
coolest and awesome person,

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.334
and so talented, but also a
very different take on Burr.

00:42:31.334 --> 00:42:33.250
And so that's why I'm
like to all my friends--

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.890
you have to see the
difference, because it really--

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:38.500
every person that
comes in to any role

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.420
really changes the feel
and the mood of the show.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.410
So Daniel Breaker's coming
in, starting next week,

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:46.630
and I am so excited
and enthused to be

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.300
able to see how the show
once again transforms.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.755
JOSEPH MORALES: Yeah.

00:42:50.755 --> 00:42:53.130
KELLIE FITZGERALD: How do they
do tech in that situation.

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:54.120
Is he already rehearsing?

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:54.994
JOSEPH MORALES: Yeah.

00:42:54.994 --> 00:42:57.560
I'm leaving from here to
rehearsal with Daniel.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.970
ARI AFSAR: And then we all
have a put-in on Friday.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:01.620
KELLIE FITZGERALD: And then
he just picks up on Tuesday?

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.250
JOSEPH MORALES: Yeah,
he's been rehearsing

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:03.125
the past month or so.

00:43:03.125 --> 00:43:04.083
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Wow.

00:43:04.083 --> 00:43:05.600
JOSEPH MORALES:
So he's been here,

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.640
but just rehearsing on his
own with our stage managers

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.887
and choreographer.

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:11.470
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
That's fascinating.

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.260
It's almost like you're
getting on a moving train.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:13.515
JOSEPH MORALES: Exactly.

00:43:13.515 --> 00:43:15.757
And then they'll just
throw him in and we go.

00:43:15.757 --> 00:43:16.715
ARI AFSAR: It's insane.

00:43:16.715 --> 00:43:18.360
And he's an incredible cook.

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.336
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Ooh.

00:43:19.336 --> 00:43:20.460
JOSEPH MORALES: I mean--

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:20.960
magic.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:21.876
ARI AFSAR: No, no, no.

00:43:21.876 --> 00:43:22.940
Follow him on Instagram.

00:43:24.674 --> 00:43:25.590
KELLIE FITZGERALD: OK.

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.150
How about one more
question from the audience?

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:28.440
AUDIENCE: I can't
get over there.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.200
KELLIE FITZGERALD: That's OK.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.658
I'll repeat it for
the live stream.

00:43:30.658 --> 00:43:31.432
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:31.432 --> 00:43:33.240
So I was at the
performance where

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.810
Wayne did two or
three songs, and then

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.205
something snapped in
his ankle or something,

00:43:38.205 --> 00:43:39.155
and he had to stop?

00:43:39.155 --> 00:43:40.976
And then the understudy came on.

00:43:40.976 --> 00:43:42.850
ARI AFSAR: How incredible
is that understudy?

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:43.962
AUDIENCE: That's what
I was going to ask--

00:43:43.962 --> 00:43:46.145
was it his first time
performing that, because--

00:43:46.145 --> 00:43:49.390
JOSEPH MORALES: Not first, but
he hadn't done it many times.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:52.247
ARI AFSAR: Well, and also
to pick up in the-- he was

00:43:52.247 --> 00:43:53.830
on for another track,
and to pick up--

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:54.820
JOSEPH MORALES: It was seamless.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:55.740
Just suddenly--

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.260
AUDIENCE: It was amazing.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.718
ARI AFSAR: Well, I didn't really
know until I was on stage.

00:43:58.718 --> 00:44:00.055
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:01.085 --> 00:44:03.460
ARI AFSAR: And then I was
like-- well, I mean, and that's

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:04.835
live theater,
though, too, right?

00:44:04.835 --> 00:44:07.040
I mean, [INAUDIBLE] happens.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.730
And so you have to be able
to be prepared and be ready

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:10.810
all the time.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:13.090
And also know and be
prepared for that happening.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:15.430
Like even the other day,
I was going on stage

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.320
and one of our swings,
Jean, came up to me.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.570
He was like, oh, I'm
on four, man six.

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:21.190
Right before "Ten
Duel Commandments."

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:23.950
I'm like, oh, OK, let's go.

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:25.870
You just have to
be ready for that.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:28.110
But that means those swings--

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:29.190
this cast is so--

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.450
JOSEPH MORALES:
Everyone's just so good.

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.720
ARI AFSAR: --freaking talented.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.700
It's insane.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.819
So I mean, that takes brain
power to be able to do that.

00:44:35.819 --> 00:44:37.360
KELLIE FITZGERALD:
It's interesting--

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.950
I think we're
working in this time

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:41.410
where everybody's
attention is so divided.

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:43.612
You're always doing a number
of things at one time,

00:44:43.612 --> 00:44:45.070
especially in jobs
like ours, where

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:47.170
you're in front of a computer
or you're in a video chat,

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:47.870
or whatever.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:50.620
You guys truly have to be
present while performing.

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.950
You can't be really thinking
about or doing anything else.

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:56.770
How did those couple of
hours compare, contrast

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:58.782
to the rest of your day-to life?

00:44:58.782 --> 00:45:00.365
JOSEPH MORALES: Well,
it's a blessing.

00:45:00.365 --> 00:45:01.711
ARI AFSAR: Yeah.

00:45:01.711 --> 00:45:02.210
Yeah.

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:04.610
Actually, in preparing even
just for the ACLU event,

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:06.317
there was a lot of
stress right before.

00:45:06.317 --> 00:45:08.150
And I was looking forward
to the three hours

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:09.920
where I know what's
going to happen.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.710
And I know what I have to say
and I know where I have to go,

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.320
and that's all I
have to think about.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.778
JOSEPH MORALES: You know you're
going to get what you need.

00:45:17.778 --> 00:45:20.220
You don't know about
that in your life, yeah.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.070
ARI AFSAR: So that
is a blessing.

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:25.370
But for me, there are times
where I do need to check out,

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:26.940
especially during
the second act.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.910
And I have a couple--

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:32.924
I have kind of a big break
after "That Would Be Enough."

00:45:32.924 --> 00:45:34.340
No, after "Room
Where it Happens,"

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.360
before "One Last Time."

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.860
So I can go down
to my dressing room

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:40.510
and I can check out a little
bit, because the next 30

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:43.160
minutes are just really
emotionally exhausting.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.680
And I have to be
present in that moment,

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.130
even backstage, the entire time.

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:54.280
So I need a little bit of time
on social media or whatever,

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.890
in order to prepare for
that emotionally draining

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:57.490
30 minutes.

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:58.990
JOSEPH MORALES: I don't even
go back to my dressing room.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:00.190
ARI AFSAR: Well, he doesn't
have enough time, yeah.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.890
JOSEPH MORALES: Once the show
starts, I don't have a moment.

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:04.450
When I'm not on
stage, I'm changing.

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:06.283
So it's like [SNAPS FINGERS]
I mean, really,

00:46:06.283 --> 00:46:07.685
just [SNAPS FINGERS] it's over.

00:46:07.685 --> 00:46:10.060
KELLIE FITZGERALD: And what
do you guys do to recharge in

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:13.057
between shows, on days off?

00:46:13.057 --> 00:46:15.140
JOSEPH MORALES: Well, I've
got my napping station.

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:17.144
Not as glamorous as yours.

00:46:17.144 --> 00:46:19.060
ARI AFSAR: So if Google
would like to donate--

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.528
JOSEPH MORALES: Mine's a pillow
under my dressing room counter.

00:46:22.528 --> 00:46:26.050
ARI AFSAR: Rolling of the eyes.

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:26.796
Yeah.

00:46:26.796 --> 00:46:27.670
I think that we all--

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:29.830
I mean, we didn't really
have a break this week.

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:33.155
We did the ACLU event on Monday.

00:46:33.155 --> 00:46:35.530
And then we're going to be
singing at Notre Dame in like,

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:36.030
two weeks.

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:41.761
So those outside experiences
is what refuels me.

00:46:41.761 --> 00:46:44.260
But then, you know what I mean,
I just got a 55-inch TV, so.

00:46:45.959 --> 00:46:48.250
KELLIE FITZGERALD: There's
also some Netflix happening.

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:49.990
ARI AFSAR: I mean.

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:52.870
I am a TV junkie.

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:55.334
I always find time.

00:46:55.334 --> 00:46:56.500
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Go ahead.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.260
This will be our last
question by the way, you guys.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:58.760
Sorry.

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.320
AUDIENCE: So much pressure--

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.230
can you speak to what
it means in history,

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:09.160
in the sense that the cast is
made up entirely of minorities.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.230
What does that mean to you?

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:13.570
ARI AFSAR: Yeah, absolutely.

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:17.350
The fact that my
last name is Schuyler

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:20.170
and that my sisters
have absolutely

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:25.820
different ethnicities than
mine and nobody cares.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.300
And it's accepted and
nobody questions it--

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.726
that's not present in the
entertainment world, at all.

00:47:31.726 --> 00:47:33.100
I mean, if you
look at my resume,

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.290
it's like, Rodriguez,
Gonzales, Munoz--

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:36.870
and I am Bangladeshi.

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:39.160
But so, that's the first
time where it's just--

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.190
it's a very
color-conscious casting.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:45.460
And every little
boy and little girl

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.640
can see somebody that
looks like them on stage,

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.072
and that's the most
beautiful part of this show.

00:47:52.072 --> 00:47:53.530
Thank you for asking
that question.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:54.895
I can't believe we didn't
even bring that up, but--

00:47:54.895 --> 00:47:56.300
JOSEPH MORALES: It's about time.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.614
Like, enough-- it's about time.

00:47:57.614 --> 00:47:58.780
KELLIE FITZGERALD: For sure.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.280
ARI AFSAR: I mean,
we didn't-- yeah.

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.860
So there are roles
and stories that

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.670
need to be told that need to
have specific ethnicities, that

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.132
need to have
specific capacities.

00:48:08.132 --> 00:48:09.840
And no one else should
be casted, other--

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.890
JOSEPH MORALES: But those aren't
the only stories we can tell.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:12.790
We can tell--

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:14.320
ARI AFSAR: No, absolutely.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.560
But I mean, yeah, but any
romance or all the rest

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.810
of the things that you see
in TV and movies and films,

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:21.650
they don't have to be
of only one ethnicity.

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:24.280
And I hope that this
really just translates

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.967
into the rest of the
world for people like us.

00:48:28.967 --> 00:48:30.050
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Mm-hmm.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:30.550
Yeah.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.182
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:36.666 --> 00:48:39.040
KELLIE FITZGERALD: Well, I
think that's a beautiful place
