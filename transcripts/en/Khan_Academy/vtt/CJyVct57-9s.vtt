00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.860
Solve for x.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.675
And we have x minus 8 is
equal to x/3 plus 1/6.

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:08.300
Now the first thing
I want to do here--

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.740
and there's multiple
ways to do this problem--

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.140
but what I want to do is just
to simplify the fraction.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.180
I'm going to multiply everything
times the least common multiple

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.870
of all of these
guys' denominators.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.040
This is essentially x/1.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.510
This is 8/1, x/3, 1/6.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.140
The least common multiple
of 1, 3, and 6 is 6.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.527
So if I multiply
everything times 6,

00:00:30.527 --> 00:00:33.110
what that's going to do is going
to clear out these fractions.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.690
So these weren't
fractions to begin with,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.200
so we're just
multiplying them by 6.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.870
So it becomes 6x minus 6 times
negative 8, or 6 times 8 is 48.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.600
And we're subtracting
it right over there.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.251
And then we have x/3 times 6.

00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:49.500
Let me just write it out here.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.900
So that's going to be 6
times x/3 plus 6 times 1/6.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.230
Or we get 6x minus 48 is equal
to 6 times something divided

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.210
by 3.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.360
That's the same thing
as 6 divided by 3 times

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.450
that something.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.130
That's just going to
be equal to 2x plus 6

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.070
times 1/6 or 6 divided by
6 is just going to be 1.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.410
So that first step cleared
out all of the fractions

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.640
and now this is just a
straightforward problem

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.370
with all integer
coefficients or integers

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.920
on either side of the equation.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.295
And what we want
to do is we want

00:01:24.295 --> 00:01:26.480
to isolate all of the x's
on one side or the other.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.860
And we might as well isolate
them all on the left hand side.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.872
So let's subtract
2x from both sides.

00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:33.330
We want to get rid
of this 2x here.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.460
That's why I'm
subtracting the 2x.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.460
So let's subtract
2x from both sides.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.330
And on the right hand side,
I have 2x plus 1 minus 2x.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.160
Those cancel out.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.201
That was the whole point.

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:48.620
So I'm left with just
this 1 over here.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.860
On the left hand side
I have 6x minus 2x.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.355
Well, that's just
going to be 4x.

00:01:53.355 --> 00:01:55.480
If I have 6 of something
minus 2 of that something,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.000
I have 4 of that something.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.630
Minus 48.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.640
And now I can-- let's see,
I want to get rid of this 48

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.880
on the left hand side
because I want only x's here.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.714
So let me add 48 to both
sides of the equation.

00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:09.880
I'll do this in a new color.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.970
So let me add 48 to both
sides of this equation.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.000
And on the left hand
side 4x minus 48 plus 48,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.890
those cancel out.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.770
I'm left with just a 4x.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.100
And on the right hand side,
1 plus 48 is going to be 49.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.630
And now I've isolated the x but
it's still multiplied by a 4.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.950
So to make that a 1 coefficient,
let's multiply both sides

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:33.810
by 1/4.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.200
Or you could also say, let's
divide both sides by 4.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.397
Anything you do to one side
you have to do to the other.

00:02:41.397 --> 00:02:43.230
And so you have-- what
do we have over here?

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.910
4x/4 is just x.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.550
x is equal to 49 over 4.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.120
And that's about as far
as we can simplify it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.280
because these don't have any
common factors, 49 and 4.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.629
Let's check to see whether
49/4 is indeed the answer.

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.420
So let's put it into
the original equation.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.880
Remember, the
original equation is

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.450
what we have in green here
before we multiplied it by six.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.570
But in theory, we
should be able to put it

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.340
into any of these steps
and the x should satisfy.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.500
But let's do it in
our original equation.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.790
So we have x minus 8.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:25.360
So we have 49/4 minus 8
should be equal to 49/4 over 3

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.000
plus 1/6.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.490
So let's see what
we can do here.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.299
So we can multiply.

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.340
Well, like we did before.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.380
We can multiply both sides
of this equation by 6.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.890
That'll help simplify a
lot of the fractions here.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.830
So if we multiply both
sides of this equation

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.350
by 6-- so we're going to
multiply everything by 6--

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.260
what do we get on
the left hand side?

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.290
6/4 is the same
thing as 3/2, right?

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.060
So this is going to
be 3 times 49 over 2.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.430
3 times 49 over 2 minus 48
will be equal to 6 divided by 3

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.990
is 2.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.590
So it's going to be
2 times 49 over 4,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.090
which is the same thing as 49/2.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.950
And then 6 times 1/6 is plus 1.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.899
And let's see.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.790
Well, I'm just going to
actually just evaluate them out.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.714
I could just essentially have
to subtract 49/2 from both sides

00:04:27.714 --> 00:04:28.880
and that'll simplify things.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.140
But let me just figure out
what these evaluate to.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.189
So 3 times 49, 49 times 3.

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:37.230
You could think about it.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.480
It's going to be 3
less than 50 times 3.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.619
So it's 147.

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:41.910
But let's just multiply it out.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.040
9 times 3 is 27 4 times
3 is 12, plus 2 is 14.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.160
So 147.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.930
So this is 147/2.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.150
And then let's put this
over a denominator of 2.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.330
So 48 is equal to 96/2, right?

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.720
96 divided by 2 is 48 I
just multiplied this by 2.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.600
So this is minus 96/2 needs
to be equal to 49/2 plus--

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.980
and instead of having this
1 let's write that as 2/2.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.920
And what's 47 minus 96?

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.150
So 147 minus 100
would be 47, but we're

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.270
going to subtract
4 more than that.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.010
So we're going to
have-- we're going

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.610
to subtract 4 less than 100.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.940
So it's going to be 147
minus 96 is going to be 51.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.440
51/2 is equal to--
49 plus 2 is 51/2.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.970
So it all checks out.
