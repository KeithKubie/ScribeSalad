You can also imagine a case where at first glance,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.830
our results might suggest that there's no significant difference but it

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.900
turns out that there is. For example, say a website was

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.620
running an AB test between two different versions of our landing

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.670
page. They're trying to see which version of the page converts

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.330
more visits to clicks. Say they run a test for weeks

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.700
and weeks, placing 500,000 visitors into each test group. One strategy

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.600
had a conversion rate of 50%, another had a conversion rate

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.675
of 50.5%. If we run a significance test on this data, we can say with a

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:33.090
95% confidence level that there is a statistically

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.510
significant, albeit small difference between the two strategies.
