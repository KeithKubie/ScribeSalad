00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.270
How do you do background subtraction?

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.210
Not so complicated.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.100
You have to estimate the background.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.570
So at some time t, you remember doing x,
image of x, y, and t.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.770
I have to estimate the background,
and then

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.190
I'm going to subtract that background
from whatever the current frame is.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.110
And wherever the difference is,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.270
big enough I'm going to call that
my foreground mask, okay, and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.000
it's an absolute difference because
the background could be brighter than

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.570
the thing that's moving or
it could be darker.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.250
Here's an example, sort of notionally,
so here again same image, right.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.530
And this is my estimated background,
we'll talk a little bit later about how

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.680
you might get such
a beautiful background.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.920
And the idea would be to
take your current image,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.880
subtract off the background,
take the absolute value,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.990
and anywhere that it's bigger than
the threshold, just output that.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.490
All right, fine.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.830
But of course the question is, what's
a good estimate of the background?

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.550
There's a form of background
subtraction, which isn't really

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.610
background subtraction at all, and
it's referred to as frame differencing.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.590
Frame differencing is
exactly what you might think.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.870
I'm going to assume that the background
is whatever was in the picture

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.130
just before.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.030
Okay?
I'm just going to compare

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.570
the current image to the last image.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.268
All right?

00:01:12.268 --> 00:01:15.912
And, background subtraction becomes,
then, I of x,y, and

00:01:15.912 --> 00:01:18.120
t minus I of x,y and t minus 1.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.810
And if that value is greater
than some threshold,

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.310
I'll output that as my foreground mask.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.160
Okay?

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.510
So here again, two examples.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.977
So here's I of x, y, t.

00:01:28.977 --> 00:01:31.240
Here's this van here.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.610
And van has moved a little bit.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.870
Let's see, which one's easiest to see
that something has actually changed?

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.690
Oh, here.
So you see that this car is

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.050
moving forward that way, and it's now,
it's now moved past this line.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.520
But at time t minus 1,
it was even with that line.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.040
Same thing that this
van is moving forward.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.300
In fact, pay attention to
this white van there, okay?

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm going to subtract from this
image that background image,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.110
and then I'm going to take a look
at different thresholds, right?

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.850
Even before we look at the results,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.540
you can just think a little bit
about how well will this work.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.810
Well, clearly this is going to depend
upon sort of what the objects look like,

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.570
how fast they're moving, what
the frame rate is the threshold, so,

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.600
you know, sometimes this is good.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.205
And then the slide that took,
you know, [LAUGH] it says usually not.

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:19.710
Well, and this can be shown here,
all right?

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.950
So if I take different thresholds, so
here's threshold of 25, of 50, of 100,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.330
and you can see, you know, for this
illumination, I don't know, somewhere,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.660
a threshold somewhere between 50 and
100 seems to be going pretty well.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.740
You remember that white
van that I told you about?

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.340
Okay, well that's right there.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.590
Okay, so you can see the front of the
van, you can see the back of the van,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.190
but there's a big hole eaten
out the middle of the van.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.270
What happened there?

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.900
Well, duh the top of the van is just
white, all right it's just plain white.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.080
So the van tops here and
then in the next frame it's moved there.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.910
So the part where the van was and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.270
now you can see the road behind it,
that's a difference.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.860
And the part that was road,
or the windshield, and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.330
now the top of the van there,
you can see that, that's a difference.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.530
But, the middle of the top
of that van is white,

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.310
and then if I move it,
what does it stay?

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.840
White, so
I don't get much of a difference.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.970
Okay, so this is a problem with,
with frame differencing,

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.520
is that large areas even as they move.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.820
They can move relatively quickly,
but if you have large,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.830
constant, intensity areas, you know
that's just not going to work very well.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.980
So, what's a better idea?
