More interesting than the simple pulley is the compound pulley.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now this picture is better than my drawing over here and you can kind of see what's going on.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
By using this clever mechanism, we actually let the string pull on the object twice.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This string is pulling upwards as is this string.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If we want to do a force diagram on the subject, we still have (mg) going down

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but now the tension goes up twice.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
One representing each of these arrows .

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What would the tension have to be now in order to balance this 1000 N weight?

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
