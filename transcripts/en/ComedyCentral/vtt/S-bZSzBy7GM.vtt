00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.936
Speed Debating.
Speed Debating.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.342
Tonight was the final
presidential debate,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.363
thank Christ!

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.775
Where the mannequins
from Ann Taylor

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.788
and Spencer Gifts--

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.135
they duked it out
to win undecided voters.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.702
But we're just not ready
to say good-bye to debates.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.655
So, comedians,
to keep the conflict alive

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.416
a little bit longer, I'm gonna
give you a famous issue

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.115
and whoever buzzes in first

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.628
should weigh in to settle it
once and for all.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.631
First up, cats versus dogs.
Andrew.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.032
Dogs.
'Cause I'm lonely,

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.300
but I'm not that lonely.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.701
All right.

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:36.970
-Points. Ben.
-Rebuttal, rebuttal.

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.640
-Yeah.
-Cats, because that office chair

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.975
-isn't gonna (bleep) on itself.
-Yeah, points. -No.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.511
-He's right. Yes, Adam.
-No. Rebuttal, rebuttal.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.780
Dogs. Cats taste disgusting.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.750
All right, points. Points.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:54.121
Next up-- I know this is a very
important issue to everyone--

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:57.257
hand jobs versus dry humping.

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.927
That looks like kind of
wet humping on the beach though.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.595
-I don't know. Ben.
-Either.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.530
I-I'll take whatever
I can get, at this point.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:04.932
All right, yeah.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:07.100
Points to Ben.

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:08.435
Adam.

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:11.438
Hand jobs, because we need
more jobs in this country.

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.373
-Yeah, points.
-I'm tired of people

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:16.710
trying to talk
about the non-important issues.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.379
Finally,
someone is on the issues!

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:22.382
I'm mad! I'm fightin' mad!

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.351
(cheering and applause)

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:29.089
N-Next one, black versus white.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.624
Black versus white.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.159
Let's be very careful
with this one.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.094
Let's be very careful
with this one.

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:35.863
(bleep).

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.435
Just hearing...

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:44.304
just hearing one of the three
black dudes in the audience go,

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:46.974
"Yeah, you better be careful."

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.309
Uh...

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:52.279
We got this, all right?
We got this.

00:01:53.547 --> 00:01:55.382
Adam.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.451
It's black.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.987
Because the darkness comes
for us all.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.323
-Yeah, all right. Points.
-Oh, we can...

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:05.993
we can pretend
it's not wasting our time

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:08.128
with little interactive
Twitter games,

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:11.465
but, eventually,
the black consumes us all.

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:13.000
All right. Good. All right.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:13.533
Points.
