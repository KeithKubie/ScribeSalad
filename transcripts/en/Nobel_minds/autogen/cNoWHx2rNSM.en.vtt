breakthrough so it was kind of easy in
 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.339
breakthrough so it was kind of easy in
those days to do more stuff nowadays the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349
those days to do more stuff nowadays the
 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.900

young people coming along heaven much
harder because there's a huge body of

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
harder because there's a huge body of
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.460
harder because there's a huge body of
work they have to be familiar with I

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
work they have to be familiar with I
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.900
work they have to be familiar with I
didn't have to be familiar with anything

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
didn't have to be familiar with anything

except basic economics and statistics in
order to proceed with my work and at

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
order to proceed with my work and at
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.589
order to proceed with my work and at
that time the reason all that started at

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599
that time the reason all that started at
 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.800
that time the reason all that started at
that time is it's kind of silly because

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
that time is it's kind of silly because
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.260
that time is it's kind of silly because
what started it was the fact that

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
what started it was the fact that
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.319
what started it was the fact that
computers came and computers made it

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
computers came and computers made it
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.840
computers came and computers made it
easy for people to do work with data

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
easy for people to do work with data
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.119
easy for people to do work with data
that was very difficult to do before

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129
that was very difficult to do before
 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.920
that was very difficult to do before
that they had to use these old

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
that they had to use these old
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.650
that they had to use these old
mechanical calculators that the people

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
mechanical calculators that the people
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.270
mechanical calculators that the people
watching this have probably never seen

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
watching this have probably never seen
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.459
watching this have probably never seen
in there and their lifetimes and it was

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
in there and their lifetimes and it was
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.900
in there and their lifetimes and it was
very difficult to do things accurately

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
very difficult to do things accurately
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.580
very difficult to do things accurately
even and then computers came they were

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590
even and then computers came they were
 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.880
even and then computers came they were
not as powerful as your cell phone is is

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
not as powerful as your cell phone is is
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.549
not as powerful as your cell phone is is
now but they were a revelation at that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
now but they were a revelation at that
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.369
now but they were a revelation at that
time so all kinds of people got

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
time so all kinds of people got
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.710
time so all kinds of people got
interested in doing work with computers

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
interested in doing work with computers
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.160
interested in doing work with computers
and stock prices are one of the most

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
and stock prices are one of the most
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.950
and stock prices are one of the most
easily available data that you can get

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
easily available data that you can get
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.570
easily available data that you can get
so lots of people started to work on

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
so lots of people started to work on
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.090
so lots of people started to work on
stock prices and returns and that's

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
stock prices and returns and that's
 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.909
stock prices and returns and that's
