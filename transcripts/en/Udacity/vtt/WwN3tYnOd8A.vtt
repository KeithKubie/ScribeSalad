00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.590
And again, since Dimple operates at a higher level of abstraction and

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.420
follows some of the principles of the grammar of graphics.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.240
To make these changes it's very simple, and

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.450
we simply have to manipulate some properties on our axis and

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.310
Dimple does all the hard work and heavy lifting for us.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.230
But beyond these small formatting changes, to make our chart more readable,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.590
there's still some fundamental issues with this bar chart.
