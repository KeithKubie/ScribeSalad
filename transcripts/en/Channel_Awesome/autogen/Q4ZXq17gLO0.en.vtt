00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 align:start position:0%
of a different design but I think that's
 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.529 align:start position:0%
of a different design but I think that's
kind<00:06:15.020><c> of</c><00:06:15.199><c> the</c><00:06:15.500><c> joke</c><00:06:16.280><c> before</c><00:06:16.490><c> is</c><00:06:16.820><c> that</c><00:06:16.849><c> like</c><00:06:17.330><c> you</c>

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 align:start position:0%
