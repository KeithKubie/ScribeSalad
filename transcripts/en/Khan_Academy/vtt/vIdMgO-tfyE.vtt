00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.428
- [Voiceover] I think one of
the most underrated skills

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:05.675
for learning history is learning

00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:07.732
how to think like a historian.

00:00:07.732 --> 00:00:11.547
And what do I mean by
"thinking like a historian"?

00:00:11.547 --> 00:00:15.380
Does that mean that you
have to go out and buy

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.374
a tweed jacket with some elbow patches

00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:20.287
and maybe grow a long, white beard

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:23.965
and sit around all day
pondering whether the Civil War

00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:27.239
was caused by slavery or states' rights?

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.559
No, but you can try that if you want.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:33.735
But I would say thinking like
a historian is a little bit

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:38.197
like being a combination
between a storyteller

00:00:41.147 --> 00:00:43.647
and a scientist . . .

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:47.701
you're gonna see me draw a
really, really bad beaker here

00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:51.407
there we go . . .

00:00:53.297 --> 00:00:56.199
some little fumes coming off of that.

00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:02.707
and a lawyer, maybe I'll put a gavel here.

00:01:08.247 --> 00:01:11.035
It's a gavel, not a
croquet mallet or a hammer.

00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:14.575
So first let's start with
the storytelling aspect.

00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:22.010
I think one of the most important
things that we can learn

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.793
from telling this story of history is that

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:29.735
in a good story nothing just happens.

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:37.306
Imagine a story where
everything just happened.

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:42.306
The story would be: the wind
blows, the earth turns, right?

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.309
No one is making those things happen

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:48.116
and that's why it's kind of a boring story

00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:50.292
because it doesn't show cause and effect.

00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:53.160
And that cause and effect is really

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.422
the backbone of history, right?

00:01:57.422 --> 00:01:59.959
And you would be surprised how often

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.533
people can fall into the
trap of telling history,

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:07.246
this incredible story
about what people have done

00:02:07.246 --> 00:02:10.935
in the past that has led to
the society we have today

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:14.235
as if it were kind of a
laundry list of events

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:16.831
that just followed one
after another without

00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:19.281
any possibility of things being different.

00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:21.954
People will say, "and then
World War II happened"

00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:26.391
or "and then the United
States was born," right?

00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:29.523
Those statements are in passive
voice because they don't

00:02:29.523 --> 00:02:32.536
talk about the people who
make these things happen.

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:35.426
And really, short of a natural disaster,

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:38.343
pretty much everything happens in history

00:02:38.343 --> 00:02:41.318
because people made it happen.

00:02:41.318 --> 00:02:44.339
So when you think like a
historian, you kind of think

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:46.690
the same way that a novelist might think.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.833
OK, what is this character's motive?

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:54.833
What are they going to do to
make their wish come true?

00:02:55.478 --> 00:03:00.478
What are the influences that lead

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:02.855
a person to make certain choices?

00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:05.216
And just like people make choices,

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:07.645
nations make choices, right?

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:10.619
World War I didn't just happen

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:12.490
and just as people make choices,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.240
actions have consequences.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.114
You wouldn't write a story where

00:03:16.114 --> 00:03:18.678
a thief stole 100 million dollars

00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:21.040
and the police didn't even
try to come after her.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.132
Neither can you write a
story about history without

00:03:24.132 --> 00:03:27.708
talking about the effects
that actions have on people.

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:30.039
So that's the storytelling aspect

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.667
of thinking like a historian.

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:34.269
Let's talk about the scientific aspect.

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.333
We often think of history as something

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:39.559
that's pretty much done, right?

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:44.283
It's a series of events
that happened in the past

00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:47.171
and now we just have to
memorize what happened

00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:50.709
so we can learn from it
and maybe have a good idea

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.095
about what to do in the future.

00:03:52.095 --> 00:03:56.117
But really there is only so
much we can actually know

00:03:56.117 --> 00:03:57.977
about what happened in the past.

00:03:57.977 --> 00:04:01.529
And so historians always have to do

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:06.529
a kind of research to
understand what happened

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.191
and get a better idea of
what people were feeling.

00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:14.349
So just like scientists have theories,

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.885
when historians think about the past,

00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:20.855
they're really thinking
about theories as well.

00:04:20.855 --> 00:04:23.869
They're saying, "ok, I have a theory about

00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:27.813
"what caused the evolution
of jazz in the 1920s."

00:04:27.813 --> 00:04:30.545
Why did jazz become a major

00:04:30.545 --> 00:04:33.315
popular form of music in the 1920s?

00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:36.447
Well, I'm gonna theorize
it was because people

00:04:36.447 --> 00:04:39.564
were reacting to the horror of World War I

00:04:39.564 --> 00:04:42.131
which made so many people
interested in kind of,

00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:45.298
staccato notes and discordant sounds.

00:04:45.298 --> 00:04:47.379
Alright, so that's a theory.

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.810
Well, how do you go
about proving a theory?

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.806
And the answer is you do research

00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:53.875
and you consult evidence, right?

00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:56.247
And the way that you do that in history

00:04:56.247 --> 00:04:59.533
is usually by doing a
lot of reading, right?

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:02.143
You might say, alright well, let me take

00:05:02.143 --> 00:05:05.644
the letters of some jazz
musicians from this time period

00:05:05.644 --> 00:05:06.906
and see what they write about.

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:09.230
Maybe they write all about how

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.629
they experienced battle in World War I

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.315
and they were trying to
reflect that in their music.

00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:16.874
Or maybe they write that World War I

00:05:16.874 --> 00:05:19.555
had nothing to do with
their interest in music.

00:05:19.555 --> 00:05:24.356
Actually, they wanted to
simulate the sounds of flight

00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:26.106
because they were so interested in

00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:28.261
modern forms of transportation.

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:30.821
So our understanding of
what happened in the past

00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:33.546
is always just a theory.

00:05:33.546 --> 00:05:36.186
I mean we have a pretty good idea

00:05:36.186 --> 00:05:39.286
of what was going on most of the time,

00:05:39.286 --> 00:05:42.705
but new information comes to
light all the time, right?

00:05:42.705 --> 00:05:45.591
I mean people are always cleaning
out their grandma's attic

00:05:45.591 --> 00:05:47.582
and finding some new documents

00:05:47.582 --> 00:05:51.560
and as the preponderance of
the evidence shifts and changes

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.205
so might our understanding of the past.

00:05:54.205 --> 00:05:56.983
The last aspect of
thinking like a historian

00:05:56.983 --> 00:06:00.555
I want to talk about is
this kind of lawyerly aspect.

00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:04.375
And what I mean by this is that historians

00:06:04.375 --> 00:06:06.456
are always making an argument.

00:06:14.326 --> 00:06:16.850
Just like a lawyer gets up
in a court room and says,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.761
"Here's my idea, now let me support it

00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:23.865
"with the evidence from
witnesses, from experts,

00:06:23.865 --> 00:06:27.281
"from objects we might have
found at a crime scene."

00:06:27.281 --> 00:06:30.788
A historian is saying, "believe my theory.

00:06:30.788 --> 00:06:33.307
"Believe my evidence."

00:06:33.307 --> 00:06:36.877
And I think the analogy of
law is really powerful here

00:06:36.877 --> 00:06:39.981
because you could see the
same pieces of evidence

00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:42.462
used to support two different arguments.

00:06:42.462 --> 00:06:46.614
So for example, say there's, maybe . . .

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:51.088
a sock that was found
at the scene of a crime

00:06:51.088 --> 00:06:53.682
right, and here's our sock . . .

00:06:58.072 --> 00:06:59.102
I'm not a beautiful artist.

00:07:02.232 --> 00:07:06.992
But, maybe the prosecution

00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:09.273
tries to argue . . .

00:07:09.273 --> 00:07:12.933
that the accused must have committed

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:16.866
this crime because the sock is his size.

00:07:20.366 --> 00:07:22.087
Right, the sock shows he did it.

00:07:22.087 --> 00:07:26.073
Whereas the defense

00:07:27.203 --> 00:07:30.484
might say, "My client never wears socks,

00:07:30.484 --> 00:07:32.654
"he always wears sandals."

00:07:32.654 --> 00:07:35.925
So it's clear that the sock shows that

00:07:35.925 --> 00:07:38.854
he couldn't possibly have
been the one to do this crime.

00:07:38.854 --> 00:07:40.549
So that's how we end up with so many

00:07:40.549 --> 00:07:43.241
different interpretations
of the same event.

00:07:43.241 --> 00:07:46.904
The task of the historian
is to gather evidence

00:07:46.904 --> 00:07:51.255
and to present an argument
that they think will

00:07:51.255 --> 00:07:55.370
best convince the public
of their interpretation.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.541
And so these interpretations
do change over time.

00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:01.430
So in later videos we'll
get into the nuts and bolts

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.609
of how you tell these stories
and make these arguments.

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:07.011
But for now, I just
kind of want you to see

00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:09.654
that thinking like a historian is not

00:08:09.654 --> 00:08:12.418
something that only historians can do.

00:08:12.418 --> 00:08:14.483
It's actually a really useful skill

00:08:14.483 --> 00:08:16.162
for lots of aspects of your life.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:20.030
We tell stories, search for
evidence, and make arguments

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.920
in our lives all the time about things

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.685
that we interact with
every day like our favorite

00:08:25.685 --> 00:08:29.700
bands, our favorite foods,
our political views, right?

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.232
We base those on our own experiences,

00:08:32.232 --> 00:08:34.337
consequences in our lives

00:08:34.337 --> 00:08:37.080
and evidence that we see around us.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.273
And we can do the same thing for the past.

00:08:39.273 --> 00:08:41.507
It's not such a foreign country.

00:08:41.507 --> 00:08:44.605
What we have are the remnants of that past

00:08:44.605 --> 00:08:47.325
and the ability to interpret them.
