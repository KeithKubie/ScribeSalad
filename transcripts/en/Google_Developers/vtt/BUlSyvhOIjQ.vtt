00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520
&gt;&gt; MOUTRAN: Hi. I'm Cyril Moutran and I'm
the founder and CEO of Twazzup.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.670
&gt;&gt; HARDEL: And I'm Hugo Hardel. I'm also a
founder of Twazzup and I focus mostly on business

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.710
development, marketing. We have a third team
member who's not here today unfortunately.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.590
His name is Stefan Repakis (ph) and he's our
main technical guy. And let me talk briefly

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.249
about the product, Twazzup, what we--what
we've built. Twazzup is a real-time search

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:37.360
engine. That's the short version. I think
it would help if I go a little bit into the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.770
long version and talk a little bit about the
Twazzup experience which is unlike the traditional

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.989
search engine experience. It's more like a
broadcasting experience if you want. So you're

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.250
going to Twazzup and the experience is if
there is a real-time event somewhere, or if

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.460
there is a conference somewhere, you can sort
of track that conference through a hash tag

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.410
or a special custom page. And you're going
to see the messages from the people at the

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.410
conference or on-site at the--at the event.
You're going to the pictures that they've

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.860
picked on-site that will show up in real-time.
You're going to see the things. And so the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.600
experience that's created is, you know, it's
sort of the ability to follow a conference

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.080
or follow a news event from your computer.
And it's very connected because it's powered

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.710
by the people if you want. So, you know, it's
more a broadcasting experience than a search

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.830
experience but the technology behind is really
a search technology.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.810
&gt;&gt; Okay, great. So how long did it take you
guys to build Twazzup?

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:52.650
&gt;&gt; MOUTRAN: Well, so when we, when we initially
selected the App Engine, we started with a

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.590
prototype and we were--it was probably about
three days and so it was very quick. But it

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.640
really took us about 10 weeks to launch--to
launch officially the site. And it was, like,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.190
we launched in April--mid-April, and since
then, we've been working on the site for about

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.319
six months.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So how did you guys use App Engine?

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.750
&gt;&gt; MOUTRAN: So we started with some of the
basic APIs. We used memcached a lot in our

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:24.319
first version. We used URL Fetch and, earlier,
at the start, you know, mostly, we used system

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.099
management but then we decided to, you know,
let's grasp--grasp and we pushed. A couple

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.050
weeks ago, we used it a lot more and our evaluation
is we need a lot more.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:40.340
&gt;&gt; HARDEL: And I think, if I can add to that,
we use--we probably use few of the many APIs

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.569
that are very available in the App Engine
but we're very satisfied users of the few

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.489
APIs that we use.
&gt;&gt; Okay, great. So why did you guys choose

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.219
App Engine?
&gt;&gt; MOUTRAN: So when we started this project,

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:00.660
we wanted to have somewhat a replaceable platform
so we looked at AWS, the Amazon offering and

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.890
at Google. At the time, Google only had a
bite in but I think the combination of how

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.810
fast our first prototype went and also the
flexibility that we saw in the App Engine--and

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.550
then also we tried to Google for our scanning
(ph) and I think we've been very--we've not

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:26.980
been disappointed at all, that being the case.
&gt;&gt; HARDEL: And scanning (ph) for us is actually

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.659
huge in the sense that, like I said, the experience
is very event-driven. So when you have an

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:40.680
event like the election in Iran where a lot
of the news were flowing through searchable

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.010
media. All of a sudden, we see a jump of traffic.
I think it was--you know, from day one to

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.819
day two, it was more than 10 times the traffic
we had seen. So the ability to ramp up traffic

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:03.149
without really thinking about it was absolutely
huge, absolutely a big, big benefit.

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:10.519
&gt;&gt; Okay, great. So what are some future clients
you have for things that use App Engine new

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.150
features, things like that?
&gt;&gt; MOUTRAN: So, we've been, we've been ongoing,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.950
doing a lot on the App Engine so we--and the
way towards that is we need realities (ph).

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:27.770
It's a mesh of several senses. We do--I think
we do the search on Twazzup and we use a lot,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.780
as I said, of API, but we also built our own
set of senses. So we have multiple app engines

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.850
consisting only of the senses and we keep
adding more and more layers. So, so far, I

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.460
think it's on a development platform. And
we'll definitely support that and we'll hopefully

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:48.760
move more and more, you know, through time
(ph).

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.289
&gt;&gt; Okay. So what are some things that you
really like about App Engine?

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.820
&gt;&gt; MOUTRAN: Okay, on my side, you know, the
thing I like the most is I don't have to think

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.160
about a couple of things. You know, like I
used to do, you know, in our previous startup

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.540
project, I used to do all the sys admin (ph).
And with the App Engine, it's really is a

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.960
one-button, you know, deploy (ph). It's also
very--the fact that you can deploy many versions

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:20.711
with minimum interruption of service for the
users makes a very, very big difference. I

00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:26.600
guess, in our case, as we are today in this
stage of our applications, we give and meet

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600
(ph) multiples times a week, and, sometimes,
you know, multiples a day when we have to

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.600
respond to things very quickly. So that's
one thing; I think the scalability, as we

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.830
said before, I think that's the big thing,
something good for us. I think of all the

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.430
places, usually, the platform is used, in
a way, the fact that you don't need to worry

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.500
about (ph) the equipment because you really
have to just think about the application area

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.750
and nothing really be off--we know that. And
that's the main, main thing, I think...

00:05:50.750 --> 00:06:01.840
&gt;&gt; HARDEL: Yeah, and I think, you know, if
look at Twazzup, it's a three-people team

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.490
and we can definitely do without the other
(ph) hand, and the App Engine is really, really

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.770
helpful. There are, I think--you know, it's
difficult to make that assessment, but I think,

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:18.110
of the time, we've probably saved hundreds
of dollars (ph), you know, not having to manage

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.690
the environment because it largely manages
itself; not having to fine-tune the configuration--the

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:30.410
configuration for performance because it's
already built-in. You know, seeing our size,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:39.370
that was, like, it was very, very, very helpful.
&gt;&gt; Okay, great. So what are some things you'd

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.490
like to see in App Engine?
&gt;&gt; MOUTRAN: Well, I think we have the right

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.810
things that we have already. There are--there
are a couple of things that people could use.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:57.370
And also, you know, if we do a search, a letter
scroll (ph) is basically nice. And if you

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:06.840
would take advantage, we have some ideas for
the future you could use. I think...

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.930
&gt;&gt; HARDEL: How about wildcard domains?
&gt;&gt; MOUTRAN: Oh, yes, wildcard domain. Thatâ€™s--that's

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:16.830
obviously two applications, but we do, the
way it works and it's built, Iran's organizers,

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:24.280
celebrities could own through Twazzup site.
And so for that, they have a need to the wildcard

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.440
domain. A manual configuration would be very
nice.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:36.140
&gt;&gt; Okay, great. So do you have any tips or
things that you've learned that you would

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.030
like to pass on to other people who use App
Engine?

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.270
&gt;&gt; HARDEL: Use it.
&gt;&gt; MOUTRAN: Very easy. I mean, initially,

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:53.921
we ran into it mostly as, for us, more learning
about cloud computing. If you have a project

00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:57.360
where, like, a startup project is a good example
where you--you have to do very interactive

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.510
development--packaging, if it comes to that
(ph). It's a--it's a platform where you can

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.150
go multiples times a day. It's also a platform
where you could take your code base--it varies

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.810
with each code base using two or three experiments.
You could use free packaged (ph) instances

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.270
and then you could be deciding which one is
the best process. So another point is we can

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.470
use that flexibility. And I will courage you
to use it.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:28.480
&gt;&gt; HARDEL: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I
couldn't agree more.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.090
&gt;&gt; All right, well, thank you, guys.
&gt;&gt; MOUTRAN: Thank you.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:31.900
&gt;&gt; HARDEL: Thank you--happy to be here.
