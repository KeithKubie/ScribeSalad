00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Today's experiment is sponsored by HelloFresh.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.540
Hey guys, I'm Nate. Welcome back to the workshop.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.840
A lot of people have commented asking us to make

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.340
some ice cream using liquid nitrogen, so today

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.600
that's what we're going to do in a few different varieties.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.600
In the past Grant has shown you how to make some

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.980
futuristic ice cream beads by melting existing ice cream,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.120
putting it into a little squeeze container, and then

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.580
dripping that out into liquid nitrogen. Today we'll show

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.920
you a recipe you can use instead of melting existing

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.820
ice cream, and we'll make both the futuristic bead-style

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.700
ice cream and regular ice cream.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.600
Here we have a lot of equipment and ingredients

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.840
to make our ice cream, and I'll go over each aspect

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.869
as we get to it.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.040
Let's start by making our Dippin' Dots-styled ice cream.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.500
This recipe is very basic.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.840
We'll start with ½ cup of milk and ½ cup of half &amp; half.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.680
My one-cup measuring cup is conveniently divided in half

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.060
inside at the ½-cup mark so I can just fill to one line with

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.620
the half &amp; half and then finish filling it with the milk.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.380
Now let's see if I have a steady enough hand to pour

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.980
the milk and the half-and-half into the bottle from our

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.480
measuring cup.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.500
Hmm. Not so much.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.240
You know I'm actually going to blame the measuring cup

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.749
for this one. It doesn't pour very well.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.200
This is also a very clean new plate, so I'm just going to

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.919
pour it straight from the plate into the bottle.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.120
Why does a folded plate work better than the pouring

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.700
spout on the measuring cup? Hmm.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.180
With our milk and half &amp; half combined in our squeeze

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.102
bottle, it's time to add ¼ cup of sugar and a dash of

00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:30.929
vanilla extract.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.839
This is going to pour just about as well as the milk.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.580
About the same.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.900
All right. Close our top and we're just going to stir this

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.080
around. We want the sugar to completely dissolve

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.920
into the liquid.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.540
It can take a while for all the sugar to dissolve because

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.760
our milk and half &amp; half are quite cold and sugar doesn't

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.520
dissolve as quickly in cold liquid.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.480
Looking at the bottom, it's hard to see but you can

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.740
kind of make out grains on the bottom of sugar if there's

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.600
too much of it. I'm just trying to stir it up until there are

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.340
no more. All right.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.060
I think most of my sugar is dissolved. Let's see how

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.060
this is tasting before I freeze it. I'm just going to drip a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.469
little bit out on my finger here.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.000
Tastes really good. It's got a good vanilla flavor, it's nice

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.260
and sweet, nice and creamy.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.180
Now what we need to do is freeze this into our

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.060
ice cream beads.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.360
I have here a stack of styrofoam plates, which should

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.420
insulate pretty well. I'm going to fill one of these plates

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.720
with liquid nitrogen so I have a nice shallow surface to

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.960
drip our ice cream mixture onto so we don't end up

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.520
piling all of our ice cream beads in one spot.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.750
Let's see if I'm able to pour straight onto this plate.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.180
Our plate changes shape a little bit as it gets cold. That's exciting.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.060
There we go. It's a nice layer of liquid nitrogen there.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.340
Plates have settled back down to the shape they were

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.820
originally. Now olet's see what happens if we just drip in,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.060
a little bit at a time, our ice cream mixture,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.520
Some of our ice cream beads have frozen just slightly to

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.440
the plate beneath it. But just a little bit of pressure

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.660
and they sort of pop right off.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.620
There we go: Milk, half &amp; half, sugar, and vanilla,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.620
dripped into some liquid nitrogen and we have our

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.720
futuristic ice cream bead dessert. These things are

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.060
really good. A word of caution, though: When they first

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.280
come out of the liquid nitrogen they are unbelievably

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.440
cold, and if you eat them right away they will stick to the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.830
inside of your mouth and burn it with the cold.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.920
If it's cold enough to stick to water on your finger, it will

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.560
stick to your tongue and hurt. DON'T DO IT.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.740
Once it's warmed up enough that it's not going to stick

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.540
to the inside of your mouth, enjoy a delicious and very

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.300
interesting textured dessert.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.310
It's really good.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.640
It is a lot more effort than just scooping ice cream

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.720
out of the carton, but it's a lot cooler,

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.080
and I mean that in both ways.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.940
Our dessert today is brought to us by liquid nitrogen, but

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.860
the rest of our meal is going to be delivered to us by

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.680
HelloFresh. Let's take just a moment to look at how their

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.080
service works. If you like to cook at home, HelloFresh is

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.040
a great way to do it. They've really set up a system that's

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.020
convenient to use.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.580
If you have a busy schedule you can choose the delivery

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.100
day that works best for you. If you're going to be out of

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.380
town you can pause your account for weeks at a time.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.160
All of the ingredients come pre-measured in handy

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.960
labeled meal kits so you know which ingredients go with

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.940
which recipe, unlike at a grocery store.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.220
And of course the whole kit is delivered right to your

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.400
door in recyclable insulated packaging. HelloFresh

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.480
offers a wide variety of chef-created recipes that are

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.220
different every week. They have the Classic, Veggie, and

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.600
Family plans to choose from.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.160
The recipes are designed to only take about 30 minutes

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.020
to prep so you're not going to have to spend all night in

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.840
the kitchen cooking.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.240
Several of the meals are designed to be one-pot recipes

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.140
for speedy cooking and minimal cleanup. Each week,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.980
one meal in the classic menu is designed to only take

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.900
20 minutes to prep. This was my first time trying one of

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.800
these services that delivers meals with all the recipes

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.980
and ingredients included.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.960
I thought the instructions were easy to follow,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.380
prep time was quick, and the

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.160
quality of the food was excellent.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.800
It's a really convenient and easy service to use,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.980
knowing that you're getting full meals in just the right

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.960
portion sizes.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.780
Dinner was great. Now let's focus back on the desserts.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.400
Using our milk, our half &amp; half, a little bit of sugar, and a

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.520
dash of vanilla, we were able to make a delicious vanilla-

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.880
flavored ice cream beads dessert.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.020
But I want to try adding a few different flavors to see if

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.180
we can mix it up a little.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.240
Rather than using regular milk, I'm going to try making

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.760
an eggnog and a chocolate version of our Dippin' Dots-

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.609
style ice cream. Let's try the eggnog first.

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:33.720
One cup eggnog. I'll try pouring this while it's just half

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.438
full to see if it'll pour better that way.

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:37.490
Yep.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.840
Half the cup of eggnog, ½ cup of half &amp; half, and ¼ cup

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.080
of sugar.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.880
Should just pour the sugar directly onto the plate

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.840
and then use the plate to pour it into the bottle.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.849
I think I will do that next time.

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.260
I'm not adding any vanilla extract this time because I

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.709
think the eggnog will provide all the flavor we need.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.060
You do have to mix it up and get that sugar

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.020
dissolving, though.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.720
Now I think a great flavor to go with our eggnog is going

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.160
to be hot chocolate flavor. Of course, it's going to be

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.780
cooled down a lot so it's not going to have the heat of

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.280
hot cocoa, but it will have the flavor of hot cocoa.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.900
To do that I have some chocolate milk and I've taken our

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.620
half &amp; half and I've mixed in a bunch of cocoa powder.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.360
Cocoa powder does not usually dissolve well in cold

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.360
liquids so I did heat up the half &amp;half, then I mixed in the

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.420
cocoa powder, and then I cooled it down in the

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.020
refrigerator until it was about room temperature.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.660
Now we'll follow our same recipe, but instead of using

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.700
milk and half &amp; half we'll use chocolate milk and

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.769
chocolate half &amp; half. Should be pretty good.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.749
I don't know how well this cup pours but

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.390
not too bad.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.800
There we go.  Chocolate milk and half &amp; half turned into

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.629
hot chocolate. This should be delicious.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.860
Now as delicious as that is, ice cream is supposed to be

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.140
a very sweet dessert so I'm still going to add a little bit

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.320
of sugar to this. Not ¼ cup like I have for the others

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.660
but a little bit, maybe ⅛ cup.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.320
There we go. We now have our eggnog- and our hot

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.380
chocolate-flavored ice cream mixes, so let's pour a

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.729
couple of plates of liquid nitrogen and start dripping.

00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:43.279
Eggnog and hot chocolate ice cream beads.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.860
That's a really good combo.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.180
There you go. A couple of recipes on how to make

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.940
eggnog- and hot chocolate-flavored futuristic ice cream

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.680
beads. These things are really good.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.580
It's a good flavor combination, too, eggnog and

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.180
hot chocolate. I noticed when dripping our ice cream

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.120
formula into the liquid nitrogen it would take a second

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.700
or two for the individual beads to begin to freeze,

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.744
and if one drip touched another drip before it had a

00:09:16.744 --> 00:09:19.220
chance to freeze, they would join together and then you

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.520
just get a larger ice-cream bead instead of

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.540
two small ones.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.240
Whether or not that's a good thing might be up to you.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.420
I generally tried to get the small beads but if I was

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.140
getting a couple that were made of two or even three

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.840
drops I didn't really worry about it. All right.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.620
Now we know how to make our futuristic Dippin' Dots-

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.420
style ice cream. Let's move on to making some regular

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.200
styled ice cream.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.740
For our more stereotypically textured ice cream we're

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.440
going to try a slightly different recipe of ½ cup half &amp; half

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.700
and ½ cup heavy cream. We'll still also add

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.460
¼ cup of sugar and a dash of vanilla.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.800
Now let's stir this up until all of the sugar is dissolved.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.900
We can't really see the sugar very well the same way we

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.120
could in the squeeze bottle. Since we won't be able to

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.520
see the sugar very well, we'll need to rely on the sound

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.140
and feel of the spatula to know when our sugar is

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.800
dissolved. There we go.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.080
I think our sugar is now completely dissolved into our

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.640
mixture, so it's time to start adding the cold.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.420
Let's pour our liquid nitrogen into our measuring cup

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.240
and then carefully pour from there into our mixture, and

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.480
then start stirring it around.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.680
I'm only adding about ¼ cup of the liquid nitrogen

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.460
at a time.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.140
You can see that the nitrogen gets inside of the cream

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.400
mixture and makes it bubble up quite a bit.

00:10:39.449 --> 00:10:40.640
It's stopped hissing.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.300
I think that means all of the nitrogen is gone and it's

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.189
time to add more.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.820
We're looking really good now; that's definitely starting

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.440
to look like ice cream. As I'm stirring I'm trying to keep

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.620
the liquid nitrogen and the ice cream off the walls of

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.260
the bowl as much as I can because if the liquid nitrogen

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.520
stays in contact within the metal it will create really cold

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.100
points, and then we'll have super-frozen bits of ice cream

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.580
on the sides, but not as much in the middle.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:19.380
Beautiful. That is looking like ice cream. Mm.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.060
It's a little bit soft. If you like your ice cream harder, I'd

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.160
say you can just keep adding a little bit more liquid

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.040
nitrogen to cool it down even further. I kind of like

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.980
slightly soft ice cream, personally. Let's have a war in the

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.640
comment section about which is better: Hard ice cream

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.580
or soft ice cream. But a polite war.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.979
A nice, gentle, kindly-spoken war.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.419
That right there, I think, is ice cream ready to serve.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.970
Let's try some of this.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.640
That's really good. That is very good.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.160
Unbelievably creamy.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.700
75% of this recipe is cream so it makes sense it would

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.420
be really creamy.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.260
Scoop out our ice cream

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.060
and I think we are ready to serve.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.460
Our recipe for vanilla ice cream works great, so let's

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.660
see if we can add a few more things and give ourselves

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.200
a little bit different flavor. This time I'm going to try for

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.240
caramel, and then I'm going to see if I can make some

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.560
raspberry ice cream with real raspberries.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.300
Just add a little bit of this [caramel extract]. I'm not sure

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.880
how powerful it is. I also have some caramel sauce

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.440
that's meant for ice cream, and once I've got the ice

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.800
cream a little bit frozen I'll swirl in some caramel sauce

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.980
Sand then freeze it even more.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.160
Just stirring to dissolve all the sugar.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.840
There we go. Our ice cream is now at a pretty good

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.540
consistency. I'm going to add some caramel and then

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.200
just try and freeze it up a little bit more with our caramel

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.059
gently swirled in.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.900
Beautiful. Got streaks of caramel. It's not so mixed in

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.280
that you don't see it anymore, and then of course it's

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.020
caramel-flavored to begin with.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.860
It's really good stuff. Super creamy.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.289
This has turned out great. Let's try raspberry.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.440
Not really sure exactly how much of that to add.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.460
This is going to be raspberry-flavored ice cream, so let's

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.880
add a drop of red to turn our ice cream pink. Perfect.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.020
We've got some nice raspberries that we were going to

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.620
add into our ice cream but unfortunately they thawed a

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.020
little bit more than they were supposed to so they're

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.740
very mushy. I'm afraid if I try and mix them in like this

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.059
we'll just have a pureé and we kind of want the chunks of

00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:11.900
raspberry instead. So to fix that I'm just going to take a

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.520
little bit of liquid nitrogen, pour that over the raspberries

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.080
and hope that solidifies them so they'll mix into the ice

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.060
cream a little bit nicer.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.420
Scrape our raspberries and our liquid nitrogen just down

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.180
into the bowl.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.960
That is looking like some delicious raspberry ice cream.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.340
Very good.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.580
Lots of good creamy flavor of course, some good

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.300
raspberry flavor, and a little bit of a

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.700
tart kick from the actual raspberry mixed in. This

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.480
is delicious.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.880
There you have it: Milk, cream, half &amp; half, some liquid

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.220
nitrogen, and several delicious recipes for ice cream.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.040
These are all seriously very good.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.880
We have our standard vanilla, we've got our raspberry

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.300
with actual raspberries in it, and we have our caramel

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.980
flavor with caramel swirls in it, which is also fantastic.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.580
Our standard-style ice cream was made by mixing up

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.320
our cream and our half &amp; half and then adding liquid

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.860
nitrogen to that while we stirred it. Our Dippin' Dot-style

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.020
ice cream was made by slowly squeezing out a mixture

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.360
of milk and half &amp; half with some sugar and flavoring

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.640
added into the liquid nitrogen so it

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.780
formed nice little ice cream beads. With our standard

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.729
ice cream recipe if you do want it to be a little lower-fat

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.320
you can substitute milk for the half &amp; half

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.320
and substitute half &amp; half for the cream.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.500
This will cut down on the fat a lot and if you're using

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.280
liquid nitrogen it's still going to freeze and get pretty

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.000
solid. It won't taste quite as creamy but it will still be

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.760
quite delicious.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.340
