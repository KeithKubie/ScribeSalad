(serene music)

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:05.263
(audience applauding)

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.040
- Well, thank you very much.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.010
I should remind you that
my brother is a novelist,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.320
and so a writer of fiction.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.730
(audience chuckling)

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.000
I felt very honored

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.510
and also very flattered

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.770
to be invited to give this
Howison Lecture in Berkeley

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.533
in 2012.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.280
And the feeling was only increased

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.680
when I read the list

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.363
of my predecessors in this office,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.803
some 70-odd lecturers,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.080
some of them really pretty odd,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.390
but on the whole,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.803
a very, very distinguished lot.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.470
You have no hope of hearing anything

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.180
of the same standard

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.710
as what you would have heard here

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.483
20 or 30 years ago.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.700
I feel also that what I have to say

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.000
would not have commended itself

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.583
to the philosopher for
whom this lecture is named.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.680
But I do think that the subject

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.630
would have appealed to him

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.203
as a suitably philosophical subject.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.353
The subject is death.

00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:23.923
And death, after all,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.480
is the final end of all our interests

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.530
and one of the few things in life

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.493
of which we can be really certain.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.810
And I find each year

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.855
it becomes more certain.

00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:41.540
(audience chuckling)

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.830
All the ancient philosophers,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.420
the Epicureans

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.193
were particularly preoccupied by death.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.103
They thought,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.360
they said,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.240
that most men

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.270
live in terror of dying,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.980
perpetually wracked, as Lucretius put it,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.763
by the fear of Acheron,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.500
which shakes human life

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.810
from top to bottom,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.470
which covers everything

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.980
with the black of night,

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.563
which prevents all clear
and unsullied pleasure.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.660
The reaper with the scythe

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.500
stands always at our shoulder,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.490
his fleshless hand

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.993
directs our every thought and action,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.510
and his inescapable presence

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.470
fills our every moment

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.283
with fear and trembling.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.970
We are thanatophobes.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.833
Poor, miserable thanatophobes.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.700
Moved by that distressful
state of affairs,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.360
the Epicureans,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.820
being philanthropical philosophers

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.373
thought they could do something about it.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.160
They offered their fellow men a cure

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.493
for their morbid disease.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.940
This cure was not pharmacological,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.440
it didn't involve taking
drugs or making drugs,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.480
it was consequently very cheap

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.093
and had no side effects.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.653
The cure was an argument,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.403
a philosophical argument.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.473
Take this argument, they said,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.640
and your dread of death

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.180
will at first abate

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.883
and then disappear,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.260
its place being taken

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.943
by pleasure, joy, and delight.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.773
The argument ran roughly like this.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.220
What happens, said the Epicureans,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.340
to animals

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.600
when they die,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.140
to animals, whether
they're ants or armadillos,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.473
mice or men,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.410
is that their souls

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.993
part company with their bodies.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.750
Every animal, they said,

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.260
is a composite being,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.210
composed of two primary bits:

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.883
a body and a soul.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.280
So the death of an animal

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.800
is the dissolution of a composite being

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.603
and consequently, the
annihilation of that being.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.550
Once dead,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.693
a mouse exists no more.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.283
And the same is true of men.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.370
Now once it's dead in that case,

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.500
nothing more can happen to a mouse

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.540
or to a man

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.947
because there's nothing there

00:05:54.947 --> 00:05:57.163
for anything to happen to.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.700
And in particular,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.310
nothing nasty

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.480
or unpleasant can happen

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.470
to a mouse or to a man

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.723
once it's dead.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.233
For that being so,

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.980
there's no reason in the world

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.070
why anyone, mouse or man,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.563
should give a hoot about being dead.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.000
And in particular,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.660
no reason in the world

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.223
why anyone should be afraid of being dead.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.450
Death, as Lucretius says,

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.450
is nothing to us.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.513
It's none of our business.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.640
When he says that death is nothing to us,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.710
he means being dead,

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.590
the state of being dead is nothing to us.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.210
Dying, of course, the process of dying,

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.990
may be and sometimes was

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.120
a peculiarly unpleasant business.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.563
He's not talking about that.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.340
When he says death is nothing to us,

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.227
he means that my death is nothing to me

00:07:06.227 --> 00:07:08.253
and your death is nothing to you.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.063
It might well be

00:07:10.063 --> 00:07:12.350
that your death meant a lot to me,

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.150
and also, though less probably,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.520
that mine meant something to you.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.870
He says nothing about that.

00:07:21.088 --> 00:07:22.200
And when he says, Lucretius,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.720
that death is none of our business,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.760
what he means

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.480
is that whatever may happen once I'm dead

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.423
is no concern of mine.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.440
It would be as absurd as irrational

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.120
for me to worry about being dead,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.113
about what happens once I'm dead,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.600
as it would be for me to lose sleep

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.740
over the question

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.873
of what happens on other galaxies,

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:52.310
or to waste my time

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.020
reflecting upon the political constitution

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.173
of Uruguay.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.360
Lucretius himself doesn't, of course,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.388
refer to Uruguay.

00:08:00.388 --> 00:08:03.388
(audience laughing)

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.380
Whatever may happen

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.250
during a long period of time

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.573
in which I am dead,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.210
none of that is any business of mine.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.070
For, as the Epicureans like to put it,

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.430
when death is, I am not,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.653
and when I am, death is not.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.650
You might ask various questions

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.100
about that argument.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.410
How good is it?

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:35.130
You might wonder, for example,

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.400
whether it really did the work

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.433
that the Epicureans thought it could do.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.987
Suppose that I take in that argument

00:08:41.987 --> 00:08:43.730
and think about it,

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.280
will I be cured

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.483
of this morbid fear of death?

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.120
Well, I don't know what
the answer to that is

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.940
beyond saying that it seems to me

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.530
that the Epicurean argument

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.020
was, therapeutically speaking,

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.980
at least as good as any cure

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.560
which any ancient doctor

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.722
offered for any ordinary disease.

00:09:01.722 --> 00:09:03.070
(audience chuckling)

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.138
But my concern, qua philosopher,

00:09:06.138 --> 00:09:07.550
so to speak,

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.740
is not with the question of
the ethicacy of the argument,

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.850
but whether philosophically speaking,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.263
it's a decent argument.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.580
That is to say

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.320
does it reach a true conclusion

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.930
by valid argumentation

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.333
from true premises?

00:09:27.385 --> 00:09:29.585
And that's what I'm
going to talk about now.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.990
It's perhaps worth,

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.653
at the cost of pedantry,

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.860
which is another name

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.185
I sometimes sing for philosophy,

00:09:44.185 --> 00:09:45.514
(audience chuckling)

00:09:45.514 --> 00:09:46.830
to set out the argument

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.253
a little more formally.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.140
There are different ways of doing it.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:54.973
Here's one way.

00:09:54.973 --> 00:09:56.420
It has four premises, okay?

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.710
The first premise says

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.550
the death of an animal

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.870
is a separation

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.713
of its body and its soul.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.280
A cat dies

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.250
when its body and its soul comes apart.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.003
It's dead when its soul
and its body are apart.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:18.783
That's the first premise, right,

00:10:18.783 --> 00:10:19.970
what death is.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.220
The second premise

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.170
says that animals are
essentially composites

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.973
of two bits, a body and a soul.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.170
A cat

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.670
isn't a body which just happens
to be attached to a soul

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.680
nor a soul which just
happens to be in contact

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.170
with a body.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.563
A cat is essentially a bipartite creature,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.223
a soul plus body.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.090
From those two premises

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.968
that death is separation of body and soul,

00:10:50.968 --> 00:10:52.650
and that an animal is a composite

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.320
of body and soul,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.050
it follows in the Epicurean argument

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.810
that once an animal is dead,

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.273
it doesn't exist.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.143
Once my cat has killed the mouse,

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.640
the mouse exists no more

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.600
because the mouse is a composite

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.690
of body and soul,

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.840
and that composite exists no more,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.353
having been separated by my cat.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.940
The third premise claims

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.440
that nothing can happen to an animal,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.070
or indeed to anything else,

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.123
at a time when it doesn't exist.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.093
If that's so,

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.050
it follows

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.020
that nothing can happen to a cat

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.800
or to any other animal

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.910
at a time when it's dead,

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.960
because when it's dead, it doesn't exist,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.480
and when it doesn't exist,

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.893
nothing can happen to it.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.850
The fourth premise states

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.830
that if nothing can happen to an animal

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.323
at a given time,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.510
then nothing which happens at that time

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.663
is of any concern to the animal.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.950
If the cat isn't there

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.533
in 2014,

00:12:10.533 --> 00:12:13.250
then nothing that happens in 2014

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.373
can be any business of the cat's.

00:12:19.128 --> 00:12:21.620
And from that premise and
the preceding conclusion,

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.860
it follows that nothing whatever

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.960
which happens at a time
when an animal is dead

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.820
is of any concern to that animal.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.123
Death is nothing to us.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.530
When I was a boy

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.920
many years ago,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.263
centuries ago,

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.750
when I first read that item,

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.550
I thought it was really bloody good.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.550
I still think it's pretty bloody good,

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.350
but not as good as I thought it was.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.290
You might first ask,

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.000
well, I don't know if you would,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.490
I'm first going to ask,

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.300
well, what the Epicureans'
ancient colleagues

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.393
would have or did think of this argument.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.723
First of all,

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.740
though they disagreed with the Epicureans

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.943
on almost every point in philosophy,

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.280
all ancient philosophers

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.610
agreed with them on their first premise,

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.260
namely that the death of an animal

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.123
is the separation of
its soul from its body.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.700
The first Christian philosopher

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.500
who wrote about the soul,

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.740
namely Tertullian, says

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.120
all the pagan philosophers agree

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.270
that death is the separation
of soul from body.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.303
And he says they're right.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.713
Of course

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.370
the pagans thought that death

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.600
was a natural event,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.560
whereas Tertullian knows

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.910
that it's not natural,
but rather a punishment

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.390
visited on humans

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.500
because a certain woman

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.030
a long time ago

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.995
ate a fruit from a forbidden tree.

00:14:14.995 --> 00:14:15.960
(audience chuckling)

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.850
But that diverting fantasy apart,

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.250
the Christian philosophers

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.140
agreed with the pagan philosophers

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.613
about the nature of death.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.400
Death for all animals,

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.120
human or not,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.570
is a decomposition,

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.563
a coming apart of body and soul.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.600
So far, so good for the Epicureans,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.580
but after that,

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.717
things go depart.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.290
When you get to the second premise,

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.370
the premise according to which animals

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.650
are essentially composites
of body and soul,

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:50.680
you find that

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.233
Platonist philosophers disagree.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.093
Take Arthur.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.720
Arthur is a cat,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.080
one of my cats,

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.170
one of my favorite cats

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.190
who's been dead for some time.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.223
Nice gray cat.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.823
Arthur, according to the Platonists,

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.500
was, when he was alive,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.023
an embodied soul.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.103
But Arthur was not a composite being.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.420
He was not made up

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.960
of a feline body

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.573
and a feline soul.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.193
No, he was a soul.

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:33.250
Well, he still is a soul, of course.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.830
And he wasn't a feline soul, Arthur,

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.003
because souls don't come in species.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.490
Arthur, rather,

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.823
was a soul who, for a while,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.833
inhabited or took on a feline body.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.693
In this life, he had a feline body.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.800
When he died,

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.733
he took off his feline body.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:00.950
So his death,

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.103
though it's a separation
of body from soul,

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.460
isn't a matter of extinction

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.223
or his ceasing to exist.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.840
After all, Gypsy Rose Lee

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.480
didn't cease to exist

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.773
each time she reached the
climax of her striptease,

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.850
nor did she cease to exist

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.073
when she finally stripped off her body.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.410
What happened to her after her death?

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.150
Well, who knows?

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.100
According to Plato,

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.030
I guess she probably returned to earth

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.860
in a new body,

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.400
perhaps the body of a peacock

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.750
or a hoopoe.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.457
(audience chuckling)

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:40.990
Arthur, on the other hand,

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.940
being a virtuous cat,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.817
was probably

00:16:43.817 --> 00:16:45.680
(audience member laughing)

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.460
allowed by the infernal judges

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.260
to continue as a disembodied soul,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.670
in which state, he now
enjoys, I like to think,

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.490
the pure and true pleasures

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.776
of philosophical contemplation.

00:16:59.776 --> 00:17:02.280
(audience laughing)

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.570
However that may be,

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:04.970
according to the Platonists,

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.652
death isn't our extinction,

00:17:10.652 --> 00:17:12.150
but we have every reason to worry about

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.200
what's going to happen to us

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.223
once we are dead.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.900
Most ancient thinkers,

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.290
not unreasonably,

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.260
thought that from that point of view,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.650
as from most others,

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.693
Platonism was absurd.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.471
And of course, I agree with these people.

00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:32.180
(audience member laughing)

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.920
The Stoics, for example,

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.320
and the Christians too,

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.660
agreed with the Epicureans

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.373
that we are composite entities.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:43.530
Animals aren't souls.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.930
They're bipartite things

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.853
consisting of bodies and souls.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.703
Not only that,

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.530
Stoics and Christians would happily accept

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.780
the second premise of
the Epicurean argument,

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.873
that

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.220
when a cat or any animal is dead,

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.863
it exists no more.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.060
But they thought,

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:12.960
or at least they would have thought,

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.610
had they addressed specifically

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:15.973
the Epicurean argument,

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.730
that this second premise
was not good enough

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.050
for the Epicureans.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.080
For from the second premise,

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.940
that when an animal is dead,

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.133
it doesn't exist,

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.060
the Epicureans move on

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.380
to a conclusion that

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.470
after an animal's dead,

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.863
nothing can happen to it.

00:18:47.249 --> 00:18:48.463
And this influence,

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.110
Stoics and Christians
would have pointed out,

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.293
doesn't work.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.090
True.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.460
While or when an animal is dead,

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.340
they might have said

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.740
nothing can happen to it.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.890
It doesn't exist,
nothing can happen to it.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.120
But it doesn't follow from the fact

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.563
that when it's dead,

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.940
nothing can happen to it,

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.820
that once it's dead,

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.583
nothing can ever happen to it.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.680
When my cat, Galen,

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.653
I like to change cats
from time to time, died,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.160
his body and soul parted company

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.040
according to Stoics and Christians,

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.603
and he ceased to exist.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.380
Throughout the time in which he was dead,

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.130
he didn't exist.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.600
And so, let us concede

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.153
nothing could happen to him.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.983
But what

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.213
if he didn't stay dead?

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.063
What if the two parts of Galen,

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:57.150
like Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor,

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.838
divorced only to remarry?

00:19:59.838 --> 00:20:02.600
(audience member laughing)

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.440
Well, that's not just a fantasy,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.970
well of course, it's a fantasy,

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.610
but it's not just an invention.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.980
It's exactly what does happen

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.203
according to the Stoics.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.230
When we die,

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.760
our bodies and our souls part.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.690
Eventually, the whole
world goes up in flames.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.830
But then things start up again.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.500
And with the inevitability of causation,

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.880
bodies and souls come back,

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.960
and there we are again.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.683
The same old bloody thing,

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.863
one after another.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.770
The Christian philosophers, of course,

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.173
held the same curious view,

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:43.793
or a similar view.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.870
To be sure,

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.033
when I'm dead,

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.490
I don't exist.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.430
There's one bit of me,

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.350
namely my body,

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.460
which is sleeping in a crematorium

00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:58.740
and another bit of me,

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.000
namely my soul,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.313
which is waiting in hell.

00:21:02.313 --> 00:21:03.930
(audience chuckling)

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.123
It is waiting in hell.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.493
But sometime later,

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.173
those two things are
gonna come together again.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.060
What will happen then,

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.550
according to the Christians,

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.500
isn't quite the same

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.983
as what will happen
then according to Plato.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.333
Rather,

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.420
what will happen then is either

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.080
that I shall have suffer
perpetual torment in hell

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.941
or else perpetual tedium in heaven.

00:21:37.941 --> 00:21:39.600
(audience laughing)

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.280
In either event,

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.950
Christians had every reason to
be apprehensive about death,

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.180
not about what was going to happen

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.783
when they were dead,

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.590
but about what was gonna happen

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.548
when they stopped being dead,

00:21:53.548 --> 00:21:54.920
(audience laughing)

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.163
when the last trumpet sounded,

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.173
and when the dead are raised.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.120
Well, there are two, I think,

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.110
rather serious objections prima facie

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.570
to the Epicurean argument.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:17.030
The Epicureans suppose

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.650
that we are essentially composite beings

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:20.483
of body and soul.

00:22:20.483 --> 00:22:22.473
The Platonists say not at all.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.480
The Epicureans suppose,

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.340
though they don't say this explicitly,

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.530
that once we're dead,

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:30.480
we're dead forever.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.000
Other philosophers hold
that that's not true at all.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.760
Sure, we're dead for a while,

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.380
but after a long while,

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.523
we revive.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.400
There are numerous ways

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.130
in which an Epicurean might reply

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:56.603
to those objections.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:02.200
I shan't mention the
replies which they gave

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.870
explicitly or implicitly,

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.820
but rather suggest the reply

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.520
that they ought to have given,

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.130
or at least the reply
that I'm going to give

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.900
on their behalf.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.220
It's not an Epicurean
reply, but it's a reply

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.890
which does the best for the Epicureans

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.143
that can be done.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.900
It means stepping back

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.890
to look again

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.110
at the first premise of the argument,

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.950
the premise that death

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.188
is a matter of the separation

00:23:31.188 --> 00:23:33.003
of a body and a soul.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.940
That notion, as Tertullian says,

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.100
was a commonplace in antiquity,

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.083
at least a commonplace
among ancient philosophers.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.563
But it's not an evident truth.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.440
I mean, it certainly isn't so to speak

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.403
what they call an analytical truth.

00:23:55.292 --> 00:23:57.250
There's no part of the meaning of the word

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.810
to die in English

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.370
or of (speaking in
foreign language) in Greek

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.360
that dying is a matter of a soul

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.803
separating from a body.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:10.960
And the more one thinks about it,

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.410
least the more I think about it,

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.983
the stranger it becomes.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.767
A couple of days ago,

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:23.444
Perdita, the third of my
cats to be introduced,

00:24:23.444 --> 00:24:25.030
(audience chuckling)

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.138
was sitting on the sundial in the garden.

00:24:28.138 --> 00:24:29.710
(audience chuckling)

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:31.203
She noticed a mouse.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.870
There are lots of mice in the garden.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.480
She jumped down,

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.140
caught the mouse,

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.750
played with it for a bit

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.120
as cats do,

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.217
whopped it with her paw and killed it,

00:24:41.217 --> 00:24:42.885
and then ate it.

00:24:42.885 --> 00:24:44.460
- [Audience Member] Oh!

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.270
- What happened?

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.880
Well, according to the

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.630
view accepted by all ancient philosophers,

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:52.830
what Perdita did

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.380
was skillfully separate

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.683
the mouse into two parts.

00:24:58.683 --> 00:25:00.200
(audience laughing)

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.230
A mouse soul and a mouse body.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.500
And she then ate the more nutritious

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.383
of the two parts,

00:25:06.383 --> 00:25:08.530
(audience laughing)

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.053
minus the gallbladder.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.860
Is that the plain truth of the matter,

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.653
that she divided the mouse into two parts?

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.880
I don't think anyone
would ever say that's so,

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.180
unless you were in the grips

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.580
of a curious philosophy

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.913
or very concerned to
make his audience laugh.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.383
I mean,

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.873
okay, death is a matter of
separating body and soul.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.660
You think of that in
your philosophical study,

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.180
but once you go out into the real world,

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.530
it doesn't seem the sort of thing

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:45.640
you're likely to say.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.890
And it's worse than that.

00:25:50.946 --> 00:25:51.779
It's worse than that

00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:53.100
because when the ancient philosophers

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.870
say that death is a
separation of body and soul,

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.200
you might wonder what on earth they mean.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.050
And in particular,

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.610
you might wonder what on earth they mean

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:01.563
by the word soul.

00:26:04.727 --> 00:26:06.833
After all, we've all come across bodies

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.620
with a bit of luck,

00:26:09.528 --> 00:26:10.700
(audience chuckling)

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.613
but I've never come across a soul,

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.270
partly because I've no
idea what it would be

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.770
to come across a soul,

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.293
and nor have you.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.030
In order for the
Epicurean argument to work

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.680
and for this first premise,

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.810
that death is a separation
of body and soul

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.860
to be true or to have any sense,

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.580
I see I should refer to squirrels,

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.963
not to mice, alright?

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:44.010
We have to be able to give
some appropriate sense

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.860
to the word soul.

00:26:46.576 --> 00:26:48.820
Not any old sense,

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.783
but a sense such that first,

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.593
that there will turn out
to be such things as souls,

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.330
and that secondly,

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.940
souls will be the sort of things

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.100
that could intelligibly be said

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.343
to be attached to and then
separated from bodies.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.663
This, of course, is a complicated matter.

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:17.680
So I should be

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:19.973
as simple as possible.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.493
It seems to me

00:27:23.493 --> 00:27:26.260
that the only way to
make an honest expression

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.520
out of the term soul

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.123
is a roughly Aristotelian way.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.610
The Aristotelian way, as I call it,

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:36.573
goes like this.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.530
The something which differentiates

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.640
living things from nonliving things,

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.840
which differentiates cats from crystals

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.873
or comets,

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:52.600
that's the fact,

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.530
and this is trivial, okay?

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:55.710
That living things are,

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.023
as we say, animate.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.520
The Greek word for animate

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.353
is (speaking in foreign language).

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.787
So living things are (speaking
in foreign language),

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.687
whereas nonliving things are
(speaking in foreign language).

00:28:10.944 --> 00:28:12.437
And that's trivial, right?

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.293
The English word animate,

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.010
in a sense which is trivial,

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:20.850
that living things are animate

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.450
comes from the Latin animatus,

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:28.450
which is connected with
a noun anima in Latin.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.727
And in the same way the Greek adjective,

00:28:30.727 --> 00:28:33.085
(speaking in foreign language)

00:28:33.085 --> 00:28:35.028
comes from the Greek noun,

00:28:35.028 --> 00:28:36.453
(speaking in foreign language) okay?

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:42.460
Now the normal English
for the Latin word anima

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.723
is soul.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.230
So animatus

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.210
might be translated as

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.293
something like ensouled or having a soul.

00:28:54.261 --> 00:28:55.997
The normal English for the Greek word

00:28:55.997 --> 00:28:57.052
(speaking in foreign language)

00:28:57.052 --> 00:28:58.219
again is soul.

00:28:59.575 --> 00:29:02.260
So the word (speaking in foreign language)

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.200
might be translated, and often is,

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.903
as ensouled or having a soul.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.673
Now it's true.

00:29:11.673 --> 00:29:13.710
It's a trivial truth

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.457
that living things are
(speaking in foreign language).

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.940
So it's true a trivial truth

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.647
that living things (speaking
in foreign language).

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.000
That's to say it's true,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.130
a trivial truth,

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.780
that all living things have souls.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.580
That's the way to present the word soul

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.683
and make sense of it.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.383
You might think that in that case,

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.360
it's clear

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.810
that living things are

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:44.643
compounds of body and soul.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.460
Perdita is a living thing,

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.120
so trivially, she has a soul.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.560
She's animate, she's (speaking
in foreign language),

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.473
she has a soul.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.810
Surely, she's evident

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.293
she also has a body.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.100
And so it follows, doesn't it,

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.870
as the second premise has it,

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.820
that she's a compound of body and soul,

00:30:06.738 --> 00:30:09.150
and that the dissolution of the compound

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:09.983
is her death.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.823
Well, no, that's not true at all.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.970
It isn't evident

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.373
that Perdita has a body.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.070
Indeed, it seems to be quite evident

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.550
that my cat Perdita

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.490
doesn't have a body.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.693
She is a body.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.350
She doesn't possess a body

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.840
in the way someone might possess a hat.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.863
She is a body.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.930
Her body isn't a part of her.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:41.763
It's her.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.360
So,

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.810
can you see the cat, Perdita?

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:46.830
Yes.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.400
Well, you can see a part of her.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.233
Which part?

00:30:49.233 --> 00:30:50.340
Her body.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.660
That's absurd.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.540
You see the body, you see the cat,

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.373
you see Perdita.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:57.750
So forget about that, okay?

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:58.650
Imagine that's false.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.040
Okay, as I say, she really has got a body.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.690
She isn't a body, she has a body.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.673
So suppose then

00:31:07.673 --> 00:31:09.110
that Perdita has a body

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.623
and also, trivially, has a soul.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:14.120
Doesn't it follow

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.023
that her soul is a part of her?

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:20.363
Well, not at all.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.930
For her to have a soul

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.070
is for to be animate,

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.743
to be a living thing.

00:31:28.652 --> 00:31:30.490
And for her to be a living thing,

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.050
as Aristotle says,

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:35.410
is for her to have a
certain set of capacities:

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:39.390
the capacity to nourish herself,

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:40.620
to reproduce,

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.540
which I'm afraid she no longer has.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.550
We just had her spayed.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.053
The capacity to eat,

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.500
to purr,

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.070
to move about,

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.773
to play, and so on.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.270
To possess a soul,

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.120
to be animate is to possess a soul.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.060
To possess a soul is to
have a set of capacities.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.790
So what a soul is,

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:05.960
if it's anything at all,

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.623
is a set of capacities.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:12.880
And a thing's capacities

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.233
are not a part of it.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:24.043
In Herbert Reed's poem,
the Naming of Parts,

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.010
among of the parts you name,

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.400
the lower sling swivel,

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.710
the upper sling swivel,

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.430
and the piling swivel.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:34.940
Haven't the faintest idea what they are,

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.253
but those are the parts of the rifle.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:39.940
You don't also name

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:43.340
the capacity to kill a man at 500 yards.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.470
That capacity, which is
possessed by the rifle,

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:46.993
isn't a part of the rifle.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.173
If I change animals now for a moment,

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:54.993
a llama,

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:58.960
this particular llama is called Lorenzo,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.130
has an apparently limitless capacity

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:03.543
to digest grass.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:08.530
That capacity isn't a part of him

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.590
in the way in which his third stomach

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:11.593
is a part of him.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.000
He also has a very keen sense of hearing,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.535
but his keen sense of
hearing isn't a part of him

00:33:19.535 --> 00:33:20.368
in the way his ears are parts of him.

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:27.340
In short, an animal's soul

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.190
being a set of capacities

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.280
isn't a part of an animal,

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.850
and an animal is a composite of two parts:

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:37.293
body and soul.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.200
I think that that's the only sensible way

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.373
of dealing with souls and the like.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.423
And I offer it to a good Epicurean.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.080
I think that on that account,

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.790
the Epicureans will be able to get round

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:02.030
some of the more obvious objections

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.430
raised by Platonists,
Stoics, and Christians

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.483
to their argument about death.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.283
Of course,

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.681
if they accept the Epicurean view,

00:34:14.681 --> 00:34:17.320
if the Epicureans accept
the Aristotelian view,

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.123
they do so at a cost.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.033
If you take the Aristotelian view,

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.333
death

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.803
may be the dissolution of body and soul.

00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:39.630
When you die, you lose
your vital capacities,

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.090
but it doesn't follow

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:42.690
and it's not true

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:46.120
that when you die, you cease to exist.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.930
And it's crucial to the Epicurean argument

00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:51.633
that death is an extinction.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.660
I actually think that's false.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.183
Death isn't an extinction.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.663
When my cat, Galen, died,

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.190
my granddaughter, Mary,

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:10.360
wanted to see Galen

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.733
before I buried him.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.893
I showed her Galen in a cardboard box.

00:35:16.893 --> 00:35:19.640
(audience member chuckling)

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.603
There was the cat, Galen.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.703
He was dead,

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:26.840
but he hadn't ceased to exist.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.370
After all, you could still see him,

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:32.383
touch him, and shed tears over him.

00:35:33.442 --> 00:35:35.970
And he was, of course, still a cat.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.150
A dead cat,

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:38.463
but nonetheless, a cat.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.060
Generally speaking,

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.500
when things die,

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.453
they go on existing for a while.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.557
Not often for very long,

00:35:49.557 --> 00:35:51.490
but in a few cases,

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:54.120
for example, the case of Jeremy Bentham,

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.333
whom you can still see
in London for centuries.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.130
Insofar as the Epicurean argument

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.120
requires that death be an extinction,

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.703
an end of existence,

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.470
the Epicureans must be cheery

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.900
about accepting an Aristotelian view

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.080
of the nature of the soul.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.060
Nonetheless,

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.280
I think that

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.250
with various

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.933
modifications to their view,

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.510
they can reasonably hold,

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:34.560
or a Neo-Epicurean can reasonably hold

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.150
death, that Aristotle says,

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:39.660
is the loss of vital capacities

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.870
at death or shortly after

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:46.663
an animal ceases irrevocably to exist.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.640
However that may be,

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.140
I want now to turn to the
third premise of the argument,

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.640
the premise according to which

00:36:58.069 --> 00:37:00.110
when a thing doesn't exist,

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:01.383
nothing can touch it.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.490
I find this premise, in some ways,

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.743
the most perplexing
premise of the argument.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:14.073
In a way, it seems evidently true.

00:37:15.024 --> 00:37:16.340
If the thing isn't there,

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.823
how can anything possibly happen to it?

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.560
On the other hand,

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.580
it's quite difficult to find

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.800
a precise formulation of the premise

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.923
which renders it true.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.440
You might think the obvious way

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.640
of taking the premises,
something like this.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.203
If an item doesn't exist at a given time,

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.680
then nothing whatever can
come to be true of the item

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.793
at that time.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.230
Not that nothing can be true
of the item at that time.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.410
Any number of things,

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:50.160
as Aristotle almost said,

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.920
are now true of Homer.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.140
For example, that Homer's a poet,

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.403
that he wrote in Greek.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.560
The fact that he doesn't exist

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.803
doesn't stop those
things being true of him.

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:04.980
But perhaps nothing can
come to be true of Homer

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.280
now that he doesn't exist anymore.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.310
Well, you think about that for a moment.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:09.763
It quitely is not true.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:13.570
Any number of things every day

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:14.740
can't be true of Homer

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.040
which weren't true before.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.543
Take the predicate,

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:25.640
schema has been read by N people, 'kay?

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.250
Has been read by 30,000 people,

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:28.963
30,001 people.

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.220
I take it that pretty well
every day of the year,

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.690
a predicate of that sort

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:35.840
comes to be true of Homer

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.440
which wasn't true of him before.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:41.500
He gains new readers every year,

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.093
long after his extinction.

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:46.460
In the same sort of way,

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.410
world record holders

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:50.140
may lose their titles

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.563
long after they have ceased to exist.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.220
Recently, a horse

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.860
has become tremendously famous

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.483
decades after its death.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.730
And even philosophers

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:08.099
have their posthumous ups and downs.

00:39:08.099 --> 00:39:10.460
(audience chuckling)

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:13.633
Nonexistence doesn't stop
things happening to you.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.930
I mean, clearly, that's true, right?

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:21.870
There are any number of things

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:23.290
you might say about that.

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.360
I think the best way to approach it

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.743
is to take the third and the
fourth premise in tandem,

00:39:30.015 --> 00:39:31.800
third and fourth premises
in tandem together.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.920
The third premise says
if a thing doesn't exist,

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.740
nothing can happen to it.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.420
Well, that's not true.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.640
So we need something like
if a thing doesn't exist,

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.200
nothing of a given sort,

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.027
nothing of sort X can happen to it.

00:39:45.027 --> 00:39:47.610
And then the fourth premise
reads something like

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:49.280
if nothing of a sort X

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.080
can happen to an object,

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.373
then it has no reason
to care about it, okay?

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.123
So we look for the magic ingredient, X.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.220
Third premise now says

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:02.710
once a thing no longer exists,

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.910
nothing of a given sort

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:05.763
can happen to it.

00:40:06.978 --> 00:40:09.320
And the fourth premise says that

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.780
if nothing of a given sort,

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.010
of that given sort can
happen to something,

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.923
then that thing has reason
for concern about it.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.670
So what possible values are there

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.300
for this predicate,

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.833
this term, X?

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.950
All the ancient texts suggest

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.530
what one would think anyway,

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:29.910
that X has something to do

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.573
with helping and harming.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:35.690
So you might think that the third premise

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:36.960
should be something like

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.920
if an object doesn't
exist at a given time,

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.580
then nothing which happens at that time

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.303
can help or harm it.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.960
Well, that of course,
is quite clearly false.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.380
Any number of things happened

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.860
before I existed

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.063
which harmed me.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.870
For example, I now have frightful teeth

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.660
because before I ever existed,

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.783
my mother didn't get enough calcium.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.210
But perhaps what really counts here

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:09.283
is that once a thing has ceased to exist,

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:12.340
nothing that happens thereafter

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.293
can harm it or hurt it.

00:41:16.742 --> 00:41:17.970
Is that true?

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:21.525
Well, I don't know.

00:41:21.525 --> 00:41:23.180
If you've been to Venice,

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:26.530
you would have seen in the
grand hall of the doges

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:29.850
that frieze of portraits

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.213
of the successive doges.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:34.420
The portraits, every so often,

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.633
they're interrupted by black rectangles.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.580
Those black rectangles

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:44.560
cover, blank out the portraits

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.503
of doges who suffered damnatio memoriae.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.540
They were damned.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.973
Their memory was damned.

00:41:56.095 --> 00:41:57.500
Damnatio memoriae

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.100
is something that only happened to you

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.193
once you're dead.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.280
You can't suffer damnatio memoriae

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.553
when you're still alive.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.570
But surely, damnatio memoriae

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:11.830
is a frightful thing to happen to you.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:13.530
It harms you.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:14.513
It hurts you.

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:16.963
If I were a doge,

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.250
looking up at this

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:22.560
series of friezes of black spaces,

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.640
I'd think, good God,

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.590
I hope they don't give me a black part.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.550
If they do,

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:30.563
that would be awful.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.203
Well,

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.790
were the doges harmed posthumously

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.090
by having their memories
damned or weren't they?

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.290
I think that that's a
question for decision.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.670
There's no true answer.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:50.823
You just decide.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.000
But I think that behind that

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.100
lies something like the following question

00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:58.310
and following idea,

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.653
that even if the doge is harmed,

00:43:02.572 --> 00:43:03.980
but he no longer exists,

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.980
he doesn't suffer from the harm,

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.333
he doesn't feel the harm, 'kay?

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.320
And surely, the Epicureans

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.620
really are getting in their third premise

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.590
at something of this sort.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:24.773
Once an animal no longer exists,

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:30.780
it can't any longer feel or experience

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.413
anything at all.

00:43:33.296 --> 00:43:34.570
(speaking in foreign language)

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:37.040
It can't feel or experience

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.543
anything pleasant or unpleasant.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.000
It can't feel or experience

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.743
anything agreeable or disagreeable.

00:43:48.622 --> 00:43:50.780
At any rate, that seems to me

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:54.110
to be the most plausible way

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:57.820
of reconstruing the third
premise of the argument.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:58.653
'Kay,

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:01.573
the sort X,

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:03.960
which can't effect us,

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.220
is a sort of felt suffering

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.143
or felt benefit.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:13.370
If that's right,

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.320
then the fourth premise of the argument

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.760
must say

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.050
that if

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:22.533
at a given time,

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:26.680
I cannot feel or experience

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:30.200
anything pleasant or unpleasant,

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.400
then what happens at that time

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.503
is no concern of mine.

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:40.483
If from the given time onward,

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:44.090
an animal can experience nothing at all

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.473
and make with no sensation whatsoever,

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:50.420
then nothing which happens at that time,

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:52.080
according to the Epicureans

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.183
is of any concern to the animal.

00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:59.110
I think something like that

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:02.560
was the fourth premise of
the Epicurean argument,

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.360
and I think that's ultimately

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.063
why the Epicurean argument doesn't work.

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.713
Because it's straightforwardly
false, I think,

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:17.820
that we have no reason to be concerned

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.840
about states of affairs

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.680
in which we ourselves

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.993
can have no feelings of any sort.

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.100
Okay.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.050
Here are a couple of types of examples.

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.883
There are lots.

00:45:32.313 --> 00:45:34.910
The first type of example

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:37.000
concerns what I call

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.733
altruistic fears and hopes.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:45.640
Despite what the Epicureans
sometimes seem to say,

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.490
animals in general

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.270
and humans in particular

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:49.600
are just occasionally concerned

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.363
with things other than themselves.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.060
Lorenzo the llama

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.610
cares for Leonora, his lady wife,

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:01.270
and for Laura, their daughter.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:02.163
That's evident.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:07.050
Female cats generally
care for their kittens.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:08.570
And some human parents

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.220
actually care for their children.

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:16.510
In particular, one
animal may be frightened

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:18.563
for another.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.050
I recently came across the case

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:24.083
of Lieutenant Colonel Pothecary,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:25.833
it's a surname,

00:46:25.833 --> 00:46:27.440
but it's a true story,

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.550
who commanded the British battalion

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:31.153
during the Second World War.

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:36.490
His battalion landed in Normandy on D-Day,

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:37.960
and just before D-Day,

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.900
Pothecary learnt that his eldest son,

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.050
who was a captain in the Royal Navy,

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.350
had had his ship torpedoed

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:47.010
and was drifting in Mid-Atlantic

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:48.063
in a small boat.

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:52.010
Pothecary was riven with fear,

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:53.943
fear for himself, of course,

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.020
since he was likely to meet pain,

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.960
mutilation, or death,

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.580
but also fear for his men,

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.813
who were likely to meet the same fate,

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:06.510
and for whom he was responsible,

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:09.260
and above all, according to this story,

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.483
fear for his son, whom he loved.

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:16.673
These you might call altruistic fears.

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:19.270
And as far as I can see,

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:21.200
they're just as oppressive

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.590
and just as real

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:24.930
as any egocentric fears.

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:27.093
And they're also just as rational.

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.333
That being so,

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:37.050
it follows, it's clear

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:38.870
that an animal and man

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.720
might be reasonably, in
certain circumstances,

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.783
fear his own death.

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.530
If a parent dies,

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:51.350
who's going to look after the children?

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:53.126
If Pothecary is killed,

00:47:53.126 --> 00:47:55.023
what will happen to his men?

00:47:59.419 --> 00:48:02.150
One of my heroes from English history

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.410
is Lord Nelson, Horatio Nelson,

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:07.610
frightful cad in many ways, but still.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:08.683
He knew no fear.

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:12.123
He was also an ostentatious sort of chap.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.643
At the Battle of Trafalgar,

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:20.050
he stood on the poop deck of HMS Victory

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:22.163
in his full naval finery.

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.540
And he was shot by a French sniper

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.193
and died shortly afterwards.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.630
He hadn't been afraid to die,

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:31.930
but he ought to have been.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.100
He also feared not for
himself, but for his men,

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.040
and also, of course, for England,

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.330
which expected that every
man would do his duty,

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:42.880
which Nelson clearly didn't do.

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.150
Had Nelson been properly afraid

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:49.620
and acted in accordance
with his proper fear,

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.750
fear not for himself,

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:54.060
but for other people and other things,

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.650
he would have survived
to encourage his men

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:59.270
and defend his country.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.230
All that is perfectly obvious,

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.570
and you might say the Epicureans
must have thought of it.

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:04.483
Well, they didn't.

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:11.100
But apart from altruistic fears,

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:13.840
there are also egocentric reasons

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.460
for fearing death,

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.963
or at least for being
pretty reluctant to die.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.353
I shan't

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:25.960
comment upon

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.790
that sort of angst or
existential fear of nothing,

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:33.390
which my brother so memorably describes

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:35.000
in his book.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.240
I'm thinking of something much more banal

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:41.650
and much more common and real.

00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:43.000
It's just this.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.670
Most of us, most of the time,

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:47.873
have various long-term projects.

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.370
At the moment,

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:53.253
I'm trying to write a book
about the church fathers.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.100
All of us, I suppose, most of the time

00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.883
have middle-term projects.

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:04.243
For example, a project
to breed white canaries.

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:06.970
And we all, surely,

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:09.080
always have short-term projects,

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.577
even if it's only the project

00:50:10.577 --> 00:50:12.850
to eat crackers in bed.

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:15.933
(audience chuckling)

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.720
If you have plans and projects,

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.790
then of course, you want
those plans and projects

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:23.423
to be brought to completion.

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.420
And normally, though not always,

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.660
the only person that can
bring them to completion

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:30.713
is yourself.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.790
After all, some projects

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:36.110
can't be completed

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.053
by anyone other than yourself.

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:40.620
My project of writing a book

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.060
on the church fathers

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.860
could be completed after my death

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.693
by Tony Long, for example.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.430
But my short-term project

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:50.892
of rereading Maupassant's Bel Ami

00:50:50.892 --> 00:50:52.410
couldn't possible be completed

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:54.213
by anyone other than me.

00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:59.503
Now if I'm writing a book,

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:02.720
I probably need to stay alive

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.720
for another two or three years to do it.

00:51:06.091 --> 00:51:08.699
And that gives me a
reason for avoiding death,

00:51:08.699 --> 00:51:09.532
(audience member laughing)

00:51:09.532 --> 00:51:10.390
just as it gives me a reason

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:12.640
for trying to stave off Alzheimer's,

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.960
DTs, and all the other things

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.235
which senility brings on.

00:51:17.235 --> 00:51:19.120
(audience member chuckling)

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.070
If it's my project,

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:23.100
this is terribly serious,

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.750
if it's my project to reread Bel Ami,

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.783
I need at least two or three hours.

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:30.640
And just as that gives me a good reason

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.780
for not wanting to fall asleep at once,

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:34.800
it gives me a good reason

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.540
for not wanting to die at once.

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:38.850
It doesn't, of course,

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:40.280
give me a reason

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.140
for being corroded with fear

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.720
at the thought of being dead,

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.820
but it does give me a reason

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.310
for being miffed

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:50.080
or vexed

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:52.290
or even enraged

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:55.553
if I learnt that I was about to die.

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:01.890
There's a further step, 'kay?

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:06.140
Each of us always has some project or plan

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.513
which can't be completed once we're dead.

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:11.960
Each of us therefore
always has a good reason

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.700
for not wanting to be dead,

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:16.250
indeed for wanting not to be dead.

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:17.530
Not that we have a reason

00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:19.690
for wanting never to be dead,

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:21.700
nor that we ever have
a reason, or I don't,

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:24.163
for wanting to live for another 500 years.

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.370
But now, I have a reason

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:29.880
for wanting to live for
another five minutes,

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.833
say, to get to the end of this lecture.

00:52:31.833 --> 00:52:32.840
(audience laughing)

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.460
And after five minutes,

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.530
I should have a reason

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:37.520
for wanting to live another five minutes,

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.603
to get over to the questions, and so on.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.290
I'll always have a good reason

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:46.280
for not wanting to be dead

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:48.980
ad infinitum,

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:50.423
or rather, ad mortem.

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.660
For those reasons then,

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.070
I think that ultimately,

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:58.053
the Epicurean argument
doesn't reach its conclusion,

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:00.773
much so as mar the argument.

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:06.563
Hamlet says, "To die, to sleep,

00:53:08.198 --> 00:53:09.737
"to sleep perchance to dream.

00:53:09.737 --> 00:53:11.177
"Ay, there's the rub.

00:53:11.177 --> 00:53:12.887
"For in that sleep of death,

00:53:12.887 --> 00:53:15.210
"what dreams may come?"

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:18.620
There, the Epicureans
disagree with Hamlet.

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.360
They tell him, truly,

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.690
that death is not a sleep at all.

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:27.603
The big sleep isn't a big sleep.

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:30.710
Cemeteries, despite their etymology,

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:31.713
are dormitories.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.060
Once you're dead,

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.543
you dream no more.

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:39.887
Hamlet goes on to ask,

00:53:39.887 --> 00:53:41.987
"Who would fardels bear

00:53:41.987 --> 00:53:45.450
"but for the fear of
something after death?"

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:47.380
And there, unless I'm mistaken,

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:49.573
the Epicureans agree with Hamlet.

00:53:50.762 --> 00:53:52.280
They'd say, "True."

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.760
No one would bear fardels,

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.130
put up with this life

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.080
unless they're afraid that
things would be even worse

00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.193
for them after death.

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:02.640
But there, I think,

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.203
the Epicureans are wrong.

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:07.330
There are plenty of reasons

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:10.420
other than the fear of postmortem distress

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:12.180
for preferring fardels

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.533
to a bare bodkin.

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:17.340
Some of the reasons are altruistic.

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:18.310
Hamlet, for example,

00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:19.520
might have thought of his duties

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.963
as the king of Denmark.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.860
Others are egocentric.

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.463
Hamlet might have thought of his plan

00:54:25.463 --> 00:54:28.860
to discovering exactly
how many things there are

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:30.640
in heaven and earth

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:33.121
which are not dreamt up
in Horatio's philosophy.

00:54:33.121 --> 00:54:34.950
(audience laughing)

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:36.080
Those are not reasons,

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.570
or not all of my reasons
for fearing death,

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:41.050
but they are reasons for
being concerned about death

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:43.000
or worrying about dying,

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.280
for wanting, sometimes wanting very much

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.593
not to die now.

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.770
No argument connects
to abate such worries,

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:52.920
nor should it,

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.773
because they are reasonable worries.

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.040
So what's to be done?

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.223
This is really the end, okay?

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:07.990
If philanthropic Epicureans
do not, in the end,

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:09.460
provide us satisfactory answers,

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:10.323
the question,

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.630
what's to be done,

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:14.883
what can we poor philosophers do?

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.400
What can we say to those about to die?

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.671
Two things, right?

00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:22.320
First of all,

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.180
do all you can

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.520
to make sure that other people

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.173
and other things don't
depend on your own survival.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.253
I have insured my life.

00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:35.420
I've set up a trust fund
for my grandchildren.

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:38.160
And I'm determined to
accept no appointment

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.363
in the armed forces from now on.

00:55:40.363 --> 00:55:43.120
(audience laughing)

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.810
Secondly, the older I get,

00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:47.473
the more I adjust my plans and projects.

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:50.053
I keep them short-term.

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:53.580
Those projects I have now

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.380
can either be carried on successfully

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.150
by someone else after I'm dead

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:02.600
or only take another 2
1/2 minutes, I think,

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.903
or anyway, are projects I
don't care too much about.

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:07.923
That, I think,

00:56:07.923 --> 00:56:10.720
is the philosophical
answer to the question:

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.513
What should we do about
the prospect of dying?

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:16.710
You will perhaps think

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:21.360
this is not really a philosophical answer.

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.673
Rather, it's an answer
given by common sense.

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.053
Well, I agree.

00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:30.280
But as Bishop Berkeley put it,

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.020
one of the chief tasks of philosophy

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.150
is to be eternally a calling man

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:36.323
to common sense.

00:56:38.376 --> 00:56:41.543
(audience applauding)

00:56:46.673 --> 00:56:49.256
(serene music)
