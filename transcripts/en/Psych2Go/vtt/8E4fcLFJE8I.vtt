00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.590
How we arranged and organized our rooms can say a lot about us for many of us our bedrooms are the most

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.719
personal and intimate spaces in our home

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.369
Colors and smells can give away your sensory interests and small decorations can hint at your taste and personal style

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:32.039
For example a messy room can mean that you're disorganized while a very neat and clean room can suggest that you're uptight.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.398
In Malcolm Gladwell's acclaimed book "Blink" he references Samuel Gosling a personality and social

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.599
psychologist who studies how people's behavior appearance and

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:50.909
Physical environment affects how they're perceived. Gosling names three variables in a bedroom that gives out clues to a person's personality

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.820
identity claims behavioural residue and thoughts and feelings regulators.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.300
An Identity Claim is a deliberate expression about how you want to be perceived by others for example

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.589
Putting your favorite books on a shelf serves as an identity claim

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.409
Because the people who enter your room can instantly get a good perspective of the things you're interested in

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.500
Behavioral residue on the contrary is the unintentional results of your behavior.

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.059
If you leave your shoes scattered around the floor. It's probably because you're lazy

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.569
you didn't intentionally leave them there to give the impression that you're

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.779
unorganized. Thoughts and feelings regulators are objects that affect the way you feel in your room

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.909
Candles that you put on top of your desk to give your room a calm feeling is an example of a thoughts and feelings regulator

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:51.209
So if a stranger enters your room and takes a look around they'll be able to Gather certain aspects about your personality just by observation

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.969
Gosling proved this in an experiment involving eighty college students using a highly respected questionnaire called the big five

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.799
inventory which measures people across five dimensions one:

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.819
Extraversion. Are you sociable and fun-loving or retiring and reserved?

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.819
Two: Agreeableness, are you trusting and helpful or suspicious and uncooperative?

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.140
Three:

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.149
Conscientiousness, are you organized and self disciplined or disorganized and weak weld?

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.290
Four: emotional stability

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.629
Are you worried and insecure or calm and secure?

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.739
Five:

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.809
Openness to new experiences are you imaginative and independent or down-To-Earth and conforming?

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.090
He first had close friends of those eighty college students fill out the questionnaire

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:55.709
then he had another group of total strangers who had never met the eighty college students go into their dorm rooms and

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.159
Along with the clipboard and 15 minutes to look around told them to fill out a very similar questionnaire

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:09.899
The close friends of the college students calculated their friends extraversion and agreeableness way more accurately than the strangers

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:17.939
which makes sense because you have to personally know somebody in order to make a better judgment of his or her personality but

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:24.989
Surprisingly the strangers did a far better job than the students friends at predicting conscientiousness,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.829
emotional stability and Openness to new experiences

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:36.659
This demonstrates that it is possible for people who have only known you for a short time to learn a lot about you

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.359
Just and also by looking around your bedroom

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:46.799
Little details like having a bottle of sleeping pills on your desk which suggests that you have trouble with falling asleep

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.459
Or leaving clothes and unfinished food all around your floor

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.158
Which hints that you don't have time to stay organized can say a lot about your passions, desires,

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.459
work and psychological state of mind

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.239
Now look around your room and try to take note of any objects that can potentially reveal parts of who you are
