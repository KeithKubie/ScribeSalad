00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.961
Most moviegoers will just sit back and enjoy
a film’s story as presented, but there are

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:13.280
others who may think something else is afoot.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.770
After a few repeat viewings, the more curious
audience members will start to piece some

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.220
evidence together and create their own interpretation
of what’s going on.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.980
And honestly, they may be on to something.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.590
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 movie theories
that will blow your mind.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.270
Star Wars
Even the most devout Star Wars fan has to

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.110
mock the ability of the Imperial stormtroopers,
as they frequently miss their targets despite

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.370
being trained soldiers.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.650
But what if it was all on purpose?

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.010
A theory suggests Darth Vader instructed his
troops to miss the main heroes because he

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.300
had bigger ideas for them.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.010
Consider that the Empire learns the location
of the Rebel base after the Millennium Falcon

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.239
escapes the Death Star, which wouldn’t have
happened if they were all killed.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.989
When the stormtroopers are shown to be efficient
killers in the opening scene, it starts to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.329
make sense.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.790
Pulp Fiction
Ever since its debut in 1994, fans have been

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.770
trying to figure out what’s in the briefcase
Jules and Vincent pick up.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.620
The only hint is a glowing aura of gold, but
some think they know what’s in it.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.780
Could it be Marsellus Wallace’s soul?

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.460
When Wallace first appears, he has a band-aid
on the back of his head.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.990
It’s a religious belief that when the Devil
takes your soul, he does so through the back

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.990
of your head.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.470
Not only that, the combination to unlock the
briefcase is 666, which is the number of pure

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.470
evil.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.990
It’s a sound theory and gives a classic
film a spiritual layer.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.630
The Rock
Did Michael Bay make a secret James Bond film

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.890
when he directed The Rock?

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.170
Some believe Sean Connery’s John Mason is
an aging Bond.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.310
In The Rock, Mason has been in prison for
33 years, lining up with the peak of Connery’s

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.310
Bond tenure.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.490
Also, it’s noted that “Mason” has no
identity and doesn’t exist – correlating

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.920
with the classic “James Bond is a code name”
theory.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.890
The script plays into it further, revealing
Mason was trained by British Intelligence

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.280
and is a lethal killer.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.950
Mason even parodies Connery’s one-liner
from Diamonds Are Forever.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.890
It may be wishful thinking, but it’s too
good to not be true, right?

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.060
The Avengers
Earth’s Mightiest Heroes seemed to take

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.560
care of an Asgardian god a little too easily,
but what if Loki was in on the whole thing?

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.420
One theory says that he lost to the team on
purpose so he would be taken back to Asgard

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.120
by Thor when it was all over.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.170
He then could launch a diabolical plan to
claim the throne of Asgard, and he’s coincidentally

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.970
sitting there at the end of Thor: The Dark
World.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.660
As the god of mischief, Loki is one of the
most cunning and intelligent Marvel characters.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.200
This paints him in a better light and makes
him an even more devious villain.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.890
Aladdin
Everyone loves the Genie, but some are confused

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.910
by his ability to imitate modern celebrities
– since the film takes place in the past.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.580
But what if it’s set in a post-apocalyptic
future?

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.780
A slip of the Genie’s tongue may have given
it all away.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.500
At one point, he remarks that Aladdin’s
outfit is “too third century”.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:53.380
But when he first appears, he notes that he’s
been trapped in his lamp for 10,000 years.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.410
That would make the year 10,300 at the earliest,
perhaps even later to explain Genie’s knowledge

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.210
of 20th century pop culture.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.900
How else could he know about third century
fashion?

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.010
Reservoir Dogs
By now, most movie fans know Tarantino’s

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.240
films are connected in various ways, but some
ties could be larger than others.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.620
Some speculate that the events of Reservoir
Dogs and Pulp Fiction’s Jules and Vincent

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.760
story take place on the same day.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.680
This would explain why Jules and Vincent are
able to fire guns in an apartment building

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.220
and drive a blood-soaked car in broad daylight
without any police interference.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.110
LA’s finest are working hard at stopping
the jewel thieves of Reservoir Dogs, so they

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.400
don’t have time to handle another disturbance.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.230
It is crazy Jules and Vincent get away cleanly,
so maybe there’s something to this.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.459
The Dark Knight Trilogy
Christopher Nolan’s Batman series emphasizes

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.220
the close relationship between Bruce Wayne
and his butler Alfred, but what if they were

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.350
something more?

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.790
One theory proposes that Alfred is actually
Bruce’s biological father.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.459
The evidence is somewhat slim, but a closer
examination of their interactions holds some

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.459
clues.

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.780
Alfred seems to be very emotionally attached
to Bruce to be just an ordinary butler.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.980
He seems to be looking after someone who’s
his own flesh and blood, but that could be

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.780
an effect of being Bruce’s surrogate parent.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.970
It’d throw the origin for a loop if true,
but Nolan’s been known to bend minds before.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.180
We’ll leave this one up to you.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.209
Toy Story 3
Sid, the villain from the first movie, comes

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.650
back for the third instalment, making a cameo
as a garbage man.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.560
That seems like an odd profession for someone
who was so adept at building things, but there’s

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.310
a solid reason behind the choice.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.039
One hypothesis is that Sid became a garbage
man so he could save toys that have been thrown

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.039
out by other owners.

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.160
He is presumably the only human in the universe
to see toys come to life and knows they’re

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.870
more than just pieces of plastic.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.880
In an effort to make up for his past crimes,
he becomes a guardian of the toys and protects

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.880
them from the dump.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.920
Titanic
Audiences fell for the love between Jack and

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.480
Rose, but what if Jack never existed?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.620
Some suggest Jack was just a figment of Rose’s
imagination as she fought a bout with depression.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.160
Jack represents her fantasy of the ideal man
while she deals with an abusive fiancé and

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.350
helps her work up the courage to stand up
to him.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.820
The film notes that there are no records of
Jack, and Rose says he exists only in her

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.820
memories.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.710
That seems odd, even for a member of the lower
class.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.150
Could Titanic just be a romantic version of
Fight Club?

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.850
We’d like to think so.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.850
Ghostbusters

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.510
Even though Egon says that the Ghostbusters
shouldn’t cross the streams, they do just

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.650
that to stop the bad guys and save the day.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.190
But things may not have been as happy as they
seemed.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.960
Theorists have suggested the group died after
crossing the streams, and the celebration

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.990
that follows is an elaborate fantasy.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.350
As for the sequel, the theory suggests the
Ghostbusters are in purgatory.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.180
The second film repeats the events of the
first, though slightly skewed, and nobody

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.210
appears to recall what happened before – even
though a giant marshmallow attacked New York.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.670
There’s something strange in this neighborhood.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.160
Those are our picks for movie theories that
will blow your mind.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.230
Are there any we missed?

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.590
