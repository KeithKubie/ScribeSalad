In today's video

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:09.240
We are working with Patrick Adair Designs to make some amazing ring stock using melted bullet shells real meteorite and titanium

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.700
Hey guys today we are here with Patrick from Patrick Adair designs Patrick. What does your company do so I'm a ring maker?

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.800
I love making rings and I have a YouTube channel where I show you guys how I make them so I just make a bunch

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.100
of them do a bunch of different designs

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.860
and one of my favorite materials to work with is meteorite And you can see I have a  big slab of it here

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.140
It's just really cool because it has a lot of interesting patterns to it

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.830
But I get a lot of scrap that there's nothing really to do with it

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.169
So you can see we've got these shavings here as well as just those remnants there. So this is meteorite

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.680
Yes, and this is meteorite. Yeah, like meteorite that fell out of the sky and crashed into the earth. Yeah, that is super cool

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.149
Yeah these crash up in the Arctic Circle and they go out with metal detectors

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.448
And they have to find them send them over to the u.s

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.999
Cut them up with a bandsaw and this slab will get sent to me make ring blanks and then make rings from them

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.309
And what's this here? Is this so, this is titanium

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.399
So we've got titanium as well. I also thought it would be a cool idea to work with. very neat. Here's what we're going to try

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.559
We're going to take the meteorite shavings and the brass we got from melting down the bullets and we're going to cast them together

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.060
Later, we'll try to machine the ingot into a ring. We've got a bunch of these bullet casings

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.899
That's our source of brass. We need to melt those down in the furnace. So let's do that

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.928
and then while things are melting we can make a couple of

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.500
molds that we can put our meteorite pieces down into and then after that's in there pour the molten brass on top of it should

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.839
That work you think yeah, let's give it a shot

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700
Oh that's like an oven in there

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.749
Alright we've got our brass shells in the cup we're gonna melt those down once that's melted down

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.759
We should be able to pour it into the meteorite. I think well that's melting we should get our molds ready

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.540
Meteorite shavings so that everything just ready to go as soon as that's nice and liquid. awesome

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.180
I had a couple different ideas of how we can try casting this and I admit that I have not done this a lot before

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.280
But you brought us these nice aluminum tubes

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.289
Which hopefully should give us a nice clean

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:35.108
Cast but aluminum has a lower melting point than brass and I don't want to melt the tube as we pour it in

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.780
So we've also got some sand and here's my thought we can tape the tube

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.540
Press it down somewhat into the sand and then build a bunch of sand up around the sides that

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.300
might act as a heat sink so that we can cast directly into the tube and not have it melts or

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.000
Deform too badly and then we should get a nice cylinder of our poor perfect

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.399
Yeah, and then I also have some of this silica firebrick and this is extremely heat resistant and somewhat porous

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.589
So I was thinking we might be able to drill a hole down into the fire rig and cast directly in it

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.149
Then once the casting cools down we can just break the fire break apart and reveal the casting inside

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.429
How do those sounds sounds great let's try it. Now. This is an experiment. We're hoping it will work

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.668
I don't know for sure a lot of this is an experiment

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:23.709
Have you ever tried embedding meteorite shavings in a metal before? I certainly have not so this all right

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.848
is gonna get crazy? How big of a casting do you think we should do in each of these?

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:28.299
well

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:28.760
I think

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.269
what we should do because it's nice because I have a lathe and what that does it crabs onto material then I spin it and

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.319
I'm able to cut some ring shape into it. So I need a little bit of excess space for that

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.638
so I think that the plan should be this will put about an inch or two of

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.399
meteorite shavings down in the bottom of each of them and

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.379
Then we'll fill it up with brass and we'll go a little bit past that and that excess material

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.869
That'll be for me to grab on to you'll end up with about a 3 maybe 4 inch long rod at the end

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.179
Okay
So this tube probably about the right size and then this one we could either cut short or we can just press it down farther

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.269
Into the sand either works. I guess let's figure out how many castings

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.770
I think our brass is ready to be poured. So at this point, what do you think?

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.159
Should we start taking our shavings and putting them into our two little tubes here?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.200
Yeah, let's try sprinkling some of these in wonderful. We probably don't want too much of it

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.849
But we want enough that it will definitely be visible inside the ring. Yeah, that's the goal

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.329
Oh boy, there we go. All right here goes

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.949
Well, we definitely got it poured down in there now

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.848
We just kind of have to wait for it to cool down so we can see how well it did

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.759
Yeah, hopefully it got in with all those little meteorite pieces

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.468
We still have some brass that's molten, but we don't have enough for a whole second core

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.469
So let's just melt a little bit more.

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:28.679
Uh oh

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:33.229
So some meteorite definitely did get stuck in the brass

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:40.158
This magnet is very attracted to all the meteorites since it's made of iron and nickel but it can't pull it out

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:44.359
So we got a little bit of it. The question is how much let this cool off

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.678
So some things there worked well and some things did not

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:54.139
We didn't get the brass to float through the meteorite shavings and I think that's because they were too dense

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.848
So for this time around we're gonna try it with some titanium. We'll also try it again with some meteorite

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:01.069
We'll do a couple different techniques to try to do that

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.549
But for this titanium one, we're just gonna try to put them in there pretty loosely

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.669
So we'll just have a lot less density of the shavings themselves

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.240
I'm also very interested about the fact that our brass looks a lot more like copper at this point .wonder if it's

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:14.039
uh

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.150
Copper colored all the way through. we can sand away

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.449
True we should maybe grab a file

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.410
And start wearing this down, see if we've got some nice meteorite in there

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.410
We might still be able to get a ring out of this yeah

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.320
Well, I think we've got good brass I'm just not so sure about the meteorite

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.119
Maybe we can try like pouring some brass and then putting some more shavings on top

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.359
So yeah, yeah kind of layering it maybe that'll work

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.180
The brass is poured into our titaniun

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:04.930
Oh boy that I like how that slides out kind of think it shrinks when it cools that that's probably it. Ooh

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:12.639
It looks like we got our brass all the way down to the bottom on this one. It's not

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.270
a super

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.079
Smoothbore since we did for it in the three layers. You can definitely see those layers

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:26.679
But the titanium is definitely in there. Yeah. Hopefully we can cut away through that

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.049
It's just really not even very warm anymore. So

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.750
Yeah, I bet you can get some good stuff now, we don't really have the equipment here

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:40.539
To show what's on the inside of this but you have the equipment you can cut this open and see what it looks like

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:42.470
Right. Yes, we'll be taking a look at that

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.970
Crease here

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.479
Very cool. Well, let's try a couple more

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:49.779
I think this method worked better than just pouring it down on top of the meteorite shavings

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.970
so let's try the same thing with the

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.079
Meteorite in and then a little bit of brass and more meteorite and more brass in that area

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.020
See if we can get this same result. Yeah with the meteorite

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.070
I think we might want to try a combo even two titanium and meteorite

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.089
That might make for a Nice combination. Alright, let's try this

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:13.689
So let's get a little bits of titanium and meteorite shavings all ready to go and try this same method again. Alright

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.210
the titanium

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:24.009
Really holds itself together and makes much longer strands than the meteorite. It seems yeah, the meteorite kind of fragments. It's a lot more fragile

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:34.420
almost like metal prepared by outer space isn't quite as refined as metal prepared by people on earth interesting is that a diss on aliens

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.700
Suckers aliens got nothing on earth

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.479
Now we also have the other mold carved into our brick what do we want to do in that one?

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.879
Let's do make this one a kind of a combo. Okay

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.229
That go let go okay, you can just come out too

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.479
Perfect, thank you. You ready? Yep

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.479
here goes pour

00:09:01.979 --> 00:09:03.400
this layer done

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.789
And that's that's cooled down

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.329
Whoo. Well, that's quite a bit more brass in those ones than we had before

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:25.489
Yeah, I think these will make some good castings Oh interesting the water seeps into the firebrick

00:09:25.769 --> 00:09:29.508
You can see steam is actually just coming right out the side of the brick now

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.980
There it is

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.210
look at that the layers like really bonded in this one, yeah

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.700
All right. This one's maybe not quite as clean, but I still think we got some

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:01.520
Metal jam and you can see there's the big piece of meteorite right there sort of sticking out on the side

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.470
Okay, and you know, you're the one who's got the tools who's gonna be able to figure out if this will work?

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:12.290
Yeah, we'll have to see I have no idea Patrick. We got some interesting results. How do you feel about this?

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:16.849
I mean, I think we're gonna be able to make this do it was quite a bit of a challenge

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:22.729
We had a lot of problems with the materials not sticking together the layers being difficult

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.359
But I think in the end, I think we'll be able to get a ring out of these

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:26.860
All right

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.080
So this was our first one we tried just pouring all the brass down on top of the meteorite

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:36.520
Shavings and it wasn't really able to get past the meteorite shavings. those ended up just sitting on the bottom of it with no

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:43.249
Brass around them. We then tried moving on to using titanium and for this instead of just pouring it down on top

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:50.540
We had loosely sprinkled titanium. We poured some brass on sprinkled some more titanium more brass more titanium final layer of brass

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.049
So for this one, I think we got some good layers of titanium sandwiched into the brass

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:59.930
It looks like it's quite well bonded together. So this one will probably, will work out pretty well. Yeah, I think so

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.260
Once we just get past those rough edges. We've got on the outside

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.929
This is the one that was inside our fire brick

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:12.229
We had some big old chunks of meteorite in there as well as lots of shavings. There are a few different layers of pores

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:18.500
So I bet there's some good embedding going on here. And then this last one here this tall one. This one looks pretty good

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:25.340
I think we've got four layers of brass and we had meteorite shavings with titanium shavings mixed together all through

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.549
What's it gonna take to find out what's inside these things?

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:34.160
so I think what we're gonna want to do is just grind into them a little bit see what we've got going make sure that

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.000
We don't have any separation of the layers

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.470
We do on the edges of course, but I think once we grind into it a little bit

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.400
We should be able to see where it fuses together and once we get it

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.329
kind of shaved down and know what we're

00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:50.128
working with that's when I'll put it in my lathe will just be able to work with it and trim it away and now we're

00:11:50.129 --> 00:11:53.519
Left with the ring shape so it could be really interesting to see how this goes

00:11:53.699 --> 00:11:56.579
Where is gonna be the best place to see the process of making?

00:11:56.649 --> 00:12:01.768
these so I'm actually going to be making a ring from these and then be posting that to my youtube channel and that's what my

00:12:01.769 --> 00:12:05.789
Channel is I just make a bunch of differing set of a bunch of cool different exotic materials

00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:10.469
So I think this is gonna be a really interesting one this ring here. What is this one? This is pretty cool

00:12:10.569 --> 00:12:16.709
so this is actually a limited edition king of random ring that we're going to do it is carbon fiber and it's infused with

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:19.558
Titanium so it's a really interesting material that's on the outside

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:24.868
And then the resin on the inside that is a glow resin and it's just in that king of random yellow

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:25.920
This is a prototype

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.559
That's just a little bit more green, but both the interior plastic and the color that it glows in the dark will be yellow

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:35.189
