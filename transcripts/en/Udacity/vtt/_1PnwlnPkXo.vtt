It is always wonderful to welcome
a Georgia Tech alum back to our campus.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.830
Today, we are delighted
to have one of our own.

Colonel Greg Conti.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.410
An academy professor for computer
science at the U.S. Military Academy.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.030
Where he also directs
the Army Cyber Institute.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.030
Greg is a graduate of the U.S. Military
Academy, but we like to remember

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.160
him as person who got his PhD here
at Georgia Tech in cyber security.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.810
