This episode is supported by Prudential.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.309
Let’s say you’re waiting for a friend
of yours to arrive on a train.

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.690
And, I should point out, it’s a very-much-hypothetical
train.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.730
For one thing, it’s moving toward you in
a vacuum.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.980
And somehow, it can travel at half the speed
of light.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.060
But your friend, Bob, is on this amazing hypothetical
train!

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.300
Oh, and the front of the train has
a headlight.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.160
From Bob’s perspective standing on the train,
the light from the headlight is moving away
from him at the speed of light.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.860
So the train is moving at half the speed of light,
but at the same time, it’s shooting out light from its
headlight that’s moving at the speed of light.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.840
You’d think that from your perspective on the platform,
it would look like the light coming from the headlight
was moving at one and a half times the speed of light.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.880
Because it would have its own speed, plus
the speed of the train.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.060
But that’s not true.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.740
Because light always has to move at the same
speed through a vacuum, from any perspective.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.320
So, from your point of view on the platform,
that light wouldn’t look like it’s going faster
than the speed of light.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.340
It would just look like it’s moving at exactly
the speed of light.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.860
As counterintuitive and strange as that sounds.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.040
Special relativity explains why.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:14.320
[Theme Music]

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.660
The theory of special relativity was proposed
by Albert Einstein in 1905.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:27.660
It explains the behavior of things that move very, very fast – as in, a significant fraction of the speed of light – where regular Newtonian physics doesn’t always apply.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.040
It’s called special relativity because it only
applies to specific situations: where the different
frames of reference aren’t accelerating.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.460
They’re called inertial reference frames.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.320
In our train example, the two reference frames are
the perspective of someone standing on the train,
and someone standing on the platform.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.360
Neither reference frame is accelerating, so
they’re inertial, and so special relativity applies.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.220
Now, special relativity is built around two
main assumptions, or postulates.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.580
The first says that the laws of physics are
the same in all inertial reference frames.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.200
It doesn’t matter whether you’re on the train or on
the platform – the same equations will apply.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.120
This has to be true, because there’s no
real way to distinguish between reference frames.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.620
For all Bob knows – from his perspective on the train
as it passes the platform – he’s sitting perfectly still,
while the platform zooms past him.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.000
Or the platform could be staying put while
he moves past it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.730
The first postulate tells us that it doesn’t
matter.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.220
The physics will play out in the same way,
no matter what.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.840
The second postulate says that the speed of
light in a vacuum is the same for all observers
– about 300,000,000 meters per second.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.720
Always.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.400
Whether or not the light source is moving.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.280
Physicists have tested this fact with lots
of experiments.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.380
It's definitely true, all the time.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.060
So even if light is coming from a train that’s
moving at half the speed of light the light

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.640
itself is still moving at about three hundred
million meters per second.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.630
And this is where things start to get weird.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.130
You already know that speed multiplied by
time equals distance.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.900
But special relativity tells us that when
it comes to light, speed is always constant.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.600
Which would mean that the other two variables
would have to change – time and distance.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.580
And they do.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.960
When time changes, that’s called time dilation,
and when distance changes, that’s called
length contraction.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:10.660
Time dilation occurs when another reference
frame is moving relative to you, so time in that reference
frame slows down relative to the time you measure.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.860
You can see why if we go back to Bob’s train.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.060
Say Bob stands on the side of his train car
that’s closer to the platform, and he’s facing a mirror
on the opposite side of the car, 5 meters away.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.940
He shines a flashlight toward this mirror,
which reflects the light right back towards him.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.210
From Bob’s point of view on the train, the
situation is very simple.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.700
The light traveled straight to the mirror and back,
a distance of 10 meters, at the speed of light.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.380
Sure, looking through the window,
you saw the light travel to the mirror and back,
but meanwhile, the train was still moving.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.340
While the light traveled toward the mirror, the mirror
moved sideways relative to your spot on the platform.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.500
And while the light traveled back toward Bob,
Bob moved even farther sideways.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.580
The result is that you saw the light travel
diagonally, as though its path formed two
sides of a triangle.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.240
From your point of view, the light traveled a greater
distance than it did from Bob’s point of view.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.700
But! Special relativity tells us that the light’s
speed was still exactly c.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.420
Even though it traveled a greater distance.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.580
And if the light traveled a greater distance at the same
speed then it must have been traveling for longer.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.720
You and Bob are both timing the exact same
series of events.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.210
But you’re measuring a longer time than
Bob is.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.180
So, from your perspective on the platform,
time has slowed down for Bob.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.620
That’s time dilation.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.240
If you measured the distance the light was
traveling from your perspective on the platform,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:31.560
you’d calculate that time slowed down for Bob by a factor of 1 divided by the square root of 1 minus the train’s velocity squared divided by the speed of light squared.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.300
We call this factor gamma, and it applies
to any situation where another inertial reference
frame is moving relative to yours.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.740
Time in that moving reference frame will seem
to equal time in your reference frame, multiplied by gamma.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.740
Gamma always has to be greater than 1, because the
velocity of the moving reference frame always has to be
less than c, the speed of light.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.520
So time is slower in that moving reference
frame.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.000
Because time can pass differently for people
depending on their frame of reference, there’s
also no universal concept of simultaneity.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.880
In other words, something that seems simultaneous
to you might not be simultaneous to Bob.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.960
Say you see a flash of lightning at each
end of Bob’s train, at the exact same time
as he passes you on the platform.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.779
I mean, we’re already talking about a train
going half the speed of light.

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.530
So let’s say it gets struck by lightning
too!

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.560
For some reason!

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.920
You see both flashes at the same time,
and they’re both the same distance from you,
traveling at the same speed.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.140
So you can conclude that lightning struck
both ends of his train at the same time.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.960
But from Bob’s perspective on the train,
that’s not what happened.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.200
Because while the light is traveling from
each end of the train to his eyes, he’s moving.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.140
At the moment that you see both flashes, Bob
has already moved past you.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.640
So he’s seen the flash from the front of
the train – but only that one.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.370
Then he sees the flash from the lightning
that struck the back of the train.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.740
Light always moves at the speed of light,
though, no matter what your reference frame is.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.700
That’s the rule.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.220
So, to Bob, the lightning must have struck the front
of the train before it struck the back of the train.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.219
Even though they seemed simultaneous to you.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.260
Does your brain hurt yet?

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.740
As if time slowing down wasn’t weird enough,
there’s also length contraction.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:03.780
Length contraction means that if something is moving
relative to you, its length in the direction that it’s moving
will seem shorter than it would if it wasn’t moving.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.740
So you might have measured the train to be
100 meters long before it left the station.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.360
If Bob measures the train from where he’s
standing, it will be 100 meters long.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.460
But from your perspective on the platform
as it moves past you, the train will be shorter.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.420
Let’s say you want to measure the train
as it moves past the spot where you’re standing
on the platform.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.240
The train is moving at half the speed of light.
That’s set.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.080
From Bob’s perspective, it takes about 6.66
x 10^-7 for the train to pass you.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.480
Velocity multiplied by time equals distance,
so Bob calculates that the train must be
100 meters long.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.480
Now you try taking the same measurement.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.860
Problem is, we already know that time moves
faster for you than for Bob.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:44.300
While 666 nanoseconds pass for Bob, only 577
nanoseconds pass for you.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:51.820
And if the train takes 577 nanoseconds to pass
you while it’s moving at half the speed of light,
it must be 86.6 meters long!

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:59.820
In general, when something’s moving past you, its length in the direction of its motion will be equal to the length you’d measure if it was standing still, divided by gamma.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.400
Length contraction happens for objects moving
at regular speeds, too!

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.120
But it’s so tiny that there’s no way you’d
ever notice it.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:14.260
If the train was moving at 150 kilometers per
hour, it would contract by less than a picometer –
that’s 100th of the length of a hydrogen atom.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.660
Since length contraction isn’t something
we see in everyday life, it isn’t part of our
intuitive sense of physics.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:27.180
So special relativity tells us that because light
always travels at the same speed, time dilates
and length contracts to compensate.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.800
Space and time – they’re directly connected
to each other.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.260
That’s what people mean when they talk about
four-dimensional spacetime.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:39.060
If you’re describing something physically,
it’s not enough just to talk about its position
in three-dimensional space.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.840
You also need to take time into account.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.640
A lot of this might seem counterintuitive,
but that’s because we’re used to seeing the world
at much, much slower speeds than light.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:52.640
All of which is to say that when you start
to analyze things that are moving fast, the
universe becomes a very strange place.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.580
Today, you learned about special relativity.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:01.720
We went over its two postulates, and their
consequences: time dilation, a lack of universal
simultaneity, and length contraction.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.180
We also talked about four-dimensional spacetime.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.520
Thanks to Prudential for sponsoring this episode.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.320
It’s human nature to prioritize present
needs and what matters most to us, today.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.960
But, when planning for your retirement, it’s
best to prioritize tomorrow.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.039
According to a Prudential study 1 in 3 Americans
are not saving enough for retirement and,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.920
over 52% are not on track to be able to maintain
their current standard of living.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:28.180
Go to Raceforretirement.com and see how,
if you start saving more today, you can continue
to enjoy the things you love tomorrow.
