00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.440
- [Voiceover] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.593
for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.870
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.560
- Welcome to a conversation
with history, I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.890
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.510
Our guest today is John Witte,
who is the Jonas Robitscher

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.860
professor of law, the Alonzo
L. McDonald distinguished

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.037
professor and director of the
Center for the Study of Law

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:59.037
and Religion at Emory Law
School at Emory University.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.660
He is the 2011 Jefferson
lecturer on the Berkeley campus.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.640
John, welcome to our program.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.360
- Thank you very much,
it's good to be here.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.500
- Where did you go to college
and what was your major in?

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.240
- I followed the natural path
for a Dutch immigrant boy

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.220
which was to go to Calvin College
in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.290
It was the college of the
Christian Reformed Church,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.070
of which I was member.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.360
I was there, my world opened
up rapidly when I got there.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.160
That was a big city, that was
a big intellectual environment

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.690
and I studied biology,
history, and philosophy.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.010
I simply couldn't settle on
one, and so I was a pre-med,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.200
a pre-law, and a
pre-graduate school student.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.670
And it was a small enough
college where you could

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.270
do all three without
being too much of a fool.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.930
- And what helped you sort that out?

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.600
A lot of different paths
that you could've taken.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.620
- I was inspired by teachers
in all three of those fields,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.160
and I ultimately did the MCAT,
the LSAT and the GRE, and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.460
applied for law school, medical
school and graduate school.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.450
Got into all three, and
then couldn't decide.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.283
And what ultimately helped
me decide was I wrote to

00:02:04.283 --> 00:02:06.630
this wonderful professor
at Harvard Law School

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.340
called Harold J. Berman,
whose work I had read

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.850
a great deal in my undergraduate days.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.870
He had been writing on
issues of Soviet law,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.260
but also law and religion
in Western history.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.060
And I found his work deeply
satisfying intellectually.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.350
And I just took, as a 21 year
old punk out of Calvin College

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.140
the whim of writing him and
asking him for his advice.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.550
And he gave me a long two
page letter back, and the core

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.310
of his advice was come study
with me, and we can work

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.370
together on issues of law and
religion in Western history.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.440
That was the key for me, and
I went to sit at his feet.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.280
- And so it was Harvard
Law School, and there,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.280
was there a kind of a focus
that immediately attracted you,

00:02:48.344 --> 00:02:51.130
this kind of, obviously you ended up with

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.680
law and religion as a very great interest.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.780
- Yeah, I spent, all law
students have their fist year

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.020
prescribed, and during that
first year of law school courses

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.790
I spent 40 hours at work
working with Berman.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.360
It was a little grueling,
but it was a wonderful

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.510
opportunity to be released
into the treasure room

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.190
of the Harvard Law Library
and read all these fabulous

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.340
tracts of the 14th
through the 18th century

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.810
focusing on different aspects of

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.310
law and religion in Western history.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.440
Throughout my second and third
year, I continued to work

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.330
with Berman, I took elective
courses in the grad school,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.940
the divinity school as
well as the law school.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.620
You don't specialize in law
school, but I tended to focus on

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.650
courses that looked at
issues of legal history,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.170
legal philosophy,
interdisciplinary approaches to law

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.810
which were just beginning to
bubble at Harvard Law School

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.660
at the time, with critical
legal studies especially.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.700
And I had a chance to
just smell the flowers

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.410
in a number of different
fields, and convince myself that

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.540
the stuff I was doing a-vocationally
as a research assistant

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.500
with Berman was really front and center

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.631
of what I wanted to do professionally.

00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:59.631
- And the important new path here is

00:03:59.922 --> 00:04:02.747
really history, and
the history of the law.

00:04:02.747 --> 00:04:04.370
Not just being a lawyer.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.510
- Not just being a lawyer,
I couldn't see myself

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.570
as being a conventional
lawyer and practicing in

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.950
public or private or public interest work.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.870
I would do that if it was
necessary for five or 10 years

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.718
to cultivate a traditional
specialty and then hold that out

00:04:16.718 --> 00:04:18.930
alongside my passionate interest in

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.315
law and religion and legal history.

00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:24.920
But I really didn't see myself
actually practicing law.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.130
What I wanted to do was
to be a legal scholar.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.530
And one of the things
that Professor Berman

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.620
pushed me to do was to
write, and to write early.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.590
He co-authored a couple
of articles with me

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.240
while I was a law student, and
then really turned me loose

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.970
and pushed me hard to
get into writing myself.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.490
And so I followed none of
the conventional routes.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.460
I didn't do law review,
I didn't do moot court,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.060
I didn't do federal
clerkships, I just worked with

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.640
Berman 40 hours a week,
and I wrote up a storm

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.990
while I was a law student,
and that got me started

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.010
rather quickly as a law professor.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.310
- And as you talk about your background,

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.182
there seems to be an
interesting dynamic between

00:05:00.182 --> 00:05:02.990
what you're calling a
provincial background,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.140
within kind of a closed
community, but really

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.140
opening up to a cosmopolitan
world, and then focusing on

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.750
this interface between
the law and religion,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.010
which is key to that interface.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.400
- Yeah, it was really
interesting to move from this

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.100
tiny cultural cocoon in
St. Catharines, Ontario,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.760
to what I considered to be
the big city of Calvin College

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.040
in Grand Rapids, Michigan,
and then to go from there

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.510
to Harvard Law School,
where in many ways you had

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.700
a platform to look at the world.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.910
And to have the chance to
interact with fellow students

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.750
from all different walks
of life and all different

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.087
parts of the world, to be
able to interact with ideas

00:05:42.087 --> 00:05:45.000
in the Western tradition but
also well beyond the Western

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.140
tradition, to have a chance
to look both historically and

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.090
along very very wide public
policy grids at some of the

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.600
fundamental questions of
faith, of freedom, of family,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.060
and other things that captivated me.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.770
Convinced me that binocular
of law and religion that

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.350
Berman was giving me the
opportunity to look through,

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.390
and to think about how these
two great universal solvents

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.700
of human living have worked
historically, how they work

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.820
today, how in many ways they
provide the biggest challenges

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.230
for us historically and today,
that was a captivating way

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.413
to think about the world anew.

00:06:17.413 --> 00:06:20.470
And it was an unpopular way
of thinking about the world

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.499
in the 1980s when I was a law
student, people didn't really

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:27.497
think about religion as a
category of legal study.

00:06:27.497 --> 00:06:30.010
Most people still were working
under the Enlightenment

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.590
assumption that religion was superstition,

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.640
it was the opiate of the masses,
it was something that would

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.640
happily die a quiet death
as scientific rationalism

00:06:42.243 --> 00:06:46.668
took over, and technology
would replace the priesthood

00:06:46.668 --> 00:06:49.490
as the leaders of our society and culture.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.950
And at the time, making an
argument to say that religion

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.770
actually is an important
source of Western law,

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.250
that religious dimensions of
law are actually important

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.920
to take into account, that
religious legal systems are

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.590
really part of our cultural
identity and civilization

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.050
and we have to take them
seriously, that at the time was

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.469
controversial, but I felt
in part by reason of my own

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:13.070
upbringing in a conservative
Christian community and in part

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.340
by looking by analogy into
Jewish and Muslim communities,

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.560
could see this was something
that we needed to do.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.090
And I thought Berman was
remarkably prescient and courageous

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.120
at the time, to be pressing this as

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.340
a fundamental part of legal education,

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.100
and happily we were
vindicated in that over time.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.270
- So you were coming...

00:07:33.115 --> 00:07:35.840
To your education just at a time

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.100
when there was intellectual ferment.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.800
Let's talk a little about that,
because the reigning notion

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.533
had been, well, law is an
isolated set of studies,

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.650
and that it's really, you quote Holmes

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.670
in one of your articles,
it's really from experience

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.194
that we get the law, it's
not from a natural law

00:08:00.194 --> 00:08:03.390
or from any other sectors of society.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.680
- Yeah, legal education
from the 1920s to the 1970s,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.220
in North America at least,
was intensely positivistic

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.640
in the sense of law is
really its own science,

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.350
it's an autonomous science.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.890
What we're looking for is the
instruments, the techniques

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.470
of law, and how law emerges,
to what extent it's influenced

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.530
by or has influence on
other dimensions of life,

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.410
to what extent we wanna take into account

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.387
any other institutions besides the state

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:34.010
and the operation of law were all

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.670
considered to be taboo subjects.

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.660
In the late 1960s and 70s, there was

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.120
the rise of interdisciplinary legal study.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.580
Some of that on the back
of legal realism that had

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.320
challenged this notion of
autonomous legal reasoning,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.900
but a lot of it with the rise
of recognizing that holistic

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.200
understandings of knowledge
had to also apply to law.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.880
That law properly had to
be understood in concert,

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.620
in conversation with other
disciplines, and we were just

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.780
beginning to see interdisciplinary
legal study emerging.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.470
Law in economics was a first one,

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.400
law in politics a second,
law in literature a third.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.720
These were suddenly new
areas of interdisciplinary

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.690
discourse that were
beginning to be accepted into

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.200
legal education, and began to fracture

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.090
the traditional legal positivism paradigm.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.460
The law and religion movement
that Berman and others

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.190
were starting in the 1970s
built on the momentum of that

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.000
interdisciplinary legal
studies movement all together.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.510
- And what was going on
in society, in your mind,

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.130
that accounts for this change of thinking?

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:39.130
'Cause one always wonders,
what makes for intellectual

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.690
ferment, for new paradigms,
new ways of looking at things.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.580
- Yeah, it's the good
political scientist's question,

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.840
of course.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.300
I think one was simply the
exhaustion of the legal

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.860
positivist paradigm as just
methodologically impossible

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.220
to maintain, and the
recognition that these doctrines

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.320
don't just sit, they're
not just isolated icons,

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.800
they have to really be
thought about in context.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.410
Part of it was the Marxist critique of law

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.850
that began to challenge
some of the economic

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.900
and sociological assumptions
that were being made

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.890
in legislation and litigation.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.260
Some of it was a kinda new
approach of psychologists

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.530
and anthropologists who
began to look at law as

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:25.530
very much part of a cultural
and civilizational fabric.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.650
Part of it was feminist
critiques of law that began to

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.560
challenge a lot of the
patriarchal assumptions that were

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.820
explicit or latent in legal institutions.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.250
And I think part of it
was simply the new wholism

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.450
that was beginning to
emerge in epistemology.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.020
Where people were beginning to say, look,

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.228
in order to understand
life, in order to understand

00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:49.970
a big institution like law,
or religion, or the economy,

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:54.500
or things of comparable
heft, we really needed

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.850
to have a kaleidoscopic methodology.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.880
And I think all of those
converged together in higher legal

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.000
education to force people to
try to develop new paradigms.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.740
And interdisciplinary legal studies was

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.443
the beneficiary of that
in the 1970s and 80s.

00:11:10.443 --> 00:11:15.380
- What is the skillset involved

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.930
in the kind of work that you do?

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.670
Obviously a knowledge
of the law, but this,

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:26.510
you clearly come to the
profession at a time when

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.790
interdisciplinary skills are
very important, and it would

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:35.040
also seem that comparative
skills are very important.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.130
It's not just what's happening in

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.520
Christianity or Judaism, but also Islam.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.936
- Yeah.

00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:43.440
You have to remember,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.210
interdisciplinary legal
study is about legal study.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:49.470
And first an foremost what we're doing for

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.060
people coming through a
law and religion focus

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.940
is to prepare them to be lawyers.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.820
In any walk of life, in any
profession or any institutional

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.740
structure, they've gotta learn
the basic black letter rules

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.300
and tools of contracts and torts

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.270
and property and constitutional law.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.360
They have to learn the
basic methods and matters of

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.980
legal science, methods of
reasoning, methods of evidence

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.860
collecting, methods of building
and breaking down arguments.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.650
They have to understand
that they're part of

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.410
a long tradition, and understand what

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.200
precedent means and how to apply it.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.890
There's no substitute for
that in any interdisciplinary

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.550
legal approach; that betrays
those fundamentals of the

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.030
profession, really in many
ways betrays itself over time.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.670
So what we do is we add a
dimension to education that says

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.520
that religion has been an
important historical source

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.466
for many of our legal ideas,
for better or for worse,

00:12:37.466 --> 00:12:40.960
that religion is a dimension
of life that has to be taken

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.800
into account when you look
at how a legal institution

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.490
or system as a whole
operates, and that religious

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.080
communities themselves have legal systems.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.610
Halakhah within Judaism, Sharia
within Islam, canon law in

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.020
Ecclesiastical discipline
within Christianity,

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.840
and that these are massive
non-profit organizations,

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.360
global in their sweep, that
have internal mechanisms

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.080
of law that have to be understood.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.180
And that we have to understand
the relationship between them

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.040
and state law, we have to
understand the religious freedom

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.940
claims that those
individuals and groups make

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.830
on the strength of their
religious convictions

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.910
and religious institutional apparatus,

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.010
and we have to understand
how to broker the inevitable

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.230
tensions one has between
different religious communities'

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.680
understandings of law, or
their own particular religious

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.390
legal system, with each
other and with the state.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.120
And then I think finally, the
real question is trying to

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.750
sensitize people to the
reality that law and religion

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:46.030
is simply one example of
interdisciplinary legal study.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.330
And to do this right, like to
do legal education in general

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.700
right, you have to have very
strong peripheral vision.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.460
You have to understand law and economics,

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.190
you have to understand law and sociology,

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.060
law and politics, law and literature.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.982
The best lawyer who's
trained is always trained

00:14:01.982 --> 00:14:05.427
at least to have very very
powerful peripheral vision.

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:08.950
That even if he or she is
specialized in a given area of law

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.740
like law and religion, they
have to be sensitive to and

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.090
have enough peripheral
vision to understand

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.480
what's there on the
outside of your discipline.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.210
Law is a big universal
solvent of human living,

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.550
law is a huge science
that has to be mastered,

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.920
and even if you specialize,
you've gotta have

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.580
enough sense of when you don't know.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:31.231
- You refer at one point in
one of your essays to kind of a

00:14:31.231 --> 00:14:36.231
binocular vision when it
comes to understanding

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.430
the interface between law and religion.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.040
Talk about that, because
the trajectory in the past

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.430
was to focus on one or
to focus on the other.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.490
- Well part of it's it's
just a clever image to try to

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.670
get people to recognize
that when you're looking at,

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.330
especially an historical
phenomenon or a movement,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.980
say the 16th century
Protestant reformation.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.610
You can't just look at that
through theology or through

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.500
doctrine or through liturgy,
you can't just look at that

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.660
as the time of the reception of Roman law,

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.130
or the transformation of the Roman empire,

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:15.030
the Holy Roman Empire, or the
rise of the legal profession.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.890
In many ways what you want,
what you're interested in

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.650
is taking a binocular vision
of that movement, of that

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.660
period, and saying, how do
these two feed each other?

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.370
In many ways it's a
species of the question

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.830
you asked me a few minutes ago,

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.380
what caused the change
in the 1970s and 80s

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.150
toward interdisciplinary legal study.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.370
This is a spin on that question which is,

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.350
to what extent if you put
law and theology together,

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.580
if you look at this
through the lenses of both

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.660
the professional legal
historian and the professional

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.850
church historian, what do
you see in the 16th century

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.290
that's distinctive and how
do they feed each other?

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.650
It's that image that I acquired
initially as an historian

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:53.210
that I'm trying now to
train on modern questions,

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.523
questions of family, for
example, family being

00:15:55.523 --> 00:15:59.090
both a legal and a spiritual institution.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.660
Issues of education, which
in many case has both

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.130
religious and secular dimensions,

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.930
issues of charity and the like.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.750
So in many ways it's an attempt to say,

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.850
rather than simply
training one methodology,

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.780
one set of institutional
concerns, one set of professional

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:20.360
aspirations on a given topic
or theme, let's try to bring

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.190
the two together into an interesting

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.913
widening of the perspective
that's offered by that.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:31.090
- I'm curious in terms of
being a historian of a faith,

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.610
and if one actually believes in the faith,

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:38.663
what is that tension like,
because the law in history

00:16:38.663 --> 00:16:43.070
is finding the truth by
rigorous standards and

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.286
searching for objectivity,
but on the other hand,

00:16:46.286 --> 00:16:51.286
a person of faith is a believer,
but somehow I get the sense

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.070
from your work that this tension really is

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.660
helpful in probing what
happened in the religion,

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.199
and understanding the dynamic by which

00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:08.350
this is brought into the legal system.

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.363
- That's a big question and we
could be here a little while.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.050
First of all, objective historiography is

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.750
a wonderful thing to do in the classroom,

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.320
but it's not really
easy to do in practice.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.360
So people bring their
blinders, people bring their

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.610
prejudices and preferences,
and that's simply

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:26.740
part of the epistemology
of being an historian.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.760
Secondly I would say I'm not
an historian of a particular

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.380
Christian community or a
particular tradition of thought,

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.570
I'm really a historian of the West.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:40.570
I happen to study the two
millennia of the common era,

00:17:42.484 --> 00:17:45.570
sometimes dipping into
ancient Greek and Hebrew

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:50.380
and Roman texts, and
increasingly as I've gotten

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.880
a bit older, trying to
look beyond the West

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.270
for analogy for competing perspectives,

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.580
for different ways of
thinking about things.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.750
I'm interested in this
in part as a person of

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:07.750
religious faith who wants to
find a way of reconstructing

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.210
some of the wisdom of
my particular tradition

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.720
of Christianity, and making it applicable

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.670
to a modern, pluralistic world.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.150
Where there is no longer an
assumption of a Christian

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.160
magistrate, when there's
no longer an assumption of

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.010
an established religion, and
when there's intense pluralism

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.680
and people's argument from
faith or from a canon or from

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.190
a tradition simply the
start rather than the end

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.450
of a conversation, that
in many ways developing

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.620
the rational logic to make
this wisdom of the tradition

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.010
applicable and useful to
wider pluralistic society.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.810
So part of my exercise is that.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.318
Part of my exercise is
that of an historian,

00:18:45.318 --> 00:18:47.820
historian of law, excuse me, to say,

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.730
I'm interested in seeing
what precedent is useful

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.000
and what precedent needs to be discarded.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.350
Jaroslav Pelikan, the great
Yale church historian,

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:59.560
now alas a blessed
memory, has this notion of

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.910
tradition is the living faith of the dead,

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.510
traditionalism is the
dead faith of the living.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.330
And I like the idea of traditions

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.020
being something that grows.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.300
Understanding where we came from,

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.650
understanding where we're going,

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.010
and trying to find the
mechanisms, the methodologies,

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.380
the responsible ways of
moving the growing end

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.930
of tradition to accommodate new realities,

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.050
to purge injustices of the past.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.000
So both of those exercises are

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.150
going on simultaneously in my mind.

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.970
I don't pretend that I'm
objective, but what's interesting

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.070
to me personally as I walked
through this last 25 years

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.670
is that, and as a little boy
in St. Catharines, Ontario

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.200
with a very very small Christian cocoon,

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.020
of a Dutch Calvinist
variety in particular,

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.840
and having the privilege
to grow in humility

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.910
as you look across the
world and you look at

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.470
all these fabulous ideas
and institutions that are

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:50.860
out there and to see all these different

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.000
faith communities and how they operate.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.281
And it reminds me, and I'll
stop at this, it reminds me of

00:19:56.281 --> 00:19:59.515
this wonderful adage that
Martin Marty, the great

00:19:59.515 --> 00:20:02.010
church historian at University of Chicago

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.200
has playing with this movie theme.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.670
It takes a thief to catch a
thief, and his flip on that is

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.970
it takes a person of deep
religious conviction to

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.850
appreciate the deep religious
conviction of another.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.850
You'll learn by analogy, and
you appreciate, tolerate,

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.510
respect the rights, evidence,
support the existence

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.270
of the other, just because
by analogy you can see

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.100
what they're doing and
why they're doing it.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.390
That's kind of been what's
interesting for me as I've

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.650
kind of toured Judaism, Islam,
and dabbled a bit in other

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:33.393
faith traditions and their
influence upon law and culture.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.900
- One of the conclusions
that I think you've come to

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.650
as I read some of your essays
is really that there is

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:47.650
a lot of commonalities in
the law and in religion,

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.300
that these are two
domains that in some sense

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.240
mirror each other, there are a lot of

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.377
similarities that have evolved over time.

00:20:58.377 --> 00:21:01.053
- Yeah, I mean we share certain concepts.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.400
Covenant and contract,
justice and righteousness,

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.750
we share certain institutions,

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.150
take marriage, take
education, take charity.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.450
We share a number of methods,
how to parse the text,

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.778
how to build a tradition,
how to create a canon,

00:21:17.778 --> 00:21:22.610
how to reason responsibly
from text and tradition

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.913
to modern prescription or principle.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.960
We share a lot of
institutional structures.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.940
Religious communities are
organized as corporate entities

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.480
in many ways, and have government
structures that sometimes

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.960
are analogous to that which
prevails in the state.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.960
Historically sometimes these
overlap, they were the same,

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.000
today they're often differentiated.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.960
And so what I'm interested in is kinda

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.320
looking at that creative interplay,

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.970
and then taking again the binocular angle.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.460
In many ways when we're talking about

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.300
an agreement that we have together,

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.990
from a religious side it's a covenant,

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:59.610
from a legal side it's a contract,

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.497
and what's interesting is the
convergence between those two

00:22:02.497 --> 00:22:04.160
where the overlapping consensus and

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.620
the creative tension between those two.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:11.010
We talk about redemption
and rehabilitation

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.360
as ways of moving beyond
a point of conflict

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.010
and coming back into community.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.530
From a religious side, this
has some really interesting

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:22.180
liturgical and other
institutional and psychological

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.270
elements, on a legal side
there's a lot of methodology

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.510
in that, and institutional
responsibility that follows.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:32.547
So part of what I'm interested
in is to look at those

00:22:32.547 --> 00:22:36.350
binaries, especially where
there's creative tension.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:40.750
- I would be curious 'cause
you seem to be well-positioned

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:45.630
to give us some insights on
this, what does creativity

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.730
look like in the law, and
what does creativity look like

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.433
in religion itself, the
practice of religion?

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.100
Can they be compared at all?

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.283
- That's an interesting question.

00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:03.021
Well we're both working out of traditions.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.420
We both presuppose
precedent and we all make,

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:13.420
we both make changes only when we overcome

00:23:15.858 --> 00:23:18.640
the presumption of the null hypothesis.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.040
There has to be strong
argument to make change.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.360
So creativity is in part a creature of

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.300
what we're faced with in a society.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.140
Law works, theology works,
religious communities work

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.833
with the contingencies of where they live.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.939
I'd say secondly there's,
inspiration works

00:23:37.939 --> 00:23:40.530
in both these traditions
in different ways.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:43.100
Religious communities talk
about divine inspiration,

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.350
or inspiration from the heart,

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.700
but legal communities talk the same way.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.600
We have transcendent ideals, we have

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.880
transcendent values that
we seek to aspire to.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.280
What is liberty, what is
due process of law, what are

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.610
some of these fundamentals
that we take for granted?

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.340
These are transcendent ideals
that inspire certain change

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.870
over time and induce creative change.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:08.083
I think third we also sometimes
face common calamities.

00:24:08.945 --> 00:24:12.913
The Holocaust, the World War, a tsunami.

00:24:15.828 --> 00:24:19.680
The blight of terrorism,
a nuclear holocaust.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.470
All of which face us today.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:26.470
And those demand sometimes
serious institutional

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.780
and intellectual changes in
our particular communities

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.120
and we sometimes will work together

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.130
as religious and political
communities to respond to those.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.830
It's not a good answer, it's a question

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.710
I'm gonna have to ponder.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.233
- No, it was more than satisfactory.

00:24:43.894 --> 00:24:48.894
I know that in your work,
you've done a lot of work on

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.900
looking at the way
religion impacted the law,

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.890
changed the law, that it was the religious

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:02.890
individuals and groups who
in practicing their religion

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.120
sought freedom, sought the
right to speak, sought the right

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:13.160
to pray, to association, and
sort of built the foundation

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.500
that a lot of what we understand as the

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:22.500
Western human rights, that
that definition came about.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:27.650
Talk a little about that,
because that interface really

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:32.650
becomes important in
understanding how the law emerged

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.650
and how it should relate
to other religions.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:41.200
- It's a hard question, that's a shifting,

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.900
you're moving into a shifting field

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.670
of the history of human rights.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.510
Our schoolboy and schoolgirl
logic in textbooks always

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.670
taught us that human
rights are a product of the

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:53.680
Enlightenment, they are the
final celebration of reason

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.030
over religion, the celebration
of the individual over

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.240
community, the celebration
of the sovereignty of the

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.110
individual over the sovereignty of god,

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.780
and we've now finally
broken the shackles of

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.407
religious establishment and
created human rights for all.

00:26:05.407 --> 00:26:08.140
Now that's a wonderful schoolboy

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.357
logic that many of us grew up with.

00:26:11.357 --> 00:26:15.420
The reality is that historically
it's complete nonsense.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.010
It's an interesting anecdote,
but an important one,

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:22.760
to say that by 1650,
1650, 150 years before

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.810
the Bill of Rights was passed,
every one of the rights

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.370
set forth in the Bill of
Rights had already been

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:30.500
defined, defended, and died for

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.170
by Protestants and by Catholics.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:38.040
Forged out of great struggle,
oftentimes responses to

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:43.040
the ardor of persecution, of
pogroms, of religious warfare,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.400
but a recognition over time
through cruel experience

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.800
that there are certain
features of human nature,

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.850
certain features that we share with all

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.750
brothers and sisters on this earth,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.193
that really have to be
respected by the state.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.280
What that anecdote tries
to illustrate is that

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:05.550
rights talk is not something that is

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.730
a creature of the
Enlightenment, number one.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.450
Rights talk is also not
something which is a creature

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:15.070
of the West, or a creature
of Western Christianity.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:20.070
In many ways, rights are
fundamental goods of human nature.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.540
Fundamental gifts that we've
all been given, that have

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.410
evolved over time or been
imbued in us through a creator

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.170
or through a creative
process, depending on how

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:30.940
you want to deal with human anthropology.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.180
And that the West, sometimes
through hard and cruel

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.650
experience, began to discover
these rights of human nature,

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.360
and began to think about how to

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.300
implement them in serious ways.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.720
And oftentimes were forced
to implement them and

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.100
fight for them in serious
ways when they were

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.930
fundamentally betrayed by tyranny,

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.150
by warfare, by persecution, by pogrom.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.160
And that we can find, if you
look at the history of the West

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.470
we can find rights talk
already in the Hebrew Bible,

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.860
in some of the early Roman law
texts and medieval canon law

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.170
and early modern civil law and common law.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.660
And in many ways the
Enlightenment is living off of

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.240
the capital of the intellectual
discovery and institutional

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.060
implementation of rights
that the West had,

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.530
through long and hard
process, come to discover.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.630
And why that's important for discussion of

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:24.513
universal human rights in the
20th and 21st century is that

00:28:24.513 --> 00:28:28.920
what human rights instruments today become

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.050
for other communities, are
simply mirrors in which

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.540
they can reflect upon
their own civilization

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.670
and cultural and religious experience.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:40.840
And invitations for them
to go back to their texts,

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.180
their canons, their original
ideas, their great prophets,

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.200
some of them slaughtered for
their courageous advocacy.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.930
And to begin to see, in their
own religious traditions

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:53.990
and civilizational patterns,
what are the teachings

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.041
and practices, norms and
habits that are most conducive

00:28:57.041 --> 00:28:59.150
to what we in the West now in the

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.430
20th century have called human rights.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.197
And the interesting thing that's going on,

00:29:03.197 --> 00:29:06.470
and one of your prior guests,
a dear friend and colleague

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:10.220
Abdullahi An-Na'im calls a
hermeneutic of human rights

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.710
that's beginning to emerge in
different parts of the world.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.500
With Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism,

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.540
Confucianism, Daoism, even
traditional communities

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.530
beginning to use this human
rights as mirror image,

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:25.300
to begin to look back at their traditions,

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.500
to reclaim their own voices in
the human rights discussions.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.390
And then, to criticize
some of the formulations of

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.600
human rights that we have as
purported universal statements

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.960
after World War II, and to
begin to make particular claims

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.350
to their unique understandings
of what human nature

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:44.160
demands and needs in the 21st century.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:49.160
- So building this edifice
of a lawful society

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:56.150
where religion is respected,
it involves hard work.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:02.150
It's a navigation that requires
both the law and society

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.100
to change on the one
hand, but also religions,

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:13.100
you're suggesting, to think
about their own history

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.160
and their own set of values
in light of what you call

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.160
the mirror of human rights, hard work.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.530
- It is hard work, and
a cruel work sometimes,

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:28.480
and oftentimes is induced
or catalyzed by the sudden,

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.790
then traumatic absence, or
betrayal of fundamental rights.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.510
What happens when you blow
up 100 thousand people?

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.770
What happens when you
see tens of thousands

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.740
of people dying from
famine or treatable disease

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.650
when there's food rotting
in the storage sheds?

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.500
What happens when you
have massive atrocities,

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.004
alas as we've seen in
Chile and southeast Asia

00:30:51.004 --> 00:30:54.466
and Rwanda, Burundi, into
Chechnya and elsewhere.

00:30:54.466 --> 00:30:59.466
There we're beginning to see,
we viscerally react against

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.440
that in part because it
violates our very human nature

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.480
to see brothers and sisters in
different parts of the world

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.960
so trampled in their human existence.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.080
And what it induces, and
the hard work it causes,

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:15.110
is to get the local communities
to begin to process,

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:20.110
painful as it is, to claim,
what are the grounds on which

00:31:20.636 --> 00:31:24.200
we can properly treat
the other, and what are,

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.493
on those grounds, the
violations that have to be,

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:34.289
what are the violations that
have to be both advertised,

00:31:34.289 --> 00:31:38.430
indicted, and then ultimately
pursued for remedy?

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.330
And I think what's
happening, interestingly,

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.100
in different parts of the world today,

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.660
see the democratic revolutions
in the Mediterranean basin

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.700
and North Africa all the
way up to Libya, Yemen and

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.560
elsewhere, from Libya to
Yemen and Biran and elsewhere

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.130
is that each of these
communities is going through

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.050
this hard experience now
through revolutionary fervor.

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.520
Some of them are prepared,
some of them are not prepared,

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.290
to accept the human rights
that they're advocating.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:06.380
What's important, especially
for our Muslim brothers and

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.850
sisters around the world, is
to recognize that the West

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.680
did not create rights,
western Christian paths to

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.200
discovering rights are not translatable

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.330
into other religious communities.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.730
And western formulations,
constitutional formulations

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:25.730
of rights, are not exportable
entities that simply can be

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:30.080
put in place in these communities
as the be all and end all.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.740
Every community has to
discover for itself,

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.160
every religious tradition
has to discover for itself,

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.270
the resources it has to
put in place the rights

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.710
that ultimately are going to respect

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.690
the fundamentals of human nature.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.040
And that's gonna be a creaky, a painful,

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.660
an arduous, sometimes a
centuries-long process,

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.240
as it was in the West, but every community

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.940
I think eventually will get there.

00:32:54.476 --> 00:32:58.010
- Help us understand
what this work involves.

00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:01.463
In a way, in a particular religion,

00:33:03.331 --> 00:33:08.331
it seems to be in part
a struggle over power.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:12.687
Who will define what our tradition is.

00:33:12.687 --> 00:33:16.430
Which text will we look to.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.200
What is the interpretation of those texts.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.200
So this is kind of the
work that takes time,

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:29.060
it takes argument, and
it takes persuasion,

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.660
but it can also be a bloody conflict

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.960
within any particular religion.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.990
- Sure.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:37.830
And you put your finger
right on the hardest part

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.040
at the beginning, which is the power.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.670
Those who hold the power
are not interested in

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.810
changing institutional structures

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:46.810
that have propped them up in that power.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:50.565
And oftentimes it takes
not just persuasion,

00:33:50.565 --> 00:33:55.120
but serious pressure and
sometimes revolutionary fervor,

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.770
and outright revolution and
warfare, to remove our brokers

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.640
that stand in the way of
the realization of rights.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.830
Whether they're religious
or political or cultural or

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:07.690
tribal leaders, these folk
are not gonna give up easily.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.760
And a mere argument out of
John Locke's two treatises

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.690
on government is not gonna convince them.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.120
And a mere argument to say,
but it's gonna be good for your

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.120
people, and think of what's
gonna happen to them once you

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.210
give them their full human
rights is not gonna work either.

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.700
It takes violence, unfortunately.

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:27.990
Violence is a necessary,
or at least an essential

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:30.530
and sometimes a necessary condition

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.330
for the move toward democratic government

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:37.060
and human rights
vindication on the ground.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:42.060
And one virtue we have in a
21st century globalized world

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:47.000
with its transparent media
is that it's not so easy

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.904
for tyrants to continue to sit

00:34:49.904 --> 00:34:52.237
without accountability to the world.

00:34:52.237 --> 00:34:54.480
And so one of the things
that human rights does,

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.840
and international diplomacy,
and forgive me for treading on

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:01.610
your own area of expertise,
it mobilizes shame.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:03.510
It allows for diplomatic pressure.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.280
It allows for sanctions
and other kinds of pressure

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.220
that don't rise to the level of violence,

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.250
but nonetheless make it very uncomfortable

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.530
for tyrants to sit
comfortably in their seats,

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.573
trampling the rights of the
people under their authority.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:22.440
It also provides ballast and
enthusiasm for those that would

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:27.110
advocate ideally by peaceable
means, but oftentimes

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:31.070
necessarily by tense and
sometimes violent means,

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:35.290
to begin to prop that
tyrant off of his throne

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:37.920
and to put in place a more
responsible government

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.170
that's consistent with
the rights of the people.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.060
But this is hard work, and
in religious communities

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.280
especially, the mechanisms
for change, especially in

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:50.810
hierarchical communities,
just aren't easily there.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:53.020
It takes reformations.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.043
Reformations have occurred in
the history of Christianity

00:35:56.043 --> 00:35:57.950
since the third and fourth century.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.940
It's not just a Protestant
reformation, reform movements

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:05.110
have been a perennial part of
Christian identity in the West

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.330
and some of them have turned
into violence, some of them

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:11.740
have resulted in huge
dislocation of people

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.010
and deprivation of
property and loss of life.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.600
That's part of the process,
and unfortunately our

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.240
Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist
and other friends are

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.850
experiencing the same
things around the world now.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:26.920
- What is the responsibility
on the other side,

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.950
that is looking at it
from the perspective of

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:34.950
the human rights advocates,
the people who sort of embody

00:36:35.431 --> 00:36:38.180
all of the rights that we've achieved.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:43.180
So in this interplay between
religion and the Western

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:48.940
notion of rights, what is
the responsibility of those

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.960
individuals and the law that
they represent to be sensitive

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:59.200
to what's going on in these
religious communities and to be

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:04.710
respectful of where those
religious communities are

00:37:05.248 --> 00:37:09.570
even as we would desire
change on their part

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:14.570
to come closer to the mirror
of human rights values.

00:37:15.078 --> 00:37:17.300
- There are two pieces to that.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:22.300
One is, what obligation befalls
the democratic human rights

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:25.450
revolutionary in the first
place, regardless of the object

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:30.063
of his or its or their or her advocacy.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:34.050
And I would say there we have,
I think Martin Luther King

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:39.050
is a shining example, who always
insisted that the first way

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:42.630
to advocate for human rights
is to live them yourself.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.780
And not to violate the
human rights of the other,

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.317
including the tyrant on the throne,

00:37:47.317 --> 00:37:49.920
in the name of some cause that ultimately

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.840
betrays the very thing that you're doing.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.120
You've gotta respect basic
rights of other people,

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.936
including the enemy, including the other

00:37:57.936 --> 00:37:59.850
whom you're trying to displace.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:02.060
I think that's a lesson
that's really powerful for

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:05.440
human rights advocates in
general, as they press for

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.940
democratic revolution, to
try to do this with as much

00:38:10.995 --> 00:38:14.620
deference to the universal
claims that they themselves

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.070
are trying to make in
the particular moment of

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:19.200
the people that they're going after.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.020
I would say especially with
respect to human rights

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.460
advocates looking at
religious communities.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:28.357
I think we have to avoid
the easy assumptions

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:33.640
of the 1950s through 70s
where it was assumed that

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.830
religion is irrational,
that religious communities

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:40.880
are simply bastions of power,
that religious communities

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:45.880
themselves are simply incapable
of being reasoned with

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:51.190
on human rights terms, and come
to realize that human rights

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.540
communities historically,
and human rights communities

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.070
potentially still today and
in some places in reality

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:58.320
still today, are bastions of human rights,

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.150
they're zones of liberty
that provide opportunity for

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.070
revolutionaries, they provide
many of the basic what we call

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:06.840
second generation rights
of education and healthcare

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.340
and artistic opportunities and more.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.750
And that religious communities are allies,

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:14.090
not enemies, in the
struggle for human rights.

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:18.410
There'll be hardened,
sometimes intractable religious

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:21.670
leaders out there periodically
whom one will encounter,

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:24.970
some of them will betray
the caricature that we have

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:28.310
of religion in general, but I
think folk have to recognize

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:31.830
that if you can find ways of
appealing to these religious

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:35.060
communities in and on their own terms,

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.970
find ways of making this human rights

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:40.460
mirror something that
they're forced to reflect on.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.190
Your own canon says, your
own tradition teaches,

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:46.530
your own prophets have
articulated, your own great

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.660
traditional heroes have
spoken to these issues

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.650
in this particular way, and
to allow those folk to be

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:56.170
betrayed by their own religious
traditions and teachings

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:58.390
rather than simply having human rights

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:59.880
imposed on them from outside.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:04.331
I think that is in many
ways the strongest advocacy

00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:08.405
and most effective revolutionary move that

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:11.302
human rights advocates can make.

00:40:11.302 --> 00:40:14.640
- Let's look at a case
in point, and that is the

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.430
growing number of Muslim
communities in the West.

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:21.180
The question is raised,
well, to what extent should

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:26.180
Western courts recognize
Sharia in court proceedings of

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:35.010
Muslim courts, and so on,
so what, give us a sense

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:41.250
of how you see this tension
evolving over time in a way

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:47.240
where there is appropriate
adjustment on both sides,

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:52.240
for bringing these communities together.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:57.410
- Yeah, this is really the
issue just over the horizon of

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.100
the frontier of family law,
of religious freedom, of human

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:07.100
rights and of the place of
Islam in Western societies.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.500
The question is, is to what
extent can faith-based family

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:15.180
laws, Sharia courts, be given
jurisdiction or power over

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:18.970
the marriage and family lives
of their voluntary faithful?

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:21.850
It's an issue that's getting
pressed very very firmly in

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:24.063
western Europe and the United Kingdom.

00:41:24.063 --> 00:41:29.063
It's being pressed with a
little less alacrity in Canada.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.860
It's just around the corner
here in the United States.

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.610
Think of Oklahoma last year
just passing a law that says

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:36.520
hmm, no Sharia, thank you, here.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.290
Nine states have that under advisement,

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:40.220
people are seeing this as the big issue.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.370
So here's the question.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.350
Marriage and family law has
transformed over the last

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:48.760
50 or 60 years in the United
States, in part through

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.120
due understandings of sexual
liberty, personal autonomy,

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:56.150
privacy, and the
institutional requirements for

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:59.840
what marriage is, or what a
proper domestic relationship is,

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.780
have dramatically changed and been thinned

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.750
compared to their traditional form.

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.760
And now marriage
increasingly is a private,

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.940
bilateral contract to
be formed, maintained

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.930
and dissolved as the parties see fit.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.760
Sexual relationships outside
of marriage are perfectly

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.640
permissible as long as they're
voluntary and the parties are

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:21.950
consenting adults, and the
traditional range of sex crimes

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:25.560
that are out there, abortion,
contraception, adultery

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.480
and the like, are increasingly
becoming private offenses

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.690
at best, that are not
enforced in part because of

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:34.550
dead letter or constitutional
change that's emerged.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:38.480
Muslims don't like these
changes, for the most part,

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.857
in their new Western host
homes, and they want out.

00:42:44.422 --> 00:42:47.700
They want to be free from
this marriage and family

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.810
law system that now obtains
in many western democracies,

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.110
including the United States,

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:54.800
and they want to become
a law unto themselves.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.880
And their argument increasingly
is to say, we would like to

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:02.310
have our voluntary faithful
opt out of the state law

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:05.460
and into the law of our
own religious community.

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.940
And we would rather have our
imams and our Sharia tribunals

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.640
and our religious
leadership in our community

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.474
govern our questions of
marriage, family, sexuality,

00:43:15.474 --> 00:43:18.720
child custody, inheritance and the like,

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.000
rather than have these questions
be dealt with by the state.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.070
And if we have our voluntary
faithful who accept our

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.030
jurisdiction over marriage,
we don't want any one of them

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:32.280
appealing to the state when we
judge against their interest

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.000
and they all of a sudden seek relief from

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.003
a local state or from a federal court.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.450
Their argument is that we'd
like to have that autonomy.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.470
'Cause actually Jews have that.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:46.100
They have their Halakah,
they have their Beit Din.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.050
Christians have that, they have
their Ecclesiastical courts

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:51.080
that deal with marriage
and family questions,

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.240
and we wanna have that, too.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.570
And if you don't like those two examples,

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.760
native peoples, traditional tribes,

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.670
they have their tribal
rulers, they have their

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:03.510
ancestral laws and they operate
their own legal systems.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.850
And we want that autonomy, as
a matter of religious freedom,

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.930
as a matter of personal
autonomy, as a matter of basic

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:13.960
individual rights, equal
protection, due process of law,

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.790
and as a matter of simple
cultural coexistence

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.023
or multiculturalism, as the political.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:23.160
The argument they're
pressing is an argument that

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.590
so far has gotten
nowhere in North America.

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.710
But that argument is
going to be increasingly

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:32.480
in the courts and in the culture wars

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.690
over the next 20 or 30 years
as Muslim communities grow,

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.460
as state laws of marriage
and family get thinner

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:44.870
and thinner, as different
forms of marital pluralism,

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.140
de facto or de jure are in place.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.340
We have domestic partnership
arrangements, we have

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.860
civil unions, we have covenant
marriage in a few states.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:56.053
We have traditional heterosexual
monogamous marriage.

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:59.600
We have same-sex marriage.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.240
Why can't we have, in
the off-the-rack models

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.840
that the state holds
out, religious marriage.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.610
That a party can simply take
that bundle of rights and

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:09.650
privileges that the state puts in place

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:11.890
and use those for their system.

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:16.191
That issue is gonna be pushed
over the next 20 or 30 years,

00:45:16.191 --> 00:45:17.910
and I think we're gonna
have to develop resources

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:20.330
to start dealing with it responsibly.

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:25.330
- One of the things that
comes out in your essays

00:45:26.999 --> 00:45:31.193
and also in our conversation here is this.

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:38.690
The separation of religion
and the law in the past

00:45:40.459 --> 00:45:45.459
led to a kind of a general
misunderstanding, or a lack of

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:52.063
appreciation of the dignity
of the other, basically.

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.570
'Cause when one looks at
the issues, let's say in the

00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:01.790
United States, where religion
seems to be a factor,

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:06.790
it's issues of gay marriage,
it's issue of abortion.

00:46:07.365 --> 00:46:11.880
I think it originally started
in the question of busing

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.880
in religious school, so the
interesting problem here

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:22.650
is how do we restore a sense of the other,

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.410
and their dignity, and
where they're coming from,

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:29.390
as we prepare to argue
about which direction

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:31.600
the law should go in the general society.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:36.410
And this then also applies
in the international context

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:41.410
where we, it's even harder
to appreciate what Hindus or

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:45.200
Muslims or whatever might want
because of their traditions.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.150
- Yeah.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:49.503
That's, again, a set of hard
questions and observations.

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.450
I think a lot of us grew up with another

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:56.200
school boy and school girl logic which was

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.310
strict separation of church and state.

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:01.430
That America's first amendment
teaches that there must be

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:03.760
a high and impregnable wall of separation

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.440
between the religious and the secular,

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:10.080
between religious or church
autonomy and what the state does

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.290
and the two should be
as separate as possible.

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:17.290
And political life, the public
square, laws, legislation,

00:47:17.637 --> 00:47:22.460
laws by legislation or by
judicial decision making

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.530
had to be done free from any religious

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:27.503
preferences, premises, or preferences.

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:31.490
We oftentimes, both in our domestic policy

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:32.930
as well as in our foreign policy,

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:35.560
took that as a given about
how religion existed.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.680
It was the private hobby
horse for the superstitious,

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.390
and it was something
interesting that they could do

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:43.080
and they had freedom
to do, but it couldn't

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.090
have any effect upon public life.

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:47.990
And we would suspect anybody
that made religious arguments

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:51.270
about legal and political
matters, and we would suspect

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:53.530
any politician that would
involve him or herself

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:55.313
actively in a religious community.

00:47:56.212 --> 00:48:00.880
That's given us a reflex about
the purported secularity,

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:05.370
and the neutrality of law
and government in general.

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:08.370
And I think over the last
30 years, that's just flown

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:12.984
very very strongly into
very strong headwinds of

00:48:12.984 --> 00:48:16.020
epistemology that have said,
come on, this notion of

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.530
neutrality really doesn't work anymore.

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:20.950
Everybody has basic founding assumptions,

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:23.340
meta ideals that they work
with, and that some of them

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.830
are religious, some of them are secular,

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:27.100
but they're equally fervently held.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:30.870
Secondly, we've come from
that separation of church and

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:35.870
state logic into an
assumption that the state has

00:48:36.296 --> 00:48:38.530
omnicompetence over things like marriage

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:41.770
or things like family, education, charity.

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:44.130
Religious communities may
want to do that themselves,

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:46.530
but the state really has
exclusive authority over this,

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:49.320
and a cooperation between
the two shouldn't exist.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.790
And over the last 30 years
we've come to realize

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:55.340
with the pervasiveness of the
state's presence in society

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:58.030
and the activity of religious
communities in society,

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.640
that there are plenty of
areas where they overlap.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.250
And so what the burden going forward is

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:07.150
is to find the places of
overlapping consensus,

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:10.420
of cooperation between the
two, where they can get along

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.040
and conserve each other rather than

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.040
being in constant tension with each other.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.310
Whether that's a respect
for the dignity of the other

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:19.840
or the office of the other,
that's I think an aspiration,

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.520
but I think it's pragmatically at least,

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.780
religious communities
and political communities

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:27.350
are gonna have to figure
out how to get along

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:30.540
on some of the fundamentals,
both domestically

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.640
and then increasingly internationally.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.130
And marriage and family questions
that we just talked about

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:38.210
a few minutes ago, education
questions, charity questions,

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:41.490
are areas where we're
renegotiating those boundaries.

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:44.480
And it's in this awkward business
of faith based initiatives

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.110
and this funny business
of religious legal systems

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:48.840
dealing with marriage and family,

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.310
that's the constant
renegotiation about the boundary

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:53.870
between public and private
schools, those are gonna be

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:58.870
perennially contested zones
of blurriness that happily

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.700
I think we have the mechanisms to continue

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:06.313
to negotiate day by day and over time.

00:50:07.448 --> 00:50:09.862
And I think we're gonna have
to just get over the lie

00:50:09.862 --> 00:50:13.030
that religion and law are
hermetically and hermeneutically

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:16.540
separate, and that religious
and political institutions

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.840
can live in completely separate
and distinguishable spheres.

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.780
The overlap is inevitable
in finding the hermeneutic

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.845
to allow them to interact responsibly,

00:50:26.845 --> 00:50:29.690
maintaining the integrity of each side's

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:32.160
responsibility in society
I think is the goal.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.530
- The tension here, it
seems to be on the one side

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:40.530
we can have fanaticism
and prejudice emerging

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.720
from one or another of the actors.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:50.720
On the other hand, we see
things like humanitarianism,

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:55.460
charity, a fellowship
for the other and so on.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:51:00.460
Is there an ideal lever
here helping us to move down

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:09.020
the right path to negotiate
these contradictions

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:14.190
between what can be the
dark side of religion,

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:22.240
which is a piece, that is
present in different places

00:51:22.527 --> 00:51:25.214
and different times,
but on the other hand,

00:51:25.214 --> 00:51:28.880
the real virtues and strength that are

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.910
brought by religion to the law.

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:34.130
- Yeah, I think the lever is
being constructed as we speak

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:37.800
and is being constructed
case by case, issue by issue,

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:41.110
area of competence by area of competence,

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:43.710
I don't think there's a
one size fits all for this.

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:46.090
Secondly I think it's
increasingly obvious that

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:48.190
the fundamentalists,
political fundamentalists

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:51.290
and religious fundamentalists
who are utterly dogmatic

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:53.970
about the certainty of their positions,

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:56.920
simply can't play in this
game, and need to be excluded,

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.620
and then that sends the
Constitution in the United States

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.990
through its establishment
clause, provides I think

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:05.393
very very strong support that
needs constantly to be there.

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:07.620
I think third...

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.740
No new cooperation between
religious and political

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.580
communities can betray the fundamentals.

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:22.270
The fundamentals of freedom
of speech and press and

00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:25.740
assembly and association,
the fundamentals of equality,

00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.560
on racial, gender,
culture and other grounds

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.970
that have been so highly sought after.

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:35.410
No cooperation I think
can sacrifice due process

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:37.693
and equal protection
ideals more generally.

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:40.770
And I think one of the
things that we've learned,

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:44.750
in part by trial and error,
is that as we think about

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.100
bringing religious communities
and political communities

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.322
back into cooperation, we're
gonna have to make sure

00:52:50.322 --> 00:52:54.050
that we don't give up on those
constitutional fundamentals.

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:55.950
So in the faith-based initiative program,

00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:59.240
to give an example, where
religious communities now can be

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.580
amongst others to receive
federal or state funding

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:06.640
and deliver that to the needy in society,

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.460
for whom the funding is directed,

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.850
those religious communities
can't discriminate

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:13.980
on any ground, religious,
gender, culture, racial

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.440
or other ground in
delivery of the services.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:20.010
They can't coerce a person to,
as a condition for receiving

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:23.610
the aid, participate in their
religious worship service.

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:26.463
They can't use the...

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.040
Funds that have been directed
to them by the federal or

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.210
state government and divert
them to the support for their

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:38.713
religious worship or the collection of

00:53:38.713 --> 00:53:41.150
religious obligations and the like.

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:44.610
There's a rather careful
set of boundary lines

00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:47.150
that have been set, which
I think are healthy ones.

00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:49.550
The education area is
another good example.

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:52.750
Yes, we can allow religious
schools and public schools

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:56.860
to sit side by side, and
that parties have a choice

00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:58.660
where they want to send their children.

00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:00.040
Or if their children are becoming

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.170
young adults, where they want to go.

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:05.765
But there are certain fundamentals
that are non-negotiable.

00:54:05.765 --> 00:54:07.280
They have to get basic
reading, writing, arithmetic,

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.440
they have to have basic
physical education,

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.690
there have to be basic
facilities requirements

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:14.730
for laboratories and gymnasiums,
libraries that are there.

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:16.230
They have to have, they have to be

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:18.910
prepared as democratic citizens.

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:20.410
We cannot handicap them if they

00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:22.420
choose to go to a religious school.

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:25.250
There, too, a religious freedom
objection or an argument

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:28.750
to say no no, we wanna
cooperate only on our own terms

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:33.650
by teaching them only Hebrew
or Arabic or Dutch or Latin,

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:35.330
simply is not gonna fly.

00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:38.740
And there too I think we have
made the kind of pragmatic

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:42.494
adjustments, the construction
of at least one lever,

00:54:42.494 --> 00:54:45.080
to make this cooperation work.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.458
And those are hard things
to construct and they're,

00:54:47.458 --> 00:54:49.870
it's a malleable
instrument that's gonna be

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:51.810
renegotiated from time to time.

00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:53.900
I think it's worth constructing them

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.880
so that religious and political
communities can cooperate

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.650
with the outsiders, the
fundamentalist outsiders,

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:01.810
left out of that cooperative vehicle

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:06.100
and vigilant, vigilant,
transparent regulation

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.660
to ensure that the areas of cooperation

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:12.280
simply do not become stepping
stones for coercion or for

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.290
betrayal of some of our
fundamental Constitutional ideals.

00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:19.780
- One final question, how
would you advise students to

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:24.270
prepare for the future where
whether they are religious

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:29.270
or not, religion will
play an important part in

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:33.550
kind of the public area,
the public discourse.

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:37.270
- I would go back to my
argument a few minutes ago about

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:41.380
the importance of learning to
train your peripheral vision.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:44.630
Even if you don't wanna be
focused on religious life or

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:46.950
religious identity, you don't
wanna be part of a religious

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:49.950
community, that's taboo for
you, you've got your own faith,

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:51.150
you've got your own spiritualism,

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:53.180
or you have no faith
or you have anti-faith.

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.840
It's important as a learned
member of society to have

00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.180
just enough knowledge of
those that have a different

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:03.260
set of beliefs and practices,
to be able to understand

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.690
what they're about, what
drives them, what are their

00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:07.890
punch points, what are the
things that you have to

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:10.130
watch out for, and what are the things

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:12.160
within them you have to respect?

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.140
It's interesting, Mahatma
Gandhi has this wonderful idea,

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:19.201
a community and an individual's
commitment to freedom

00:56:19.201 --> 00:56:23.843
is judged by how they treat
their most hated minorities.

00:56:23.843 --> 00:56:25.900
And I like that idea.

00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:29.240
It's basically a learned
citizen who's democratic

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:31.230
and who believes in human rights values as

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:35.050
a sine qua non for our
existence of living together

00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:38.210
has to be able to know
enough to know how to,

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:41.000
not to love the other,
but not to hate the other.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
And I would say for a person growing up,

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.430
to learn about different faith traditions.

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:49.700
To wander into a temple or a synagogue,

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.470
or a mosque or a church,
and kinda feel what's there.

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:54.020
To read a few of the key texts,

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:57.070
to be aware of what's going on in society.

00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:59.050
So that you can be in learned conversation

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:01.940
and you can advocate the
position that you take,

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:04.720
which happens to be of
no faith or anti-faith.

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.530
If you don't have the resources
to understand the other,

00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:10.906
you can't argue convincingly
about the other.

00:57:10.906 --> 00:57:13.600
- On that note, John, thank you very much

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.955
for this fascinating discussion.

00:57:16.955 --> 00:57:17.973
- Thanks so much for having me.

00:57:17.973 --> 00:57:20.980
- And it was a great pleasure
to have you on our program.

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.680
And thank you very much for joining us

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:25.693
for this Conversation with History.

00:57:26.864 --> 00:57:30.364
(upbeat electronic music)
