hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.020
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
Android team at Google I work on

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030
Android team at Google I work on
 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.700
Android team at Google I work on
graphics and animation but today I'm

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710
graphics and animation but today I'm
 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.740
graphics and animation but today I'm
going to talk about something a little

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
going to talk about something a little
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.030
going to talk about something a little
bit different a little bit of animation

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040
bit different a little bit of animation
 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.029
bit different a little bit of animation
but it's more about doing things wrong

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039
but it's more about doing things wrong
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.370
but it's more about doing things wrong
so this is the first in possibly an

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
so this is the first in possibly an
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.140
so this is the first in possibly an
ongoing series which i like to call

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
ongoing series which i like to call
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.109
ongoing series which i like to call
you're doing it wrong so the demo I'm

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119
you're doing it wrong so the demo I'm
 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.160
you're doing it wrong so the demo I'm
going to show you today this is really

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
going to show you today this is really
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.320
going to show you today this is really
hacked up as many of my demos are and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330
hacked up as many of my demos are and
 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.450
hacked up as many of my demos are and
very obvious and and you may not do

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
very obvious and and you may not do
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.310
very obvious and and you may not do
things exactly this way but these are

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
things exactly this way but these are
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.979
things exactly this way but these are
examples taken from relapse shipping on

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
examples taken from relapse shipping on
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.440
examples taken from relapse shipping on
the device where we've seen approaches

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
the device where we've seen approaches
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.830
the device where we've seen approaches
like this or like this in a maybe much

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
like this or like this in a maybe much
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.319
like this or like this in a maybe much
more complex and not as obviously bad

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329
more complex and not as obviously bad
 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.049
more complex and not as obviously bad
way so it's important to sort of take

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059
way so it's important to sort of take
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.150
way so it's important to sort of take
the the main idea away from it if not

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
the the main idea away from it if not
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.119
the the main idea away from it if not
the exact implementation so in

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129
the exact implementation so in
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.750
the exact implementation so in
particular I want to look at list view

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760
particular I want to look at list view
 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.490
particular I want to look at list view
and the idea that there's a distinction

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500
and the idea that there's a distinction
 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.260
and the idea that there's a distinction
between the position of items on the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
between the position of items on the
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.510
between the position of items on the
screen and the views that represent the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
screen and the views that represent the
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.189
screen and the views that represent the
content in those items and you should

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
content in those items and you should
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.420
content in those items and you should
understand those differences very

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
understand those differences very
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.060
understand those differences very
carefully for the following reason so

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
carefully for the following reason so
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.560
carefully for the following reason so
let's take a look at the demo which I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
let's take a look at the demo which I
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.770
let's take a look at the demo which I
call ListView deletion and we've got a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
call ListView deletion and we've got a
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630
call ListView deletion and we've got a
list of cheeses on the screen we can

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640
list of cheeses on the screen we can
 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.300
list of cheeses on the screen we can
select several of these and we want to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
select several of these and we want to
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.440
select several of these and we want to
select the ones that we're getting rid

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
select the ones that we're getting rid
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.600
select the ones that we're getting rid
of so we click the delete selected they

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
of so we click the delete selected they
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.460
of so we click the delete selected they
fade out so that's the animation part of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
fade out so that's the animation part of
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.690
fade out so that's the animation part of
this thing they fade out and then we

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
this thing they fade out and then we
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.160
this thing they fade out and then we
remove them from the adapter and the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
remove them from the adapter and the
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.200
remove them from the adapter and the
list view updates and all things are

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
list view updates and all things are
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.090
list view updates and all things are
wonderful but what happens if we select

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
wonderful but what happens if we select
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.980
wonderful but what happens if we select
a few of these and then we scroll down

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
a few of these and then we scroll down
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.469
a few of these and then we scroll down
and okay we'll go ahead and run the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479
and okay we'll go ahead and run the
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.230
and okay we'll go ahead and run the
deletion okay let's run that one again

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
deletion okay let's run that one again
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.270
deletion okay let's run that one again
if I could slow mo this I would notice

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280
if I could slow mo this I would notice
 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.190
if I could slow mo this I would notice
that there are things fading out on the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
that there are things fading out on the
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.410
that there are things fading out on the
screen that had nothing to do with the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
screen that had nothing to do with the
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.910
screen that had nothing to do with the
ones that are checked in fact if I

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
ones that are checked in fact if I
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.260
ones that are checked in fact if I
scroll all the checked ones off the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
scroll all the checked ones off the
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.300
scroll all the checked ones off the
screen nothing should fade out because

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310
screen nothing should fade out because
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.819
screen nothing should fade out because
none of these items are actually

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829
none of these items are actually
 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.810
none of these items are actually
selected right so they shouldn't be

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
selected right so they shouldn't be
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.510
selected right so they shouldn't be
removed but they are but actually the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
removed but they are but actually the
 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.819
removed but they are but actually the
content that's the content of the items

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
content that's the content of the items
 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.580
content that's the content of the items
themselves is not being deleted what's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
themselves is not being deleted what's
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.310
themselves is not being deleted what's
being deleted are the views right so we

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
being deleted are the views right so we
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.350
being deleted are the views right so we
fade out the view and then we delete the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
fade out the view and then we delete the
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.700
fade out the view and then we delete the
items well the items that are being

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
items well the items that are being
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.020
items well the items that are being
deleted or not the view that are being

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030
deleted or not the view that are being
 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.210
deleted or not the view that are being
faded out so what's going on so there's

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
faded out so what's going on so there's
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.889
faded out so what's going on so there's
a concept in the list view of view

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
a concept in the list view of view
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.410
a concept in the list view of view
recycling this is done because you can

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
recycling this is done because you can
 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.050
recycling this is done because you can
have lists

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060
have lists
 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.970
have lists
views of enormous size with tons of

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980
views of enormous size with tons of
 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.559
views of enormous size with tons of
views in them and we don't want to

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569
views in them and we don't want to
 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.300
views in them and we don't want to
instantiate all of those things and have

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310
instantiate all of those things and have
 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.370
instantiate all of those things and have
them persistent in the state of the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380
them persistent in the state of the
 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.020
them persistent in the state of the
activity at all times and we don't want

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030
activity at all times and we don't want
 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.490
activity at all times and we don't want
to have to update all this stuff every

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500
to have to update all this stuff every
 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.470
to have to update all this stuff every
time we redraw the ListView so instead

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
time we redraw the ListView so instead
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.720
time we redraw the ListView so instead
we have active views for the items that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730
we have active views for the items that
 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.970
we have active views for the items that
are on the screen at the time and as

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980
are on the screen at the time and as
 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.759
are on the screen at the time and as
view scroll off those views get recycled

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769
view scroll off those views get recycled
 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.470
view scroll off those views get recycled
and used for other content on the screen

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480
and used for other content on the screen
 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.300
and used for other content on the screen
it's very nice it makes a list view very

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310
it's very nice it makes a list view very
 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.309
it's very nice it makes a list view very
smooth to fleeing into scroll and to

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319
smooth to fleeing into scroll and to
 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.890
smooth to fleeing into scroll and to
interact with however it means that if

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900
interact with however it means that if
 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.509
interact with however it means that if
you are assuming things about the

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519
you are assuming things about the
 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.940
you are assuming things about the
specific views that are being used in a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950
specific views that are being used in a
 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.180
specific views that are being used in a
listview you're doing it wrong there

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190
listview you're doing it wrong there
 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.190
listview you're doing it wrong there
there it's important to understand that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200
there it's important to understand that
 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.809
there it's important to understand that
list view you should really think of it

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819
list view you should really think of it
 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.090
list view you should really think of it
as a holder of content and you need to

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100
as a holder of content and you need to
 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.340
as a holder of content and you need to
really interact with that content in

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350
really interact with that content in
 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.070
really interact with that content in
terms of the adapter directly and not

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080
terms of the adapter directly and not
 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.780
terms of the adapter directly and not
necessarily the views on the screen or

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790
necessarily the views on the screen or
 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.339
necessarily the views on the screen or
else you at least need to know what

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349
else you at least need to know what
 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.839
else you at least need to know what
you're doing so let's take a look at the

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849
you're doing so let's take a look at the
 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.280
you're doing so let's take a look at the
code and see what the application is

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290
code and see what the application is
 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.680
code and see what the application is
doing wrong so we have this list view

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690
doing wrong so we have this list view
 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.190
doing wrong so we have this list view
deletion class we create this arraylist

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200
deletion class we create this arraylist
 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.620
deletion class we create this arraylist
holding this large list of cheese is

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630
holding this large list of cheese is
 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.900
holding this large list of cheese is
terribly interesting content and then we

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910
terribly interesting content and then we
 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.910
terribly interesting content and then we
have this set onclicklistener for the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920
have this set onclicklistener for the
 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.140
have this set onclicklistener for the
delete button so when you click the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150
delete button so when you click the
 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.660
delete button so when you click the
button it figures out what to delete and

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670
button it figures out what to delete and
 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.640
button it figures out what to delete and
runs animations in Ruby removes things

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650
runs animations in Ruby removes things
 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.259
runs animations in Ruby removes things
appropriately oh and then there's some

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269
appropriately oh and then there's some
 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.910
appropriately oh and then there's some
code down here where when you actually

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920
code down here where when you actually
 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.370
code down here where when you actually
checked on these things so we can take a

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380
checked on these things so we can take a
 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.670
checked on these things so we can take a
look at that on item click listener for

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680
look at that on item click listener for
 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.199
look at that on item click listener for
the checkbox it basically adds these

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209
the checkbox it basically adds these
 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.690
the checkbox it basically adds these
views to this list of checked views

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700
views to this list of checked views
 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.650
views to this list of checked views
there so we track that now this is kind

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660
there so we track that now this is kind
 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.780
there so we track that now this is kind
of the hack part of the demo where we're

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790
of the hack part of the demo where we're
 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.250
of the hack part of the demo where we're
actually tracking you know the views

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260
actually tracking you know the views
 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.039
actually tracking you know the views
that are actually being deleted for the

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049
that are actually being deleted for the
 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.870
that are actually being deleted for the
purposes of the demo so we go through

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880
purposes of the demo so we go through
 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.490
purposes of the demo so we go through
here and we go through the the checked

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500
here and we go through the the checked
 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.849
here and we go through the the checked
items of the list view and this is the

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859
items of the list view and this is the
 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.009
items of the list view and this is the
default code which is bad which is okay

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019
default code which is bad which is okay
 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.069
default code which is bad which is okay
we're not this checkbox to to control

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079
we're not this checkbox to to control
 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.629
we're not this checkbox to to control
the behavior is not currently check so

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639
the behavior is not currently check so
 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:04.800
the behavior is not currently check so
we're going to we're going to run the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810
we're going to we're going to run the
 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.030
we're going to we're going to run the
code that we thought was obvious and

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040
code that we thought was obvious and
 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.520
code that we thought was obvious and
we're going to simply remove we're going

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530
we're going to simply remove we're going
 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.110
we're going to simply remove we're going
to fade out views and remove them so

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120
to fade out views and remove them so
 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.509
to fade out views and remove them so
first of all we're going to post this a

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519
first of all we're going to post this a
 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.460
first of all we're going to post this a
delayed thing to actually remove it from

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470
delayed thing to actually remove it from
 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.229
delayed thing to actually remove it from
the adapter after the fade animation is

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239
the adapter after the fade animation is
 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.670
the adapter after the fade animation is
done we know that the animation is going

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680
done we know that the animation is going
 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.500
done we know that the animation is going
to take 300 milliseconds the actual

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510
to take 300 milliseconds the actual
 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.380
to take 300 milliseconds the actual
animation is run down here where we

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390
animation is run down here where we
 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.480
animation is run down here where we
iterate through the checked views list

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490
iterate through the checked views list
 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.610
iterate through the checked views list
and for each one of those we grab the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620
and for each one of those we grab the
 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.920
and for each one of those we grab the
view

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930
view
 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.860
view
that was checked and we run a animation

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870
that was checked and we run a animation
 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.390
that was checked and we run a animation
on it this is using the view property

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400
on it this is using the view property
 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.360
on it this is using the view property
animator API which was introduced in the

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370
animator API which was introduced in the
 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.870
animator API which was introduced in the
32 release so we say animate the Alpha

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880
32 release so we say animate the Alpha
 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.360
32 release so we say animate the Alpha
property to 0 and when you finish let's

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370
property to 0 and when you finish let's
 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.830
property to 0 and when you finish let's
restore the Alpha property because

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840
restore the Alpha property because
 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.540
restore the Alpha property because
that's good practice otherwise this

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550
that's good practice otherwise this
 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.150
that's good practice otherwise this
thing stays invisible so all what that

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160
thing stays invisible so all what that
 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.980
thing stays invisible so all what that
looks good except for the part where if

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990
looks good except for the part where if
 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.960
looks good except for the part where if
you scrolled off the screen that view

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970
you scrolled off the screen that view
 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.090
you scrolled off the screen that view
got recycled and reused by completely

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100
got recycled and reused by completely
 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.770
got recycled and reused by completely
different content so now we're going to

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780
different content so now we're going to
 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.140
different content so now we're going to
fade out the view which has nothing to

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150
fade out the view which has nothing to
 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.820
fade out the view which has nothing to
do with the content that was checked

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830
do with the content that was checked
 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.159
do with the content that was checked
which is now sitting off the screen bad

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169
which is now sitting off the screen bad
 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.080
which is now sitting off the screen bad
way to go if we go back and look at the

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090
way to go if we go back and look at the
 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.710
way to go if we go back and look at the
demo again and we say use positions

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720
demo again and we say use positions
 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.839
demo again and we say use positions
instead of use views and we check a

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849
instead of use views and we check a
 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.850
instead of use views and we check a
bunch of things on here and then we run

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860
bunch of things on here and then we run
 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.460
bunch of things on here and then we run
this thing well of course it does the

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470
this thing well of course it does the
 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.450
this thing well of course it does the
right thing when they're on the screen

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460
right thing when they're on the screen
 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.210
right thing when they're on the screen
anyway but if we scroll these things off

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220
anyway but if we scroll these things off
 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.270
anyway but if we scroll these things off
the screen then it fades out only the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280
the screen then it fades out only the
 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.159
the screen then it fades out only the
ones that are actually selected that are

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169
ones that are actually selected that are
 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.170
ones that are actually selected that are
on the screen and that logic works as

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180
on the screen and that logic works as
 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.040
on the screen and that logic works as
follows so in here we go into the else

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050
follows so in here we go into the else
 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.170
follows so in here we go into the else
clause first of all we clear this thing

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180
clause first of all we clear this thing
 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.249
clause first of all we clear this thing
so that we're not going to run

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259
so that we're not going to run
 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.689
so that we're not going to run
animations on these because we have a

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699
animations on these because we have a
 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.279
animations on these because we have a
different way of managing our animations

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289
different way of managing our animations
 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.189
different way of managing our animations
in this approach we get the position on

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199
in this approach we get the position on
 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.870
in this approach we get the position on
the screen so we can get the first

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880
the screen so we can get the first
 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.760
the screen so we can get the first
visible position and then everything

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770
visible position and then everything
 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.589
visible position and then everything
after that is numbered after that

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599
after that is numbered after that
 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.080
after that is numbered after that
position so we can say okay this is the

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090
position so we can say okay this is the
 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.360
position so we can say okay this is the
first visible position and then we

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370
first visible position and then we
 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.800
first visible position and then we
iterate through so this is the number of

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810
iterate through so this is the number of
 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:51.640
iterate through so this is the number of
checked items so we're actually

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650
checked items so we're actually
 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.290
checked items so we're actually
iterating through the list view items

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300
iterating through the list view items
 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.270
iterating through the list view items
here so we can get the position of the

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280
here so we can get the position of the
 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.249
here so we can get the position of the
list view item itself the position of

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259
list view item itself the position of
 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:59.050
list view item itself the position of
the first visible position and then

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060
the first visible position and then
 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.460
the first visible position and then
figure out whether that thing is

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470
figure out whether that thing is
 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.170
figure out whether that thing is
actually on screen and if it's not on

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180
actually on screen and if it's not on
 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.330
actually on screen and if it's not on
screen don't run an animation at all

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340
screen don't run an animation at all
 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.029
screen don't run an animation at all
just remove the thing in fact we should

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039
just remove the thing in fact we should
 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.060
just remove the thing in fact we should
remove it after we're done so that it

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070
remove it after we're done so that it
 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.610
remove it after we're done so that it
doesn't blink the list and move stuff

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620
doesn't blink the list and move stuff
 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.860
doesn't blink the list and move stuff
around at the time but we basically use

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870
around at the time but we basically use
 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.870
around at the time but we basically use
that as a trigger to determine whether

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880
that as a trigger to determine whether
 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.490
that as a trigger to determine whether
it's on screen there for running

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500
it's on screen there for running
 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.560
it's on screen there for running
animation on the thing or it's off

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570
animation on the thing or it's off
 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.210
animation on the thing or it's off
screen don't bother with the animation

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220
screen don't bother with the animation
 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.499
screen don't bother with the animation
just remove it when all the animations

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:23.509
just remove it when all the animations
 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.350
just remove it when all the animations
are done so if it is on screen then we

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360
are done so if it is on screen then we
 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.820
are done so if it is on screen then we
do a similar animation as we did before

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830
do a similar animation as we did before
 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.279
do a similar animation as we did before
we animate the Alpha property on that

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289
we animate the Alpha property on that
 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.320
we animate the Alpha property on that
view with an end action to restore alpha

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330
view with an end action to restore alpha
 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.140
view with an end action to restore alpha
and after we've restored alpha then we

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150
and after we've restored alpha then we
 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.839
and after we've restored alpha then we
remove it from the adapter so all the

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849
remove it from the adapter so all the
 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:39.550
remove it from the adapter so all the
animation code before was good what

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560
animation code before was good what
 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.110
animation code before was good what
wasn't good was that we were using a

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120
wasn't good was that we were using a
 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.629
wasn't good was that we were using a
view that was determined at checked I'm

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639
view that was determined at checked I'm
 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.670
view that was determined at checked I'm
not at the time when we were actually

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680
not at the time when we were actually
 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.010
not at the time when we were actually
telling the system to delete and we knew

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020
telling the system to delete and we knew
 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.450
telling the system to delete and we knew
what was actually on the screen at the

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460
what was actually on the screen at the
 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.240
what was actually on the screen at the
time so the takeaway here is be aware of

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250
time so the takeaway here is be aware of
 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.800
time so the takeaway here is be aware of
the position of your items on the screen

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810
the position of your items on the screen
 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.629
the position of your items on the screen
be aware that your views can be recycled

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639
be aware that your views can be recycled
 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.550
be aware that your views can be recycled
and be aware that there is a really

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560
and be aware that there is a really
 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.920
and be aware that there is a really
large disconnect potentially between

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930
large disconnect potentially between
 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.600
large disconnect potentially between
those positions and the views and the

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610
those positions and the views and the
 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.510
those positions and the views and the
data underneath that the views happen to

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520
data underneath that the views happen to
 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.700
data underneath that the views happen to
be displaying at any point in time so

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710
be displaying at any point in time so
 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.250
be displaying at any point in time so
thanks
