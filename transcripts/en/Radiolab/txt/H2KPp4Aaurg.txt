Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich, This is Radiolab. We're back from our break. Yes we do. During our breaks, what would you say we do during our breaks? We don't do anything. We don't exist really. And we're going to continue with our show here. A today, how many meditations? 1111 meditations on things relating to death and what happens after, but we're not up to living. This is a five. It's called four seconds down from producers who are in wheeler. Wake up. Everything's pretty black. Same as Azman. Last couple of weeks. This is Ken Baldwin. The day he's talking about is August 20th, 1985. Say Goodbye to my wife

Speaker 2:          00:41          and I just say, you know, I'll be home late. Do some overtime at the time he used to living couple hours east of San Francisco. Say Goodbye. Say I love her. And uh, I know right now that I won't survive the day. She has no idea how I feel. Everything is, is dark, everything is, is black. So I get in my car, I'm, I'm just not a very good person drive to work. Cause I think maybe, uh, maybe I can do it one more day closer. I get to work the more I realize I've, I've, I've got to disappear to, to start over and get rid of whatever it is I've got. It's got to end. I drive right past work and then I'm on the, uh, freeway kind of relaxed and I finally see the bridge and it's, it's huge. It's gigantic. He parks his car at the bridge, puts money in the meter and uh, I start walking and I'm walking on the bridge just like any other tourists. It's a beautiful day. It's a gorgeous Wednesday. I see everything around me and it's just gorgeous. And I find a place, it's, it's an outcropping. You can see straight down into the water

Speaker 2:          02:04          and I say, uh, this is the time to do it. You really got to do this. I really believed that everybody would be better off without me

Speaker 3:          02:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:15          that everybody would just get on with their lives, feeling better about me being gone. Then me being here, I put my hands on the, on the railing count to 10

Speaker 3:          02:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:36          and I vaulted over

Speaker 2:          02:40          and the last things I uh, saw leave the bridge where my hands and that moment, that very moment

Speaker 1:          02:50          I said, oh my God, this is a mistake.

Speaker 2:          02:55          [inaudible] nothing I can do about it. The fall from the bridge to the, it takes about four seconds and it was almost like a quick flickers of what I was trying to think of my family, my daughter, three years old, I'll never see her grow up. The things she's going to see that I don't get to see man, the misery that I caused. This is bad. I'm sorry guys that I did this to you. I do want to listen to how it's going to end

Speaker 1:          03:25          and I just blacked out

Speaker 4:          03:35          and I woke up and I was swimming for my life and I was saying, oh my God, somebody please save me somebody. Somebody saved,

Speaker 1:          03:42          he hit the water and a ball. He bruised his feet, his backside, but no serious injuries. Some workers saw him jump and called the coast guard.

Speaker 4:          03:52          And then the next thing I remember, I was on the coast guard cutter.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Only 26 people have made it onto that boat out of a thousand or so that have jumped. And nearly all of them say that in the middle of the fall when they're facing their death, something inside them changed.

Speaker 3:          04:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:12          they didn't want to die.

Speaker 3:          04:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:15          for Ken, that change happened the very moment he saw his hands leave the bridge. I can see that perfectly.

Speaker 3:          04:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          04:23          I can, I can, I can see my hands leave the bridge. I don't know if it was a, if it was a mechanical switch or a, you know, um, some kind of switch in the brain function, but it, for some reason it became a switch to another life.

Speaker 3:          04:51          [inaudible] number six

Speaker 4:          05:02          m a dead. Ooh, I hear some seagulls. You hear the seagulls? Yeah. Where are they coming from? We just on the edge of the, um, the English Channel on the Atlantic. So they've got you in a little box floating in the ocean. We don't actually, we're not that far away from, from the sea. So we get lots of seagulls here. This is Paul Brock's, he's not really floating in a box in the ocean. He used, it's in a box near the ocean. And uh, the reason we've connected our box in New York to his in England is because of a question he was once asked, you know, if you work in this sort of line that I've worked in over the years, you get the most bizarre statements and questions, which is because Palsy neuropsychologist, which means he diagnosis patients with various mental disorders. And he describes this one case about eight years ago involving a woman named Jeannie, just an ordinary pleasant middle aged woman from the north of England, early fifties well loved by her family.

Speaker 4:          05:57          She comes into his office, he runs it through some basic tests. I just did a basic assessment of as I would in that sort of case of genuine intellectual level. And at first she seemed pretty with it. She answered all his questions. He seemed pretty alert. But then, well, she was, she, we then go into a conversation about whether things seemed real. What does that mean? Well, it's difficult to pin that one down. She just felt that things weren't real. She would point to objects in the room and say, well, that cup that doesn't, doesn't seem real, does it? Or the chair doesn't seem real. It just doesn't feel real. So I can see it and I can describe it to you, but it just doesn't feel real. And the thing that really made me sit up

Speaker 6:          06:42          was when she said, um, I forget the exact phrase, but it's in the book. Um, eventually Jeannie said, am I dad and like to add? Yes. Do you think I'm dead? Do you think I'd die? I didn't respond immediately. I let the silence flow. Jeannie smiled. The face was lit with a benign perplexity. There was a smear of toothpaste around the corner from that. She didn't seem to notice the droplets of tea spinning onto her dressing gun, but there was a Glinton right in the middle of the night. I was convinced. She said, I thought they'd come to take me away.

Speaker 3:          07:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          07:21          I can't say for sure that I'm dead. She continued. The things are not the same. I don't feel real. It seems to me like he did. How would I know if I was dead?

Speaker 3:          07:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          07:42          immediately made me think. This might be an example of coats syndrome.

Speaker 5:          07:46          No one really knows what causes Kotara [inaudible] Syndrome. Very rare. I mean I've come across three cases, but one of the symptoms, he says often this sense of deep sense that you're somehow not completely here.

Speaker 6:          08:02          One idea about, um, this syndrome is that somehow there's a decoupling of thoughts and feelings,

Speaker 5:          08:10          which means what exactly here's how to explain it to me. The brain has two jobs. It's doing it all times. The first is to keep track of what's happening outside your body. Like the sites that are coming out. You smell, touch, your central experience of the world and the most immediate consciousness of the body and the world and the body being in the world. All the while. The brain also is maintaining this inner life where you think thoughts and you have memories, personality, what you normally think of when you think about yourself, you right, what do you think happens in these, in this condition? Is it that outer? Are you, this was sensual self somehow gets cut,

Speaker 4:          08:50          cut off from that inner mental you and it just drifts off to

Speaker 1:          08:56          leaving you with just thoughts,

Speaker 4:          08:59          but it's the feelings that give us our in the moment sense of self. So if you don't have feelings attached to forts and perception,

Speaker 1:          09:07          then you're like a vapor. You're there but you have no weight isn't what you're describing. Basically one version of the afterlife, like my body's gone, but some thing remains.

Speaker 4:          09:17          Yeah, I hadn't thought of that. That's very, very interesting way to think about it. But is that any different than the story persisting in someone else's head?

Speaker 3:          09:45          [inaudible] seven

Speaker 1:          09:46          do you guys know this group? That edge edge.org it's John Brock News Group. Yeah, we do. That's David Eagleman again and for number seven, a brief excerpt from a conversation we had with him. If I only had a brain, so, so I just wrote an essay on there yesterday. It came out because this big ideas that will change the world [inaudible] exactly. Yeah. What's the thing that'll change everything? And my answer was, and I think this is something I'll actually see in my lifetime. So the idea is silicone and mortality. In other words, downloading your consciousness and do a computer and we'll really have reached a new point where there'll be a mortality. Ah, how would you, how would you figure this would work? We did so. So imagine you make an exact copy of the three dimensional structure of the brain. All the neurons, all the connections between the neurons, the proteins inside the phosphorylation states of the proteins.

Speaker 1:          10:33          You make a copy of this whole thing. What matters is the algorithms that are running on top of the brain, it's not the wet gushy stuff that matters. It's what that wet gushy stuff is implementing. And the idea is that if you could recreate the brain out of let's say beer cans and tennis balls and you get all the structure the same and it runs the same algorithms, then that would be, you would have your consciousness, your memories, your thoughts and so on. Yeah. Right now it's science fiction because it's so much data. Our current computers can handle it. Is that the only limitation? Just the, the hard drive size? No. There's other limitation where there are two, there are two limitations right now. One is our imaging technology and the other is the amount of storage capacity and error. I mean, you get one Adam or two wrong and all of a sudden instead of your cat named cocoa, it's now named Boko and then you're not the same person.

Speaker 1:          11:22          No, that's not true. In fact, because every time you hit your head on a cabinet, you're actually killing lots of neurons, but that doesn't change who you are. You don't miss remember your cat's name. I mean, imagine that you changed one word in, in the novel, Moby Dick. It would still be Moby Dick. It'd be more almost Moby Dick. It would be almost Moby Dick. But, but you are almost the same person day to day and you're never exactly the same person that you were yesterday because of the small changes in your brain. But let's imagine that you're right, despite Robert's objection not imagining, let's just say you stick to the Hubris of this. What would you actually do with a xerox brains to be immortal? Don't you have new car? No, no, no, no. But I mean you seen his own life. No, no. But what, which, how would you interface with a xerox brain? So the idea is if we can recreate a brain in zeros and ones on a computer, then you could actually live inside of a virtual world and you could enjoy living in this world indefinitely. Or like the scarecrow

Speaker 7:          12:30          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          12:30          If I only had a brain, he, he didn't have a real brain. He had straw and a certificate. Well, you don't actually know that you have a real brain either, right? One, there are, there are modern philosophers who deal with this in a very, in a real way. They ask, how would we know if we are a simulation? Why would we die if we were a simulation? He's not going die. Ah, well, so this, this is the point of my book. Some is to illustrate that there are lots of possibilities out there. Right here it comes with you, interrupt you because you're about to become immortal. So there, there are many different stories written here and some of them, God is actually a married couple that got separated and then reunited or that God is the size of a microbe eight. Did we say eight or is it nine? I think it was nine, I think were eight. Um, ineffable. Another story by David Eagleman and his books, some read for us again by actor Jeffrey tambor

Speaker 8:          13:34          when soldiers part ways at war's end, the breakup of the platoon triggers the same emotion as the well, the death of a person. It's the final bloodless death of the war. The same mood Hans actors on the drop of the final curtain after months of working together, something something greater than themselves has just died after a store closes its doors on its final evening or a congress wraps its final session. The participants amble away feeling that they were just part of something larger than themselves, something they intuit had a life, even though they, they can't quite put a finger on it in this way, death is not only for humans but for everything that existed and it turns out that anything that enjoys life enjoys an afterlife, platoons and plays and stores and congresses, they don't end. They just move on to a different dimension. Although it's difficult for us to imagine how these beings interact. They enjoy a well this delicious afterlife together. They exchange stories of their adventures. They laugh about good times and often, well just like us, just like humans, they lament how short this thing is brief.

Speaker 9:          14:54          It is.

Speaker 8:          14:56          It may seem mysterious to you that these organizations can live on without the people who compose them, but the underlying principle, it's simple. After life is made of spirits. I mean, after all, you don't bring your kidney or your liver or your heart to the afterlife with you. Instead, you gained independence from the pieces that make you up.

Speaker 8:          15:17          Now, a consequence of this cosmic scheme is going to surprise you when you die. You're aggrieved by all the atoms of which you were composed. Yeah. I mean, they hung together for years, whether in sheets of skin or communities as spleen, but with your death, they don't die. Instead, they, they part ways moving off in their separate directions, mourning the loss of a special time. They share together actually haunted by the feeling that they were once playing parts in something larger than themselves, something that had its own life, something, um, well, they can hardly put a finger on.
