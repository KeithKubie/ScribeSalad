00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.930
We’ve explored the jungles, the deserts,
the arctic, even the moon.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.660
But one place still remains a mostly uncharted
mystery; our oceans.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.599
Oceans cover about 70% of Earth’s surface,
but we know more about the geography of Mars

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.470
than we do about what lies on the bottom of
the sea.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.040
But all that might change.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.500
Around the world people are looking to finally
reveal the secrets of our deep oceans for

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.990
both scientific and economic gains.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.020
So, how close are we to completely mapping
the ocean?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.370
For thousands of years people have taken to
the seas with the goal of finding out just

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.989
how deep our oceans are.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.210
This mainly consisted of tying a weight to
a long rope and throwing it over the side

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.200
of a boat.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.200
This is actually how we discovered the deepest
part of the ocean,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.690
Mariana Trench.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.499
Since then we’ve obviously advanced with
our technology, and have actually already

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:59.079
used satellites to map the entire ocean.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.510
Kind of.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.909
The way that they do satellite mapping of
the ocean, they use altimetry.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.719
As the satellite is passing over an orbit,
if there's a higher concentration of rock,

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:15.320
or sea mounts, or anything that's beneath
the ocean surface, the increased gravity actually

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.330
causes some of the water to collect around
the top of it and they

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.450
can measure the different heights of the ocean
surface.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.470
Using certain algorithms and processing that
data, they can actually get a decent representation

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.750
of what it's like down there.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.079
But decent isn’t good enough.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.240
Satellite mapping only gives us about a 5km
resolution of the ocean floor, meaning we

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.289
can see features and objects larger than 5km
across.

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.310
To put that in context, most of Mars has been
mapped to 6m and almost all of Venus and 100%

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.630
of the moon has been mapped to 100m.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.329
Less than 10% of our oceans, and maybe closer
to 5%, have been mapped to this detail.

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.950
that really is disappointing for a marine
biologist, really disappointing for anyone

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.740
who's thinking about doing business on the
oceans, managing the oceans, thinking about

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.210
how to get what we need from the future of
the oceans...We're sort of fumbling around

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.679
in the dark…

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.400
Having a detailed map would greatly change
how we use the ocean.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.190
It would help with safety, like charting potential
hazards that could take down a ship.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.770
It could lead to more accurate climate models,
better understand tsunami dangers and improved

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.940
weather predictions.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.450
It would help with laying down ocean cables,
fiber optics and pipes.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.840
However, it could also help advance the exploitation
of the ocean’s natural resources, like those

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.170
precious metals used to create your cell phone.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.670
But having a detailed map will help us better
understand how to protect the ocean when the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.502
inevitable rush to further exploit it begins.

00:02:39.502 --> 00:02:45.360
The International Seabed Authority, which
is in charge of overseeing seabed mining on

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.430
the high seas, part of its charge is to set
up some areas of special biological interest

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.330
that will not be mined and putting them in
the right places, in places that matter for

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.980
biodiversity and matter for ocean function,
requires knowing what's down there...so you

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.230
don't mine, for example, a rainforest and
put your protected area in a desert, right?

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.110
So ocean mapping may be this double edged
sword.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.980
On one side, people are trying to map the
ocean to help understand and protect it, making

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.220
geological and biological discoveries along
the way.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.459
Others are trying understand and exploit it,
potentially harming the ocean floor as they

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.459
go.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.180
But these two factions might work together
to achieve a goal that could see both sides

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.820
benefiting.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.520
How do you manage what you don't understand

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.120
We can map out things like manganese nodules,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.800
that have the potential for copper and nickel and cobalt.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.200
We depend on ocean mapping for before any kind of oil explorations done

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.260
they must map the seafloor

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.720
both the surface and the subsurface of the seafloor,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.840
and in this case, here we’re going to get a full understanding

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.360
through mapping what’s there

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.680
and then can set up the appropriate management approaches

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.760
So if everyone wants this map, why hasn’t
it been done yet?

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.150
Well, it’ll cost a lot of money.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.450
and take a lot of time.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.329
Maybe as much as 200 ship years.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:12.390
So with the current day technology, it would
take about 200 years for one ship to map the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.739
whole ocean or 200 ships one year.

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.360
The question is the cost.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.770
We've estimated that to map the entire ocean
at a reasonable level of resolution would

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.030
cost on the order of three billion dollars
and you'd say, "Wow, gee, who would ever spend

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.400
three billion dollars to map a planet?"

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.560
And I point to the fact that we've sent missions
to the moon which cost on the order of 600

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.370
million dollars or so and mapped the moon
much better than we've mapped our planet.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.150
We've sent missions to Mars, many missions
to Mars.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.419
Each one of those missions cost between two
and three billion dollars.

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.330
And so we have the will to do that.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.660
One way to cut down on cost would be to do
it faster, and the good news is that’s the

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.660
plan.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.130
What started as throwing a weight over the
side of the boat has turned into utilizing

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.590
acoustic waves.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.550
By sending hundreds of laser-like beams of
sound into the ocean and measuring how long

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.610
it takes to bounce back, scientists can more
accurately image the ocean depths.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.340
We're also trying to develop techniques to
speed that up, to do it more quickly.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.780
And to do it maybe with autonomous vessels,
vessels that will be more efficient that you

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.470
don't have to have a crew on and send autonomous
vessels out for months at a time and let them

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.120
start collecting the data…

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.970
To put out drones that would go out and do
it autonomously, that's a new forefront that's

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.300
developing at the moment, but that's still
in its infancy.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.460
The amount of drones that would need to go
out to perform this, that's something that

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.650
they're still building on.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.380
So yes, one day in the near future our oceans
may be teeming with underwater drones or crew-less

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.910
ships, crisscrossing the planet, collecting
and sending data that will be transformed

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.690
into a 3D map of our oceans.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.789
Which is another hurdle we still need to figure
out, what to do with all this data?

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:04.820
There's also a major challenge of trying to
mass collect and synthesize this data…

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.300
It's one thing to have the data stored on
500,000 hard drives and 500,000 vessels, but

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.630
you need to get put all together in the same
place.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.789
And one boldly named group, Seabed 2030, is
looking to lead that fight.

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:20.080
The collaborative project between the Nippon
Foundation and GEBCO, is aiming to gather

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.300
all the bathymetric data and produce the world’s
first highly detailed ocean map, and do it

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.310
by 2030.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.750
It's amazing how every time we go out to map
in unknown waters, we find something we didn't

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.099
know about.

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:39.389
It's that kind of discovery and exploration
that really drives at least me in terms of

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:40.389
ocean mapping.

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:43.650
And it’s that passion, along with their
hard work, that has given those in the community

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.270
the ability work with and root for Seabed
2030 and their nearing deadline.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.550
They could certainly use more resources if
they're gonna get close to hitting that goal,

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.020
but I'm gonna go ahead and commit the least
aspiration, I'm gonna hope that they're right

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.759
that we'll have the oceans mapped by 2030.

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:05.099
I think, the global initiative to have it
done by 2030 is going to be quite an undertaking.

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:11.789
It's going to depend on developing technology
and a concerted effort from different players,

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.900
but I'm optimistic and I think it will happen
at some point.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:21.129
We need a detailed map of the ocean to better
understand the ocean, and to do this we need

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:25.860
people, ships, advanced technology, global
cooperation and of course, money.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.440
So, how close are we to mapping the entire
ocean?

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.770
Well, all eyes are on Seabed 2030 and their
goal to have a complete, public map by well,

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:36.990
2030.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.789
We're gonna give it our darndest to do.

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:42.250
It's a very, very ambitious goal.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.520
I'm not sure we will get a hundred percent
there but we're certainly gonna make some

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.600
strides toward that.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.050
So that's our goal is to see it all mapped
by 2030.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.479
