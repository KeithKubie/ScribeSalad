00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.106
Well we know that these two hypotenuses
must be the same.

00:00:04.106 --> 00:00:07.099
This hypotenuse, and this hypotenuse

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.221
were both measured using a length of the string.

00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:12.553
The length of the string is 50cm

00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:17.688
and it hasn't changed since when we created
this triangle from the first triangle.

00:00:17.688 --> 00:00:21.192
We only change the position of the end of the string

00:00:21.192 --> 00:00:23.194
when creating a second triangle.

00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:25.432
So the length of the string didn't change

00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:29.432
so we know these two lengths must be equal.
