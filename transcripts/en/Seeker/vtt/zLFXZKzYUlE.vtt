Drinking on a Tuesday morning DOESN'T MAKE
you an alcoholic, but science is working on

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.320
understanding the thing that does.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.660
Hey everyone!

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.639
Trace here for DNews.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.039
Alcoholism is a downer of a topic, but it's
important to understand how addiction is formed

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.859
and reinforced.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.449
As we've learned more, the idea behind addiction
has changed.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.429
In the early 20th century, addiction was thought
to stem from a lack of willpower, but as medical

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.020
technology advanced and we began to understand
how physiological addiction worked, the idea

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.690
of addiction changed.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.230
The pervading wisdom today is addiction is
created in the brain because drugs, like alcohol,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.330
override the brain's reward center called
the limbic system.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.890
According to the current model, the delivery
of dopamine from the limbic system REORGANIZES

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.710
a healthy brain into a DRUG-ADDLED DEMON BRAIN.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.440
The drug initiates a coup of the executive
function -- people with addiction are physiologically

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.400
unable to abstain from their habit.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.260
Their brain has to get them high.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.190
Most of the literature calls it a hijacking!

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.049
This is where people get the idea of drugs
being SUPER addictive even with only ONE USE.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.420
The problem is, scientifically, there's not
a lot of evidence for this.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.780
In reality, two people could both use heroin
once, and one will go on with their life and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.569
be fine, but the other might seek it out again
and again.

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:30.950
A new study in PLOS One is changing attitudes
even further by finding a small part of the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.389
brain might be a major trigger for addictive
behavior in rats.

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:39.380
The lateral habenula is deep in the middle
of the brain, and when the rats had theirs

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.439
selectively destroyed -- they could no longer
tell if the decisions they were making were

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.359
harming themselves or others.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.399
Basically, they'd lost the ability to feel
the consequences of their actions.

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.039
Rats were given the option to enjoy a 40 proof
alcoholic drink, and water.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.499
They chose the alcohol thanks to the lovely
dopamine wave that comes with being drunk.

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:05.049
But, once they were wasted, they didn't stop
drinking it, they didn't moderate their behavior,

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.579
and once they'd sobered up enough, they went
right back to it.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.060
The researchers believe the lateral habenula
could be responsible for the internal monologue

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.640
for which asks, "How bad was my drinking last
night?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.860
I should back off for a while, I need to make
sure this isn't a problem."

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.220
According to this new study, addiction isn't
solely about the brain's reward center, there's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.540
also an internal moderation of the effects
of that reward.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.540
They're not saying people with a bad lateral
habenula ARE addicts; rather that with more

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.560
information, a genetic profile could be established
and we could tell who'd be in a high risk

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.620
group for addiction!

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.670
That information could help people and their
families make responsible life decisions.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.090
Do you know someone with addiction?

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.090
How have you helped?
