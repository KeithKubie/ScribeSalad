00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:16.090
Prepare for a film that only exists so non-nerds
will recognize the blonde guy in The Avengers.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.510
You’ve seen great superhero films.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.630
You’ve seen terrible superhero films.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.180
Now prepare for a superhero film that’s
just kinda ehhhh.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
I mean I guess they did the best they could
adapting a comic book about a bratty space

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.500
god.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.070
"You are an old man and a fool!"

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.780
Journey to Asgard, the land of viking myth,
where

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.030
everyone gets a pointy hat,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.000
the gods live inside a CGI pipe,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.260
and the only way in or out is through the
Rainbow Road level from Mario Kart.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.739
Meet Thor, the least relatable Marvel hero
since Dr. Strange.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.989
He’s an idiot demigod prince, with a magical
hammer that really needs

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.690
to buy a vowel.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.690
“Mjolnir”

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.690
“Mjolnir”

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.690
“Mjolnir”

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.690
“Mjolnir?

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.690
What's Mjolnir”?

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.430
But Thor isn’t the only god in town...

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.209
Meet Loki, Thor’s evil stepbrother, who
will stop at nothing to betray

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:14.619
his adopted father

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.189
with the help of his real father

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.909
"I will conceal you and you can slay him where
he lies."

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.490
in order to betray his real father

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.909
"And your death came with the son of Odin."

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.610
to impress his adopted father.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.689
"I could've done it, father.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:29.689
For you!"

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.100
Ugh, that makes even less sense than his plan
from The Avengers.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.590
"Not a great plan."

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.509
Meet Odin, Thor and Loki’s dad who pretty
much guarantees that one of

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.930
his kids will grow up to resent the other...

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.869
“Only one of you can ascend to the throne,
but both of you were born to be kings."

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.109
Oh and all of these rejects from Lord of the
Rings, Game of Thrones, and Xena: Warrior

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.459
Princess.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:59.060
Struggle with the former god of thunder as
he’s stripped of his powers and banished

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.719
to these two square blocks in the New Mexico
desert.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.219
There, he’ll acclimate to our strange Earth
customs like...

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.229
ordering in restaurants,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.229
"Another!"

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.229
health care,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.250
"You're no match for the mighty --"

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.580
traffic safety,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.620
and horse purchasing.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.090
"I need a horse!"

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.569
"We don't have horses.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.569
Just dogs."

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.410
"Then give me one of those large enough to
ride.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.620
Watch as Thor turns to Jane Foster for help,
a brilliant astrophysicist with supermodel

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.310
good looks that just happens to be single

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.310
and who immediately falls in love with Thor
for no good reason.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.350
Make that 6 reasons:

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.350
Aaaaabs.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.890
So ride along with Thor as he loses, then
regains, his magic powers,

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.230
hooks up with Jane,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.840
saves two different realms from destruction,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.090
and learns the virtues of patience and humility

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.600
...All over the course of a long weekend.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600
Seriously.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.070
This whole movie takes place over two and
a half days.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.070
Starring...

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.820
Thunder From Down Under

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.070
Lokimon

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.370
The God-Father

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.750
Eye Dress Elbow

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.510
Lord Zedd from Power Rangers

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.500
1 Broke Girl

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.920
and Portmandia.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.430
Thor...’s obligatory movie

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.960
So Loki “dies” at the end and comes back
to life by the ending credits?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.080
That’s gotta be some kind of record.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.310
Hey, Screen Junkies!

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.130
If you like my voice, how about clicking that
big subscribe button then, huh?

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.570
Also: want to see Lucius Fox himself read
The Fox?

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.069
Then click the box to the left to see us waste
Morgan Freeman, Robert DeNiro, Michael Douglas

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.090
and Kevin Kline's time reading dumb stuff.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:46.650
Speaking 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.260
of which...
