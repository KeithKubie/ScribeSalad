Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay. So last time we looked at and played this game, you have to choose grades as you, so you have to choose alpha and Beta. And this table told us what outcome would arise in particular, what grade you would get and what grade your pair would get. So for example, if you'd chosen visa and your pad shows an Alpha, then you would get a c and your path would get an a. And one of the first things we pointed out is that this is not quite a game yet. It's missing something. This has outcomes and it's, it's an outcome may tricks, but it doesn't the game because per game we need to know payoffs. Okay? And then we looked at some possible payoffs and now it is a game. So this is a game is to give you some more jargon. This is a normal form game.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       And here we've assumed the payoffs are those that arise if players only care about their own grades, which I think was true for a lot of you, it wasn't true for the gentleman. He's sitting there now. But it was true for a lot of people. All right, and when pointed out that in this game, Alpha strictly dominates pizza. What do we mean by that? We mean that no, if these are your pay offs, no matter what your pair does, you attain a higher payoff from choosing Alpha than you do from choosing [inaudible]. Right? Let's focus a couple of lessons of the class before I come back to this one lesson was do not play a strictly dominated strategy ever. I remember that lesson and then much later on when we looked at some more complicated payoffs and a more complicated game, we looked at a different lesson, which was this, put yourself in others shoes to try and figure out what they're going to do.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       All right, so in fact, what we learned from that is it doesn't just matter what your pay offs to other. That's obviously important. It's also important what other people's pay offs are because you want to try and figure out what they're gonna do and then respond appropriately. All right, so we're going to return to both of these lessons today, right? Both these bathrooms will reoccur today. Now a lot of today is going to be fairly abstract, so I just want to remind you that game theory has some real world relevance, and again, it's done in the interest of recapping. This particular game is called the prisoner's dilemma. It's written there, the prisoner's dilemma. All right, let's just, it's prisoners, plural, and I, we mentioned two examples last time. Let me just reiterate and mentioned some more examples which actually written here so they'll find their way into your notes.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       So for example, if you have a joint project that you're working on, perhaps it's a homework assignment, or perhaps it's a video project like these guys that can turn into a prisoner's dilemma. Why? Because each individual might have an incentive to shirk. All right? Price competition. Two firms competing with one another in prices can have a prisoner's dilemma aspects about it. Why? Because no matter how the other, from your competitor prices, you might have an incentive to undercut them if both firms behave that way, prices will get driven down towards marginal costs at industry. Profits will suffer in the first case. If everyone shirks you end up with a bad product. In the second case, if, if both firms undercut each other, you end up with low prices that actually good for consumers, but bad for firms, and let me mention a third example. Suppose there's a common resource out there.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       Maybe it's a fish dock or maybe it's the atmosphere, right? There's a prisoner's dilemma aspect to this too. You might have an incentive to overfish. Why? Because if the other countries with this fish stock and see the fish Tacos, the Atlantic, if the other countries are going to fish as normal, you may as well may as well fish as normal too and at the other countries aren't going to cut down on their fishing. Then you want to catch the fish now because there aren't going to be any there tomorrow. Right. Another example of this referral would be global warming and carbon emissions. Again, leaving aside the science about which I'm sure some of you know more than me here, the the issue of carbon emissions is a prisoner's dilemma. Each of us individually has an incentive to it to emit carbons as usual. Right? If everyone else is cutting down item have to and if everyone else does cut down, I don't have to.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       I end up using hot water and driving a big car and so on. Right? In each of these cases we end up with a bad outcome, so this is socially important. It is not just some abstract thing going on in the class and Yale and we know we need to think about solutions to this. Right from the start of the class and we already talked about something, we pointed out that this is not just a failure of communication, right? Communication per se will not get you out of a prisoner's dilemma. You can talk about it as much as you like, but as long as you're going to go home and still drive your hammer and have six 16 hot showers a day, we're still going to have high carbon emissions. You can talk about working hard on your joint problem set, right, but as long as you go home and don't work hard, it doesn't help.

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       All right. In fact, if the other person is working hard or is cutting back on their carbon emissions, you have every, every bit more incentive to not work hard or keyboard high carbon emissions yourself. So we need something more and kind of things. We can see more, we can think about contracts, we can think about treaties between countries. We can think about regulation. All of these things work by changing the payoffs, not just talking about it, but actually changing the outcomes actually and changing the payoffs, right? Changing the incentives, right? And important. Another thing we can do, very important thing is we can think about changing the game into a game of repeated interaction and seeing how much that helps and we'll come back and revisit that later in the class. And one last thing we could think of doing, but we have to be a bit careful here, is we could think about changing the payoffs by education. I think of that as the Maoists strategy, right? Lock people up in classrooms and tell them how to be better people that may or may not work and not optimistic, but at least it's the same idea. What? Changing payoffs.

Speaker 2:          00:06:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       All right, so that's enough for, uh, for recap. I want to move on now and in particular we left you hanging at the end last time we played a game at the very end last time where each of you shows a number. All right? All of you chose a number and we said the window was going to be the person who gets closer to two thirds of the average in the class. Now we've figured that out. We figured out who the winner is and I knew what all of you have or trying to see if you want. Is that right? And I'm going to leave you in suspense. Okay? So I'm going to tell you today, why don't we did figure it out and we'll get there. But I want to do a little bit of work first. All right? So just going to leave it in suspense. That'll stop you walking out early. If you want win, win the prize.

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       So do me, lots of times in this class, when we get to play games, we get to have classroom discussions and so on. But there's gotta be some times when we have to slow down and do some work. And the next 20 minutes are going to be that. All right? So with apologies for being a bit more boring for 20 minutes, let's do something we'll call formal stuff in particular. I wanted to develop and make sure we all understand what are the ingredients,

Speaker 2:          00:07:18       what are the ingredients? All the game.

Speaker 1:          00:07:25       All right? So in particular, we need to figure out what formerly make something into a game and the formal parts of a game of this. We need players. All right? And while we're here, let's develop some notation. So the standard notation, the players, I'm going to use things like little I and little j. All right? So in that numbers game, the game, when all of you wrote down a number and handed it in, at the end of last time, the players were who hires were you, right? You all with the players, right? Useful texts and expression. Meaning you plural.

Speaker 2:          00:08:02       Right? And the numbers game, we give him something more on the here and the numbers game you will with a players. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       Second Ingredient took the game. Ela Strategies. That's a good clue here. If I'm writing, you should be writing. Okay. Strategies. All right, notation. All right, so I'm going to use little s, little SSI to be a particular,

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       can I strategy off player I

Speaker 1:          00:08:44       particular strategy of player I so an example in that game might have been choosing the number 13 all right, everyone understand that? Now I need to distinguish this from the set of possible Spanish is of player I. So I'm going to use capital SSI to be what? To be to be the set, the set, all alternatives. The set of possible strategies.

Speaker 3:          00:09:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:20       Oh, of player I. So in that game we played at the end last time. What were the set of strategies? They were the set one, two, three all the way up to 100 all right. So I'm distinguishing APP ticket, a strategy from the set of possible strategies. And while we're here, I want a third mutation for strategy. I'm going to use little s without an eye. All right? No subscripts, but less without an eye to mean a particular play of the game.

Speaker 3:          00:09:55       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       particular play.

Speaker 3:          00:10:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       Oh, of the game. So what do I mean by that? All of you at the end, last time wrote down this number and handed the man's, we had one number per one strategy choice, pepper for each player and each person in the class. So here they are. Here's my, uh, collected in instead of strategy choices, here's the bumble bits of paper you hand in last time. This is a particular play of the game. All right, I've got you the person's name and I've got a number from each person. A strategy from each person. All right? We actually have it on a spreadsheet as well. So here it is written out in a spreadsheet, right? Each of you, each, your name is on the spreadsheet and the number you chose. All right? So that's a particular player of the game. And that has a different name. We sometimes call this a strategy profile. So you're in the textbook. You'll sometimes see the term a strategy profile or a strategy backdoor strategy list. It doesn't really matter what is saying is one strategy for each player in the game. All right? So in the numbers game, this is the spreadsheet. One example of this.

Speaker 3:          00:11:15       Yes, the spreadsheet, right?

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       How does that make sense? You can still see that I'm going to pull down these boards,

Speaker 3:          00:11:26       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:31       And let me clean something. So you might think what Don, right, we've got a players, we've got the choices they could make. That's their strategy sense. We've got those individual strategies and we've got the choices they actually did make. That's the strategy profile. Seems like we've got everything you could possibly want to describe. Again, what are we missing here? Say shout it out. Pay Offs. We're missing payoffs, right? So to complete the game

Speaker 3:          00:12:00       we need,

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       we need payoffs. Alright. And again, I need to Taishan the payoffs. So in this course I'll try and use you for you tile to be player. Eyes playoff. All right? So you, I will depend on play a one's choice. All the way to play eyes own choice all the way out to play at EMS choices, right? So, uh, plant eyes off the Ui depends on all the choices in the class in this case, including his own choice. And of course a shorter way of writing that would be Ui s it depends on the profile. All right, so in the numbers game, what is, this is a numbers game. Ui of ass can be two things.

Speaker 3:          00:12:49       It can be

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       $5 minus your era in pennies if you won. I guess it can be something as it was a tie went by the writing that now and it's going to be zero otherwise.

Speaker 3:          00:13:07       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       so we've now got all of the ingredients, the game players, strategists, payoffs. All right, now we're going to make an assumption today and for the next 10 weeks or so. All right, so, but almost all the class, we're going to assume that these are known.

Speaker 3:          00:13:31       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       we're going to assume that everybody knows the possible strategies everyone else could choose and everyone knows everyone else's payoffs. Now that's not a very realistic assumption and we are going to come back and challenge it at the end of the semester. But this will be complicated enough to get us a lot of material in the next 10 weeks. I need one more piece of notation and then we can get back to having some fun. So one more piece of mutation. I'm going to write x minus I to mean what it's going to mean a strategy choice for everybody except person I it's gonna be useful to have that rotation around. All right, so this is,

Speaker 3:          00:14:19       this is

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       hey, choice

Speaker 3:          00:14:23       for all.

Speaker 1:          00:14:24       Excellent.

Speaker 3:          00:14:27       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       person I apply. So in particular if you're person one than that and then s minus, I would be s two s three s four up to sn, but it wouldn't include as one. All right. It's useful. Why? Because sometimes it's useful to think about the payoffs. I was coming from his own choice and everyone else's choices. It's just a useful way of thinking about things. All right. Now this one I want to stop for a second and I know that some of you from past experience are somewhat math phobic. You do not have to wave your hands in the air if your math phobic. But since some of you are, let me just get your water, take a deep breath. This goes to people who are math phobic at home, too high. So everyone's like a slight panic. Now you know you came here today, your thought everything's gonna be fine.

Speaker 1:          00:15:20       Now I'm putting math on the board. All right, take a deep breath. It's not that hard. And in particular, notice that all in doing here is writing down mutation. It's actually no math going on here at all. I'm just developing notation and I don't want anybody to quit this class cause they worried about math or math notation. So if you are in that category of somebody who might quit it because of that, come and talk to me. Come and talk to the AES. We will get you through it. All right? It's fine to be math phobic. I'm, I'm phobic of all sorts of things. All right? Not necessarily math, but all sorts of things. All right, so serious thing. A lot of people get put off meditation. It looks scary. That is, there's nothing going on here except for the station at this point. All right, so let's have an example to help us fix some ideas. And again, I'll have to clean the boards. So give me a second. I think an example might help those people who are disturbed by the mutation.

Speaker 3:          00:16:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:23       So here's a game

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       which we're going to discuss briefly. It involves two players and we'll call the players. One. I'm two and play a one has two choices, top and bottom, and play a two has three choices, left center and right. All right. And so spray simple abstract example for now. And let's suppose the payoffs are like this, they're not particularly interesting. We're just gonna do it for the purpose of, of, of a illustration. Here are the payoffs. Five minus 1300640220. All right, let's just map the notation we just developed into this game. Okay. So first of all, who are the players here? Alright, well there's no secret there. The players are just writing down what, wait, why don't we, the players here in this game, our player one and player two. All right, what about the strategy sets? What about the strategy sense or the strategy? Alternatives? All right, so here, player ones, strategy set, she has two choices. Top, well bottom represented by the rows which are healthfully, the top row and the bottom row right? And play a two.

Speaker 3:          00:17:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:58       Has to, Cha has three choices, right? This game is not symmetric, so they have different numbers of traces that spine play. A two has three choices, left center and right represented by the left center and right column in the Matrix. And just to point out, in passing up to now, we've been looking mostly at symmetric games. Notice this game is not symmetric and the payoffs or in the strategies, there's no particular reason why games have to be symmetric and pay offs. All right, so again, this is not rocket science, but let's do it anyway. So just an example of payoffs. So player one's payoff if she chooses top and play a to choose his sensor. We read by looking at the top row and the center column and play a ones pay off is the first of these payoffs. So it's 11. All right. And play a Tuesday off from the same choices. Top four player, one center for player too. Again, we go along the top row and the center column. But this time, which you'd pay a Tuesday, offer to the second pay off.

Speaker 3:          00:19:07       Sorry. It's three. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       All right. So again, I'm hoping that he's calming down the math phobics in the room. Now how do we think this game is gonna be played? There's no particular interesting game at while we're here. Why don't we just discuss it for a second. All right, so if the, if our make guys get a little bit ready here. All right, so how do we think this game should be played? Ah, well let's ask, uh, uh, somebody at random, at perhaps hourly. Do you want to ask, uh, this guy in the blue shirt here, right? Uh, does, does play a one here. Just play a one. Have a dominated strategy.

Speaker 4:          00:19:42       Alright. No player one doesn't have a dominated strategy. For instance, if a player two picks left and player one wants to pick bottom, but if Claire to pick center player one wants to pick center. Good. Very good. I should let

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       you stand up. I forgot that. Never mind. But that was very clear. Thank you. And, and, and was that loud enough? People are to hear it. Do people hear that? People in the back, you hear it. So even that wasn't loud enough. Okay. So we need, we really need to get people to, that was very clear and very nice. Will you want to stand up and shout? All the people at the back can't hear. So what I'm gonna do on your name is Patrick and Patrick said was no play at one does not have a dominator strategy. Top is better than bottom against left cause. Sorry. Bottom is better than top against laugh because six is bigger than five. But top is better than bottom against center because 11 is bigger than zero. Everyone see that? Alright, so it's not the case. That top always beats is not the top, always does better than bottom or that bottom always does better than top. Okay. What about a bit raised hands this time? What about player to just play a, to have a dominated, everyone's keeping their hands firmly down so as not to get spotted here. Should we, we uh, yeah. Should we try a I like can we try this guy and why you want to stand up and wait for and against that and really yell it out now louder

Speaker 5:          00:21:05       I believe right is a dominant strategy because of player one chooses top. Uh, then player two will choose center. And if or I'm getting confused now it looks better on my paper, but yeah, at play, right is never the best choice.

Speaker 1:          00:21:21       Okay, good. Good. Let's be a little bit careful here. So your name is Thomas Thomas. So Thomas said something which was true, but it doesn't quite match with the definition of a domination strategy. What Thomas stayed was right is never a best choice. That's true. That's true. All right. But to be a domination strategy, we need something else. We need that. There's another strategy of a play or two that always does better right now that have turned out to be true in this game, but it's a seat. All right, so in this particular game, I claim that sensor dominates, right? Which center dominates, right? Just to see that if play a one shows top sensa yields free, right? Yield zero three is bigger than zero, and if player one chooses bottom, then center yields to right yields zero two is bigger than zero again. So in this game sensor strictly dominates, right?

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       All right, well what you said was true, but I wanted to tell me specifically about about a domination here. All right, so, uh, what we know here, we know that player to should not shoes should not choose, right? All right. Now that's as far as we can get with dominance arguments in this particular game. But nevertheless, let's just stick with it a second. I gave you the door, I gave you the definition of strict dominance last time and it's also on the handout by the way, the hand out on the web. But let me write that definition again. Using or making use of the mutation from the class.

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       So definition. All right. So player, I play an eyes strategy.

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       Yes. Nicholi prime.

Speaker 2:          00:23:10       All right. Is strictly dominated by play eyes.

Speaker 3:          00:23:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:26       Strategy s Aye.

Speaker 3:          00:23:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       If not, we can use on rotation if you are I from choosing s when all the people choose s minus Pi is strictly bigger than you. I S I prime when other people choose as my, the PSI and the key part, the definition is for all x minus sign.

Speaker 3:          00:23:56       Alright.

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       All right. So just say it in words. Pyre I strategy SEI prime is strictly dominated by her strategy. Ssi. If s I always does split me better. Always yields a higher pay off a player. I, no matter what the other people do answer this is the same definition we saw last time. Just being a little bit more nerdy and putting it in, in some, uh, some notation. Okay. People panicking about that. People look like deer in the headlights yet. No, I'm gonna let you get a correct. Alright. Alright, let's have a look at another example. People, okay, I can move this.

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       All right. So it's not a slightly more exciting example now. So, uh, imagine the following example. An invader is thinking about invading a country and there are two ways that would have two passes if you like, through which he can lead his army and you, you are the defender of this country and you have to decide which of these passes or which of these routes into the country you're going to choose to defend. And the catch is you can only defend one of these two routes, right? It's if you want to a real world example of this, think about the third century BC and can someone can correct me afterwards. I think if the third century BC, when Hannibal is thinking of crossing the Alex, right? Not Hannibal, Hannibal Lecter Hannibal, the general in the third century BC, the one with the elephants. All right. Okay. So the key here is going to be that there are two passes.

Speaker 1:          00:25:34       One of these passes is a hard part that goes over the Alps and the other one is an easy pass. It goes along the coast. All right? If the invader chooses the hard pass, he will lose one battalion of his army simply in getting over the mountains. Something going through the hard past. Alright, add. If he meets your army, whichever party chooses, if he meets your army defending a past, then he'll lose another battalion. All right, I'll, I haven't given you, I've given you roughly the choices. The choices are going to be for the attacker, which to choose and for the defender, which pass to defend. But let's put down some payoffs so we can start talking about this. Why you in this game, the payoffs for this game, I'm going to be as follows, such a simple two by two game. This is going to be the attacker. This is Hannibal and this is going to be deep offender. And I forgotten which general was defending and someone's about to tell me that dam and there are two palaces. You could defend the easy pass or the hard pass on. There's two of you could use to attack through easy or hard. And again, easy past here just means no mountains. We're not talking about something on the New Jersey turnpike.

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       So the payoffs here,

Speaker 3:          00:26:54       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:26:55       are as follows, and I'll explain them in a second.

Speaker 1:          00:27:00       All right, so here's pay off. The attacker's payoff is how many battalions that he get to bring into your country. He only has two to start with. And for you, it's how many battalions of his get destroyed. So just I just give an example. If he goes through the hard pass and you defend the hard pass, he loses one of those battalions going over the mountains and the other one cause you meet you. So he has none left and you find it just dropped to destroy two of them, right? Conversely, if he goes on the hard past and you defend the easy past, he's going to lose one of those battalions. Or how have one left? You lost it in the mountains. But that's the only one who's going to lose because you were defending the wrong past. All everyone understand the payoffs of this game?

Speaker 3:          00:27:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:44       All right. So now imagine yourself has a Roman general, hi, this is gonna be a little bit of a stretch of imagination, but imagine yourself as a Roman general. And let's figure out what you're going to do. You're the defender. What are you going to do?

Speaker 3:          00:27:57       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:27:58       so let's have a show of hands. How many of you think you should defend the easy pass? Raise your hand. Just raise your hand. Soap, soap. So Jude can see the, keep them up. Weigh them in the air, but emotion right in the air. What your flags. Okay, because these are the Romans defending the easy pass. And how many of you think you're going to defend the hard pass? We have a huge number of people who don't want to be Roman generals here. All right, let's try it again. No abstentions, right? I'm not going to penalize you. Get in the wrong item set. All right, so how many of you think are going to defend the easy pass? Raise your hands again and how many think you're gonna defend the hard pass? Hi, we have a majority choosing. Easy Pass. I had a lot. A large majority.

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       So what's going on here? Is it the case? Is it the case that defending the easy pass dominates defending the hard pass? Is that the case? Is the case that pending the easy pass dominates defending the hot pass. You can shout out, no, it's not in a facts and facts. We could check that at the attacker attacks through the easy pass. Not surprisingly, you do better if you defend the easy pass on the hard pass, one versus their sorrow. But if the attacker was to attack through the hard pass, again, not surprisingly, you do better if you defend the hard pass down the easy pass. All right? It's, that's not hot. Not, not an unintuitive a finding. It isn't the case that he defending easy dominates defending hard. You just want to match with the attacker. Nevertheless, almost all of you chose easy. What's going on?

Speaker 1:          00:29:29       Can someone tell me what's going on? Let's get the mics going a second. So can we catch the guy with uh, uh, yeah. Can we catch this guy with a beard? If we'll just wait for the mic to get there. And if you could stand up, stand up, stand up and up and shout. There you go. Because you want to minimize the amount of, uh, an, uh, of enemy soldiers that reach Rome or whatever the location is. All right. You want to minimize the number of soldiers that reach Rome. That's true. On the other hand, we've just argued that you don't have a dominant strategy here. It's not the case that easy dominates hard. What else could be going on while we've got you out? What do we get the other guy who's got his hand up there and the metal and again, stand up and shout on that Mike points your Facebook might get.

Speaker 5:          00:30:08       Um, it seems, it seems as though, uh, while, while you don't have a, you don't have a dominating strategy, it seems like Hannibal is, uh, is better off attacking through. It seems like he would attack through the easy pass.

Speaker 1:          00:30:23       Good. Why does it seem that, I guess that's, that's right. We're on the right lines now. Why does it, why does it seem like he's going to talk for the easy pass?

Speaker 5:          00:30:29       Well, if you're not defending the easy path he got, he doesn't, he doesn't lose anyone. And if he attacks through the the hard pass, he's going to lose at least one battalion.

Speaker 1:          00:30:38       All right? All right, so let's have a look at it from, let's do the exercise. Let's do the second lesson by emphasizing the beginning. Let's put ourselves in Hannibal shoes. That probably boots or something. I had no wait. Whatever you do in your writing an elephant, whatever you were, all right, let's put ourselves in the Hannibal shoes and try and figure out what Hannibal's going to do here. All right, so it could be it from the animal's point of view, he doesn't know which parts you're going to defend. All right? But let's have a look what happened. Look at, look at his payoffs. If he, uh, if you were to defend, if you were to defend the easy pass and he goes through the easy pass, he will get into your country with one battalion. And that's the same as he would have got if he were, if he went through the hard parts.

Speaker 1:          00:31:21       So if you defend the easy pass from his point of view, it doesn't matter whether he chooses the easy pass, he gets one in there or the hard pass, he gets one in there. But if you were to defend the hard past, if you were to defend the mountains, then if he chooses the easy pass, he gets both battalions in and if he chooses the hard pass, he gets new battalions in. All right, so in this case, easiest better. And we have to be live at careful. It's not the case that for Hannibal easy choosing the easy pass to attack through strictly dominates choosing the hard pass. But it is the case that there's a week notion of domination. Here it is the case of new introducing jargon. It is the case that the easy pass for the attacker weekly dominates the hard pass for the attacker. What do we mean by weekly dominates? It means by choosing the easy pass he does at least as well. And sometimes better than he would have done had he chosen the hard pos. All right, so here we have a second definition. A new definition for today

Speaker 1:          00:32:33       and again we can use our jargon definition.

Speaker 3:          00:32:37       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:32:38       player. Oh eyes

Speaker 3:          00:32:39       strategy.

Speaker 1:          00:32:44       Yes. I prime is weekly dominated by her strategy as I, if I'm going to take advantage of annotation, if player eyes payoff from choosing s I against s minus sy is always as big as all equal to her pay off from choosing s I prime against s minus I and this has to be true for all things, but anyone else could do. And in addition player eyes payoff from choosing s I against as minus side is strictly better than a payoff from choosing sia prime against s minus PSI for at least one thing. Whatever else could do. Fine. So just check. That's exactly corresponds to the easy and hard thing we just had before. I'll say it again, play I strategy sie prime is weekly dominated by our strategy. SSI, if she always does at least as well by choosing Sei than choosing us. I prime regardless of what anyone else does and sometimes she does strictly better.

Speaker 1:          00:34:14       All right. And it seems a pretty powerful lesson that just as we said, you should never choose a strictly domination strategy. You're probably never going to choose a weekly dominated strategy either, but it's a little more subtle. All right. Now that definition, if you're worried about what I've written down here and you want to see it in words on the handout I've already put on the web that has the summary of the first pass, I included this definition in words as well to compare the definition and words with what's written here in the nerdy notation on the board. Right now, since we think that Hannibal, the attacker, is not going to play a weekly dominated strategy, we think that Hannibal is not going to choose the hard pass. He's going to attack on the easy pass. And given that which should we defend, we should defend it easy, which is what most of you shows. So be honest. Now was that way. Most of you chose easy. Yeah, probably was right. You might be able to read this. All right. So by putting ourselves in Hannibal shoes, we could figure out that his heart attack strategy was done that was weekly dominated. He's going to choose easy, so we should defend easy. Having said that, of course Hannibal went through the mountains, which kind of screws up the lesson but too late now. All right, now that I promised you we'd get back to the, the uh, the game from last time.

Speaker 3:          00:35:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:37       All right, so what do we want where we got to so far on this past, we know, we know from last time that you should not choose a dominated strategy and we also know with probably aren't going to choose a week. You don't need to strategy. And we also know that you put yourself in other people's shoes and figure out that they're not going to pay off strongly, strictly or weekly dominated strategy. That seems a pretty good way to predict how other people are going to play. So let's take those ideas and go back to the numbers game from last time. Now before I do that, I don't need the people at home to see this. But how many of you were here last time? [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:36:13       I asked the wrong question. How are you were not here last time? All right, so, uh, we handed out again that game we ended out again the game with the numbers, but just in case, let me just read out the gate. The uh, the game, you play it, this was the game you play without showing your neighbor what you're doing. Put it in the box below a whole number between one and 100. We will in fact have calculated the average number chosen in the class. And the winner of this game is the person who gets closest to two thirds times that average number, they will win $5 minus the difference in pennies. All right, so everybody filled that in last time. And I have that choice is here. So let's just before we reveal who won, let's discuss this a little bit. That'd be come down. Houses have to be off the stage. I'd figured out it's got the mix up about a second. Let me get some mics ready. All right. So, um, let me find out some people here and see what people did a second. Or you can be honest here since I've got everything in front of, in front of me. So how many of you chose some number? Like a 32 33 34?

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       Actually, I tell you, wait, nine of you did. So should I read out the name if I embarrass people? All right, so, so, uh, our, we've got Lynette's uh, liquor. Hussan we've got Christian bargin. Is that, there's nine of you here is try to get, how many of you, how many of you chose numbers between 32 and 34? Yeah. Okay. So if you're not a number, you don't know these things. Some hands up. All right? Just keep it, keep your hands up a second. Even hot headed up there and those people. All right, so let me ask people why we're here. Can we, can we can, we can, can you get their hand into the guy? What's your name? If we get him to stand up, stand up a second and shadows the cost me. Hey, what's your name? Chris. Chris, you're on this list somewhere.

Speaker 1:          00:37:58       I'm you're not in this lifetime. I know. Mine. What did you choose? I think I chose 30 okay. 30 is, that's pretty close. Okay. So why did you choose 30 cause I thought everyone was going to be around like the 45 range cause 66 is two thirds or right around of a hundred and then we're going to go two thirds less than that. And I did one less than that one. All right. Okay. All right, so let's look at that. Thank you. Let's get one of the others are, there was another one in here. Can you just raise your hands again? The people who are silver rounds 33 34 the somebody in here. Can we get you to stand up and who you are between Mike said. Yup, go ahead, shout it out. What's your name? Festival. Ryan. Ryan, I must have you here as well. And if mind, what did you choose? 33 or 33 are you, did you are Ryan low? You are around. Okay, this is good. Go ahead.

Speaker 5:          00:38:47       I thought similar to a Chris actually and also thought that if we got two thirds and everyone was choosing numbers in between 100 and up 33 would be around the number.

Speaker 1:          00:39:00       All right, so just just to repeat the argument that we just heard, again, you have to shout out more than, I'm guessing people didn't hear that in the room. So let me repeating to make sure everyone hears that. And reason for choosing a number like 33 might get, might go as follows. If the people, if people in the room choose randomly between 100 then the average is going to be around 50 say and two thirds of 50 is around 33 33 in the third free. All right, so that's a pretty good piece of reasoning. Alright, what's wrong with that reasoning? What's wrong with that? What's wrong that can we, uh, can we get the guy or the woman in the striped shirt here? Yeah. Yes. I'm sorry. We have not a woman for a while so can keep, even if everyone else had the same reasoning as you, it's still going to be way too high.

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       All right, so, so in in particular, if everyone else had the same reason as you, it's going to be way too high. All right? So if everyone else reasons that way, then everyone in the room would choose a number like 33 or 34 and in that case, the average would be what? Sorry. Uh, so the average we have just to show that two thirds of the average would be, would be what? Something like 22. All right. So the flaw in the argument that crest and Ryan had a little bit, it isn't a bad argument, it's a good starting point. But the floor in the mistake, in the argument, it was the first sentence in the arguments. The first sentence in the argument was if the people in the room shoes or random, then they will choose around 50 that's true. The problem is the people in the room arm's going to choose at random.

Speaker 1:          00:40:35       All right? Look around the room a second. Look around yourself to any of you look like a random number generator. Actually from here I can see something to do. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna put all right. All right. All right, so I'm actually looking at some of your answers. Maybe some of you are right on the whole Yale students are not random number generators. They're trying to win the game. All right, so the unlikely to choose numbers at random, right? If they, we also further arguments if in fact everyone thought that way and if you figured out everyone was going to figure out, cause I'm gonna think that way, then you would expect everyone to choose a number like 33 and in that case you should choose a number like 22 how many of you raise your hand a second. How many of you chose numbers in the range? 21 to 23 there's way more than you than that. I'll start reading you out as well. The actually about 12 of you raise your hands is 12 she'll be 12 hands going up somewhere. There's two, three hands going up. Four, five hours ago, there's actually 12 people who chew, who chose exactly. 22 so can sort of be more if we include 23 and 21 all right, so those people, I'm, I'm guessing, I'm guessing we're thinking this way. Is that right? Let me get one of my 22 is up again.

Speaker 3:          00:41:49       Me.

Speaker 1:          00:41:49       All right, so here's a 22 is when, but we want to get this guy. So what's your name sir? Stand up. Stand up and shout Brian. Yup. And you chose 22 I chose 22 because I thought that most people would play the game dividing by two thirds a couple of times and give numbers averaging around the low thirties all right. All right. So do you think people are going to play a plucking away in particular? If you think people are gonna choose the strategy of Ryan and Chris and choose around 33 then 22 seems a great answer, but you underestimate your Yale colleagues. You undress me all y'all can wax and fax at 22 was was was way too high. That's way too long. All right, now again, let's just, it's right. The point here is, it's a repeat the point here. The point here is when you're playing a game, you want to think about what other people are trying to do to try and predict what they're trying to do.

Speaker 1:          00:42:48       And it's not necessarily a great starting point to assume that the people around you are random number generators. They have aims trying to win and they have strategies to, let me take this back to the board a second. So in particular, are there any strategies here we can really rule out? I said we're not millionaires. We said already people are not random. Are there any choices we can just rule out? We know people are not going to choose those traces. Uh, let's have someone here. We have the guy in, in, in green on his weight weight fairly that, yup. Great. Stand up. Give me your name. Uh, my name is nick and shout it out to we. We're going here. Uh, no one is going to choose number over 50 notes, which is number 50. Okay. I was doing that. That's a, that that actually got it. Okay. That's fair enough. Some people did.

Speaker 1:          00:43:38       That's fair enough. I wasn't going to get a little bit then. That's fine. I just don't think only a little bit less ambitious. Somebody said 66 somebody said 66 so let's, let's stop analyzing this. All right, so in particular, this is something about these strategy choices that are great, sir, that are greater from 67 at any rate. All right. Certainly, I mean a 66 I said, let's go up a little bit. So these numbers bigger than 67 what's wrong with numbers? Bigger than 67 what's wrong? Raise your hands. Governance. That what's, what's wrong? You're gonna get the, the guy in red is right close to the mic. Stand up. Give me your name. Stand up, shout it to the crowd and Peter. Yep. And if everyone chooses a hundred it would be 67 all right, good. So even if everyone in the number, everyone in the room, didn't she just randomly, but they all chose a hundred a very unlikely circumstance.

Speaker 1:          00:44:45       But even if they ever want to chose hundred the highest the average could. Sorry, the highest two thirds of the average could possibly be is 66 and two thirds, hence 67 would be a pretty good choice in that case. So numbers bigger than 67 seem pretty crazy choices, but crazy isn't the world isn't the word I'm looking for here. What can we say about those choices, those strategies? 6,706 a bigger than 67 68 and above. What can we say about those? Choices are to the authority right behind him. Right behind you. Shout it out. No pay offs. They have no payoffs. What? What's the jargon here? It's, let's use our jargon. Somebody shout it out. What's the jargon about that? They're dominated. All right, so these strategies are dominated. Actually, there are only weakly dominated, but that's okay. They're certainly dominated, right? In particular as strategy, like AC is dominated by choosing 67 right?

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       You will always get a higher up a payoff from choosing 67 at least as high and sometimes higher than the payoff you would have got had you chosen 80 no matter what else happened in the room. So these strategies are dominated. We know from the very first lesson of the class last time that no one should choose these strategies that dominated strategies. All right, so did anyone choose strategies bigger than 67 okay, I'm not going to read out names here, but turns out four of you did. And I'm not going to make your way here. Okay. All right. So okay, for the four of you did, nevermind, nevermind. But well, yeah, mind actually. Yeah. All right. All right. So once we've eliminated, once we've eliminated the possibility that anyone in the room is going to choose a strategy bigger than 67 it's as if these numbers 68 through 100 are irrelevant.

Speaker 1:          00:46:40       It's really is. If the game is being played where the only choices available on the table are one through 67 is that right? Is that right? We know no one's gonna choose 68 and above. So we can just forget them. We can delete those strategies. And once we delete those strategies, all that's left are choices one through 67 all right, so can somebody help me out? Now what? Can I come out? What can I conclude? No, I've concluded that the strategy is 68 through 100 essentially don't exist or have been releases. What can I conclude? Uh, let me see if I got a mic in here. That's a stamp. Stand up. Wait for the mic and he comes to the right. Good shout out. Then all strategies 45 and above are this also ruled out. Good. Good. So your name is Henry. Henry is saying, once we've figured out that no one should choose a strategy bigger than 67 then we can go another step and say if those strategies never existed, then the same argument rules out or similar arguments, rules out strategies bigger than 45 let's be careful here.

Speaker 1:          00:47:48       The strategies that are less than 67 bought but bigger than 45 is that your strategies are not. They are not dominated strategies. In the original game in particular, we just argued that if everyone in the room shows a 100 then 67 will be a winning strategy. So it's not the case that the strategy is between 45 and 67 our domination strategies, but it is the case that they're dominated. Once we delete the dominator strategies, once we delete 67 and above. All right, so these strategies to be careful here, the word weekly, yet these strategies are not

Speaker 6:          00:48:32       weekly dominated in the original game.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       Bye Bye. Oh dominated

Speaker 6:          00:48:48       weekly dominated once we delete 68 through 100

Speaker 1:          00:49:02       to all of the strategies, 45 through 67 are gone now. So okay, let's have a, let's have a look. Did anyone choose? Raise your hands. Be Brave here. Did anyone, did anyone choose a strategy between 45 and 67 1446 and 67 no one's right now, but I know some of you take, cause I've got it in front of me, right? So these four of you did, and I won't read out those names yet, but I might read them out next time. Okay, so the four, four more people shows those strategies. All right? Now notice there's a different part of this, this argument, the argument that eliminates strategies 67 and above, or second 68 upwards fat strategy. Just involve the first lesson of last time. Do not choose a dominator strategy. Admittedly weak here, but still. All right? But the second, uh, the second slice strategies, 45 through 67, getting rid of those strategies involves a little bit more. You've got to put yourself in the shoes of your fellow classmen and figure out they're not going to choose 67 and above essentially the first argument. That's a straightforward argument. The second argument says, I put myself in other people's shoes. I realize they're not going to play a dominated strategy. And therefore having realized they're not going to pay a dominant strategy, I shouldn't play a strategy or between 45 and 67. So this argument is an in shoes argument.

Speaker 6:          00:50:33       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       now what? Where can we go now? Yeah. So let's have the guy in the beard, but let me the might get him, uh, all right, and yell out your name. Uh, Carter, you just repeat the same reasoning again and again and eventually get down to one. All right, well let's, let's, let's, we'll do that, but let's go one step at a time. So now we've ruled out the possibility that anyone's going to choose a strategy 68 from the bottom because they, we could dominate is, and we've ruled out the possibility that anyone's gonna choose the traffic between 46 and 67 because those strategies, because those strategies are dominated once we've rolled out the dominant strategies. So we know no one's choosing any strategies. About 45 it does. If the number is 46 and above don't exist. So we know that the highest and anyone could ever choose is 45 and two thirds of 45 is roughly someone help me out.

Speaker 1:          00:51:20       They're 30, right? Roughly 30. All right. So we know that all the numbers between 45 and 30, these strategies were not dominated and they weren't dominated even after leading the dominator strategies. But they are dominated once we deleted, not just the nominated but, but also the strategies that were dominantly wants. We deleted the dominated strategist. All right, I'm not gonna try and write that, but if you try and write it in your notes. All right, so without writing that argument down in detail, notice that we can rule out the strategies 30 through 45 not by just examining our own payoffs, not just by putting ourselves in other people's shoes and realizing they're not going to choose a dominant strategy, but by putting ourself in other people's shoes while they are putting themselves in someone else's shoes and figuring out what they're going to do. All right, so this isn't in shoes per capita where we are here. This isn't

Speaker 6:          00:52:20       Jane shoes in shoes, arguments.

Speaker 1:          00:52:24       At which point you might want to invent the sock. All right? Now where's this going? Because we were able to tell where it's going. We were able to rule out 68 and above. Then we're able to route 46 and above. Now we're able to rule out 31 and above. All right? By the next slice down, we'll be able to eliminate a, what is it about 20 and above. All right, so 30 down to above 20 and this will be an [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:52:53       in shoes, in shoes, in shoes, right?

Speaker 1:          00:53:00       These strategies aren't dominated, nor are, they don't want you to beat the dominant his strategies nor we donated the trashes dominated once we clean them on his tragedies, but they are dominated a bunch. We delete the structures of the dominate in the neck. You get what I'm doing? Okay. All right. So where does this argument going to go? Well, where's his argument going to go? It's gonna go all the way down to one. We all the way down to one. We could repeat this argument. We're down to one notice, but once we've deleted the dominator strategies, we know I, I'd said before about four people chose the strategy and in here about four people chose their strategy, but in this range, 30 through 45 I had lots of people. Lots. How many of you chose a number between 30 and 45 all right. The more than that and your guarantee you more than that.

Speaker 1:          00:53:46       Matches number two, put that in 45 all right. In fact, the people who chose where we started off that e three chosen that right? I had a lot more of you chose numbers between 20 and 30 so we're really getting into the, the, the, the meter, the distribution here. We're seeing that these are choices that perhaps are ruled out by this kind of reasoning. All right? Now I'm still not going to quite reveal yet who won? I want to take this one. Just one step more abstracts. All right, so I want to just discuss this a little bit more. I want to discuss the consequence of rationality in playing games slightly first offical for a few minutes. All right, so I claim that if you are irrational player, by which I mean somebody who's trying to maximize that pay offs by that play of the game, that is simply being rational.

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       Just being a rational player moves out playing these dominated strategies. All right. So the four of you who chose numbers bigger than 67, his name is, I'm not going to read out. Maybe they were making a mistake. Alright. However, however the next slice down requires more than just rationality. What else does it require? Ah, yes. Okay. Can I, can I get this guy again? Sorry. Shout out your name again. I forgot net. Nick shackle that nick. Yep. Uh, the assumption that your opponents are being rational as well. Good. Good. So to rule out the second slice, I need to be rational.

Speaker 6:          00:55:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:20       Myself and I need to know.

Speaker 6:          00:55:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:27       But others are rational.

Speaker 6:          00:55:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       Alright. That's a legible. But then my, what it says is rational and knowledge that other people are rational. Now how about the next slice off to that? Well, now I need to be rational. I need to know that other people are rational and I need to know that other people know that all the people are rational. All right, so to get this slice, let's get this next slide here. I need rationality as some of you know, that's widely criticized and the social sciences these days, I'll be right to assume that people are rational. But to get this slice, I need rationality. I need knowledge of rationality that's called that k are, am. I need knowledge of knowledge of rationality. All right? How's I go down to further? I'm going to need rationality. I need to know people that are optional. I need to know that people know that people are rational. And I need to know the people know that people know that people.

Speaker 2:          00:56:27       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:56:28       And let's just make this more concrete for you. These people, these people, the four people who chose this, they made a mistake. What about the four people who chose numbers between 45 and 67? What can we conclude about those people? The number of the people who chose between 45 and 67 so I read out their names.

Speaker 2:          00:56:51       No, I want, perhaps I've had to know what can we can talk about the people.

Speaker 1:          00:56:56       Yeah. Uh, we're never gonna make it. Let's try and get them making their come forward as far as you can. And then it really shattered. Their classmates are pretty dumb, right? Right. It's not necessarily that the four people who chose between 46 and 67 are themselves thick. Instead, they think the rest of you are thick. All right? And down here, this doesn't require people to be thick or to think the rest of you or think they are just people who think that you think, sorry, that just people who think that you think that that ethic. Alright, and so on, and again, all the way to one, we're going to needs very, very many rounds of knowledge, of knowledge, of knowledge, of rationality. Does anyone know what we call it? If we assume an infinite sequence of, I know that you know that. I know that you know that. I know that you know that. I know that you know something.

Speaker 2:          00:57:44       What's the expression for that? 10 believe it or not. Technical expression.

Speaker 1:          00:57:50       Tandem, especially with that in philosophy is common knowledge. Common Knowledge. Chicken never spell. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna win. All right. Common Knowledge. Common knowledge is, I know something. You know it. You know that I know it. I know that unit. I know that, you know, the, I know it, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. Infinite sequence.

Speaker 2:          00:58:10       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:58:12       All right. But if we had common knowledge of rationality in this class, then the optimal choice would have been one. How many of you chose one? Look around on the roads. There's paneling over, like keep your hands up a second. How many of you chose one? So actually a lot of you chose one. One was the modal answer. In this class, a lot of good shows weren't. All right. So those people did pretty well. They must've done, you know, they must be thinking they're about to win,

Speaker 2:          00:58:45       but they didn't win.

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       So it turns out that the average in this class, the average choice was about 13 and a third, which means two thirds of the average was nine. Two thirds of the average was nine. And some of you chose nine. So if you are here, stand up, uh, the following people choose nine. Um, that's not right. Whether the people who shows nine, I've got one here somewhere. Sorry. There's so many pages that people, here we go, the following people shows nines who stand up if you're here. Uh, and uh, if you're that person's roommate or they're not here. All right? So leashing Chang, at least in Shanghai here. Stand up. You're here. And Christopher [inaudible], Christopher Bharara who can stand up if you're here and, uh, William official, are you here? I don't know if he's here at Jed. Click or you hear jetpack Stein and Jeffrey Green. Stand up if you're here and Allison heights, then I'll put you here. No, Aspen Heights. Okay. And perhaps add theirs. And John Robinson. John Robinson. All right, so these people, these people want him to come. We get to that. Can we get good at that? Up to the camera. Can see you. There you go. There you go. Then all the way around and around wave. Wave to mom at home. All right, can we get a round of applause for our winners?

Speaker 3:          01:00:01       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       so jade has, has, uh, trustworthy brought back the $5. I've got to focus for a second just to get it here is the $5. We're going to tie this into nine pieces, except I get arrested and deported. They do that. So we're going to find a way to break this into change later. Okay. And come and come and claim it afterwards. All right, but you're on, you're on title or whatever. Whatever, whatever that fraction, whatever that fraction of $5. All right. Okay. So why was this after all that work? Why was it that one wasn't the winning answer? Why wasn't one the winning arcs? Let's have some where we haven't had before. Can we? Uh, um, we got the mic in way in the backpack. Got Mike and they told you on the road you're on. See if you can put, actually, yeah, you're good as stand up, shouts, stand up, shower, go, shied away.

Speaker 7:          01:00:53       Uh, when would have been the winning answer? Loud. Louder one would've been the winning answer had. Um, everyone assumed that the, the average would have been constantly compounded down to one. But since a couple of people chose the, I mean, not incorrect answers, but the higher averages, they,

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       let's push that to 13. So to get all the way. Good. So to get all the way. Thank you. So get all the way to one. We need a lot, right? We need not just that you're all rational players, not as you know each other's rational, but you knew everyone else. Restaurant. I mean, I know you will know each other cause you made at Yale, but you also know each other well enough to know that not everyone in the room is brash on, you're pretty sure that not everyone knows that you're rational and so on, so forth. Right? So it's wrong. It's asking a lot to get to one here. And in fact, we didn't get to one. It had been previous years we were even higher. This was the low, that's where the low, this year, in 2003 the average was 18 and a half. And in 2004 it was 21 and a half.

Speaker 1:          01:01:45       And in 2005 we had a class that didn't trust each other at all. I guess because the average was 23 all right. And this year it was 13 a third. Okay. We're getting better there, I think. All right. One Nice thing. By the way, this is just chance. I think the media announcer in the class was nine which is spot on to the median. Hit this, hit this, bang up. All right, now what I want you to do is I want you all to play again. We haven't got time to do this properly, even though I've given you this, the sheets, so write down, but don't tell us your neighbors. Write down a number.

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       Don't talk about yourself. That's cheating right down a number. If you haven't got a sheet in front of you, just write down on your notepad. Write down a number. Has everyone written down a number? All right, I'm going to do a show of hands now. How many [inaudible], right? Well guys, we'll get the camera on you. How many of you chose a number higher than 67 Oh, there's the spoil makers. They're not. Okay. How many of you chose a number? Higher than 20 how many of you is a number higher than 10? How many times a number between five and 10. How many of you choose a number between zero. Which I between one and five.

Speaker 2:          01:03:02       All right.

Speaker 1:          01:03:04       How many of you, excluding the people who chose one last time, how many of you chose a number that was lower than the number you chose last time?

Speaker 2:          01:03:11       I keep your hands up a second. All right,

Speaker 1:          01:03:15       so almost all of you came down. Why? Why are we seeing this massive contraction? I'm guessing the average number in the class now it's put about three or four, maybe even low, right? Why are we seeing this massive contraction in the numbers being chosen? The woman in greening, I forgot your name. I'm sorry.

Speaker 2:          01:03:35       Told us we're not being rational if we pick a high number.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       All right. All right, so part of it is you yourselves have figured out some of you that you shouldn't choose a high number, right? What else though? What else? What else is going on here? Let's get somebody, uh, um, there's, there's a guy waving his arm out value. You want to stand up behind the hat?

Speaker 2:          01:03:55       Hi. Yeah, yeah, Yup, Yup, Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       Because we've repeated the game. It's true. We repeated it, but it's true. We repeated it. But one of what is it about repeating or what is it about talking about this game that makes a difference? I mean has it the here. I think what makes the difference is not only do you yourselves know better how to play this game now, but you also know that everybody around you knows better how to play the game. Discussing this game raise not just each person's sophistication, but it raised what you know about other people's sophistication. And you know that other people now know that you understand how the play the game. So the main lesson I wanted to get from this is that not only does it matter that you need to put yourself in other people's shoes and think about what their payoffs are. Huh? You also need to put yourself into other people's shoes and think about how sophisticated are they at playing games.

Speaker 1:          01:04:54       And you need to think about how sophisticated do they think you are playing games and you need to think about how sophisticated do they think that you think that they are playing games and so on, right? This level of knowledge, this, these, these layers of knowledge lead to very different plan the game and to give it, make this more concrete. If a firm is competing against a competitor, it can be pretty sure that that competitor is a pretty sophisticated game player and knows that the firm is itself. If a firm is competing against a customer, let's say for a non prime loan, perhaps that assumption is not quite so safe. It matters. It matters and how we take gain through to the real world and we're going to see more of this as the term progresses. Now I've got five minutes. Do I have five minutes left?

Speaker 1:          01:05:40       I've got, so I've got five minutes to district. A little small aside here. We've been talking about knowledge and about common knowledge and I just want to do a very quick experiment to everyone stay in their seat. I'm going to get two TA's up here. I want to get la and and uh, and up here and we're going to sh I wanted to show that common knowledge is not such an obvious a concept as I've made against him on the board. Come up on stage a second. You can leave the mic. It's okay. All right. Here we have two of our tas actually is the two head TA's and I want you to face forwards. You don't see what I'm doing exactly. Okay. All right. I'm about to put on their heads a hat. All right. All right, here's a hat on his head and here's an a hat on Kaiser.

Speaker 1:          01:06:28       It's moving this way so they're in focus. All right. Now you can all see these hats and they can see that and if they turn around to each other, they can see each other's have. All right. Now I want to ask you the question here. Here is the facts. All right, so is it, is it common knowledge? Is it common knowledge that isn't common knowledge that at least one of these people has a pink hat on their head? Is it common knowledge? So I claim it's not common knowledge. What is known here? Well, I'll reveal the fact that you've now that in fact Allie knows that Chi has a pink hat on his head. So it's true that Allie knows that that is one person in the room has a pink capital in their head. And it's true. That kind knows that Allie has a pink hat on his head.

Speaker 1:          01:07:21       They both look absurd, but never mind. But gnosis that Allie doesn't know the color of the hat on his own head. Right. So even though both people know, even though it is mutual knowledge, that there's at least one, perhaps pink cat, uh, in the Roman lay doesn't know what kind of seeing. So Allie does not know that Chi in knows that there's a pink hat on the room. In fact, from audience point of view, this could be a blue hat. So again, they both knew that someone in the room has a pink hat on their head. It is mutual knowledge that there's a fee. There's a pink hat in the Roman, but Allie does not know that. Kind of knows that he's wearing a blue or a pink hat, and Chi does not know that. Allie knows that Kai is wearing a pink hat. Each of our hats, each that own hats might be blue.

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       So notice that. Common Knowledge. Thanks guys. Common Knowledge is a rather subtle thing. Thank you. All right, come on. Now. There's a subtle thing. Mutual knowledge doesn't imply common knowledge. Common knowledge is a statement about not what I know it's about what do I know the other person knows that I know that the other person and so on and so forth. And even in this simple example where you might think it's all vs become a knowledge, it wasn't common knowledge because there was a pink hat on the road. Does anybody have a smaller siblings or children or their own? They can have a pink cat at the end of the class. All right, we'll see you on Wednesday.
