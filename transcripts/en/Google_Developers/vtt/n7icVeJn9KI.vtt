RETO MEIER: Hi.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.574
I'm Reto Meier for
"The Developer Show."

00:00:03.574 --> 00:00:05.740
This is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.330
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.450
The second annual
TensorFlow Developer Summit

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.720
was held on March 30,
and, as you could predict,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.860
it was awesome.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.040
But don't worry if you miss
the event or the livestream.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.780
This post has all
the highlights,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.910
including how we're
making TensorFlow easier

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.610
to use, work on more
languages and platforms,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.350
and how we're expanding
the community resources.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.856
"The Dev Show" crew
was also on site

00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:29.980
to interview some speakers.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.350
So watch for those
videos coming soon.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.920
D8 is the next
generation dex compiler

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.210
that runs faster and
produces smaller dex

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.780
files with equivalent or better
run-time performance, when

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.060
compared to the
historic compiler.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.850
And D8 is now the
default dex compiler.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.850
To learn more, including
the deprecation plan for DX,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.930
take a look at the post.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.810
The Google Fonts catalog now
includes Korean web fonts

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.760
for those of you working with
the Hangul writing system.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.060
To learn more about these fonts
and the Google Fonts API, head

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.720
for the post.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.239
Last year, we
introduced MobileNetV1,

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.550
a family of general
purpose computer vision

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.770
neural networks, designed
for the mobile devices

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.650
in mind, to support
classification, detection,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.710
and more.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.990
MobileNetV2 is now available.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.830
And it's a significant
improvement over MobileNetV1,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.570
pushing the state-of-the-art
for mobile visual recognition,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.840
including classification,
object detection,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.970
and semantic segmentation.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.670
Links to the TensorFlow-Slim
image classification library,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.850
collaboratory, Jupyter
Notebook, and GitHub repo

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.460
are all in the post.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.170
Cloud Functions
for Firebase helps

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.600
you build backend
functionality for your app

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.060
without worrying about
managing servers.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.180
Version 1.0 of the Cloud
Functions for Firebase SDK

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.340
is now available, with
frequently requested

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.480
improvements for the
development, testing,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.450
and monitoring of functions.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.480
More details are in the post.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.870
GitLab and Google Cloud recently
announced a new integration

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.707
of GitLab and Kubernetes Engine.

00:01:57.707 --> 00:01:59.790
You can now connect your
Kubernetes Engine cluster

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.660
to your GitLab
project, and then use

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.640
it to run your continuous
integration jobs

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.860
and configure a complete,
continuous deployment

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.160
pipeline, including previewing
new changes live and deploying

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.750
them into production.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.820
Getting started
instructions and screenshots

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.340
are all in the post.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.620
Logging and monitoring
are the cornerstones

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.140
of network and
security operations.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.420
They let you identify traffic
and access patterns that

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.490
might present security
or operational risks

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.500
to your organization.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.750
We recently introduced
VPC Flow Logs,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.030
which increase transparency
into your network

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.650
and allow you to
track network flows,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.230
all the way down to an
individual virtual interface

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.290
in near real time.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.700
A flowchart and screengrab
are in the post.

Thanks for watching.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.650

such tongue twisters.
