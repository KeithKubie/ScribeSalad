00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.259
We are at the [diamond] [light] source just outside Oxford in England

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:11.400
[we're] here for the next week or so [to] do an experiment and we are standing in the synchrotron right now

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.480
You can see it all around [I]

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.080
Think that [one] is a particle accelerator

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.049
Where electrons are circulated around put in a roughly circular or a pretty well circular trajectory?

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.959
Very very very close to the speed of light. We are not so much interested on like Particle physicists

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.130
We're not so much interested in the particles of themselves what we are interested in for our

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.819
experiments is the fact that when you take a charged particle like an electron and

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.659
Circulate it very very close to the speed [of] light or accelerate it very close to speed of light

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.460
What it does is it gives off?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.480
What's called synchrotron radiation. So this is radiation that goes all the way from infrared up to very very hard very very [high-energy]

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.149
X-Rays and we as condensed Matter physicists solid-state physicist nano scientists

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.409
Whatever you want to call us what we are most interested in is harnessing that light

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.189
Shining it onto a sample and learning about what the atoms and molecules

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.368
And that sample are doing we walk around is there's a sort of hissing noise

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.149
And the hissing noise comes from nitrogen gas now because of this very bright light that we have it's very very focused

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.779
But it can get quite hot so we are standing right above. What is called Beamline eyes zero name

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.369
What's a beam line? Well? You have the electrons circulating around. How do you get the light out well?

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.949
What happens is you have tubes funnels

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.509
through which the light travels and also as you can see

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.769
Us going off into the distance you might be able to see this in terms of just coming off

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.000
tangentially to the to the ring

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.279
We're on the surfaces and interfaces line just here just down here and we will be collecting that light

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.850
Coming from those electrons and shining it onto our sample down in this experimental hatch down here

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.169
So to get beam time you have to like anything in science

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.610
you have to write a grant proposal you have to get the time you have to get the funding for the work and

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.109
We wrote that proposal quite some time ago almost a year ago now

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.050
So we were hugely excited when we got the time and they were hugely excited to be here to actually be able to exploit this

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.110
Synchrotron radiation

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.180
So what we're looking at here is obviously we need to have optics to get this light down

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.420
But this isn't optics these are X-Ray optics

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.480
And we need to be able to get those x-rays onto our sample to focus them down the synchrotron is about 10

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.939
billion times Brighter than the sun

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.670
So this is an immense engineering challenge with very very clever people doing this work

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.410
To ensure that we can get that those very bright x-Rays and get them on to our sample

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.069
so that [the] Tube you can see

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.909
Coming down here is actually the tube that is carrying the beam [to] [our] to our chamber, and it's also a high vacuum

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.949
So it's a pressure comparable to that you get on the surface of the moon the electrons are not [allowed] to the electrons are basically

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.979
Circulating away over there what [we're] what is coming down

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.980
This Tube is the light generated by those electrons, and that's going to come into or similarly ultra high vacuum chamber

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.799
We're going to have those x-rays and they're going to impinge on our sample

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.549
And then we're going to find out wonderful things about our particular molecule

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.569
We're in the experimental hochberg

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.789
This is where we actually do the experiments and the light actually comes in through this Tube here

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.690
And then we're going to chase out through the tumors ETc some more optics some

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.980
very tips of

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.519
Diagnosis, and then we're coming all along all along

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.649
Into our experimental chamber here. It's an ultra high vacuum Chamber [Stainless-steel]

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.920
Pressure in here very very low again comparable to the surface of the moon and our sample sits in there

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.479
So the beam is coming into our chamber, and it's going to the beam is going to hit our sample

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.030
And it's going to eject the electrons out and we want to measure the energies at which those electrons come out

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.019
It's actually something called the photoelectric effect which it wasn't for a relativity that Einstein won. His nobel prize

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.139
It was actually for the photoelectric effect something called photon emission

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.109
that's what we're doing here one part just one part of what we're doing here photons in, electrons out and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:18.630
Every material has [its] own signature in terms of its photo emission spectrum, so this is our electron energy analyzer this wonderful

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.430
hemispherical analyzer

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.590
and it's literally called a hemispherical analyzer and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.010
The way we measured the energies [of] the electrons is that we have a couple of spheres in here, and we put a voltage on

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.209
those spheres and then what we do is we [clear] off the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.349
centripetal

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:41.999
Force on the electrons against that that voltage so we play off the centripetal force against the electrostatic force and

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.669
only those electrons that I've got the right and

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.669
Kinetic energy the right speed are actually going to make it through and then we vary the voltages and we can collect a spectrum that

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.360
way

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.360
Precisely, that's exactly what it does. It's an energy pencil. So it it allows us to detect how many electrons

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.700
We've got of a certain energy all these different arms

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.700
you can see

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.349
It's also allowing us to move samples around in vacuum without

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.279
Breaking the vacuum and so we can use these arms to move the sample around

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.139
What they're doing over here? What Sam's doing at the moment is sorting out?

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.109
The the important aspects that this experiment [let] me tell you about the experiment

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.190
We're going to do so this is the [molecule] were interested, and it's a absolutely fascinating molecule

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.750
It's a [C60] it's [a] what's called a Buckminsterfullerene

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.489
We've got a single water molecule, and this is made. We don't make this we're not half clever enough

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.990
We are physicist  we are not clever enough to do this. This is made by our colleagues in Southampton

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.400
They do something called molecular surgery they open up a hole in the cage

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.370
they drop a water molecule in and then they seal up the hole just with wet chemistry it's

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:54.539
Phenomenal the water molecule is trapped within the kids. It's in kids its incarcerated within within this molecule

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.509
Why is that interesting [well] first of all you've got a single water molecule not interacting with any other water molecules

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:06.839
[this] is not something you find very often in nature the C60 is about a nanometer across once you confine

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.410
Molecules once you confine atoms and once you confine particles to small spaces

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.289
That's when you start to see very interesting quantum effects

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:20.789
What we're really interested [in] is can we exploit those effects when we take this molecule and put it down onto a surface

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:28.469
And the first question to ask is when you put it down onto a surface and the cage bonds to the surface does the molecule

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:32.489
Inside does the water molecule feel the effect of the surface

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.970
Or is this just like a faraday cage does it completely screen it out

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.059
So that [the] water molecule doesn't see the surface there are a number of different things

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.280
We do both up the first is to exploit this photoelectric effect this photo emission effect photons come in

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.400
We excite electrons out [of] the oxygen and we can look at the spectrum [of] those

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:54.839
Electrons to work out, what's happening with the water molecule? Where do we get those photons?

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.829
Well we get them from the [beamline] why do we need the beamline and why is a synchrotron?

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.919
Why don't we just do this with an X-Ray source back in Nottingham?

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.198
Why don't we do [it] in a lab the great thing about a synchrotron?

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.199
Is that you can tune the photon energy?

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:12.060
across a very wide range in this case from hundred Electron volts of the killer Electron volts that's a

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:20.669
Remarkable tool because we can tune in on [particular] parts of the spectrum and work out what's going on the challenge of this experiment?

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:28.139
it's a really fun experiment to do is we take a silver surface which everybody is busily preparing at the moment and

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:33.538
We're going to put our molecules down onto that surface the first challenge is how do we get the molecules down into the surface?

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:39.479
well what we do fortunately would [C60] we can take it as a powder, and that's how we

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:46.500
guess we get about a milligram of these molecules at the black powder we put it into an oven it's literally an oven and

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:48.930
We [bolt] [it] [onto] the chamber

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.870
We heat it up and the molecules very nicely

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:58.470
Sublime they go directly from the solid phase to the gas phase and they stream off as a beam of molecules

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:02.429
They hit the surface and they stick and if we do that in just the right way

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.259
It's [taking] us a bit of time to work out just

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:08.339
What that [right] way is what if we do it in just the right [way]?

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.889
Then you can get a nice ordered film an ordered mono layer a single layer of molecules on the surface

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.030
Then we take a beam of photons

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:22.169
They come in and we look at the electrons of a given out by the water we also interested actually in the kids itself

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:24.179
So we also look at the electrons coming out from the carbon

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.739
That's the first stage of the experiment, but [actually] the technique. [we'll] use in here

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.849
in parallel

00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:37.979
And a real advantage of this particular beam line because it can do this technique. It's something called X-Ray standing with analysis and that's

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:45.479
That is a fascinating technique and here's where my lack of a crystal comes into play what we do is. We have a crystal

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.779
There's [a] surface of a crystal. We have planes of atoms

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:55.919
What we have here is our beam coming in now if we tune our photon energy of [our] beam

00:08:56.589 --> 00:09:02.489
To something called the Bragg Condition right what that means is if we get the wavelength of our beam?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:08.099
So it's the right is the same size as the spacing of the crystals well half of the crystal planes

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.380
What will happen is that the beam will get diffracted?

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:16.169
So we have a beam coming in here, and we have a beam diffracted which comes back out

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.930
and when those two beams interfere

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:25.050
What happens is we get to get something which is called a standing wave it's pretty well exactly what happens on a guitar string you

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:30.300
get a standing wave [set] [up] [on] a guitar string in terms of the interference of [travelling] waves on a guitar string and

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.520
Now the great [thing] is if we have our molecule at the surface

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.300
We have this standing wave field which has got a periodicity

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.250
It's a weird so it's got a periodicity the molecule bears in this

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.609
Wave that's the best way of thinking about it. You've got the molecule

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:52.740
Which is sitting in this wave field and if you change the energy of the incoming beam

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.419
just a little bit what you can do is you can tune the Maxima and minima you can shift them back and forth [and]

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.890
By shifting them back and forth you shift them back and Forth through the oxygen

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:09.859
And then what happens is if you look at the electrons coming out from the oxygen you will see a characteristic profile

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.730
depending on where the

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:18.740
Water molecule is sitting with respect to the surface planes the reason we're doing all [of] this is to find out where in the kids

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.490
The molecule is sitting and moreover

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:25.820
We're not even restricted to those planes what we can do is you can rotate our sample and we can triangulate?

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.030
the position after we do the same thing again and

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:35.270
Triangulate the position of a single molecule within the cage we have done some preliminary work [were] fairly confident

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.710
It's going to be sitting fairly close to the key to the center of the cage which is

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:47.090
Relatively surprising because when these molecules when the fullerene molecules go down onto the surface, what happens is was charged

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.200
from the silver surface

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.530
Electrons go into the molecule bonds are quite strong bond and yet the water just sits in the middle of the kids [well]

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:58.579
I don't care what seemed seemingly does it seems to be completely screened from its environment

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:04.070
Which in terms of actually being able to exploit this effect to be able to look at those?

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.960
That water molecule explode in a device for example is really [quite] interesting

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.609
Good luck Tim [laughing] they are going to turn on the beam we will be fried we will absolutely be fried

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.390
You're looking into the chamber absolutely

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:25.159
so you're looking into the preparation one of the preparation chambers this thing coming down with the bellows is a

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.210
Manipulator that allows us to move the sample up and down. You've got all these various

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.089
What are called feedthroughs?

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:35.359
Which allow you to feed electrical signals in and out from [the] sample for example to heat it for example or to measure the temperature?

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:41.060
Of the sample the windows are obviously obviously this is a wonderful invention called a leak valve

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.119
It allows you to leak in very very small [quantities] of gas

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.200
And that's what we need to do to prepare our sample. What we do is

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:55.429
We bombarded with argon ions business is happening here in [terms] of the measurement is happening and over here in these chambers over here

00:11:55.430 --> 00:12:00.349
That's where the beam yeah in terms of where the beam hits the sample and here is going to our analyzer

00:12:00.839 --> 00:12:03.949
This large cylindrical Tube. This is [our] analyzer

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.300
Thank you

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.100
for 10 weeks

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:19.370
[I] think I guess yeah by 10 weeks since we did the beam time so we've done some analysis

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:24.529
And when I say we I'm using the royal way, I must admit. I have not been heavily involved with the analysis. It's been driven
