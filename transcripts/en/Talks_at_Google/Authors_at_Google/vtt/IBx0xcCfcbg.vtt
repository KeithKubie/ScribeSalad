&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Okay folks welcome to today's
Authors @ Google session where we've got Alex

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:33.210
Bellos who's going to tell us about some Adventures
in Numberland. So it's really great to have

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.210
you here Alex.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.720
Little bit of an intro: Alex studied mathematics
and philosophy at university but he started

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.030
his career as a journalist. And I read with
great interest in the intro to the book, so

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.460
eventually moving to Rio as the Guardian's
South American correspondent and he's since

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.750
presented a five-part series on Brazil for
the BBC called Inside Out Brazil, and his

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.750
short films about the Amazon have been broadcast
on the BBC and lots of other channels like

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.089
More 4and Al Jazeera. He's written other books,
and one of these I was particularly excited

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.400
about, so he's written a book called Futebol,the
Brazilian Way of Life, and the one I was particularly

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.010
excited about ghost written PelÃ©, The Autobiography.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.940
And today he's gonna tell us about some of
the ideas in his latest book Alex's Adventures

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.190
in Numberland which you all have a copy of.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.550
So Alex it's great to have you here and I'll
hand over to you.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.140
Alex Bellos: Thank you it's great to be here
in --

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.140
[applause]

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.010
in Sir James park near Victoria. See I'm Alex
Bellos and I write about maths. And not a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.540
lot of people write about maths 'cause I think
right from kind of school age we're sort of

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.910
divided into people who are kind of the maths
numbers people and the words kind of literature

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.640
people. And I think that's a false dichotomy
and I think that we need to be much more aware

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.250
of the fact that sort of maths and science
is actually part of our cultural heritage

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.610
just as well, just as much as our scientific
heritage.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.960
And in this spirit, here's a conundrum for
you, which links both numbers and words and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.260
it is: if all numbers were listed alphabetically,
what number would come second? Now normally

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.650
I'm at literary festivals talking to kind
of literary folk and they never get it. It's

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.430
actually quite simple and for you guys to
be here you probably had to do this famous

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.739
kind of Google questions which are really
difficult. So this far too easy so I'm gonna

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.819
add an extra thing. I want the answer in French.
[chuckles] So I'll get the answer at end of

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.819
the talk.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.079
Now I qualified as a journalist but before
that I was a mathematician. So when I came

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.650
to write about maths I started to write about
it as a journalist, so really as if I was

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.260
a foreign correspondent in the world of numbers.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.769
And being this foreign correspondent, I traveled
sort of back in time to tell the history of

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.639
maths. I also made geographical journeys,
so I went all around the world and I spent

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:47.079
a year or so going around the world and I
went to Japan, which we'll get into later,

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.760
I went to India, I went to France, went to
Germany, always trying to meet people whose

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.170
lives bring out maths in some interesting
way.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.200
I went twice to the States but I went across
the West Coast, the Midwest, I went to the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200
East Coast.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.579
For instance I went to St. Louis, Missouri
to meet the president of the American Dozenal

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.150
Society who's campaigning to introduce two
new digits to our 10 digit system, decimal

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.390
obviously, so you would count one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, dek which

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.760
is a single digit, el which is a single digit,
and then dough which would be one zero. And

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.569
that was interesting and he actually uses
that in his work doing architectural drawings.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.290
So obviously if you go up to 12 you can divide
into 3 and 4 much easier than you can if you're

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.290
decimal.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.050
I also went to Reno, Nevada to meet the man
who sets the odds for most of the world's

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.989
slot machines, 'cause most of the world's
slot machines come from one company based

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.819
in Reno and there's a chief mathematician
there whose job it is to make sure that all

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.739
the maths is correct. And so that's a great
way of kind of bringing why maths is relevant

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:00.769
and also the history of probability really
begins with gambling so it's interesting to

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:01.769
go and speak to someone who is on the kind
of cutting edge of gambling.

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.719
And also I went to Scottsdale, Arizona to
meet Jerome Carter. And the reason I went

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:17.520
to meet him is that he is a modern day Pythagorean.
And Pythagoras is the most famous name in

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:25.480
maths. Pythagoras is also the oldest real
person, as in Adam and Eve didn't exist or

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.750
just ideas that maybe they did, but the person
who we learned at school who's the oldest

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.390
living person we know definitely existed is
Pythagoras. And this is kind of interesting

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.160
because surely the oldest living person we
should be studying maybe in history, but no.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.160
Pythagoras is really before anyone we really
learn in history.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.220
Pythagoras is famous in maths for the theorem
that bears his name, the square of a, for

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:51.540
right angle triangles the square of the hypotheses
is equal to square of the other two sides.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.270
Turns out Pythagoras probably didn't invent
this, certainly is was known before him and

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.000
the earliest proofs come from China.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
[pause]

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.040
Also if you kind of look into what he was
and what he did it's a fascinating story that

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.540
he's a little bit like kind of Jesus in the
sense that he was a spiritual and religious

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.340
leader who didn't run anything himself but
over the following centuries had lots and

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.600
lots of people write about them and kind of
raise them to this sort almost divine figure.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.620
And that's essentially why several hundred
years after he died he was sort of most attributed

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.220
the Pythagorean Theorem because he was the
guy who kind of made maths mystical.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.610
And that's what I find fascinating when I
was researching Pythagoras is that he's both

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.141
the earliest name in maths and responsible
for maths, but really what he did was he invented

00:05:45.141 --> 00:05:52.920
anti-maths 'cause he thought that numbers
were not just numbers, did not just represent

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.000
quantifies but also represented qualities.
So two was feminine, three was masculine,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.810
and five was the union of them both so the
most spiritual number.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:08.190
And this mysticism that we really can sort
of date back to Pythagoras as influential

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:15.440
as his sort of mathematical legacy. So and
also sort of Gematria which came afterwards,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:22.740
the Masons all kind of has this sort of Pythagorean
basis. In fact the Masons is essentially modeled

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.020
on the Pythagorean Brotherhood which was this
sort of cult like group where Pythagoras lived.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.820
So the reason why went to see Jerome is that
he is a numerologist. You go to him, you pay

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.120
lots of, thousands of dollars and you tell
him what you're called, you give him your

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.310
date of birth, and he will advise you based
on the numbers. And I don't believe anything

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.960
he really said apart from one thing which
was, "Most fortune tellers are poor, that

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.140
makes no sense."

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.140
[laughter]

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.711
Which is true [chuckles] and he's not poor
and he gets money from being the sort of number

00:06:56.711 --> 00:07:00.950
clairvoyant. So he said that he advised Puff
Daddy to become P. Diddy and then just become

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:08.650
Diddy and he was paid thousands for that.
He also advised people like Mike Tyson, Jay-Z,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.740
and he has spent all his money on motorbikes
and has this kind of trophy wife, this sort

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.740
of amazing condo.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.230
And I thought, "Well if this was expensive
maybe I could get some advice it'd be pretty

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:24.420
good." So I said, "Okay I'm called Alex Bellos,
good name bad name?" And he said, "Well what's

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.200
your real name on your birth certificate?"
I said, "Well it's actually Alexander." And

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.790
he went, "Hum. You might be quite successful
as Alex but not half as successful as you

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:42.111
will be if you change your name to Alexander."
I said, "Why?" And he said, "Come on, one

00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:46.410
of the greatest men in the history of civilization
was not called Alex the Great."

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.410
[laughter]

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.890
And so I thought that's not a mathematical
reason and then he actually showed me, he

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.510
wrote down all the numbers and R is a very
good letter to end a name with and X is a

00:07:53.510 --> 00:08:00.930
terrible name to end a name with. So I actually
thought in my book about maybe changing my

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.639
name to Alexander Bellos, but then actually
people might start to think that I actually

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.230
believe in this and I have been criticized
for sort of giving people like this too much

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:12.290
space in the book. But actually I think all,
anything that encourages us to think about

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:18.020
numbers in any way at all is all good.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.020
[pause]

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:26.330
Numerology talks about magic numbers and spiritual
numbers and lucky numbers. Three especially,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:33.050
three is the magic number. Now three is a
magic number, three is very special and if

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:38.370
you think about it, why do we always want
to know the top three? And why in the pageant

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.740
places are there just three? Why not the name
of the top two or the top four? Just so you

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.550
know you're in the school playground you don't
say, "What are your nine favorite bands?"

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:55.730
It's either gonna be top 3, top 5, top 10,
top 100. It's obvious why 100, 10, and 5 are

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:01.880
numbers that we like to round up to because
it makes anatomical sense. But why three?

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:08.670
Well three is the largest number, it's the
largest grouping that we can understand without

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:15.480
thinking. And this leads on to the science
of numerical cognition which is essentially

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.110
the science of staring at dots and working
out how long it takes you to work out how

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.420
many numbers of dots. So the simplest experiment
numerical commission which has been done for

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:30.290
decades is just this: I show a dot to someone
who's wired up to like a timer and I say,

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:37.261
"How many dots?" And the person will say,
"One." Instantly you say one, instantly you

00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:40.370
say two, instantly you say three, you don't
instantly say four there's a little delay

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.890
and it goes on and that's like 25, you'd never
get that instantly.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:45.890
[laughter]

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.490
But the moment that you start to actually
have to count rather than something where

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:55.320
it is subitized is four. So why is this interesting?
It's interesting culturally.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:02.170
So this is contemporary Chinese, ancient India,
and ancient Rome. Because one, two, and three

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:07.830
we instantly see without counting it's one,
two, or three they're perfectly good as symbols.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:13.710
Whereas because four, we have to count them,
it's a terrible symbol. So there are other

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:19.230
symbols and this is, I've just chosen three
but there are other, writing isn't the word,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.460
it's exactly the same.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.920
Now I was giving this talk once in this sort
of grand kind of room and there was a great

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.291
antique clock like right there and it was
in Roman numerals and as I looked up I thought,

00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:37.110
"The four was IIII," just completely contradicting
what I was saying. But actually I kind of

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:42.900
knew that and the Romans did, sometimes, put
IIII on their clocks because position tells

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.580
you what time it is you don't actually need
to read the number and that would be for aesthetic

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:52.110
reasons. And whereas at the beginning of Rome
they did use IIII, towards the end of the

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.000
Roman Empire it was always IV.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.779
Now let's look back at India. So about one
and half thousand years ago in some parts

00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:05.960
of India this is the symbols for one, two,
three, and four. And just imagine you are

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.910
writing that without taking your pen or whatever
they used in ancient India off the paper you

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:16.160
get that which is the origin of the digits
we use today. So even though we call them

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.840
Arabic numerals they actually got to the Arab
lands from India. We should call them Hindo-numeric

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.560
numerals.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.110
But the reason why we use Hindo-numeric numerals,
why that we use the system that came from

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:35.390
India isn't because of this sort of funny
little trick, it's because of the number zero.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.940
So the joke is, "What did India give the world?
Nothing." Well,

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:40.940
[laughter]

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.960
actually giving the world nothing, the mathematical
zero, was probably the greatest conceptually

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:52.020
possibly in all of mathematics. It permitted
arithmetic to be done by sort of the common

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:58.410
man, it really meant that quantitative science
could begin. And actually it made sort of

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:03.899
arithmetic and numbers really be part of maths
because the Greeks didn't have the zero so

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:08.500
basically Greek mathematics it's just, it's
all visual, it's all geometric.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.850
So being a journalist I thought zero came
from India I need to go to India to try and

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:17.300
find out why, one and a half thousand years
too late. So I went to meet this guy here

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:24.390
who is the Shankaracharya of Puri who is one
of the most spiritual men in India; one of

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:29.220
four Shankaracharyas he has a temple one in
each of the north, south, east, and west,

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.350
his is in the east and millions and millions
of people follow him.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:38.660
And it was quite difficult to get an interview
with him to talk about numbers and maths.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.440
He actually has published some books on maths
and numbers. But when I did it was fascinating

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:52.040
so I went there to Puri in the Bay of Bengal
and was told because you're going to meet

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.270
him in a spiritual place you can't speak English
to him you can only comm, he can't communicate

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:00.420
in anything but Hindi even though he speaks
fluent English." So I had to go, which is

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:06.460
quite a good trick. So I had to go and speak
to the disciple in English, then he would

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.970
translate it into Hindi, then it would come
back then come back to me.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:14.330
So this is, it's kind of like Chinese whispers:
I would say something very simple, "How is

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:19.130
maths linked to spirituality?" And then he
would translate it into Hindi, it's like kind

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:24.190
of learning about geometric progressions,
five times longer than [chuckles] what I'd

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:28.120
originally said thinking, "strange why it's
so much longer in Hindi?" Then he would reply

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.520
taking about 10 minutes to reply and then
the reply being translated to me was about

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.790
20 minutes. It was a huge amount of time so
I actually had to go and see him four times

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.160
and each time the sessions went on for hours
and I would just say this one question [laughs]

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.940
and it would come back and I realized that
I was getting absolutely no answers at all

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.940
from this.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:51.500
And actually to try and get kind of a rational
reason in a sort of spiritual context is completely

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:57.440
the wrong way to go about it. And so I just
started like zoning out and sort of staring

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:03.130
at him. And I learned a little bit about,
he wears the same saffron robes every day.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:08.540
He eats the same curry every day, it doesn't
have any spices in it to be kind of as bland

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.290
as possible. In his room he has no possessions
and what's funny is when you meet him, you

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.630
give him gift, but as soon as he gets a gift
he just gives it to someone else. So if you're

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:21.160
lucky to be sitting, there was maybe 100 of
us sitting having an audience with him, gradually

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.190
you'd sort of fill up with goodies because
anyone comes and gives something he just gives

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.190
them straight back.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:33.830
And it was just contemplating this that I
realized that he, himself, is sort of embodiment

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:40.230
of zero, of nothingness. It's all about realizing
that Nirvana is a state of nothing, it's nothing

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.560
so that having nothing is actually having
something.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.779
And the reason why zero was invented, the
mathematical zero was invented in India, is

00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:53.520
that it was a mathematical interpretation
of what was a metaphysical idea.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.630
And I've talked about how we got one, two,
three, and four. The symbol for zero which

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:03.270
comes from India, I mean I used to think as
a kid, "Why zero, zero's sort of nothing,

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:07.279
it's like a hole made with nothing in it."
That's completely to misunderstand the point.

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:11.930
Zero is the eternal cycles of the faces of
heaven, just kind of infinity and also zero.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:17.380
And it's this sort of spiritual idea linking
infinity and zero and something that's a nothingness

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:24.150
which is why the Indians, India was the culture
where mathematical zero first appeared.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.610
As well as mathematical zero first appearing
in India, this recently appeared. It's the

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.589
first zero currency note and I thought it
was absolutely fantastic --

00:15:30.589 --> 00:15:31.589
[laughter]

00:15:31.589 --> 00:15:37.839
and I don't know if they realize the mathematical
history of India. But the reason why the Zero

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:44.330
Rupee Note was invented, is there's lots of
corruption and so an NGO printed loads of

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:50.070
these notes so that if you want to be bribed
you just give someone Zero Rupee Note like

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.130
make a point.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:16:02.190
Now our numbers come from India about one
and a half thousand years ago, that's where

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.681
the zero's invented in the sort of the system
that became ours. Before that there were numbers,

00:16:04.681 --> 00:16:07.580
there were Roman numbers and there's Greek
numbers before then, and Phoenician numbers,

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:13.980
way back to the first numbers. And the first
numbers are about 6,000 to 8,000 years old

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:20.760
and emerged in Sumeria in Sumer which is now
in present day Iraq.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:27.630
They emerged because people needed ways to
count things without actually just using a

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.860
one to one correspondence say with like pebbles
or stones. So just say you were, or notches

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:38.560
on wood. So just say you were a shepherd and
you had 50 sheep. Before numbers, there's

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.589
no way of saying you've got 50 sheep apart
from maybe having 50 pebbles in your pocket

00:16:43.589 --> 00:16:48.720
or a staff with 50 notches on it. And then
they thought, "Well why don't we make these

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.450
little clay pieces," they didn't think this,
this sort of emerged. They're these clay pieces

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:59.260
with different patterns on and each pattern
referred to a different amount. So just say

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.420
you had 50 sheep you could make this pattern
say, "Well this is how much I've got." So

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:08.699
it was much easier for keeping track of your
stock and also for doing trade. And that really

00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:12.900
--. And those were the first things that you
can call numbers which is a system of words

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.209
and symbols for numbers.

00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:19.089
And what's interesting, as well as being the
first time that words and symbols were used

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:24.980
for numbers, it's the first of any scripts,
so all literature or any of the Western writing

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:32.730
systems emerged from these first kind of Sumerian
accountants really developing this system.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:36.130
Now before they had the system, humans would
be able to tell the difference between one

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:40.340
thing and two things it's just that we didn't
have the words, the abstract nouns and the

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.070
symbols for one and two.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:47.270
So what is it that numbers bring us 'cause
most people think, "Well numbers they're so

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:53.160
natural they must have been here sort of forever."
Well now you know 6,000, 7,000 years in the

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.080
history of civilization is really not very
much and they are new and it's because they

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.160
combine two different things.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.160
[pause]

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:07.330
Anyone who's studied sort of the philosophy
of maths or maths will know all this, but

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.010
most people I think are quite surprised they
think that you can't make anything simpler

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.460
than a number, it's obvious what it is. First
of all, you can divide it, it has two separate

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.059
parts, it has cardinality and ordinality,
those are just the sort of long words for

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:14.059
amount and position.

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:23.240
So the cardinality of the number of chairs
in the front row is gonna be five 'cause there

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:29.240
are five of them there. But when I say, "Count
to ten," one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.990
seven, eight, nine, ten I'm not counting things.
So five is literally just what comes in the

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.650
position after four and before six.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:42.820
So I was thinking, "Well how can I bring this
out to sort of explain that it's not obvious,

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:48.049
these are two very different things?" And
then I realized that there are some non-humans

00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:53.300
who have been taught to count and they are
chimpanzees and they're in Japan. And so I

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.450
called up the travel agent and flew there,
flew to Japan to meet these chimpanzees.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:08.670
How do you teach a chimpanzee to count? Well
you have to teach the cardinality of a number

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.670
and the ordinality of a number.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:10.670
[pause]

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:15.679
In the early 80s when Japan was sort of pioneering
in touch screen computers they got a chimpanzee

00:19:15.679 --> 00:19:21.180
called Ai from West Africa and started to
teach her both the cardinality and the ordinality

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.700
using these touch screen computers. And so
it was reward driven: you set a task and if

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:32.390
they get it right they get a bit of food like
shoots down the sides. If they get it wrong

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.470
they don't get the food. So they end up only
wanting to do what gets them food so that's

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:36.470
how they work it out.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.780
And so cardinality what would happen they
would show and sort of say different boxes

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.340
with say different numbers of carrots or colored
pencils in them and they would have to then

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:49.700
tap the symbol for the digit of how many were
currently referring to that. And also visa

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.370
versa, they'd be given a digit say four and
they they'd have a selection of boxes with

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:59.360
different objects in, they'd have to tap the
box which corresponded to number four. Didn't

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.870
take very long for Ai to learn how to do that.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:07.230
Ordinality, what they would do they would
show two digits, say six and seven, so single

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:12.549
digits between one and nine, and the chimpanzee
had to learn to press the lowest one and then

00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:17.600
the highest one in order to get the food.
They learned that pretty quick as well.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:24.179
So in the late '80s you could say that there
was a chimpanzee who had learned the Arabic

00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:33.300
numeral system because had a working, functional
knowledge of both cardinality and ordinality.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.590
Then the chief researcher there realized,

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:37.590
[pause]

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:44.450
"We've not taught the chimpanzee zero. Why
don't we teach the chimpanzee the cardinality

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:52.330
of zero and then see if the chimpanzee can
work out what the ordinality is?" So for us

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:56.299
it's just like dead easy, yeah it's below
one, it's less than one, so yeah it's gonna

00:20:56.299 --> 00:21:04.140
be zero's before one, one is more than zero.
We get that; it's so obvious to us. So is

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.380
it obvious to a chimpanzee? So what they did
first they taught the chimpanzee the cardinality

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.950
of zero, when there's a zero there there's
a box with nothing in. When there's a box

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.470
with nothing in it's a zero.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:17.910
And then they did the ordinality test: they
showed two digits of which sometimes one was

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:24.630
a zero and they waited to see which number
the chimpanzee would touch first. Often I

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:29.001
have to hesitate when I say chimpanzee 'cause
I want to say monkey, but a chimpanzee is

00:21:29.001 --> 00:21:32.630
not monkeys they're apes and apes and monkey
are very different. And once when I was there

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:36.910
interviewing these people about it I accidentally
referred to one of their chimpanzees as a

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.250
monkey and my God [laughs]

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.250
[laughter]

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:44.200
it was ugly. [laughs] 'Cause when you work
with chimpanzees, because they're so like

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:51.080
close to us, they're called students and the
lab is called a classroom, it's like kinda

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.080
weird, but it's kinda brilliant too.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.630
So they taught the chimpanzee the cardinality
of zero, came to the ordinality,

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:57.630
[pause]

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.910
did it a bunch of times and then did the average
amount of times of when the chimpanzee, which

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:06.059
numbers they were and when it was the zero
tapped first, when it was tapped second. And

00:22:06.059 --> 00:22:07.059
where was zero?

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:08.059
[pause]

00:22:08.059 --> 00:22:12.660
It was between six and seven. So even though
they understood the cardinality of zero they

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:19.470
had no idea about where it was, on the number
line it's less than one. So they did this

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.799
test more and more and more and obviously
because they're getting food when they get

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:27.990
it right they're kind of learning and so gradually
the position of zero over the number line

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:33.540
got less and less and less and less but it
never really got below one. It was always,

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.480
they were always confused about where the
zero and one were sort of more or less the

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.800
same thing.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:45.679
That I think really shows that what makes
it distinctive for us humans is that we can

00:22:45.679 --> 00:22:50.730
slip between cardinality and ordinality very
easily and chimpanzees cannot.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.030
But while they cannot do that --

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.400
[pause]

00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:01.210
the Primate Research Institute in Kyoto, in
Inuyama but synced to the Kyoto University

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:06.270
had, now they've got about 15 chimpanzees
that can manipulate numbers amazingly well.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:10.650
And they thought, "Well let's try and use
these skills to see if we can find out anything

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:16.480
else about the cognitive capacities of chimpanzees."
And what they found was that in some cases,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.270
they'd never thought this before, chimpanzees
have a higher cognitive ability than humans

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.090
when it comes to the memory of numbers.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:28.980
So what I'm gonna show you I'm gonna show
you a clip and what's going on here is that

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:33.870
five digits appear on the screen and then
after--

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.050
[pause]

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.660
when they first did the test for point six
five seconds they're on the screen so you

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.900
can see them for point six five seconds then
they become white blocks, white squares.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.900
[pause]

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:48.309
What you've gotta do is remember the order,
the numerical order and to tap them to get

00:23:48.309 --> 00:23:54.320
the reward. Now at point six five seconds
humans can do it, chimpanzees can do it.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.320
[pause]

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:01.410
So they did less time, point four five seconds,
then point four three seconds, sorry. Humans

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:06.240
are starting to get confused they can't do
it so well. They can do sort it kind of all

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.880
right but it makes no difference to the chimpanzee,
still they get it right most of the time.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.780
Then they went done to what I'm gonna show
you now which is point two one seconds and

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:20.660
now humans really can't do this, but chimpanzees
they can as you can see. Now I think I need

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.660
to press play.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.660
So what's going on here that chimpanzee's
here he's gonna press that, that's not a zero

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.750
that's the button to start, you're gonna see
five digits for only point two one seconds

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:37.480
and then can you remember their order the
way that the chimpanzee does? And the food's

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:50.580
coming down here which is what's going on.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.220
[pause]

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:57.130
Here hang on.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.770
[pause]

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.220
And the sound isn't --

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.270
[sounds of chimpanzee touching screen]

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.270
[laughter]

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.730
[sounds of chimpanzee touching screen]

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:06.730
[laughter]

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:07.780
So press the button.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.780
[laughter]

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.240
[sounds of chimpanzee touching screen]

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.240
[laughter]

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.780
It's completely right and it's also interesting
the chimpanzees when they do that they want

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.539
to have their heads as close to the screen
as possible, when humans to it you kind of

00:25:15.539 --> 00:25:16.860
want to have a bit of distance.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:24.711
And this was amazing, no one really believed
that chimpanzees could do this and that was

00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:30.650
a couple of years ago; point two one seconds,
five digits. They can now do five digits at

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:37.700
zero point zero nine seconds. That's more
than twice as fast or eight digits at point

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.900
two one seconds. So completely amazing.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.900
One day,

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.280
[pause]

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.460
something else happened. They were doing the
same test,

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.460
[pause]

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.160
which I'll show you now, it's also quite interesting,
the same test.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.160
[pause]

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.600
but point two one seconds, he's pressing it
and he'll press it, does it, and then the

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.309
chimpanzee hears something and turns round.
So for ten seconds it's not looking; it's

00:25:58.309 --> 00:25:59.669
not concentrating; wonders what's going on
?

00:25:59.669 --> 00:26:00.669
[pause]

00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:02.240
for ten seconds, comes back --

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.480
[laughter]

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.260
totally gets it right.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.260
[laughter]

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:13.390
Absolutely and then carries on. So not only
do they have this, this way of seeing things

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.820
very fast they can remember for at least ten
seconds. And there might be lots of evolutionary

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:23.429
reasons why this is the case that we can't
go into now, but the main point is that there

00:26:23.429 --> 00:26:27.850
is something that chimpanzees can do that
are better than us involving numbers, the

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.850
memory of numbers.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:34.020
Now I went all around the world and went out
to Japan to see the chimpanzees. I was probably

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:39.660
the first guy to go on like a maths tour of
Japan. I wanted to see anything to do with

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:45.880
numbers and digits. And I learned that even
though we think that maths is the same all

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:50.169
over the world because one and one is two
everywhere, our approach to maths and the

00:26:50.169 --> 00:26:53.880
cultural resonance is very, very different.
And sometimes even the simplest way and I

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.039
think it's good to think about this because
it makes us kind of just challenges some of

00:26:58.039 --> 00:27:01.850
our own preconceptions about what maths is,
what numbers are, where they come from.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:09.299
The most obvious one is tallying. I grew up
in the U.K. and you tally like this: one,

00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:14.070
two, three, four, five. Obvious, surely the
simplest way, surely they've been doing this

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:21.780
since we were sort of cavemen tallying in
caves and no one does it any other way, but

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.780
that's wrong. I don't know if there any South
Americans,

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.720
[pause]

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:31.360
in the audience, non-Venezuelan South Americans
'cause Venezuelans do it like this because

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.950
the Venezuelans kind of do everything like
America. If you're not a Venezuelan South

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:42.020
American this is how you tally: one, two,
three, four, five which actually is a much,

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:46.780
much better way than the way we do it because
here three and four is always different, you're

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.790
never gonna confuse it, whereas as I said
before three and four you would confuse it

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:54.720
'cause at four you have to start counting
the lines. So if you see a bunch of guys in

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.270
Brazil playing Dominoes, that's how they're
counting their scores.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.090
In the Far East though in Japan, I see if
there's any Japanese, Chinese, or Korean people

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:07.260
in the audience if you are, be quiet. 'Cause
this is how you tally in these countries:

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.260
[pause]

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:14.260
one, any guess where the next one's gonna
come from? From there two, three, four, five.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:21.590
Is that that really confusing and complicated
and like designed to like turn people off

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:26.140
counting? Actually it's beautiful 'cause what
it means, that is the Kanji character for

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:30.669
correct. So it's almost like a haiku, it's
a way of kind of containing, sort of mixing

00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:39.909
words and numbers together and there's something
rather sort of delightful about it. And if

00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:41.420
you don't believe me the next time you go
to like a Chinese restaurant or sushi place

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.730
in Soho ask for some five beers and the waiter
will mark it like that, it's totally true.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.679
I mean I didn't believe it and I asked myself
a nice little party trick. Whenever you go

00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:49.909
to, that's how they tally.

00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:50.909
Now --

00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:51.909
[pause]

00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:57.910
I saw lots of different people in Japan and
one of the most fun people I met with this

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:00.440
guy here, Maki Kaji, and he's the guy who,
I wouldn't say invented he sort of reinvented

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.610
Sudoku but probably the most important guy
in the history of Sudoku.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:05.330
Sudoku was actually invented in the late '70s
by an amateur puzzle maker in America, when

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:16.780
it was a small American puzzle magazine but
in a few Times and no one took any notice.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:22.289
And then Maki Kaji in the early '80s was trying
to start a Japanese puzzle magazine, saw this

00:29:22.289 --> 00:29:26.580
American puzzle magazine, most of it was word
puzzles could understand anything about it,

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.110
about those ones. Saw the number puzzle one,
thought it was brilliant.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:33.770
So he adapted it and now the givens in a Sudoku
are all parallel a bit like in a crosswords

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:37.090
and he coined the phrase, I think he registered
it, Sudoku, which means "the number appears

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:42.309
only once" and then it became a bit of a hit
in Japan and then since it came to Europe

00:29:42.309 --> 00:29:46.860
about five years ago and around the rest of
the world. He's become quite wealthy and he

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.325
says, "I'm not a mathematician. I'm more of
a numbers impresario; a kind of showman."

00:29:50.325 --> 00:29:55.090
And he loves gambling and he was saying, he's
in his 50's he looks a little younger, he

00:29:55.090 --> 00:30:01.730
said, "Thank God I didn't make all my money
when I was in my 30's and 40's; I would have

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:07.680
spent it all on Geisha girls," and he's like
the least sort of nerdy numbers guy Japanese

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.600
that you'd ever expect to meet.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.679
And what I loved about him is where ever he
saw, when he saw numbers he just was making

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:20.530
games and having fun with them. And this is
what he told me his latest hobby was, taking

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:25.890
pictures of Japanese car number plates. I
don't know if anyone here can maybe see why

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:32.280
he might want to, sort of a good Google question
for [chuckles] These number plates are mathematically

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.280
interesting --

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.280
[pause]

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:39.110
it's because they're aligned to the times
table, three times five is fifteen and four

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:43.160
times one is four. So actually there are eighty-one
different types of registration license plate

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:49.121
in Japan and he was going around where ever
he saw one the motorway or the car park he

00:30:49.121 --> 00:30:53.050
would just take its picture and his idea was
to have an exhibition of the times tables

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.400
as seen on car license plates.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.400
[laughter]

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:01.080
I thought that was just sort of brilliant
and you don't need to be a math genius to

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.970
appreciate the sort of the beauty and the
simplicity in that.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:07.580
[pause]

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:13.140
In Japan, probably the greatest way that their
approach to maths and numbers is different

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:22.940
to in the U.K. and in America, certainly,
is in the presence of the abacus. Now this

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:27.140
is an abacus. An abacus is a counting machine
or a calculating machine. It's really the

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:33.900
oldest kind of calculating machine that there
is and virtually all cultures that count have

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:39.480
similar things. Sometimes they don't make
them into mechanical objects they're just

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:51.429
lines and you have sort of say pebbles on
a counter. That's where the word counter comes

00:31:51.429 --> 00:31:56.059
from where you'd have little counting things.
And the abacus --

00:31:56.059 --> 00:31:57.059
[pause]

00:31:57.059 --> 00:31:58.300
a Japanese abacus called the soroban has five
beads per rod so there are ten positions per

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.880
rod so they represent the numbers from zero
to nine. It should be horizontal so there's

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.030
no, gravity isn't working. And at the top
the bead can either be at the top or the bottom,

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:10.429
black is the bottom. So you start with naught.
These four here would be naught, one, the

00:32:10.429 --> 00:32:14.120
bottom goes up; two, the two would go up;
three, three goes up; four, four goes up;

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:20.460
and five they all go down and the top one
goes down to go five. So it's kind of like

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.460
a little base five with the base ten there.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:29.470
Now you do not need, once you get good at
the abacus it's very easy to do additions,

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.400
subtraction 'cause just by putting in the
sum you've done the addition already and multiplication

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:38.360
is essentially a little bit more complicated
addition so you can do additions, square roots,

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:45.549
division, all that really, really quickly
using an abacus. And in fact up until the

00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:57.450
pocket calculator in Japan and from Russia,
eastwards, actually, everyone would learn

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.030
to calculate using an abacus.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:03.900
And actually I've brought this item on here
which came out ?

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:04.900
[pause]

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:10.260
in Japan in the '70s when the pocket calculator
was becoming popular. And you might think

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:16.290
that this abacus calculator is to, you do
the sum on the abacus and then you just check

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.720
whether you're right with a calculator. But
obviously it was completely the other way

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.159
around 'cause they didn't trust this so they
would do it here and they would just check

00:33:23.159 --> 00:33:25.900
on the abacus just to see if they got it right.
[laughs]

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.900
[laughter]

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.600
Now the phrase for reading, writing, arithmetic
in Japanese is yonde, kaki, soroban; reading,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:37.679
writing, soroban. So it's very kind of culturey;
it's something in their culture. And even

00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:42.220
though you do not need to use an abacus in
daily life at all, you don't even need to

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:48.539
use it for the school maths syllabus, still
a million Japanese kids every year study the

00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:54.150
abacus at about 20,000 abacus schools or kind
of after they're called jukus where it's sort

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.730
of after school clubs.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:34:01.409
And Japan has this kind of tradition of these
jukus for other things, after school clubs.

00:34:01.409 --> 00:34:07.340
Monday you might wanna do violin practice,
Tuesday baseball, Wednesday soroban. And I

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.879
went to one to see what they did.

00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:09.879
[pause]

00:34:09.879 --> 00:34:15.270
And this is basically what goes on in a soroban
school. You learn to calculate using the abacus.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:18.159
It's very competitive and you can get speeds
and when you get sort of good at it and because

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:26.990
it's competitive the awards that you get are
just like a martial art. So if you get good

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:32.790
you get your Dans and it goes up in Dans,
so just like in karate or whatever, I don't

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:37.839
know anything about martial arts, but I know
that they use Dans, they use Dans in the abacus.

00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:42.109
And I went to a competition, 'cause they have
lots of competitions. This is a regional competition,

00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:48.010
there were maybe a couple of hundred kids
doing it and it was several hours on their

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:53.030
Sunday. And this is them just, the person's
reading out sums and they're calculating as

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:59.280
fast as possible. This is the sums being read
out and this is what you win, these wonderful

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:05.030
winged figures holding sort of golden soroban,
that's fantastic.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:10.660
Now why do people learn the soroban? And why
would you want to calculate really fast mentally

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:16.890
if you don't really need to? And I asked this
guy, Yugi Miyamoto, who this is his kind of

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:23.520
group of soroban pupils, why and he just looked
and me and just didn't really understand the

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:28.801
question. And he said, "Well why would you
ever want to run for 26 miles? But people

00:35:28.801 --> 00:35:34.000
do." He said, "There's this idea that why
not practice something that the body, the

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.580
human can do, as best possible, and running
in sports what about the kind of the brain

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.440
muscle as well to kind of practice that."

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.560
And also I could see that the kids were really,
they were really having fun. There's something

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.250
about learning with the abacus, there's something
kind of visceral about the counting that makes

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.380
people enjoy it a lot more.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:57.300
Now I was kind of fascinated by the soroban
and then Yugi Miyamoto made me more fascinated

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:03.690
by telling me about something called anzan.
Anzan is if you can do the abacus really well

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:10.410
after while you don't need to have a physical
abacus anymore to do the same calculations

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:15.962
'cause you can visualize the abacus in your
brain, right? So I said, "Well what do you

00:36:15.962 --> 00:36:19.450
mean?" He said, "Okay," and he got one of
his top pupils and then just said something

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:23.320
it was like I don't know 57 times 221 and
the guy just gave the answer.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.680
And I said, "Well, what's going on in your
brain?" He said, "Yeah, I have like eight

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:31.620
rows, eight columns with the beads in my brain
and I just like moving them around."

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.620
[pause]

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:36.859
It's absolutely amazing and Yugi Miyamoto
decided to sort of, 'cause there's something

00:36:36.859 --> 00:36:41.900
very Japanese about it, he wanted to kind
of publicize it more. So he thought, "Why

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:46.270
don't I think up a game, some kind of counting
task which the only way of solving it is using

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:50.690
anzan?" So if you were to say 25 times 26
say.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:51.690
[pause]

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:55.650
Millions of ways you could solve it: you could
stick it in Google for example, you could

00:36:55.650 --> 00:37:01.002
go on the beach and a line of 25 and 26 pebbles,
you could us an abacus, you could anzan, you

00:37:01.002 --> 00:37:04.720
could do all these things, so it's not good,
that task just saying something.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:11.800
And then he had this idea, "Why don't I have
a computer screen flashing digits so fast

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:17.950
that you can't write them down and work out
a task like that?" So he invented this game

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:23.000
called Flash Anzan which I'm gonna show you
now which flashes digits incredibly fast and

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.540
the idea is in this game here particularly
to add them all up. So what you're gonna see

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:35.040
is 15 digits and they're all three number
digits, three digit numbers, so like 221 is

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.650
a three digit number, 15 of them in three
seconds, that's five per second and the purpose

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:53.660
or the object is to count them and say the
answer, to add them all up.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.940
[pause]

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.230
Alright.

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.520
[pause]

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:02.660
Fifteen digit, three seconds.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.230
[beeping sounds]

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.540
Yep, he got it right.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.540
[laughter]

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:12.090
So what was going on? 'Cause you can't remember
any of the intermediate sums. He's got a blank

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:16.292
abacus, he sees the first one he just sees
it instantly as a shape on the abacus. He

00:38:16.292 --> 00:38:20.830
sees the next one and instantly he just adds
it. And he keeps on adding and he's like reading

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:22.119
the printout at the end.

00:38:22.119 --> 00:38:30.040
And when I heard about I said, "Oh can I take,
can I film it?" And I filmed it here and I

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.220
thought that maybe they would have to do it
10 times to get it right the first time, but

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:40.730
this is the very first time they did it completely
right. So the guys can do it and it's amazing.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:46.750
Now I was pretty impressed by this but not
as impressed as I was for the next thing that

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:52.060
you can do with an abacus. When I was trying
to understand a little bit about why we can

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:59.530
do this about the sort of neurology of it
or the neuroscience of it, they say in Japan

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:03.910
not that much research has been done on it
but they basically say, "Right brain normal

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:10.781
maths, left brain," no "left brain normal
maths, right brain abacus." What they mean

00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:16.740
is that our left side of the brain, the left
hemisphere, tends to be used for linguistic

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:21.440
programming, sort of language, numbers, counting,
all that kind of thing. And the right side

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:28.140
of the brain is the visuospatial skills that
we have. So normally we use the left side

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:32.220
of the brain to do maths but with the abacus
it's using the other side of the brain.

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:36.900
So what this means is that you could do the
abacus or Flash Anzan whilst, either your

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:44.210
left side or right brain is still free so
they designed this test which is to do Flash

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.850
Anzan whilst playing a language game at the
same time.

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:48.850
[laughter]

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:52.940
Alright? So what I'm gonna show you now is
it's two 10 year old girls, one of them is

00:39:52.940 --> 00:40:00.720
actually the daughter of the teacher. They're
going to be doing I think it's yeah it's 30

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:06.690
digits in 20 seconds and whilst playing this
Japanese word game called Shiritori which

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:10.180
is the first person says Shiritori, the next
person has to say a word that begins with

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.210
"ri" the last syllable of the previous word.
And the person after that has to say a word

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:18.130
beginning with the last syllable of the previous
word. Very kind of common, we have things

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:21.280
like that but with less rather than syllables.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:29.460
So this two girls playing Shiritori whilst
counting.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.030
[beeping sound]

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:35.890
&gt;&gt;girl #1: Shiritori.

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:41.030
[girls speaking in Japanese]

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:46.180
[man speaking in Japanese]

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:51.320
[girls speaking in Japanese]

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.610
[laughter]

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:53.890
[pause]

00:40:53.890 --> 00:41:03.270
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Yeah, they got it completely
right and that was the first time that I filmed

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.190
them. It was absolutely fascinating.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:12.349
So the abacus is basically the oldest way
to calculate, but it's still in some ways

00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:17.490
the most versatile and also the littlest understood.

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:22.630
Now very quickly the final section I'm gonna
have to rush through because I realize I'm

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.010
running out of time.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:29.170
I was all these very glamorous places: Japan,
India, Phoenix, Arizona, etcetera but I also

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:34.280
went some less glamorous places: Braintree
in Essex. And I reason I went to Braintree

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.730
is that I discovered that Britain's second
largest collection of slide rules is in Braintree.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:43.599
And as a journalist and having to make all
of sort of this exciting kind of want something

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:46.010
that's quite funny, has a comic potential
and I thought this was going to be hilarious

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:51.750
because the slide rule is gotta be like the
world's, the reputation is like they're the

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:57.810
most nerdy thing ever. So I was intending
to think that it was gonna be easy, easy gags.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:02.670
But when I got there I realized I kind of
fell in love with mathematical instruments.

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:07.980
Because the slide rule which I guess I'm looking
at the ages of people here, most people here

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:14.210
probably don't even know what a slide rule
is. A slide rule uses logarithms to, you can

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:19.030
do multiplications and divisions, square roots
very easily by sliding two log scales against

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.250
each other. And,

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:22.250
[pause]

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:29.109
when the logarithms were invented about 400
years ago.

00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:30.240
[pause]

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.570
A couple decades later the slide rule was
invented and it totally revolutionized science.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:37.770
Straight away you could do long complicated
calculations very quickly and probably every

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:44.540
single great invention of the last 350, 400
years required a slide rule. Right up until

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:49.890
you can almost date it it's like August 1974
when Sinclair's pocket calculator came out

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:55.930
and no one needed them anymore. So nothing
has been so dominate and then died so quickly.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:43:01.790
And actually I can remember and also from
movies in the sort of '50s and '60s the slide

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:06.610
rule was this sort of really quite boring
like two sticks like really sort of dull people

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.630
would have them like in their top pocket.
But actually for hundreds of years there are

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:14.760
sort of beautiful ones were made and every
industry, every trade had their own type of

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.760
slide rule.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:20.630
And when I was sitting at this guy's house
these collections they were gorgeous. This

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:26.900
one is from the 1890's which the log scales,
you pull them out, and that called Thacher's

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.390
Calculating Instrument.

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:35.329
This one here was the most amazing. Also in
the 1890's, it's called Professor Fuller's

00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:42.609
Calculator and the scales were on a helix
running to about 45 feet. So you could do

00:43:42.609 --> 00:43:47.930
a calculation with this two five decimals
places. So normally most slide rules they're

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:51.320
only analog because you're looking on the
stick to see where something goes, you get

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:56.820
about three decimal places. And five decimals
places for most types of engineering is more

00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:07.430
than enough. So it's amazing to think that
something could get you, could calculate within

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:11.109
seconds complicated sums of five decimal places
120 years ago.

00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:13.400
There's also this the Halden Calculex and
I actually brought on which is a sort of debonair

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.860
person's slide rule which you'd have maybe
like this like a kind of pocket watch and

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:23.990
wear the slide rules. The log scales are circular.
And when I was there, I was just getting,

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:25.010
falling in love with these machines and actually
the collection of mathematical instruments

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:31.060
is like a huge growth area. You look an Ebay
there's all these things that are worth hundreds

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:38.420
of pounds is I sought this item here which
looks like a hand grenade or a pepper grinder.

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:45.200
And what it is actually it's not a slide rule
it's the only digital pocket mechanical calculator

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.720
ever made.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:54.500
So Pascal, 400 odd years ago, had this dream
for mechanized calculating and he invented

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:59.140
the Pascaline which is sort of the very first
one. And then Leibniz has its Step Reckoner,

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:02.660
there's this whole history of people mechanizing
counting. That's where the word kind of number

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.010
crunching comes from.

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:08.190
And there's the Victorian age and also the
early 20th century around until the mid-20th

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:13.670
century people would have these big desks
sort of machines that would do all this calculating

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:14.970
for them.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:18.990
Then in the 1930's Curt Herzstark, an Austrian,
had this idea for this new sort of system,

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:25.630
an engineering system, that he can make a
pocket sized one. And it took him 20 years

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:29.890
to work out exactly how to do it and he was
imprisoned for some of that time as a prisoner

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:34.290
in Buchenwald Concentration Camp. And he was
half Jewish so he was going to be killed because

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:39.310
the Germans knew he was working on this. They
didn't kill him and they said, "If you invent

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:43.610
this we will present it to the Fuhrer and
you'll be declared Aryan and you will survive."

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:49.520
And he didn't do it quite in time, we don't
know if he actually did but didn't wanna tell

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:56.030
them, but he'd almost completed it by the
time he was liberated by the Russians.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:46:00.520
Then in the years after the war worked out
how to do it, tried to get funding, the only

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.760
people who he could get funding was the Duchy
of Liechtenstein. So he moved to Liechtenstein

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:12.560
and for basically up until the late '60s this
was made. And I brought one here which is

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.339
the most sort of beautiful, beautiful thing.

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:17.820
[sound of getting item to display]

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:23.440
It basically can do multiplications, divisions,
all those things and you put the number in

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.040
and then you grind it round. If anyone wants
to have a look afterwards I'll show it.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:31.140
But what is sort of interesting is that this
in a sense was the zenith of the dreams of

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:37.780
mechanical calculation. It was pocket-sized
sort of beautiful engineering, beautiful sort

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.070
of that end of the road for a way of thought
because then calculators became all about

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:48.260
information and electronics and computers
and you guys and stuff like this. So this

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:55.510
is quite nice it's sort like of a historical
relic and fossil almost of the dreams for

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:59.359
hundreds of years of the mechanization of
calculation.

00:46:59.359 --> 00:47:03.880
Now I'm just gonna finish here 'cause at the
beginning of the talk I said and I hope it

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:09.339
will come, "If all numbers were listed alphabetically
what number would come second?"

00:47:09.339 --> 00:47:10.830
&gt;&gt;female #1: Eight billion.

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:11.960
&gt;&gt;male #1: [unintelligible]

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:16.120
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Correct. [laughs] Correct.
Or sometimes people, but in French.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.120
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible]

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:23.760
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Cinq billion I think, I think
yes or a billion and eight. Some people they

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:28.200
disagree that it should be one billion and
eight.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.440
So very, post finally, I just wanted to say
that I've been trying, I've got this survey

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.359
out to the world, I'm trying to find out what's
the world's favorite number. And I've got

00:47:36.359 --> 00:47:41.360
this website which is here, favoritenumber.net,
and so far I've had about 25,000 votes from

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:48.220
numbers from all over the world, from virtually
every country and so please if you do, I'm

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.470
trying to just study on the emotional connection
we have to numbers. If you do have a favorite

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:54.500
number or even if you don't go, on there and
say, "Yes I do this is what it is."

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:55.500
[laughter]

00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:03.010
Or don't and Tweet it and share it with all
your friends because next year hopefully I'll

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:04.860
have the results.

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:11.040
So that's me and thank you very much for listening.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.040
[applause]

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:20.920
&gt;&gt;commentator: Thank you very much Alex or
maybe I should call you Alexander. I think

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.990
we've got just a few minutes for questions
so does anyone have a question for Alex?

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.990
[pause]

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:29.069
&gt;&gt;female #2: What is your favorite number?

00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:33.410
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Well, that's the whole thing,
I don't have a favorite number and I would

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:36.240
give these talks when my book came out and
people would always put their hands up and

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.692
say, "What's your favorite number?" And I
thought they were just winding me up because

00:48:38.692 --> 00:48:40.440
it's a really stupid thing to have.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.440
[laughter]

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.720
Until I realized that I was in the minority
of not having a favorite number and that's

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:51.380
in a sense what has given me this sort of
impetus because I'm really fascinated by the

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:54.460
fact that people can have favorite numbers
because surely they're all the same. How can

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.240
you have this emotional connection to something
which is so impersonal.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.670
&gt;&gt;female #2: But you have a favorite color
don't you?

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:01.780
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Yes but color ?

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:02.780
&gt;&gt;female #2: same idea.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.490
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: yes but a color definitely
gives you an emotional reaction like red makes

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:08.790
angry, green is comforting. Why would a number
be more comforting than another?

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:14.920
And then I kind of realized, when I was asking
these questions, people tend to choose numbers

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:21.040
below 20 especially under 10, odds more than
evens which is interesting, and primes more

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:28.300
than non-primes. Now why is this? Lots of
sort of theories and most people the reason

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:31.712
with their favorite number is the day they
were born, right? But only if you were born

00:49:31.712 --> 00:49:36.830
on a low prime; if you were born like me on
the 22nd you're very unlikely to choose 22

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:41.750
as a favorite number. So I think that had
I been born on the 7th or the 13th or the

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:48.200
11th that would be my favorite number. [laughs]
This is a lovely discussion and I will come

00:49:48.200 --> 00:50:10.060
back and tell you the answers next year. [laughs]

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:21.090
&gt;&gt;male #2: The chimpanzees -- could the chimpanzees
have beaten the humans for physiological reasons

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:23.190
rather than mental capabilities?

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:32.770
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Well what do you mean could
they--

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:55.470
&gt;&gt;male #2: They focus much faster with their
eyes or --

00:50:55.470 --> 00:51:11.690
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Yeah I mean the reason why
they can do that is going to be that it's

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:19.819
much more useful in the wild to have those
instant reactions. I mean I'm not sure, is

00:51:19.819 --> 00:51:28.730
it an instant reaction a neurological thing
or is it a physiological thing? I don't know

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:29.730
enough about--

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:30.730
&gt;&gt;male #2: both?

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:34.150
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Yeah [laughs] I'm not a neuroscientist
but yeah.

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:35.150
[pause]

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:42.540
&gt;&gt;male #3: Maybe I can ask a question myself.
When you met the guy who had reinvented Sudoku

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:43.540
and--

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:44.760
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Yeah.

00:51:44.760 --> 00:52:02.940
&gt;&gt;male #3: and also was the guru of the number
thing, you said he was like least nerdy mathematician

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:03.940
or person interested in maths you'll ever
meet.

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:04.940
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Yeah.

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:05.940
&gt;&gt;male #3: Why do you think it is that there
is this kind of association with maths as

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:06.940
a nerdy pastime interest etcetera within society?

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:07.940
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Well,it is I discovered only
really in cultures like especially Britain

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:08.940
when there is, I don't know we value, we don't
value mathematical skills the way they're

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:09.940
valued in other countries. But even in, say
France and Germany, it's quite common, there

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:10.940
are a lot more women do science even in those
countries. It's something about the kind of

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:11.940
Anglo-Saxon approach I think it's cultural
but I also think it's changing and I think

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:12.940
that whereas before the word "nerd", you'd
never say, "Well, I'm a nerd." That's sort

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:13.940
of a very negative, very pejorative. Now it's,
"Hey I'm a geek." Everyone says, "I'm a geek."

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:14.940
It's quite cool to be a geek. Geeks make lots
and lots of money and do interesting things

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:15.940
--

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:16.940
[laughter]

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:17.940
in a way that they never were seen as doing
that, say, in the 1970s.

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:18.940
[pause]
Yeah.

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:19.940
[pause]
&gt;&gt;male #4: There's this legend about Gauss

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:20.940
that's using a human calculator to aid him
do you know this ?

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:21.940
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Yes that's true, that's true.
He's called Zacharias Dase and one thing which

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:22.940
is interesting about numbers as well, when
numbers, [clears throat] so these Arabic numbers,

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:23.940
numerals came in about the 13th century to
Europe and it was only, took a few hundred

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.940
years for them to become dominant. And when
they were, all of a sudden, some people were

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:27.770
able to have these amazing numerical skills,
the kind of the sort of idiot savant type.

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:32.349
And these people were probably what now we
would call sort of Asberger's cases or sort

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:37.530
strong autistics or whatever. But, yes, there
were some people who had this amazing facility

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:44.960
with numbers and one of them the most famous
one was Zacharias Dase who was employed by

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:51.890
Euler actually it was either Euler or Gauss,
maybe Gauss, where he calculated Pi to 200

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:55.850
places which was the most that was done at
the time. And he did a table of factors up

00:52:55.850 --> 00:53:02.830
to about 8 million, it was just unbelievable.
And still now you can get people who are,

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:07.580
have this amazing ability with numbers from
nowhere.

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:14.201
And in fact I'm flying next week to America
and one of the people I'm gonna meet is a

00:53:14.201 --> 00:53:22.099
guy who's got Asberger's and he's a taxi driver
from Tucson, but he's the world's best square

00:53:22.099 --> 00:53:27.930
rooter. You can give him any number and he
can get the square root; and he just can and

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:34.990
he always has been able to do that. So these
sort of skills which now, he's a cab driver.

00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:39.440
If he'd been around in Gauss' day he might
have been working for Gauss [laughs] making

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.319
lots of money.
&gt;&gt;male #4: Yeah, I can understand question

00:53:44.319 --> 00:53:52.609
about like well Gauss or whoever that was
like he didn't abandon life to start a being

00:53:52.609 --> 00:53:55.609
a better calculator. So do you think that
actual pure calculations just like a pointless

00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:56.609
hobby like compared to actual life?
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Yeah it's got nothing, there

00:53:56.609 --> 00:54:00.460
are very, lots of great mathematicians that
got terrible mental arithmetic and the ability

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:07.850
to be good at mental arithmetic is not really
anything to do with ability to be good at

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:13.830
maths.
Maths values other things, deductive reasoning,

00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:16.690
creativity, sort of conceptual things that,
yeah, and in fact CERN were last people where

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:21.579
they've got the Large Hadron Collider were
the last people to use a human calculator.

00:54:21.579 --> 00:54:27.089
Up until the '70s a guy called Wim Klein,
a Dutch guy, he was used to do the calculations

00:54:27.089 --> 00:54:30.210
that they were needing there and then after
the '70s computers came in and didn't need

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:34.359
it anymore. So there's a kind of tradition
of the human calculator.

00:54:34.359 --> 00:54:36.680
[pause]
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Okay, we probably have time

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.720
for one more question. One more?
[pause]

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:43.980
&gt;&gt;male #5: So you compared the various tallying
techniques and you looked at abacus--

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:48.160
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;male #5: and things like that--

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.060
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;male #5: that's very popular. Are there

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:54.830
any other calculating techniques that are
particularly easy to understand that we should

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:58.609
be teaching our kids instead of the way we
do arithmetic right now?

00:54:58.609 --> 00:55:04.950
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: The most interesting thing
about how to teach kids, which I hadn't realized,

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:10.380
is also to do in Japan and is about how they
learn the times table. So the times tables

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:14.190
in Japan, and I think in China as well but
I didn't go to China, it's called a kuku 'cause

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:20.630
ku is nine, so it's the nine nines and you
say it exactly as you do here. So we'll start

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:27.619
one one is one, two ones is two, three ones
is three, but they sometimes like a number

00:55:27.619 --> 00:55:35.130
in Japanese one can be in it can be ichi,
two things. So the word that you use within

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:39.520
the times tables is chosen to make it scan
better and sometimes the word is actually

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:45.329
changed so ha is eight, ha ha eight eight
is changed to ha pa 'cause it rolls off the

00:55:45.329 --> 00:55:48.829
tongue better.
So the children are taught the times tables

00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:52.720
as if they are a nursery rhyme with a kind
of musicality to them and they're actually

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:58.099
taught them before they're taught really what
they mean. And this means that one, it's really

00:55:58.099 --> 00:56:03.100
fun learning the times tables, it's a bit
like a rap. I went into a school and the kids

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:08.320
love sort almost singing the times tables
and it seems to sink deeper.

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:12.130
So when I was talking to my interpreter and
she was saying, "Yeah, when I have to do say

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:17.970
six times seven I remember the line in the
music of the kuku what six times seven is,

00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:23.700
six times seven forty-two and then I say forty-two."
So this idea that language is being used to

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:30.510
make maths easier the sort of marriage between
maths and language is kind of helping the

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:36.610
maths and helping the language, whereas here
they sort of keep themselves to themselves.

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:37.610
[pause]
Yeah.

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:43.520
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Cool. Thank you very much
Alex for coming in to talk to us. We have

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.330
some -
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Oh fantastic.

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:48.970
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: little gifts for you.
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Thank you.

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:52.970
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I'm sure everyone is very
happy you came in.

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:54.790
[applause]
&gt;&gt;Alex Bellos: Thank you.

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:55.150
[applause]
