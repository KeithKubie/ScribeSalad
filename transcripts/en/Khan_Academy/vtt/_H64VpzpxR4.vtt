00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.860
- [Narrator] At this point,
you are likely already familiar

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.320
with the idea of rounding.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.210
Probably, you have had some practice

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.870
rounding to the nearest 10.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.270
Now we're gonna do
another type of rounding.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.567
We are now going to
round to the nearest 100.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.750
So let's just start with an example,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.160
and you'll see that in a lot of ways,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.920
it's very similar to
rounding to the nearest 10,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.260
we're just looking at
different place values now.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.237
So let's say we have the number 345.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.270
And we want to round
this to the nearest 100.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.000
So pause this video, and
see, I know I haven't even

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.880
taught you how to do that,
but what's your intuition?

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.243
What is the nearest 100 to 345?

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.860
Okay, now let's do this together.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.090
And what we wanna do is
first look at the 100s place.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.090
And you can see 345 is three
100s, four 10s, and five ones.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.670
So 345, the 100, the number of 100s,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.670
that is right below 345 is three 100s,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.870
so it's between three 100s,
zero 10s, and zero ones,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.980
and then the number of 100s

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.800
that's right above this number is 400.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.080
We're in between three 100s and four 100s.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.850
And 400.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.690
So if we're gonna round
this to the nearest 100,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.470
it's gonna go to one of these two.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.380
Well, to think about
which one we round to,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.400
we have to think about
well, is 345 closer to 400,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.250
or is it closer to 300?

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.730
And to think about that,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.220
we can draw ourselves a number line.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.110
And so let me just start
my number line here at,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.470
I'll just start it at 200.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.983
So that's 200, let's make this 300,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.273
and then this would be 400.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.640
And then since we, let's just see,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.980
this would be about 350 right over here,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.970
so I'll do the 50s right over there.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.210
So that 350.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.880
So where would 345 sit?

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.820
Well, 345 is a little bit less than 350.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.450
It's going to be roughly right over there.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.700
So which 100 is it closer to?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.470
Are we closer to 300,
or are we closer to 400?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.900
Well, you can visually see,
350 is right in between.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.300
It's 50 away from 300,
and 50 away from 400.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.590
So 345 is going to be a
little bit closer to 300.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.910
So in this situation, if we're
rounding to the nearest 100,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.700
we would round down to 300.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.820
Now another way that you could do this,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.220
and it's very similar
to what we thought about

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.620
when we rounded to the nearest 10,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.000
is okay, we're rounding
to the nearest 100,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.400
so this is either going to be
rounded to a three or a four,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.760
and to decide on that,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.950
we go to one place value less than that.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.150
So to decide on that, we
would go to the 10s place.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.730
Let me do this in a different color.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.090
Go to the 10s place.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.710
And in our 10s place right over here,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.700
if this is less than
five, then we round down.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.880
If it is greater than or
equal to five, we round up.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.220
So in this situation,
it is less than five,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.320
so we round down.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.700
If this was 365, well then that would be

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.400
greater than or equal to five,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.740
so then we would round up.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.180
And that makes sense, because
365 would be over here,

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.370
and it would be closer to 400.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.620
Let's do another example.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.350
We'll do it both with
what I just described,

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.880
and we'll do it with a number line.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.940
And I'll actually do a
four digit number now,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.930
just to just mix things up a little bit.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.373
Let's say we have the number 7,652.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.080
Pause this video, and see if you can

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.323
round this number to the nearest 100.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.160
Alright, now let's do it together.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.300
Now, we're thinking about the 100s place,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.720
so right over there.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.520
You can view this as seven
thousands and six 100s.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.330
Or you could even view this as 76 100s.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.870
So what are the closest
100s to this number?

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.920
Well, this is, you could either view this

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.170
as 76 100s and five 10s and two ones,

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.850
or seven thousands, six
100s, five 10s, and two ones.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.670
And so either way, the 100s
that are right below this

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.670
is 76 100s, or 7,600,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.620
and the 100s that are right above this,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.970
well you would just take
one more than this six,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.970
so that would be 7700, 7700.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.583
And so, which one would it round to?

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.430
Well, we could use the technique
that I just showed you.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.810
You go one place value less than the 100s,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.060
which in this case is in the 10s position,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.220
and you would say, alright,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.410
is this greater than or equal to five?

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.900
If it is, we round up.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.600
Is this less than five?

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.840
Then we round down.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.410
This is greater than or equal to five.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.720
It's equal to five.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.150
So in this situation, we round up to 7700.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.860
And we can see that on
a number line as well.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.133
Let me draw a number line here.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.550
And so let me just start at,
let's say that this is 7500,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.360
this is 7600, or 7,600, and
this right over here is 7,700.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.550
And this would be 7,650 right over here.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.410
And so 7,652 is going to be
a little bit more than that.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.100
It's going to be a little bit more.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.710
And since you can see, it's
either right in the middle,

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.800
or to the right of right in the middle,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.450
we would round up to 7700,

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.440
which is exactly what we just did.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.680
Now let me give you another
interesting example.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.680
Let's say we wanted to round
to the nearest 100 for 982.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.793
What would that be?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.940
Well once again, we
look at the 100s place.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.260
Well what's 100 that's right below 982?

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.770
Well if you just get rid of the 82,

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.400
you're just left with nine 100s,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.700
so that would be 900 if you round down.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.220
And if you were to round up,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.840
what's the 100s right above this?

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.180
Well, you could go from
nine 100s to 10 100s,

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.413
and that would be the same thing as 1,000.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.250
And so I wanted to show this example

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.070
because when you're rounding up here,

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.370
the next 100 is 10 100s, or 1,000.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.540
And so we can see very clearly here

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.403
that if we look at the 10s place,

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.400
the eight is greater
than or equal to five,

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.600
so we are going to round up.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.213
So 982 rounded to the
nearest 100s is 1,000.
