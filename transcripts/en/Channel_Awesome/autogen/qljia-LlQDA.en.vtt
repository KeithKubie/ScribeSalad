a quiet place this movie is still out

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
a quiet place this movie is still out
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160
a quiet place this movie is still out
and it's really good a lot of people are

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
and it's really good a lot of people are
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.499
and it's really good a lot of people are
calling it horror I don't know if I call

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509
calling it horror I don't know if I call
 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.870
calling it horror I don't know if I call
it that it's more suspense it's more

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
it that it's more suspense it's more
 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.620
it that it's more suspense it's more
thriller um but I mean there is you know

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
thriller um but I mean there is you know
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.060
thriller um but I mean there is you know
there's still monsters trying to get

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070
there's still monsters trying to get
 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.550
there's still monsters trying to get
people and stuff like that so I guess it

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
people and stuff like that so I guess it
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.100
people and stuff like that so I guess it
counts most you know the story it's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
counts most you know the story it's
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.160
counts most you know the story it's
about these monsters that go after they

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
about these monsters that go after they
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.810
about these monsters that go after they
go after sound it's kind of like tremors

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
go after sound it's kind of like tremors
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.359
go after sound it's kind of like tremors
except they're above ground and it's

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
except they're above ground and it's
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.609
except they're above ground and it's
it's this family that has to communicate

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
it's this family that has to communicate
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.490
it's this family that has to communicate
entirely without words they or being

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
entirely without words they or being
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.240
entirely without words they or being
vocal and it's I like films that can

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
vocal and it's I like films that can
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.749
vocal and it's I like films that can
really incorporate silence and the quiet

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759
really incorporate silence and the quiet
 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.530
really incorporate silence and the quiet
especially if it's supposed to be

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540
especially if it's supposed to be
 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.109
especially if it's supposed to be
suspense and I think that can't teaches

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
suspense and I think that can't teaches
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.819
suspense and I think that can't teaches
an audience to it's like okay we can be

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829
an audience to it's like okay we can be
 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.889
an audience to it's like okay we can be
quiet during a movie and don't get me

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
quiet during a movie and don't get me
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.740
quiet during a movie and don't get me

be quiet but sometimes I make a joke and
 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.289
be quiet but sometimes I make a joke and
yeah but when a film is designed to be

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
yeah but when a film is designed to be
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.789
yeah but when a film is designed to be
entirely silent it's I I don't know it's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
entirely silent it's I I don't know it's
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.710
entirely silent it's I I don't know it's
something we're kind of like shows a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
something we're kind of like shows a
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.589
something we're kind of like shows a
maturity especially when it's a big hit

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599
maturity especially when it's a big hit
 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.020
maturity especially when it's a big hit
and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030
and
 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.640
and
shows that audiences are ready for a

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650
shows that audiences are ready for a
 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.130
shows that audiences are ready for a
quiet film and they can get more quiet

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140
quiet film and they can get more quiet
 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.930
quiet film and they can get more quiet
films even the end of infinity war was

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940
films even the end of infinity war was
 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.640
films even the end of infinity war was
kind of quiet so I like that more these

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650
kind of quiet so I like that more these
 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.370
kind of quiet so I like that more these
risks are being taken especially for a

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380
risks are being taken especially for a
 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.790
risks are being taken especially for a
film this was directed I think written

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800

name right but he stars in this to a
good job I mean that this is kind of a

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870
good job I mean that this is kind of a
 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.309
good job I mean that this is kind of a
risky type of movie to do in terms of

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319
risky type of movie to do in terms of
 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.340

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.050
this is not something that was sure to
be a hit so I'm glad that was I'm glad

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060
be a hit so I'm glad that was I'm glad
 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.090
be a hit so I'm glad that was I'm glad
that he has sort of this maturity to

it's trying to tell like there's
 

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.470
it's trying to tell like there's
definitely some movies where they just

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480
definitely some movies where they just
 

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.870
