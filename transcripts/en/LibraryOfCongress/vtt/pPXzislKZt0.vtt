00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Good
evening ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.900
Welcome, my name is Nicholas
Brown, I'm a music specialist here

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.330
at the Library of congress.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.760
So, great to see so
many of you today.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.900
Hope it didn't take too
long given the weather

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.020
and transportation mayhem that
was had today in Washington, DC.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.280
We're so thrilled that we have all
of the artists here tonight as well

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.190
as the composer of the
piece being premiered,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.810
Kati Agocs, who is at the far end.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.290
And she made it from
Boston despite all

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.920
of the transportation
nonsense today,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.460
so we really appreciate
her putting up with all

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.480
of that to join us this evening.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.720
And I'll just introduce the rest
of the quartet members to you.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.170
This of course is the
Cecilia Strong Quartet.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.110
They're based in Toronto.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.510
And we have Min-Jeong
Koh, first violinist.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.980
Sara Nematallah, also violin.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.960
Caitlin Boyle on viola.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.040
And Rachel Desoer on Cello.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.510
Awesome. Yeah, welcome.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.960
[ Applause ]

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.740
So, we're just going to have
an informal chat to talk

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.700
about their experience with the
Stradivari instruments and also

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.460
with the repertoire and then also
bringing Kati's piece to life

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.790
as they've given the
world premiere already

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.920
and some other performances of it.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.060
Just some context about
this evening.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.770
This is our annual
Stradivari concert,

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.270
also known as the Stradivari
Anniversary Concert.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.380
And we invite a string quartet and
sometimes some other guest artists

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.370 position:56%
to perform on the library's historic
string instrument collection.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.750
Specifically, the violins, and
viola, and cello that were donated

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.650
by Gertrude Clarke
Whittall beginning in 1935.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.950
She actually built this room.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.130
We're in the Whittall
Pavilion here at the library.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.140
And she was a very wonderful
philanthropist who liked to compete

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.400
with Mrs. Coolidge who of
course build the hall next door.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.880
There's a difference
of about 10 years

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.810
between Mrs. Coolidge
giving her initial gift

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.240
and then Mrs. Whittall's
gift of the instrument.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.130
Tonight's events mark
the 80th Anniversary

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.250
of the first Stradivari
Anniversary Concert.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.590
So, this is a lot of redundant
use of the word anniversary.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.220
I'm sorry and we're very pleased

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.940
to be featuring the
Cecilia Quartet tonight.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.150
Beyond that, we're also honoring
the upcoming 150th anniversary

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.170
of the confederacy of Canada.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.700
And they're mostly
Canadian, if not all Canadian

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.590
and definitely all based in Canada.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.710
And Kati, is also Canadian,
which is really great

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.120
and she was born in Ontario.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.300
So, we are all Canada
all night today

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.190
which is really great [laughter].

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.990
They're so charming, aren't they?

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.980
[ Applause ]

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.400
So, I'll start off with the
quartet, because they've been here

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.480
since Thursday evening, getting
to know some of our dear friends

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.100
that usually live in
those cases over there.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.270
We have several of the
instruments being used tonight

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.690
of course, there are four.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.090
The Betts Violin from 1704, the
Castlebarco Violin from 1699,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.380
the viola from 1727,
known as the Cassavetti

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.500
and then the Castlebarco
Cello from 1699.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.360
What has the experience been
like meeting these instruments

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.100
and also coming to terms with them

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.710
or conquering them
in the last 48 hours.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.410
And that's open for any one or all.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.910
&gt;&gt; RACHEL DESOER: Well,
it's been an adventure.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.670
And I think this evening
will be even more of one.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.850
I'm trying to think, there's
just actually so many variables

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.610
and things that happen
when you first encounter a

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.910
different instrument.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.870
And I sort of feel like I've met
a person who would be like one

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.590
of my greatest friends,
like just immediately love,

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.410
but have no idea how
to talk to them yet,

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.800
like they're from a different
country or something.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:19.350
So, yeah, I guess that's
where I sort of started.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.510
&gt;&gt; MIN-JEONG KOH: Because I
feel like I'm having an affair.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.150
[ Laughter ]

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.570
And I'm already dreading
tomorrow when I have to say bye,

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.890
I mean the Betts strat, it's a
remarkable instrument and it's just

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.840
so many wonderful things about it.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.670
And I think you know when you're
freshly in love with someone,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.720
just everything seems so
perfect and just so, it just,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.200
you know it fits perfectly.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.550
So, I'm in this you know la-la
land where you know I think we're

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.080
like the greatest couple
ever created by man

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.700
and my pour violin
is actually here too.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.860 position:56%
And it looks kind of you know dirty,
and you know it looks a little,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.270
feels a little bit shafted I think.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.120
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: Yeah
it's been a great honor

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.470
to play on the instruments.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.500
I feel quite humbled
by the experience.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.670
We're really honored to be invited.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.760 position:56%
And I think what's been most amazing

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.410
for me is the way a different
instrument can actually teach you

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.580
things about yourself
that you couldn't get

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.040
from your regular instrument.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.840
So, I've just been
noticing different movements

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.190
that are possible, you know
on instruments in general.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.760
Different sounds that are possible.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.250
Like you learn so much, even from
just a few days on the instrument.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.350
So, it's a pity that we
obviously can't have more time,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.780
as I'm sure everybody feels
who comes to play on these,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.760
but even the short time is
really, really enlightening.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.500
&gt;&gt; CAITLIN BOYLE: Yeah I was going
to say something similar to Sarah.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:57.530
Well, I've never actually played
on an instrument this old before.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.920
A lot of violas are
more contemporary.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.040
And I feel like I've
learned a lot from it.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.160 position:56%
Like the response of the
instrument is just, it's incredible.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.120
It's so fast and it will
just, like we were talking

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.130
about an analogy also of like
driving a very expensive car.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.200
So, like Rachel said, it's a
little bit scary and dangerous

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.230
because it jumps at like the
slightest thing that you do.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.990
And the sound is just incredible.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.780
I find it so smooth and full.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.840 position:56%
So, it's been such a great pleasure.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.450
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROW: Could
each of you share maybe one

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.280
of the biggest surprises about
your specific instrument.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.880
And it doesn't have to be cheerful.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.180
&gt;&gt; CAITLIN BOYLE: Okay.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.440
Well I was like, for some
reason I had it in my mind

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.510
that the Strad here was huge.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.190
Was going to be this
massive instrument.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.790
So, I was you know
practicing like this before.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.950
No, I'm just kidding.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.530
But it's actually smaller
than my own viola.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.750
So, that was a bit of a relief for
me since I don't have to struggle

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.270
at all physically to play.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.250
&gt;&gt; RACHEL DESOER: I think the first
day I looked at the instrument,

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.330
there's a spot on the back that
looks at either a knot of wood,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.550
or perhaps we were discussing
it might be a fossilized worm.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.410
And so, that just made the
age really hit me in the face,

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.700
but also very odd to like lightly
put your hand over wood that felt

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.040
like a little soft and fragile.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.600
So, it's a good thing
it lives in that case.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:40.100
&gt;&gt; MIN-JEONG KOH: Oh, there
are just too many I can't pick.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.390
Well, I think when you,
as soon as you put the bow

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:47.220
on I think it feels buttery,
but in high on the E string,

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.160
which of course is the best string,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.150
I think it really requires
like no effort.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.410
And somehow it has this
amazing ability to project

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.640
and create this unbelievable
sound, but without much effort.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.710
It's as if it has like
a little tiny built

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.360
in mic underneath the
bridge or something.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.710
It's amazing.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.580
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: Yeah
I had a similar experience.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.930
I guess I was surprised that less
is more on these instruments.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.480
So, when you want to pull out
a deeper sound or when you want

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.030
to project more, it's
actually better

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.170
to let the instrument do what it
does best, as opposed to trying

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.800
to you know put your muscle
into it and pull it out kicking

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.470
and screaming kind of thing, so.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.200
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Wonderful
thank you for sharing those.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.870
Kati, what do you think

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.790
of your piece being performed
on these instruments.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.910
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: You know
I haven't heard it yet,

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:40.470
because I had an eight-hour
delay getting out of Boston.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.990
So, I just, I was hoping to be
able to hear the rehearsal today,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.500
but I didn't have that chance,
but I'm so thrilled to be here.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.930
And I'm going to be hearing
it fresh tonight with you.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.060
So, I can't wait to hear it.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.360
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Wonderful.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.070
Could all of you maybe share a
bit about how you started working

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.350
with Kati, or with each other?

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:01.650
&gt;&gt; RACHEL DESOER: Sure, we actually

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.310
as a quartet began a commissioning
project a couple of years ago now.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.290
We commissioned four
female, Canadian composers,

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:13.310
because we just wanted to expand
the repertoire for our genre

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.110
by female composers who are
still under represented.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.320
And so, we just looked basically

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.970
through every composer we'd ever
heard of from Canada and listened

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.210
to their works and Kati was
one of the four that really

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.570
that really jumped out to
us as just really strong

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:33.460
and we really just felt
connected to what she was writing.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.410
And so, we asked her and
she graciously agreed

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.300
to write us this 17-minute work.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.650
And since then we've
been learning the piece

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.140
and we've had some Skype sessions.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.430
And we've had a couple
of performances

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.730
that she's been able to attend.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.300
So, it continues to be a sort
of great collaboration of trying

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.350
to bring what she wrote to life.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.130
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: It's nice when your
piece has a life, it collectively.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.570
Now, now we have a bit
of a history with it.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.620
We've worked together in Toronto on
it, we've worked in Ottawa on it.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.720
We've done Skype from
Boston to Canada.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.330
And what happens is we all get
more of an investment in it.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.320
And that's really nice, it's
nice to see the piece grow

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.620
and our collaboration grow.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.030
And I think when I
first gave it to them,

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.490
they maybe weren't quite sure
exactly what I was giving them,

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:33.100
so I really thank them for having
confidence in me and faith in me

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:38.000
and learning about the
music, being so open to it.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.300
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Great.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.600
Anyone else?

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.900
Or did that cover it?

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.200
&gt;&gt; CAITLIN BOYLE: Yes,
that covered it [laughter].

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.960
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: The
title of your piece is

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.030
of course "Tantric Variations."

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.740
Could you tell us a little
bit about the through process

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.470
that went behind creating the piece
and then maybe also some thoughts

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.890
of the use of variation form.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.450
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: Yes, so Tantric
is from the Sanskrit Tan

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.230 position:56%
which means to weave out or to spin.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.010
So, we weaved this trans of our
nature into a unified whole.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.390
And I always have been fascinated
by variations, but I never,

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.390
this is my first time
working in variations.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.100
And the thing about
variations is it's usually,

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.390
composers usually do
discrete variations

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.400
because it's easier to do that.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.100
It's harder to make a long form,
a continuous form with them

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.750
because it's hard to have
enough textural contrast.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.720
But I'm really interested
in large form.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.700
I like my forms to be continuous,
not in separate movements.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.590
So, what I ended up
doing was taking a very,

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.380
very simple elemental motive.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:44.070 position:56%
It's just like a little turn figure,
or embellishing of a single note,

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.270
kind of like, daa,
da, da, da, da, dum.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.270
And I just use this motive
throughout the entire piece,

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:56.320
the entire piece is in
medication just on this one motive.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.350
But what I do is the motive
gets increasingly melodic

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.130
and it gets spun out as
the piece progresses.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.160
So, you hear it spun
into longer melodies

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.010
and then the variations start
to interrupt each other,

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.400
even invade each other so
the form becomes dynamic.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.430
And ultimately it's kind of a
purification process of this motive

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.310
because it flowers into a sort
of fuller version of itself.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.020
And what you should listen
for is there's a duet

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.360
between the two violins close
to the end where it sort

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.760
of reaches its full self.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.280
and then at the end
it gets distilled

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.700 position:56%
down to just a single note, because
we don't really need to turn anymore

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.130 position:56%
by that point, it's sort of
purified down, and so the piece ends

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.870
with just single harmonics
on the violins.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.270 position:56%
So, it's kind of like a purification
process that we all go on together,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.940
journey that we all go on.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.600
Me as the composer, and
you as the audience,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.990
and the quartet, obviously.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.520
And I think if I had to sum it up,

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.630
it would be like developing
variations then,

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.330
sort of like what Brahms would
have done, but my own version

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.380
of developing variations.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.680
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Very cool.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:04.740 position:56%
Maybe for the quartet, what have the
new discoveries been with the piece

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.100
from performance to performance.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.930
Now, I think this will be the fifth
performance overall, is that right?

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.230
Or fourth, something like that.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.490
It's in your program.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.530
So, like have there been
surprises from one venue

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.000
to another, or from one experience.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.510 position:56%
Or has there been feedback from Kati

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.400
that has changed the way you're
approached certain section

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.000
or variations.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.970
&gt;&gt; MIN-JEONG KOH: I think
we're extremely fortunate

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.610
that Kati's alive.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.080
Because musical notation
can be so limiting.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.290
So, a process like this or project

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:35.280
like this I think it really
teaches you that I think

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.080
when we play Beethoven, or other
pieces I think we shouldn't get

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.420
so hung up on you know
little musical notations

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:50.870
that I think could
somehow not be in line

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.590
with what the composer had in mind.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.290
And I think I mean because
you know people argue over it

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.480
and there's scholars and
there's all these things.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.780
But, no one would really know.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.450
No one really talked
to Beethoven, right.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.360
But we're lucky and this project
is awesome because we can Skype

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.540
or we can text her and say oh,
is this bowing what you meant?

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:10.650
And so, it's been an amazing
experience in that sense.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.640
Seeing the piece come
alive and for us

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.460
to like you know have
custody over it together and.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.420
&gt;&gt; CAITLIN BOYLE: Yeah, I
think in the beginning for me,

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.590
like when Kati gave it to us.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.450
It was very scary.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:29.370
Like, I think partly because you
said it was a large-scale work.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:33.320
So, I wasn't able to, well
it just took a while for me

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.150
to understand the form and
the different variations.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:44.090 position:56%
And so, as we play it more and more,
like I'm just able to hear more

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.340
and more of the different
textures and the different ways

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.100
that you developed the variations.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.980
So, it definitely is a process.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.390
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: And
Kati's writing is very

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.690
technically difficult.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.870
It's not. Well I mean you
don't, there's a lot of passages

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.400
that are quite challenging.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.330
Sorry, maybe that's going to
expose myself as incompetent.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.680
But, you know like I mean
some composers are, you know,

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:13.540
or in different pieces you know
they push the hardest more,

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.840
or more or less.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.870
But this, I think is,
yeah challenging.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.290
So, we had to do some you know
slow metronome practice for a while

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:25.040
on it before we were able
to really build it up, yeah.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.340
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Great.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:31.390
Kati, how does your style in
this piece compare or contrast

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.240
from your other compositions,

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.950
like your orchestral
works, or your vocal works?

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.910
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: Yeah, I had just
finished a big orchestral choral

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.570
work right before I started this
and it's called "Debrecen Passion."

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.890
And there are actually,
it was recorded

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.510
on an album of [inaudible] music.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.670
And that's for sale in the
lobby during intermission,

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.720
if you're interested.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.450
So, it was my Guggenheim piece.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:16:01.420
I had a Guggenheim Fellowship which
was a tremendous gift and I've been

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:06.010
so immersed in it for a year or
more and so when that was over

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.310
and I had to write the quartet.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.170
It was like starting
from scratch again.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.550
I didn't know how it would start.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:15.090
Because I was so just into
that piece and so I had

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.290
to do something completely
different.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.400
And just start again and
I think with each work,

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.920
I'm trying to distill things
down to a more pure approach.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.770
And, so I think this piece
does that a little bit.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.070
Hopefully.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: One question for
all of you is what are your thoughts

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:41.900
on the Canadian new music scene
and the American new music scene

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.090
and are there differences.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.990
What have your experiences been?

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.290
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: I wonder
what you think about that Kati,

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.380
because you have your hand in both.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.680
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: Yeah, so I'm
an American citizen too.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.410
So, the United States
is a much bigger pond.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.180
Well, you guys can tell me
what you think after I answer.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.810
But Canada is a much smaller pond.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.370
There's fewer composers.

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:08.270
There are amazing performing
artist, but fewer.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:14.540 position:56%
And so, when you're in this
country, it's kind of a little less,

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:21.770
it can be sort of cold, more
competitive and in a certain way.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.160
Whereas Canada supposedly
has government funding.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.650
Although that can be, like we
supposedly have a lot more funding

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.970
in Canada, but then it doesn't
always end up being true, so.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.460
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: It depends on
what province you're in as well,

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.250
the provinces support differently.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.940
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: Yeah, so one
is a little more aligned

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.240
with like the state.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.540
Like, I'm always getting
commissioned by,

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.860
like I got commissioned by
the government of Canada

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.660
to write a fanfare for the
150th anniversary of Canada.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.480
That would never happen here.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.220
Like, here one is like on one's own
and one just follows one's path.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.890
So, it's more like a
bit more state mandated

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.720
in Canada, or province mandated.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.450
So, I'm lucky that I
get to sort of live

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.200
in these two worlds
and do work in both.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.680
But what you guys think?

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.940
&gt;&gt; RACHEL DESOER: Yeah, I would
agree I mean I think it just

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.420
like everything else,
the major difference

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.870 position:56%
between the countries is population.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.170
And therefore, the
size of all that stuff.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:24.550 position:56%
So, I think that yeah, that's right,
what I'm always told by Americans is

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.220
that we have a lot
of funding in Canada.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.080
And then I see a lot of people

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.040
in America commissioning using
private foundation funds.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.630
So, it's always this thing of
like America has foundations

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.630
and Canada has government grants.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.670
And I don't really know
if one is more supportive

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.890 position:56%
than the other in the end, but yeah.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: It kind of evens out.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.700
&gt;&gt; RACHEL DESOER: Yeah.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.190
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Well, just
to give the audience a bit

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.160
of background on our
commissioning programs.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.910
We have a very interesting case
of modeling our commissions

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.400
on the public-private partnership.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.810
So, beginning in 1925 when Mrs.
Coolidge established the concert

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.470
series here, she really
wanted an institution to take

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.310
on the administration of her vision
to make the concerts and music

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.230
over to the public and available.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.400
But also, to have the
sense of permanence

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.500
that private foundations
often don't have.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.870
Unless you're like the
Guggenheim or that kind of thing.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.700
So, Mrs. Coolidge went to Congress.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.000
She was quite the character.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.320
Five years into voting rights
this woman went to Congress

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.640
and lobbied all kind of everyone
to get legislation enacted

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.660
to allow the government
to accept private funds

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.770
for cultural programming and
for building the concert hall.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.800
This hadn't happened
in this way before,

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.360
so it was really a novel thing.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.740
And since then, we've had
many other supporters.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.020
Some of you are here and come
to our concerts all the time,

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:53.280
who make these commissions possible
by giving financial contributions

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.400
or helping us get to
other foundations.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.080
And so, while we are, the Library
of Congress as the commissioner,

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.880
there's always a private foundation

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.190
or fund associated
with the commission.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:10.350
So, for example, our McKim Fund
commissions violin and piano works.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.430
It's the Library of
Congress McKim Fund.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.410
Or, Mrs. Coolidge's foundation
is the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.000
foundation in the Library
of Congress.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.230
So, here we are, the government's
administering all this,

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.970
but the government is not
necessarily giving the money

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.990
for the commissions.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.070
So far this model has worked very
well for protecting the integrity

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.090
of the series and making
sure it keeps going.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.020
I'm sure the audience
could guess why

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.820
that would be the case
in a public only model.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.630
So, we consider ourselves
very fortunate

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.920
to have this opportunity
to commission folks.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.040 position:56%
And it's always interesting to hear
what the other models are out there.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.660
And one of our favorite
things to do is

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.960
to co-commission with other people.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.300
So, if there's ever any ideas about
that, feel free to let us know.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.680
Great. So, one of the things
that I'd love to ask the quartet

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.130
about is your experience
seeing the manuscripts

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.930
that are just through there.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.760
So, there are some really
nice treats for all of you

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.010
to see before the concert,
including a Mozart manuscript

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:07.390
and a Heiden manuscript, as well
as a letter written by Mendelson

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.710
in which he describes
composing the quartet that is

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:12.010
on the program this evening.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.550
So, tell me a bit about your
experience seeing those.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:18.230
Because I know I totally
surprised it on you last night.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:23.870
&gt;&gt; CAITLIN BOYLE: Well, I think for
me, like sometimes I feel so far,

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.370
well I do and I don't,
but I feel so far

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:30.140
from music that's been written
so long ago, in one way.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.770
And I think seeing
manuscripts like this,

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:38.080
like makes me feel closer
somehow to this music.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.790
So, for me it is just incredible,
that it's just the right here.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.880
And even yeah, I was looking
around the library today

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.560
and it's just incredible, like the
artifacts and all the exhibitions

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.610
and the building itself, so.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.090
&gt;&gt; RACHEL DESOER: Yeah,
I'm always amazed

00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:00.060
by how unintelligible
manuscripts look to me because.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.410
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: As
well as Kati's [laughter].

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.660
&gt;&gt; RACHEL DESOER: Well, since
the computer age it's a lot

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:06.960
more intelligible.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.420
But actually, the Gubaidulina

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.990
that we're also playing is
also not computer generated.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.370
So, it's very hard to read.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.000
And it just makes just
admire the amount of research

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.640 position:56%
that actually goes into learning how

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.810
to read what the composer
probably meant.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.280
And research that we
don't really do much of.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.290
So, we kind of rely on people
who work in these libraries

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.700
and for publishers to like,
to decipher these manuscripts

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.520
and then publish them so
that we can understand.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.310
And then the other thing I
really noticed is Mendelson,

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:44.390
there's a beautiful little
painting in one of the letters,

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:45.710
I hope you'll check it out.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.560
And it's just so small
and detailed and gorgeous.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.760
That you know as we know Mendelson
was so great at writing literature,

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.300
and writing music, and painting,
and you know real Renaissance man.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.930
And so, does the beauty
of this painting is just,

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.660
struck me once again
in a negative way,

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.060
just how greedy some
people are [laughter].

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.510
At just being so talented
in so many areas.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.850
But it's really beautiful.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.580
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Great.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.490
One of the wonderful connections
between some of the items in there

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:19.050
and the concert is
that Mrs. Witthalll,

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.990
who of course donated the
instruments and built this room,

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:27.030
donated Mozart, Beethoven,
Schubert, Mendelson,

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.360
and Schoenberg manuscripts
to the library.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:35.140
And she's very much one of the
core reasons why we have the

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.570
world-renowned collection of
transcripts of European composers

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.080
that we have here at the library.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.010 position:56%
And for those of you who are the
nerdy type, and that's a good thing,

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:45.400
that is a badge of
honor in this building.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.230 position:56%
The high-resolution scans of most of
those items by these composers are

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.530
up online on our website.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.030
You can download them,
you can play from them

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:56.090
if you can decipher anything.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.400
So, enjoy them.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.620 position:56%
You can also print them out and make
them gifs, you know; gifs and gifts

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.180
if anyone's into make gifs.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:07.900
And so, I definitely encourage
you to check those resources out,

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.720
they're available at LOC.gov.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.020
And also in your program booklet

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.980
when you get them inside you'll
see some of the highlights

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.400
from the Mendelson collections
are listed specifically.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.890
And with some QR codes and
links for you to check out.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.650
One of the great manuscripts that
we have is the Octet manuscript,

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:27.180
which is kind of, just like
every time you get near it.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.940 position:56%
and while they were rehearsing last
night I was having fun putting items

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.920
in the cases with my
colleague Bob, so.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.950
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: There's something so
special about the handwritten score

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.450
that we're losing now with
all the computer annotation.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.150
And when one looks at those
scores one can see the personality

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:46.080
of the composer, just, one can
feel it just jumping off the page.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.380
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN:
Definitely and some of them,

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:52.040 position:56%
the Beethoven manuscripts of course,
it's just like scratching it out

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.390
and writing on top of things in
different types of pen or pencil,

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:59.270
and also the paper quality
differences are kind of interesting

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:04.310
to see from the 18th century
and early 19th century.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:08.210
Sometimes you can tell who was
working in a better situation,

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:12.050 position:56%
or who had a wealthier patron, that
kind of thing, by the paper quality.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.120
And then some of the like
19th century American stuff

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.810
around the Civil War is a little
dicey in terms of paper quality.

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:25.710
But, and what excites you all most
about the performance tonight?

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; MIN-JEONG KOH: Well, I don't know
if you've noticed but we have a bit

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.880
of a girl power theme going on.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.520
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: It's pretty
great, we love [laughter].

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.120
&gt;&gt; MIN-JEONG KOH: And being here
I think, I mean it's a huge honor

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.290
and we're excited to
bring Kati along with us

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.590
and to be playing Gubaidulina here.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:46.260
And like you said before, I mean
the library here is well known

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.030
for its beautiful collection
of instruments,

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.090
but it's also quite well known

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:54.040
because of the two leading women
philanthropists of that time.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.950
And I think it's just a huge
privilege and an honor for us

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.170
to be a part of that
celebration here.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.670
And she's a girl too, so.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.050
Yeah, girls.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:04.660
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Yes, we have
an extra member of the quartet

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.900
on board, which should
be really exciting.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.860
So, does she move when you play?

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.160
&gt;&gt; MIN-JEONG KOH: Yeah.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Oh, that's great.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.760
&gt;&gt; MIN-JEONG KOH: Only when
we play female composer,

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.370
I'm just kidding [laugther].

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:15.670
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: That's awesome.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.930
&gt;&gt; MIN-JEONG KOH: Just kidding.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.840
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: I'm really
honored to be on a program

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.260
with these composers, especially
Gubaidulina, whom I met in Paris

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.440
and was lovely and thank you
for performing living composers.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.020
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Oh, thank you
for giving us something to perform.

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:35.670
Yeah, you know that's one of the
big reasons why Mrs. Coolidge came

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:40.230
to us was because she that new
music component really kept safe

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.240
and is one of the best
things about our government.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.470
There's new music going on on
Capitol Hill, supported by Congress

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.740 position:56%
which I know most people would never
believe, but we're very thankful

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.710
for the opportunity to
be able to do this here

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.660
and to have a broader
community with composers

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.000 position:56%
and with artists such as yourselves.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.840
And I think as this point
we'll open up to Q&amp;A.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:04.220
To give you all a chance
to chat with the artists.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.620 position:56%
If you will just hold one second for
the microphone, I think Jay is going

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.410
to come around and get one.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:14.900
If you just hold your hands up for
a bit and Jay will, there you go.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.200
This is Jay.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.500
Everyone on camera world.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.980
Waive, Jay.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.810
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE 1: I want to
ask about the Canadian scene

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.140
and your two cultures
if there are differences

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:30.060
in the way music is created and you
know tastes and things like that.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:35.670
Because you have the French and
English aspect of your culture.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:39.010
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: I think all
the provinces are really different.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:42.710
We've been fortunate enough to be
able to travel over much of Canada,

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:44.110
actually from coast-to-coast.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:46.700
The only place that we haven't been
able to visit yet is the north,

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.750 position:56%
which I hope to go to someday, soon.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:53.020
But I've just been astounded
at how different each

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:56.000
of the provinces are,
each of the cities.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.560
Like real, there's
almost small cultures

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.190
within you know, each province.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.300
So, it's a little hard to give
sort of a broad generalization

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.060
to the whole country
because of that.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.430
And then, of course the individual
composers are all are so unique.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:13.560
I mean the four that we chose they
couldn't have been more different.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.360
Like one is into electronic
music, very heavily.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.030
You know one is into very, very
minimalist sort of textural music.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:25.260
It's been yeah, it's
been really enlightening.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.560
I don't know.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.010
I don't if that's a very
good answer for you but.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.040
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: But just,
maybe to just build upon that,

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.600
you're going to be recording
all four works, right.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.390 position:56%
Then in the next year or so there
should be a recording of those four?

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:38.690
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: That's right.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:40.530
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: So, you'll be
able to hear the range there,

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.110
between at least a small subset.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.350
But from composers from
different parts of Canada

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.240 position:56%
and different aesthetic backgrounds.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.170
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:56.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Oh, we'll go over
here, oh, Jay's got one in the back.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.870
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE 2: I'm curious to
know, you're such modern artists

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:08.350 position:56%
and composers yourselves and to
hold such old, old objects that it's

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:13.620
so rare in life to in particularly
on this continent to confront

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:18.700
or engage with such old objects,

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.260
or pieces of art, or
houses, or buildings.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:28.100 position:56%
And what that must be like from your
experiences as musicians and artists

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:32.670
to behold something so old
in such a modern world.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.690
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH:
Great fear [laughter].

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:40.310
Terror. Terror of being
sued for doing something.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.990
I'm just kidding [laughter].

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.320
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: We
wouldn't do that to you.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.740
&gt;&gt; CAITLIN BOYLE: I
think another thing

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.460
that I think the viola
has taught me is that,

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.190
I feel like it really
has its own voice.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:56.890
It's like, it has its
own personality.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.960
And it's kind of just
my job to kind of try

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.390
to release that or encourage it.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.870
I mean, I know that these
instruments actually don't get

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:10.250
played continuously so often.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:14.300
So, we also have to kind of,
it's our job a little bit

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:20.750
to warm them up, I think for you
know to play at that concert, but.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.290 position:56%
&gt;&gt; MIN-JEONG KOH: It's also amazing
to think that these instruments were

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:25.740
around when like Mozart

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.910
and Beethoven were
actually writing the music.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.750
And they were being performed
on these instruments.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:33.350
And we get to play on
them 200, or some 300,

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.110
I can't do math years later.

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:39.090
And like these instruments
will last even way after us.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:42.270
You know and they'll be servicing
millions of other artists.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.390
So, yeah it's incredible.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.380
&gt;&gt; RACHEL DESOER: Yeah, everything
we're playing tonight was written

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:52.910
after these instruments were made
by quite a significant amount.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:57.970
But I think this is maybe a little
corny but I felt this connection

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.860
when I first picked up
instrument and I was

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.710
like I know it's Stradivari
instrument from 1697.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:07.920
And it's like that's so wild that
it doesn't really enter me like,

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.570
I don't really understand
that concept.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.390
And then I'm playing it
and it sounds beautiful.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.490
And I'm tuning it to my
iPhone [laughter], right?

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:19.250
Because I have an app
that tells me my pitch.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.940
And I just felt this,
this is the corny part.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.990
I felt like this connection
of humanity.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:27.610
Like Stradivari made
this how many years ago.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:28.910
I am playing it.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:32.250
Technology is hearing
it, and yet it obviously,

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.270
its sound is current right.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:39.680
So, it's like this thread
of creating beautiful music

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.340
for hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:47.150
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: That was
lovely, it wasn't corny [laughter].

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:48.450
Okay.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:52.080
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE 3: So, that's actually
a good segue to the question I had

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:57.250
about the composition and
the name of the composition.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.880
But you alluded to Bach
variations and I'm wondering

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:06.700
about the Eastern music connection
as you were conceiving of the piece

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.150 position:56%
and the different sort of approaches

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:13.970
to that vibrational
thread coming through.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:18.220
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: I'm always thinking
about Bach and I'm always inspired

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.840
by Back every day I
think about Bach.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.800
And I think with developing
variations I was reference Brahms,

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.240
because he specifically
did developing variations.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.600
In terms of the Eastern, I'm very
interested in religion in general

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.610 position:56%
and spirituality and the common
threads between different religions.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:41.940
So, I think I was intrigued by
using this notion of tantric

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:46.010
and bringing it into a work.

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:49.960
In my own interpretation of it
of course, because I don't know.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.330
I'm not as well versed
in it as a lot of people,

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.810
but I just love something
about this idea of completeness

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.110
and looking for completeness.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:00.360 position:56%
Because it is something we all think
about and striving for completeness

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.210
in a musical work seemed
like a compelling thing.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:06.510
So.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:11.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE 3: So, there's no
tangible connection the [inaudible]?

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:16.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: Oh yeah, I had
written I had set a Sufi text prior.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.560
I was commissioned to
set a test in in Farsi,

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.920 position:56%
which was actually interesting
because I don't know Farsi and I had

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.110
to understand the pronunciation
and all the sounds

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.980
and work with Farsi speakers.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.970
But I had set a text
in Farsi and I think

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:32.030
that influenced actually
thanks for brining that up.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.330
I think that influenced.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.530
Because that was like
a few months before.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.430
So, that influenced how I
was thinking about this.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:41.540
It was the vocal piece, so.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.840
Yeah.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.540
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE 4: Thank you.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.250
I just wanted to go
back to the question

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:55.990
about what you called
the new music scene.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:00.600
You talked about it in terms of
funding between the US and Canada.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.670
But I was actually
interested in it from the point

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.890
of view of the music itself.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:09.980
You gave, such a beautiful
description of your piece

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.970
that we're going to hear tonight
and the variation, you know and how

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:17.780 position:56%
that will unfold as we listen to it.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.510
But I wondered, I'm
not a musician myself.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:26.020
I wondered what is really going
on in the new music scene,

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.750
if it is a scene, musically
what you're finding interesting,

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.050
you know maybe you have

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:35.340
to name favorite composers
really to answer the question.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.970
But if you'd say just a
little bit about that.

00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:42.170
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Yeah, I'll let
you all go first, then I will.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.090
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: I mean we
live in very pluralistic age.

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:47.130
So, what we're seeing now
especially in the last 10

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:53.420
or 15 years is it becoming
mainstream to bring influences

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.500
from other kinds of
music into concert music.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:00.140
So, folk music, pop music
rap, whatever it may be.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.190
Composers are synthesizing all
of these different influences.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:09.710
And what would have been before a
more marginal thing is now becoming

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.010
more mainstream.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:15.020
So, we're seeing more and
more different approaches.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.990
And as far as, do you guys
want to build from that?

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.580
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: Yeah,
I think diversity of style.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.140
I think composers are they sound,

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.690
well I mean the sense I get is
composers sound more different

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.820
from each than maybe every before.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:33.350
Yeah I don't know if
anyone else wants.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.310
But I mean we know I mean
like one of the composers

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.110
that we commissioner
from Québec actually.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.490
So, she's a French
composer, named Nicole Lizee.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:45.910
She was very influenced by
electronic music, dance music.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:49.600
And a lot of sort of
lesser-known musical trends,

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.770
like I can't remember it
was like ghosts something.

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:54.770
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: Yeah, she's
really into like the turntable.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.190
She played with turntables
in her basement and she did

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.990
like the scratching
on the record players.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.290
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: Yeah,

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.590
and that's actually
an interesting trend.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:04.890
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: It's a retro analog.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:06.190
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH:
Yeah, so I composers know

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:09.600
that they can't ignore technology
and a lot of them are sort

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.950
of you know trying to tap
into it and be inspired by it,

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.720
which is really interesting
for us actually.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.670
Working on that piece was unusual
because we fully understood

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:21.750
where these sound ideas were coming
from, but we're playing as you said

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:26.650
on you know antiques that were
really never meant to be used

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:28.190
to make these kinds of sounds.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:32.130
So, we really had to work
hard to come up with an idea

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:35.180
of how we were going to bring
that across on our instruments.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.440
And then also, well I mean,
this is more international.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.490 position:56%
But I mean like we played a composer
a couple years ago from England

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.160
who is very inspired by rap

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.010
and really synthesized
that into his music.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.510
So, that was like a
whole other sound.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:56.090
We actually, we run a competition
at the University of Toronto

00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:00.350
where we're in residence,
where we challenge the students

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:04.340
to write a string quartet,
15-minute string quartet.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.890
And we choose one and we
premier and record it.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.940 position:56%
And yeah, all the, well the one
that we choose this year was written

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:15.840
by a woman who is very
inspired by her Balkan heritage.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.820 position:56%
So, it sounds a lot like folk music.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.530
So that's kind of more
drawing from the past.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.240
Very, very different
from Kati's, piece,

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.910
from piece from Nicole
Lizee's piece, from you know.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.940
&gt;&gt; KATI AGOCS: But if you want
specific names, I mean ensembles

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.020
like this have to curate
right, they have to listen

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.320
to tons of music and choose.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.700
So, you can look at an ensemble
like this, who they programmed.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.760
And it will be interesting.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.450
There will be some
consistent threat.

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:42.050
Or another ensemble that you like,
they play and you can see what new,

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:43.380
what new music are they doing.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.770
And so, that can be a good entrée.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.620
Because I know it can
be a bit overwhelming.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.520
Like how do you find the
composers out there that are good

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.740
and who to learn about and.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:57.710 position:56%
But you can trust them because
they're spent, they've devoted a lot

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:04.470 position:56%
of time to learning about the music
and choosing what they want to play.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.360
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: And from the
presenter's side I 'll throw

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.730 position:56%
in some comments and hopefully not
get into anything too controversial.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:15.690
But presenting contemporary
music is a complex thing, right?

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:21.110
So, we have what mainstream society
is trending on at a given moment.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:23.010
We have what major
orchestras are programming,

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.410
which might be more
conservative or less conservative,

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.880
depending on what city,
what country.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:34.780
I think there's a sense of global
connections between styles of music

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.290
that are person-to-person based.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:40.260
So, you might have like, Kati
came to study in New York

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.640
and worked with Milton Babbitt.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.940
And now you're based in Boston.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.400
So, you have all these
connections out of that location.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.430
And so it's not necessarily

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:50.640
that you're inviting this
Canadian style all the time,

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.730
you're creating your own
style that's informed

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.320
by all these different touchpoints.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.190
And I think one of the things
that presenters struggle with is

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:02.660
that we can't represent all of the
great new music that's out there.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:05.090
And if you compare any
presenter to another presenter,

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:07.000
you'll see that it's not
all the same composers,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.880
there might be some overlap.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.130
There might be certain artists,
or composers are being picked

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.980
up by certain radio stations,
and others who are not.

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.970
But I think my recommendation

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:19.000
and probably everyone else's
recommendation would be to listen

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.160
to as much as you can and make up
your own decisions about what you

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.600
like and what you don't like.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.240
There are contemporary
music radio stations online.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.930
There are concerts that you
can go to that are free,

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.480
like at the Library of Congress
where you can hear new things.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.840
You can also you know go to any
public library in the country

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.550
and use their digital
subscription service,

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:41.280
like DC Public Library has freegle,
where you can actually go on

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.710
and download free MP3s every week.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.010
Who knew that?

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:46.310
Completely free.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:47.610
So, take advantage of that.

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:50.800
And, so it's not this culture
where you're just listening

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.430
to X radio station, it's based
in New York and get their view

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.250
of what's good in contemporary
music.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:01.430
We have so much access to good
and bad information nowadays

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:04.690
that my personal suggestion
is to really go

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.090
out there and explore on your own.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.550
And listen to what people
are recommending, of course,

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:13.560 position:56%
like you know Alex Russ in "The New
Yorker" he has certain things to say

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.090
that a lot of people appreciate.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.860
Or some people might
not appreciate them.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.220
But Alex Russ isn't going to
cover all of the great things

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:24.980 position:56%
that are going on in the music scene
whether it's in DC, or New York,

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.860
or Toronto, or anywhere else.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.350
So, it's kind of this sense of
having your ear to the ground

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:33.800
and really forming your
own set of preferences.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.100
Which I think is a
healthy way to go.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.410 position:56%
Do you all listen to the same music?

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:39.940
Probably not right?

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.240
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: Some of
us listen to Silas [laughter].

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.670
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Do any
of you avoid listening

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:50.380
to music in your off time?

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.680
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: Sometimes.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.980
&gt;&gt; CAITLIN BOYLE: Me, yeah.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.280
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: Yeah.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.580
More and more over the
years, I've just been

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.030
like you know I just
want to hear my fridge.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:02.780
&gt;&gt; CAITLIN BOYLE: Well, I think
it's, like when we spend like 6

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:07.150
or 8 hours a day listening
as our like primary job.

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:14.010
When you go home sometimes you do
want time just for a little break.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.310
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Definitely.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:16.610
Any other questions?

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:17.910
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE 5: Yeah.

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:21.390 position:56%
Would you tell us a little bit
about Canadian music conservatories,

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:25.500 position:56%
especially The University of Toronto
and is there a concerted effort

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.860
to keep the best musicians
in Canada,

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.640 position:56%
not send them to Julliard or Curtis?

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.790
And can you tell us a
little bit about all

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:36.730 position:56%
of your music education backgrounds?

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.970
&gt;&gt; SARAH NEMATALLAH: Well Min and
I, well actually three of us now.

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:44.140
So, Min and I were actually
students together at The University

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.890
of Toronto in our undergrad
and we sat beside each other

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:48.190
in orchestra and everything.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:54.400
And so, and Caitlin also attended
the Royal Conservatory in Toronto

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.410
and then she went to
Europe later on.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:01.900
And Rachel you studied in
the states primarily right.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.550
We also spent some time at McGill.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:09.810
And yeah I don't know what
you guys would say about.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:11.520
&gt;&gt; RACHEL DESOER: Well,
I was going to say,

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.080
it's actually very strange being
in this room because on this side

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.130 position:56%
of the room I'm a defector for
going to the United States to study.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:19.950
And then on your side of the
room I'm someone who came

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:21.800
to your lovely country to study.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.800
Anyway. So, yeah.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.950
I would say that there's a concern,
just to address your questions

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:30.720
about trying to keep students.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.350
There's a concern about the brain
drain for our musicians as well

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:36.060
as everything else that Canadians.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.730
Because it is smaller
place with fewer schools

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:41.840
and less competitive,
and all that stuff.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.470
And people end up a lot of the time
going to other countries to study.

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:51.260
That being said, I think we
have a few strong schools.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.800
The University of Toronto
being one of them.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:58.460
And there are a lot of people who
just love living in Canada so much

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:03.040 position:56%
that they decided to stay and get
great educations like Min and Sarah.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.870
So, I don't know I mean
there's definitely fewer options

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:11.940 position:56%
and they are in the major cities,
right, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.470
Those are kind of the only major
cities by an American standpoint.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:19.520
And that's where we all end up.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.290
&gt;&gt; MIN-JEONG KOH: Things are
already I think much different

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:24.990
for our students we
mentor and teach,

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:27.870 position:56%
compared to how things were you know
when we were applying for school.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:31.610
I don't remember there being
online applications or there things

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:36.270
and I think, there
was a bit of a fear,

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:39.820
or you know I think people always
wondered what the outside world was

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.850
like, and I think a lot of people
sort of were lured by that.

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:45.340
And I think it's great,
I think, I mean even back

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.300
in like you know the 1700s or
whatever I think, composers

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:53.870
or musicians would travel afar to
meet new teachers and to be able

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.840
to play for different people
so I think that's wonderful

00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:02.570
and we do encourage students to
travel, among many other things.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:06.260
But now with the technology
and YouTube

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.630
and all these apps and Apple Music.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:12.030
I mean we can listen to and
watch whatever we please.

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:13.330
There's Medici TV.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:16.060 position:56%
There's, you know what I mean all of
these things weren't available to us

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.820
at our fingertips before.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:21.660
And now, they all are
you know available.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:26.140
I mean it's never the same as going
to a live performance and having

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.700
that experience in person.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.360
But I think the students
nowadays have a huge advantage

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.080
of being wherever they
are, being able to study

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.370
with whoever they want on Skype.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:37.850
A lot of teachers do that now.

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:40.640
You know there's Zookermen
among many others.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:46.460
So, yeah, I think there are
advantages and disadvantages

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:50.860
for both, staying in
Toronto and going abroad.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.220
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: If anyone
goes to visit Toronto,

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.870
the Royal Conservatory
building is just incredible.

00:44:55.870 --> 00:45:00.800
How long about was it the
renovation or the remodel of that?

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.820
&gt;&gt; CAITLIN BOYLE: Yeah,
fairly recently.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.690
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: So,
literally if you go to Toronto,

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:08.270
form my recommendation, top of your
list in terms of things to see.

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:10.780
It was really spectacular and there
were historical instruments all

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.080
over the place.

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.380
And there's this connection
between the older architecture

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.210
and the contemporary architecture.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.850
So, I think we have time for one
last short question, which we'll do

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:20.150
up here and then we'll have

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:23.210
to let the artists go
to have a little break.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:26.010
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE 6: Could you talk a
little bit about the difficulty

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:31.510
if there is difficulty in
moving between classical,

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:36.630
western music to the pieces
represented in your program tonight

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:41.340
and contemporary music,
in adjusting your playing,

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.640
the way in which you use
your instruments going

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:49.530
from one to the other.

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:54.020
&gt;&gt; CAITLIN BOYLE: Well
I think one thing for me

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.060
about new music is just,

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:59.950
or contemporary music is
the extended techniques

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:04.580
that composers now ask you to do.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:09.040
So, they're asking you to kind
of pull like a huge variety

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.990
of sounds out of your instrument.

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:14.970
So, you'll listen to the
beginning of Kati's piece.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:19.420
So, that's just like a much, yeah,
it's a much different technique.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:23.950
And so, I think that in one sense
the sound scape, just the variety

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:29.310
of sounds that we work
with really expands

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:32.420
and then there's also some staging.

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.870
Some staging things.

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:39.590
So, yeah there's a lot, there's a
big variety that we have to kind

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:46.280
of coordinate and know how
to do for contemporary music.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.570
&gt;&gt; RACHEL DESOER: For me I
think the major difficulty is

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:53.860
that no matter how many hours we
practice, we will never know one

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:57.470
of these new pieces as well as
a Mozart or a Mendelson quartet,

00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:59.890
simply because we haven't
been living

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:02.970
with that musical language
for most of our lives.

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:04.270 position:56%
And as we were talking about earlier

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:06.700
with the different
styles of each composer.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:09.860
I really feel like each new
piece I get is a completely

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.160
different language.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.460
Like, I'm not only
learning the music,

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.300
I'm learning the language
it's written in.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:19.790
So, it's really wonderful and
challenging, but I really feel

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:26.680
as though I don't know really the
piece I'm playing nearly as well

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.000
as I will in like 25 years.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.680
And that's just the
way it is, you know.

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:34.370
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS BROWN: Wonderful.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:37.090
Well thank you all so much
for sharing your insights

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:39.990
and experiences and also
answering the questions.

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:44.590
We'll invite you all to join us in
the hall of course in a little bit.

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:47.630
The doors should open at
about 730 to the auditorium.

And please, please, please take
some time to check out the artifacts

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:52.270
that are on display in the cases.

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:56.960
They're really spectacular and
we are just so thrilled and giddy

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.090
to be sharing them
with you, as always.

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:02.120
And CDs will be available
for sale both for the quartet

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:05.730
and for Kati's recent
orchestral CD, that was released

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:07.860 position:56%
by Boston Moderns Orchestra Project.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.460
And are you going to
be signing afterwards?

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:11.840
Or? Yeah. Okay.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.730
So, if you want them to sign
they'll be available afterwards.

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:18.700
Sarah's husband Don will be taking
care of business in there for you.
