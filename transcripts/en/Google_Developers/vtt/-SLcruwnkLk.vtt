00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:03.534
Ohye: All right.
Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:07.033
My name is Maile Ohye, and I'm
a developer programs tech lead

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:09.267
with Google
Webmaster Central.

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:10.667
So today
is gonna be great

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:14.667
because I know all of you
can make a great site for users,

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:16.567
and we're gonna combine
that knowledge that you have

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:19.367
to create a site for users
with new knowledge

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:22.367
about how to create a site
that's search engine smart,

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:23.667
and then
between the two,

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:25.567
you have a really
powerful experience

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:28.167
that can get a lot
of conversions on your site.

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:31.100
So today's goal
for me is actually

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.601
to create a really
good environment

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:36.167
where all of you can feel like
we're learning from each other.

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:38.267
So you have questions
that you can ask me,

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:40.200
I have stuff I'm gonna
show you in my slides,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.067
as well as present some examples
of things not to do.

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:45.434
So if you happen
to see something

00:00:45.434 --> 00:00:48.234
that you've done before
on the slide,

00:00:48.234 --> 00:00:51.701
and you think to yourself,
"Oh, gosh, that's me!"

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:54.167
remember that in this session
there's gonna be no shame.

00:00:54.167 --> 00:00:57.400
So you could just
take this lesson learned,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.067
get home, fix it
at some point,

00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:00.200
and we're all
gonna move forward.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.634
All right.

00:01:01.634 --> 00:01:06.300
So here's to a great
Web experience for all of us.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.334
In the agenda,
first I'll just do an overview,

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:11.534
telling you about
some basic things

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:13.000
about what
I'm gonna talk about.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.100
Next we'll talk about
the size of the Web puzzle.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.634
And what this means is just
how Google's Search engineers

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:23.501
start to understand
how we crawl and index the Web.

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:26.467
And then after that, we'll do
Search friendly development

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:28.133
from start to finish.

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.901
So that means
from planning your site.

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:33.167
And that's in italics
because we actually have

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:35.601
a small announcement
to make there.

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:37.701
Then to designing
your site.

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.100
Next we'll get
to choosing technologies.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.334
So now that you've
planned a site

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.467
and you've started
some site architecture,

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:46.601
you can think about things
like Flash and JavaScript.

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:48.868
Next we'll talk
about making the page.

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:52.067
So what you can put
in the head of your HTML file.

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:55.534
And then adding content
like text, images, and videos,

00:01:55.534 --> 00:01:57.400
as well as responding
appropriately

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.701
with response codes.

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.501
And then engaging
the community.

00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:02.934
It's a big presentation,
but if you have questions,

00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:08.467
just go up to the mic
and I'll take those at any time.

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:10.467
All right,
so in a nutshell,

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:11.934
if you were to leave
in five minutes

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:14.467
and didn't want to hear these
cool announcements I have,

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:17.367
what I want to let you know is
there's an SEO Starter Guide.

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:19.901
So if you just query
"Google SEO Starter Guide,"

00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:21.000
you'll probably
get that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.367
And it's just
some basic ideas.

00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:26.167
After that, read the FAQs
in our Help Center,

00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:28.734
verify your site
in Webmaster Tools,

00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:31.434
keep your site clean
and secure--secure is a big one.

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:35.100
And then, of course, subscribe
to our blog to get updates.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.534
And then if you have
specific questions,

00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:40.968
you can go to our
Webmaster help forum.

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:42.534
And there it's
monitored by Googlers

00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:44.667
and also by super users
in our community--

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:46.100
We have some here today--

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.901
in over 15 languages.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.367
So that's everything
that you need to do,

00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:50.567
but we're gonna
go into

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:53.801
some great detail here
in this presentation.

00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:57.634
First, I just need to give a
mention as to what my focus is.

00:02:57.634 --> 00:03:00.467
We're gonna be talking
about organic search,

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:01.834
and there's a big
difference between that

00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:03.834
and the paid search
that's advertising.

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:05.367
So again,
this is organic search,

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:06.801
where it's free
to participate

00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:10.567
and there isn't money
changing hands.

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:14.934
All right, this is the size
of the Web puzzle.

00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:19.100
And what this is is a picture
of a globe, the Earth,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.601
which represents
the World Wide Web.

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.934
So that's a very vast
Internet and Web experience.

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:26.567
Inside that
we have a subset,

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:28.834
and that's gonna be
the yellow circle.

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:30.334
So the yellow circle
is everything

00:03:30.334 --> 00:03:31.734
that Google
is able to crawl,

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:33.868
and we know we haven't
reached the end of the Web yet.

00:03:33.868 --> 00:03:37.100
So again, that's a subset
of the entire Web.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.400
And then within that
is what we can actually index

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.701
and return
in search results,

00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:42.400
And that's
the green segment.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.234
So it's not enough just to make
a site and stick it on the Web.

00:03:45.234 --> 00:03:47.067
Right? Because there's
so much out there.

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:48.901
You actually need
to make it crawl-able,

00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:50.434
inside that
yellow circle,

00:03:50.434 --> 00:03:53.133
and then even furthermore,
return in search results,

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:54.701
you'd have to be
inside the green.

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.901
So there's steps you can
take along the way

00:03:56.901 --> 00:04:02.133
to make sure that your site
appears in search results.

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:04.601
You can see evidence of this
in Webmaster Tools.

00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.534
Here if you submit
a site map,

00:04:06.534 --> 00:04:08.567
in that red circle,
you'll actually notice

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:11.634
here's all the URLs
we extracted from your sitemap,

00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:13.100
but even
a smaller number--

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.834
in this case about 700 less,
is what's actually in our index.

00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:18.868
So again, we can't
index everything

00:04:18.868 --> 00:04:20.601
because a lot of it's
boilerplate

00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:22.367
duplicate content
information,

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:23.801
so you really want
to make sure

00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:25.267
that we can not only
crawl your site,

00:04:25.267 --> 00:04:29.501
but we actually index a large
majority of your good content.

00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:31.467
This is what our engineers
have to face.

00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:33.834
But let's look
at Webmaster Tools now.

00:04:33.834 --> 00:04:36.100
If you haven't verified
your site in Webmaster Tools,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.801
I'd like
to introduce you.

00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:40.067
So Webmaster Tools,
this is the audience.

00:04:40.067 --> 00:04:42.801
Hello, developers.
This is Webmaster Tools.

00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:44.334
Here you have
Message Center,

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:46.801
which is a great way for us
to communicate with you

00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:48.701
any notification
we might have.

00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:51.734
So one might be, which is
the second notification here,

00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:53.901
is that we're actually
telling webmasters

00:04:53.901 --> 00:04:55.901
that they have malware.

00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:57.434
So again, that's something
you might not know.

00:04:57.434 --> 00:04:59.234
You might just kind of someday
realize you have

00:04:59.234 --> 00:05:01.167
a malware notice when you
click through to your site.

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.534
But you could have
found that out

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:05.834
if your were also verified
in Webmaster Tools.

00:05:05.834 --> 00:05:09.234
You can actually verify
multiple sites here.

00:05:09.234 --> 00:05:12.400
And verification
is really simple.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.467
It's just an HTML file
in your root directory

00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:19.834
or a metatag that you put
on your home page.

00:05:19.834 --> 00:05:21.868
All right.
So moving on.

00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:23.300
Planning for a new site.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.701
This is very exciting;
it's like planning for a baby.

00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:30.400
All right, so full steam ahead
if you have some great idea.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.868
Great ideas would be,

00:05:31.868 --> 00:05:34.133
"I have unique content
that I'm gonna create,"

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:36.901
or "I have a compelling
product or service."

00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:38.701
Now, unique content
in this example

00:05:38.701 --> 00:05:41.634
is my cousin's
wedding blog.

00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:43.968
So good for her
for getting online.

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.167
Anyway,
she tells you about

00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:47.267
the tuxedos
that they're picking out,

00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:48.434
and flower arrangements,

00:05:48.434 --> 00:05:51.234
which is really exciting
for a lot of people,

00:05:51.234 --> 00:05:52.601
and the next part
is just Google,

00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:55.367
so if you have a good service,
or you have great content,

00:05:55.367 --> 00:05:57.067
look to make a site.

00:05:57.067 --> 00:05:59.601
You might want to fine-tune
your business plan, however,

00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:01.868
if you're just looking to have
a made for AdSense site,

00:06:01.868 --> 00:06:03.767
looking to get clicks.

00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:06.367
This is actually
my ex-office mate's site

00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:07.701
before I came to Google.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.133
He did a lot of these,
where not much is being said,

00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:12.100
he's just trying
to get some ads.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.100
Kind of just pollutes
the Web, I think.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.000
So when it comes to
selecting a domain name,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.868
you want to think about what
you want your site to target.

00:06:20.868 --> 00:06:23.834
So there's a lot of ways
you can do this.

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:25.601
If you want to target
international visitors

00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:26.868
from all over the world,

00:06:26.868 --> 00:06:28.667
you might want to get
something like a .com

00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:30.767
or a .net or .info.

00:06:30.767 --> 00:06:32.667
Or alternatively,
you can get

00:06:32.667 --> 00:06:36.100
the .co.fr versions
of your same domain.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.601
But again there's
a two-pronged approach here.

00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:43.934
So know that if you want to get
a ccTLD, country-specific,

00:06:43.934 --> 00:06:46.300
then you can only target
users in that region,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.367
at least through Google.

00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:49.634
So if you get, like,
an example.com--

00:06:49.634 --> 00:06:53.000
I'm sorry--example.fr,
you can't then use that domain

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.634
to target users
in the United States.

00:06:54.634 --> 00:06:59.000
It's going to be specifically
for a French audience.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.133
The next thing you want
to do is also think about

00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:04.934
hosting yourself or hosting on
Blogger, WordPress or AppSpot.

00:07:04.934 --> 00:07:08.167
And most cases people say if you
like to get the most authority,

00:07:08.167 --> 00:07:09.300
then you're gonna
want to self-host

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.801
just to show
your own domain.

00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:15.067
And the next part is about
choosing a www

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:17.601
or non-www version
of your site.

00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:20.100
And this is important
because of page rank dilution.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.701
You don't want two versions
of your site out there

00:07:21.701 --> 00:07:23.501
that people can
link to, you know,

00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:26.367
dispersing your links
between two sites.

00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:29.267
So...dang.
Page rank dilution.

00:07:29.267 --> 00:07:30.868
So again I wanted
to keep this friendly

00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:33.100
so that we don't kind of
shame any site,

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.801
but I do a simple query
for, like, mobile phones,

00:07:35.801 --> 00:07:37.801
and here is one
that comes up.

00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:39.901
And I kind of tried
to white out their name,

00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:41.234
but obviously
you can see they have

00:07:41.234 --> 00:07:46.033
two versions
of the same thing running.

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:48.234
With the geographic target
that we talked about,

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.801
you can actually set this
in Webmaster Tools.

00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:53.467
So again, if you have
a country-generic TLD,

00:07:53.467 --> 00:07:55.801
then you can go ahead
and pull down

00:07:55.801 --> 00:07:57.667
to select where
you want it targeted to.

00:07:57.667 --> 00:07:59.334
If you're just
targeting users

00:07:59.334 --> 00:08:01.234
for a certain language
like Spanish,

00:08:01.234 --> 00:08:03.334
then you shouldn't be using
this geographic targeting tool.

00:08:03.334 --> 00:08:07.801
It's just for
a specific region.

00:08:07.801 --> 00:08:10.234
The next thing you want to do
is determine where to host.

00:08:10.234 --> 00:08:11.501
So I wanted
to list this here

00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:13.534
just to give you a rundown
of all the factors.

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:16.801
So when you pick a domain, we're
gonna look at different factors

00:08:16.801 --> 00:08:19.133
to determine where
you're trying to target.

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:21.834
So first we look at TLD,
as we've talked about.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:23.601
Next we're gonna look
at whether or not you set

00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:26.200
a geographic target
in Webmaster Tools,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.434
and then next we're gonna look
at your Web server's IP address.

00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:31.801
So if you give us none
of the other two signals,

00:08:31.801 --> 00:08:33.834
then you want
to choose a Web server

00:08:33.834 --> 00:08:37.000
and a location where you're
gonna also serve your users.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.467
This can run into problems,
like, say in Europe,

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:39.701
we've seen this before,

00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:41.167
where they're hosting
maybe in Switzerland,

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:42.934
but they want to target
users in Spain,

00:08:42.934 --> 00:08:44.834
but they've set
nothing else up for us,

00:08:44.834 --> 00:08:46.734
so actually that becomes
kind of something

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:48.267
that you might
want to think about

00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:51.133
when it comes
to Web server IP.

00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:54.367
Another question you might have
is about using shared hosting.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.467
So say you say,
"I'm gonna use shared hosting,

00:08:56.467 --> 00:08:58.467
"but I don't trust
anyone else on there.

00:08:58.467 --> 00:09:01.067
"There might be spammers there
who're doing bad things,

00:09:01.067 --> 00:09:03.300
you know, I might be associated
with bad neighborhoods,"

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.501
and that's actually
not the case;

00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:06.000
we'll actually
keep those separate.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.567
So if you use
shared hosting, don't worry

00:09:07.567 --> 00:09:12.267
about repercussions from other
domains on the same host.

00:09:12.267 --> 00:09:13.334
And the next thing.

00:09:13.334 --> 00:09:14.801
If you actually
buy your domain

00:09:14.801 --> 00:09:17.567
from someplace
like GoDaddy or you use Strato,

00:09:17.567 --> 00:09:21.667
they use the Webmaster Tools API
and Access Provider Program.

00:09:21.667 --> 00:09:23.834
And what this allows them
to do is automatically,

00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:26.167
once you purchase your site,
also verify your site

00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:29.033
with Webmaster Tools,
and then give you Clickthrough

00:09:29.033 --> 00:09:31.367
to Webmaster Tools
kind of using Google Apps.

00:09:31.367 --> 00:09:32.767
So all of that
can be available

00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:34.701
if you use something
like GoDaddy.

00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:37.501
Which leads me
to the Webmaster Tools API.

00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:39.567
So here's our first little
product announcement.

00:09:39.567 --> 00:09:42.501
We have a GData API
that currently has functionality

00:09:42.501 --> 00:09:45.934
like add and remove sites,
submit sitemaps,

00:09:45.934 --> 00:09:48.033
verify your site,
change settings--

00:09:48.033 --> 00:09:49.434
a whole bunch
of these things.

00:09:49.434 --> 00:09:51.067
But we're adding
more and more on.

00:09:51.067 --> 00:09:53.834
What was just recently added
was crawl errors.

00:09:53.834 --> 00:09:55.000
And so hopefully
in the future

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.601
we'll get this
more and more robust,

00:09:56.601 --> 00:09:59.300
and if you're developing sites
for multiple people,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.534
then you can use this
to actually

00:10:00.534 --> 00:10:02.367
manage and maintain
these sites

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:04.267
and understand
how they're doing

00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:09.033
in search results,
and also with our crawler.

00:10:09.033 --> 00:10:11.367
Moving on
to designing your site.

00:10:11.367 --> 00:10:12.834
This is a pretty
meaty topic.

00:10:12.834 --> 00:10:15.000
We're gonna talk
about site architecture.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.868
This is important
in three main areas.

00:10:16.868 --> 00:10:19.000
So users can find
what they want,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.467
so crawlers access
their good-quality content,

00:10:22.467 --> 00:10:24.667
and also so that
as a search engine

00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:26.901
we index your content
optimally.

00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:30.334
So let's talk
about first for users.

00:10:30.334 --> 00:10:32.367
A big thing
is navigation.

00:10:32.367 --> 00:10:33.868
So you want
easy navigation

00:10:33.868 --> 00:10:36.000
for your users
in these three main areas.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.434
First, when they come
to your site,

00:10:37.434 --> 00:10:39.133
they can determine
their location.

00:10:39.133 --> 00:10:41.167
What helps with that
are things like breadcrumbs.

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:43.067
Right, if they clicked
a link from somewhere else,

00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:44.801
to, let's say,
women's high heels,

00:10:44.801 --> 00:10:47.868
they want to know "what category
is this and how did I get here?"

00:10:47.868 --> 00:10:50.934
So breadcrumbs give them a good
indicator of where they're at.

00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:52.367
Next a user's
probably going to ask

00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:53.667
about "where do
I want to go?

00:10:53.667 --> 00:10:55.434
I know where I want to go--
how do I get there?"

00:10:55.434 --> 00:10:57.934
And you want to help your users
get where they want to go.

00:10:57.934 --> 00:11:00.133
So things that are helpful
are a search box,

00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:02.501
logical category
navigation,

00:11:02.501 --> 00:11:05.033
and also think about
if they come to a child page,

00:11:05.033 --> 00:11:06.868
how can they get back
to the home page?

00:11:06.868 --> 00:11:08.133
Or if they come
to your home page,

00:11:08.133 --> 00:11:12.133
how can they get
to the appropriate child page?

00:11:12.133 --> 00:11:15.167
You also want to let them know
what they've already visited.

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:16.834
And this comes
in the form of links

00:11:16.834 --> 00:11:18.334
that are colored
when they're visited,

00:11:18.334 --> 00:11:23.534
also in maybe things like
"Items you've also looked at."

00:11:23.534 --> 00:11:26.200
So that's for users
in terms of navigation.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.801
Now for users
for URL structure.

00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:30.701
Shareable URLs
are always good.

00:11:30.701 --> 00:11:31.868
So that I can have a URL,

00:11:31.868 --> 00:11:33.267
I can give it
to my friend through email,

00:11:33.267 --> 00:11:35.734
and they can find
the exact same item.

00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:39.300
Descriptive filenames also help
users as well as search engines.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.367
So you have keywords here
separated by hyphens,

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.968
like "g1-phone."

00:11:43.968 --> 00:11:46.167
And then, of course,
you have lowercase URLs

00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:48.868
for the safest
implementation.

00:11:48.868 --> 00:11:50.834
Meaning that users
might manually

00:11:50.834 --> 00:11:53.400
type this into their browser;
it's easier if it's lowercase.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.067
Also if it comes
to wanting to block content.

00:11:56.067 --> 00:11:58.501
Keep in mind that "Robots.txt"
is case sensitive,

00:11:58.501 --> 00:12:00.834
so it's harder to do
combinations of every word

00:12:00.834 --> 00:12:05.200
if you're using a "Robots.txt"
file with mixed case.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.801
Now let's get into site
architecture for search engines.

00:12:10.801 --> 00:12:12.000
You want to
first think about

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.434
what's gonna be
private versus public,

00:12:13.434 --> 00:12:15.534
and secure
that private data.

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:19.000
When it comes to having a site
that has adult content,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.133
think about separating
adult content

00:12:21.133 --> 00:12:22.734
from family-friendly
content.

00:12:22.734 --> 00:12:25.267
And this is because
for things like SafeSearch,

00:12:25.267 --> 00:12:27.000
it's much easier
for us to filter

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.567
if we see a directory structure
that's logical.

00:12:29.567 --> 00:12:31.934
So I don't know
who does adult sites,

00:12:31.934 --> 00:12:35.167
but go ahead and separate
that between the two.

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:36.767
And of course,
for search engines,

00:12:36.767 --> 00:12:38.400
static links are
always best, right,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.634
because we can follow those,
and they have good anchor text.

00:12:41.634 --> 00:12:44.367
Keep important pages
well-linked from the home page.

00:12:44.367 --> 00:12:46.801
This means don't hide it
in some child leaf node;

00:12:46.801 --> 00:12:48.200
if it's a really
important product,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.467
bring that up and link it
from the home page.

00:12:50.467 --> 00:12:51.934
And of course
submit a sitemap.

00:12:51.934 --> 00:12:55.501
These are xml sitemaps,
often from sitemaps.org,

00:12:55.501 --> 00:12:58.334
followed by Yahoo!
and Microsoft and Ask.

00:12:58.334 --> 00:13:01.267
Okay, so now we're gonna
get some fun stuff

00:13:01.267 --> 00:13:03.400
like what can
I disallow, right?

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.267
Again we have that
size of the Web problem

00:13:05.267 --> 00:13:06.667
where there's all that
content out there,

00:13:06.667 --> 00:13:08.000
then there's
some content we crawl,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.567
and then
some content we index.

00:13:09.567 --> 00:13:12.133
You don't want to get us stuck
crawling stuff that's not good.

00:13:12.133 --> 00:13:14.634
So you can actually
disallow shopping carts

00:13:14.634 --> 00:13:17.400
if you happen to be doing
this type of implementation.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.334
Because Googlebot will never
go through your site

00:13:19.334 --> 00:13:20.667
and actually
purchase books

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:22.701
and give that conversion
that you want.

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:25.200
So go ahead and disallow
things like shopping carts.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.100
Login pages as well.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.934
He forgot his username.
He probably won't be logging in.

00:13:30.934 --> 00:13:34.300
And you can test
all these types of disallows

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.968
through the Robots.txt
generator

00:13:35.968 --> 00:13:38.601
and testing tool
in Webmaster Tools.

00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:40.801
So here you can test everything
before it goes live,

00:13:40.801 --> 00:13:44.634
as well as help create
a Robots. txt file.

00:13:44.634 --> 00:13:45.868
All right,
so this is kind of fun,

00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:48.567
but we're gonna talk
about Dynamic URLs.

00:13:48.567 --> 00:13:49.968
And the reason
I want to do this is because

00:13:49.968 --> 00:13:52.501
I'm gonna channel people
from my crawl team here

00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:54.701
who have had
serious headaches

00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:56.601
when dealing
with things like this.

00:13:56.601 --> 00:13:57.767
I'm sure most of you
create sites

00:13:57.767 --> 00:13:59.567
that are dynamic
and not static-based,

00:13:59.567 --> 00:14:01.300
so let's talk
about this for a while.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.100
Dynamic URLs
are often recognized

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.667
by name/value pairs,
right?

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:07.200
So you have a name
like "category"

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.767
and a value being "1."

00:14:08.767 --> 00:14:10.834
A name "answer,"
value equals "10."

00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:12.267
Often we see this
through cookies,

00:14:12.267 --> 00:14:15.868
so, you know, it's hidden
for the user details,

00:14:15.868 --> 00:14:18.834
but if you want your site to be
accessible without cookies,

00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:20.667
with cookies disabled,
then of course

00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:25.100
you're gonna have to go
back to these dynamic URLs.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.801
A great practice
for our crawl team and for us,

00:14:27.801 --> 00:14:29.701
and to make sure
that we understand your site,

00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:33.901
is to create algorithmically
easily understood--

00:14:33.901 --> 00:14:37.501
i.e. standard--
dynamic URL structures.

00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:39.133
So take a look at this.

00:14:39.133 --> 00:14:41.667
We have four URLs here,
and they're all actually

00:14:41.667 --> 00:14:44.834
gonna lead to the one
product page for the G1 phone.

00:14:44.834 --> 00:14:46.234
But they differ
in terms of

00:14:46.234 --> 00:14:47.667
different parameters
set on there,

00:14:47.667 --> 00:14:50.667
like "category"
as well as "affiliateid"

00:14:50.667 --> 00:14:53.567
and the two
the "affiliateid" changes.

00:14:53.567 --> 00:14:56.467
So you might have a site
that has 1,000 products.

00:14:56.467 --> 00:14:58.567
You might have ten URLs
that could actually link

00:14:58.567 --> 00:14:59.834
to each product.

00:14:59.834 --> 00:15:02.067
So now you've created
a site with 10,000 URLs,

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:05.667
and actually you only have
1,000 good product pages.

00:15:05.667 --> 00:15:07.133
Now Google comes along,

00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:10.033
and we see that you have
10,000 URLs, right?

00:15:10.033 --> 00:15:11.467
But we can't crawl
all the Web.

00:15:11.467 --> 00:15:12.467
We're trying to limit
our resources

00:15:12.467 --> 00:15:14.100
and crawl what's useful.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.334
So given a list
of 10,000 URLs,

00:15:16.334 --> 00:15:19.133
what we're gonna do is we use
our algorithms to understand.

00:15:19.133 --> 00:15:21.367
What's an important parameter?
What's an irrelevant parameter?

00:15:21.367 --> 00:15:23.033
And we go through,
and go through.

00:15:23.033 --> 00:15:25.868
So we might start
to see "category=mobile"

00:15:25.868 --> 00:15:27.968
didn't change this that much--
the content much.

00:15:27.968 --> 00:15:31.267
So "category," let's think
about that not being relevant.

00:15:31.267 --> 00:15:35.133
"Affiliateid" and then "1234,"
"affiliateid=5678"

00:15:35.133 --> 00:15:36.200
didn't change at all.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.667
Let's definitely
throw that out.

00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:40.033
So we start with 1,000,
we start to prune that down

00:15:40.033 --> 00:15:43.501
as we see what becomes relevant
and what becomes irrelevant.

00:15:43.501 --> 00:15:46.434
So when you stick with these
types of standard formats,

00:15:46.434 --> 00:15:48.367
if you want to be
found in search engines,

00:15:48.367 --> 00:15:50.634
this is much easier
for us to process.

00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:53.200
Right, because we're not gonna
go out and crawl all 10,000,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.667
we're gonna find out
ways to just crawl

00:15:54.667 --> 00:15:56.534
the most important
of those.

00:15:56.534 --> 00:15:58.934
So when we do crawl, you want us
to crawl your important content

00:15:58.934 --> 00:16:02.901
so that we can index that and
return that in search results.

00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:05.300
So this is great.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.167
The one reason why people might
not have done this in the past

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:09.567
is they thought
ranking reasons.

00:16:09.567 --> 00:16:11.868
They thought, oh, I need to put
keywords in my path

00:16:11.868 --> 00:16:14.634
because that's better for
ranking, which isn't the case.

00:16:14.634 --> 00:16:16.434
We'll actually interpret
keywords from whether they're

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:19.601
in the path or within
the actual name value here.

00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:23.501
So if you have a G1 phone that
you're hoping can rank for this,

00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:26.067
either place is actually
gonna be fine for ranking,

00:16:26.067 --> 00:16:28.667
but in terms of how
we process your URLs

00:16:28.667 --> 00:16:30.567
that second example
with the standard pair

00:16:30.567 --> 00:16:32.067
is actually easy for us.

00:16:32.067 --> 00:16:34.167
So we're more likely to find
more of your good content

00:16:34.167 --> 00:16:38.167
and not spend time crawling
your duplicate content.

00:16:38.167 --> 00:16:40.767
All right, so,
my girlfriends and I

00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:42.567
tend to call
things "mavericks"

00:16:42.567 --> 00:16:44.934
when it's not
what we want.

00:16:44.934 --> 00:16:46.567
And so one way
we're gonna look at this

00:16:46.567 --> 00:16:50.367
is called "maverick
alternative encodings."

00:16:50.367 --> 00:16:51.734
So these are developers
who thought,

00:16:51.734 --> 00:16:53.534
you know what, I'm not gonna
stick with the standard.

00:16:53.534 --> 00:16:56.100
No, no, no, I'm gonna
try something new.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.267
And this is really hard,

00:16:57.267 --> 00:16:59.067
from a search engine
perspective, to process

00:16:59.067 --> 00:17:00.567
because we can't apply
our algorithms anymore.

00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:06.267
So in this case, this company
decided to do their own encoding

00:17:06.267 --> 00:17:11.801
where "W0 = ?"
and "QQ = &amp;."

00:17:11.801 --> 00:17:13.634
Again, if we see
10,000 URLs

00:17:13.634 --> 00:17:15.234
and they only have
1,000 products,

00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:17.000
we can't make out
which ones to crawl.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.901
This all looks like
static URLs, right?

00:17:18.901 --> 00:17:22.067
We can't see anything different
between the two.

00:17:22.067 --> 00:17:23.968
Luckily we were able
to diagnose this,

00:17:23.968 --> 00:17:25.801
but you could see
from your standpoint,

00:17:25.801 --> 00:17:27.234
you really don't want
to leave that in our hands

00:17:27.234 --> 00:17:29.501
to have to make
those type of decisions.

00:17:29.501 --> 00:17:32.367
This is fairly
tough to do.

00:17:32.367 --> 00:17:34.167
So some other examples.

00:17:34.167 --> 00:17:35.634
People putting
session I.D.s

00:17:35.634 --> 00:17:38.501
in their path
or in some positional value.

00:17:38.501 --> 00:17:40.534
Again this creates
an infinite space.

00:17:40.534 --> 00:17:41.767
So we can't start
narrowing down

00:17:41.767 --> 00:17:44.734
from 10,000 to 2,000
to 1,000 URLs.

00:17:44.734 --> 00:17:47.067
If you put your session I.D.
in the middle of the path,

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:51.200
which I think was a default for
some Web servers, unfortunately,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.834
that looks pretty
infinite to us.

00:17:52.834 --> 00:17:54.000
We're not gonna
be able to know

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.434
that that's actually
not valuable.

00:17:56.434 --> 00:17:59.067
And then some people do it
as positional value,

00:17:59.067 --> 00:18:00.434
where you're
the only developer

00:18:00.434 --> 00:18:02.167
who knows it's gonna
be like this.

00:18:02.167 --> 00:18:04.067
It's really hard again
as a search engine

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:07.033
to understand
what's actually valuable here.

00:18:07.033 --> 00:18:09.133
Again, think about it
from our perspective.

00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:11.067
If you want to be found
by a search engine,

00:18:11.067 --> 00:18:14.400
and we need to be able
to process this algorithmically.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.434
I have a few other
cute ones.

00:18:16.434 --> 00:18:19.601
Okay, this is my favorite.
[laughs]

00:18:19.601 --> 00:18:23.133
I don't know if this developer
is out there wearing some badge

00:18:23.133 --> 00:18:25.033
of, like,
"yeah, I did it,"

00:18:25.033 --> 00:18:28.067
because what they've done here
is done category navigation,

00:18:28.067 --> 00:18:32.133
but with this binary encoding
of what's expanded

00:18:32.133 --> 00:18:36.167
and what's collapsed.
[laughs]

00:18:36.167 --> 00:18:39.033
Okay, now let's put on your
search engine cap again.

00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:41.701
From our perspective,
our crawl team wants to crawl

00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:44.968
every category page,
and every leaf node page.

00:18:44.968 --> 00:18:47.968
We don't want to spend time
having everything expanded

00:18:47.968 --> 00:18:50.501
and not knowing to get
to your leaf node pages.

00:18:50.501 --> 00:18:52.300
Because there's
so many URLs now.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.868
We can't make this out.

00:18:53.868 --> 00:18:56.734
So some good tips are
if you have, you know,

00:18:56.734 --> 00:19:00.834
a lot of navigation, maybe just
expand one category at a time

00:19:00.834 --> 00:19:02.434
or maybe there's
other things you can do,

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:04.334
but the idea here
is keep it standard

00:19:04.334 --> 00:19:08.334
so that we don't have to
deal with something like this.

00:19:08.334 --> 00:19:11.067
All right, so know that
from Google's perspective

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:12.534
we really want
to help you out.

00:19:12.534 --> 00:19:13.968
We really are trying
to crawl this.

00:19:13.968 --> 00:19:16.467
That's why we've kind of
diagnosed some of these sites.

00:19:16.467 --> 00:19:19.133
So if you verify your site
in Webmaster Tools,

00:19:19.133 --> 00:19:21.868
we'll actually give you
an infinite space notification

00:19:21.868 --> 00:19:24.234
if we think that
you've got a problem.

00:19:24.234 --> 00:19:26.534
And this can be things
like calendars or this type

00:19:26.534 --> 00:19:29.400
of positional encoding
that you've seen earlier.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.267
So in this example
we're actually

00:19:31.267 --> 00:19:32.868
sending you
a message that says,

00:19:32.868 --> 00:19:35.200
"Googlebot found
an extremely high number

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.501
of URLs on your site."

00:19:36.501 --> 00:19:39.701
And then we give you
ways to diagnose that.

00:19:39.701 --> 00:19:41.501
All right,
so now I want to talk

00:19:41.501 --> 00:19:43.300
about indexing
and URL structure.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.400
You want to have
pretty sweet anchor text.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.234
So if I'm Webmaster Tools,
I'm linking to our blog.

00:19:48.234 --> 00:19:50.234
You can see here
my anchor text actually says,

00:19:50.234 --> 00:19:52.701
"Webmaster Central Blog."

00:19:52.701 --> 00:19:54.701
What you don't want
is something like "click here"

00:19:54.701 --> 00:19:57.901
because that's
not descriptive.

00:19:57.901 --> 00:20:00.133
Okay, now let's get
into choosing technologies

00:20:00.133 --> 00:20:01.300
and here
is where we have

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.434
some cool product
announcements as well.

00:20:03.434 --> 00:20:05.934
First with technologies,
always remember,

00:20:05.934 --> 00:20:08.100
HTML is your friend.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.434
Progressive enhancement's
always a good way to go.

00:20:10.434 --> 00:20:11.634
So there's
a lot out there,

00:20:11.634 --> 00:20:13.300
but HTML is access--

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.067
you know, can be seen
on a lot of devices,

00:20:15.067 --> 00:20:17.067
whether it's a desktop
or mobile phone.

00:20:17.067 --> 00:20:21.100
On top of which you'll just
reach the largest audience,

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.968
it'll be crawled well
by search engines--

00:20:22.968 --> 00:20:24.767
that's pretty given--

00:20:24.767 --> 00:20:25.934
and then
with progressive enhancement,

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.300
you can add this other stuff
later, right?

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.701
So you still might add AJAX,
or you might want Flash,

00:20:30.701 --> 00:20:35.868
but you can do that in addition
to your beautiful static HTML.

00:20:35.868 --> 00:20:39.300
All right, so moving on
to something like JavaScript.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.634
Here's something cool
that we just

00:20:40.634 --> 00:20:43.834
want to let you know
up front here about our status.

00:20:43.834 --> 00:20:47.567
We're actually innovating all
the time with our crawl team,

00:20:47.567 --> 00:20:50.801
and we can now process
"onclick" events.

00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:53.400
So what this means for you
is that if you had a site

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.934
that didn't have
some URLs indexed

00:20:54.934 --> 00:20:58.133
because it was
JavaScript executed,

00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:01.901
Now we actually hopefully can
reach more of your good content.

00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:05.934
So know that this functionality
is being continuously updated.

00:21:05.934 --> 00:21:07.400
We're not in
the perfect state,

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.901
but we just want to make you
aware of what's going on.

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:11.400
So how are we
doing this?

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.200
We're actually constructing
a page much like the browser;

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.234
we have a lot
of the dom structure there,

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:19.934
and we're adding things like
the link tags and form elements

00:21:19.934 --> 00:21:22.200
to find some of these
onclick events.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.901
We can also do an onclick
if it calls a function

00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:27.701
and creates a URL,
or an anchor,

00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:30.734
but only if that function
is defined on the page itself.

00:21:30.734 --> 00:21:34.968
We are not at the point where we
can externally load resources.

00:21:34.968 --> 00:21:37.033
So to give you
a better idea,

00:21:37.033 --> 00:21:39.200
I'll just have you
look at some of these.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.834
So these are examples
that we are now

00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:42.434
able to process
from your site.

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:44.167
So again this is Google's
new capability

00:21:44.167 --> 00:21:49.000
with JavaScript onclick.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.100
You can see here
there's "window.opens,"

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:56.501
calling functions,
stuff like that.

00:21:56.501 --> 00:21:59.501
All right,
let's talk about AJAX.

00:21:59.501 --> 00:22:00.667
All right,
so while we could do

00:22:00.667 --> 00:22:02.100
some of this stuff
with JavaScript,

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.701
we're not yet there
with AJAX.

00:22:03.701 --> 00:22:06.300
Kind of those RPC calls
and such going on,

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.801
we're not at that point.

00:22:07.801 --> 00:22:11.167
So if it's important to you
to get your AJAX site crawled,

00:22:11.167 --> 00:22:13.400
then you're still gonna want
to do something like Hijax

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:19.334
where you create a static link
in addition to your AJAX.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Something we're working on,
but we're not there yet.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.234
Again, we're just letting you
know about JavaScript.

00:22:26.234 --> 00:22:28.300
If you have questions
you guys can go up to the mics.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.100
For sure, any time.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.634
All right, for Flash.

00:22:32.634 --> 00:22:34.367
So you might have seen
this announcement before,

00:22:34.367 --> 00:22:36.100
we have more
to say, though.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.000
We can find
all the user-visible text

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.534
in a Flash file.

00:22:39.534 --> 00:22:41.434
So we're actually going through,
executing buttons,

00:22:41.434 --> 00:22:42.901
doing things like that.

00:22:42.901 --> 00:22:47.100
And we can associate the text
we find with your file itself.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.267
So if you don't want text found,
then put it in an image,

00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:52.200
'cause we won't still capture
text in images.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.133
Other things
to know about this

00:22:54.133 --> 00:22:56.934
is that it's been
a huge boon to our users.

00:22:56.934 --> 00:22:59.634
Before, we had no snippets
showing for Flash files,

00:22:59.634 --> 00:23:01.067
we just had the title,

00:23:01.067 --> 00:23:05.467
and now they see
something much prettier.

00:23:05.467 --> 00:23:07.534
You can embed your Flash
using the standard techniques

00:23:07.534 --> 00:23:10.200
like SWFObject
and SWFObject2,

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.868
but our big announcement here is
that previously we couldn't load

00:23:13.868 --> 00:23:16.868
external files
into your Flash file.

00:23:16.868 --> 00:23:20.534
But now we're actually able to
associate any external files--

00:23:20.534 --> 00:23:22.000
externally loaded files,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.701
and actually bring that in
with the Flash itself.

00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:26.234
So again that's
a big improvement for us

00:23:26.234 --> 00:23:27.734
in terms of
calling Flash.

00:23:27.734 --> 00:23:30.601
So we have two big announcements
here with our crawling team.

00:23:30.601 --> 00:23:33.234
We have JavaScript onclick
as well as this ability

00:23:33.234 --> 00:23:39.267
to use externally loaded
resources.

00:23:39.267 --> 00:23:40.868
A big thing
that I think

00:23:40.868 --> 00:23:42.234
they talk about
at developer conferences

00:23:42.234 --> 00:23:44.000
are frames and iframes.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.901
So I just wanted to cover
how we deal with these

00:23:45.901 --> 00:23:48.701
from a crawl and index
perspective.

00:23:48.701 --> 00:23:50.300
Frames and iframes
can all be discovered

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.601
at crawl time
within the parent page.

00:23:52.601 --> 00:23:53.901
So you don't have to
have a separate link

00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:55.234
to the frame or iframe;

00:23:55.234 --> 00:23:57.601
we'll actually interpret it
within that parent page.

00:23:57.601 --> 00:23:59.400
When it comes
to indexing, though,

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.334
there's gonna be
a slight differentiation.

00:24:02.334 --> 00:24:04.634
Frames will be processed
with the parent,

00:24:04.634 --> 00:24:07.200
while iframes will actually
be treated in index

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.400
as a separate URL.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.868
And the reason that's the case--
Go ahead.

00:24:11.868 --> 00:24:13.868
The reason that's
the case is because

00:24:13.868 --> 00:24:16.434
historically we've seen
a lot of ads in iframes,

00:24:16.434 --> 00:24:17.834
and so there was
no use to actually

00:24:17.834 --> 00:24:19.501
bring that into
the parent page.

00:24:19.501 --> 00:24:21.133
Yes.

00:24:21.133 --> 00:24:26.067
audience member:
[indistinct]

00:24:26.067 --> 00:24:29.434
If you have content
on that site--

00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:32.501
on your site,
that people are using,

00:24:32.501 --> 00:24:34.367
their friends are
chatting about stuff,

00:24:34.367 --> 00:24:36.567
all of that information
that people are chatting about

00:24:36.567 --> 00:24:37.734
you will not--

00:24:37.734 --> 00:24:41.834
that stuff won't
be indexed by Google?

00:24:41.834 --> 00:24:43.567
Ohye: Most likely not
with Friend Connect.

00:24:43.567 --> 00:24:45.467
And also do you
have to be logged in

00:24:45.467 --> 00:24:48.000
for a majority of that,
or is it public?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.968
audience member: Y--

00:24:52.968 --> 00:24:54.534
Ohye: Okay,
so this person says

00:24:54.534 --> 00:24:57.734
you can see
the discussion, but...

00:24:57.734 --> 00:24:59.367
Okay, I think
with Friend Connect

00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:00.934
that we're still
not processing that content.

00:25:00.934 --> 00:25:02.200
audience member: Okay.
Ohye: Yeah.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.567
But we can look
to do more of this,

00:25:03.567 --> 00:25:05.067
this is just our current
treatment of iframes.

00:25:05.067 --> 00:25:06.801
But thanks.

00:25:06.801 --> 00:25:08.601
So this is kind of
a big topic within our team--

00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:09.767
is what we're gonna do

00:25:09.767 --> 00:25:14.634
with some of the things
like Friend Connect.

00:25:14.634 --> 00:25:16.934
Okay, so now let's talk
about making the page.

00:25:16.934 --> 00:25:18.801
We've talked about
selecting a domain,

00:25:18.801 --> 00:25:20.834
we've talked about
site architecture,

00:25:20.834 --> 00:25:23.033
we've talked about
choosing technologies,

00:25:23.033 --> 00:25:24.901
and now we're just gonna
actually make the page.

00:25:24.901 --> 00:25:26.667
So using your head.

00:25:26.667 --> 00:25:28.467
So all these things we're gonna
put in the head of our file.

00:25:28.467 --> 00:25:30.601
Or we can.

00:25:30.601 --> 00:25:33.968
but first of all, let's look at
what a search result looks like.

00:25:33.968 --> 00:25:35.501
All right,
so there's a title,

00:25:35.501 --> 00:25:38.267
and that corresponds to
the title of your page, right?

00:25:38.267 --> 00:25:40.634
There's a snippet,
which could either be found

00:25:40.634 --> 00:25:43.901
within the context of your page
or used from a meta description,

00:25:43.901 --> 00:25:46.167
which is, again,
in the head of your page.

00:25:46.167 --> 00:25:48.501
Then there's the URL
as well as sitelinks.

00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:51.234
And those sitelinks are
calculated algorithmically,

00:25:51.234 --> 00:25:52.567
done especially
if you have a site

00:25:52.567 --> 00:25:55.167
that's very accessible
to search engines.

00:25:55.167 --> 00:25:57.400
And it's gonna be
the high result.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.567
So looking at titles.

00:25:58.567 --> 00:26:00.033
You want to create
unique titles

00:26:00.033 --> 00:26:04.534
as well as descriptive
meta descriptions.

00:26:04.534 --> 00:26:06.067
Again, because they can be
used in a snippet.

00:26:06.067 --> 00:26:08.601
So here's an example
of a meta description.

00:26:08.601 --> 00:26:14.534
[reads portion
in pink box]

00:26:17.667 --> 00:26:20.000
Again, it's not too long,
which is good,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.834
and it gives the user
a good snippet,

00:26:21.834 --> 00:26:24.100
should this be shown
in search results.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.434
The next thing you could put
in your head is rel="canonical."

00:26:27.434 --> 00:26:30.000
Have any of you heard
about rel="canonical"?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.167
Okay, okay.
A few people. All right.

00:26:33.167 --> 00:26:34.167
So what this is--

00:26:34.167 --> 00:26:36.067
Oh! Sorry, before I get
on to that.

00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:37.834
Here's an
informative title.

00:26:37.834 --> 00:26:41.801
I recently had
a hair salon mistake,

00:26:41.801 --> 00:26:44.167
and so if I were to search
for "grow healthy hair,"

00:26:44.167 --> 00:26:46.400
something I could see here
is that these titles

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.467
actually contain
my keywords, right?

00:26:48.467 --> 00:26:52.534
So it's good to have
these unique titles.

00:26:52.534 --> 00:26:55.234
Again, "untitled"--
not informative.

00:26:55.234 --> 00:26:58.634
All right, so in terms of titles
and meta descriptions,

00:26:58.634 --> 00:27:00.801
you can use
Webmaster Tools.

00:27:00.801 --> 00:27:03.501
This is gonna point out to you
where you have duplicate titles,

00:27:03.501 --> 00:27:08.567
or duplicate meta descriptions,
or titles that don't exist.

00:27:08.567 --> 00:27:10.467
So rel="canonical."

00:27:10.467 --> 00:27:12.467
Again, we talked about
all those dynamic URLs

00:27:12.467 --> 00:27:14.033
and something
you might have been asking

00:27:14.033 --> 00:27:17.033
is that it's creating
a lot of duplicate content.

00:27:17.033 --> 00:27:21.067
Right, these three URLs
go to the same page.

00:27:21.067 --> 00:27:24.300
What this means is that
you might be losing page rank.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.300
So before
you had 20 links,

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.167
now there's being dispersed
ten to the first URL,

00:27:29.167 --> 00:27:30.667
five people are linking
to the second,

00:27:30.667 --> 00:27:35.267
five to the third.

00:27:37.634 --> 00:27:39.968
So what you can do here
is add to the head section

00:27:39.968 --> 00:27:42.701
of your duplicate,
and even your canonical version,

00:27:42.701 --> 00:27:45.067
this rel="canonical."

00:27:45.067 --> 00:27:46.634
And this is actually
gonna tell us--

00:27:46.634 --> 00:27:48.133
search engines
being Google;

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:51.467
also Yahoo! and Microsoft have
agreed to accept this standard--

00:27:51.467 --> 00:27:54.200
what you want as the canonical
version of your URL.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.167
So now all those properties
from the duplicates

00:27:56.167 --> 00:27:58.501
will be transferred
to your canonical version,

00:27:58.501 --> 00:28:02.234
and your canonical URL will also
be shown in search results.

00:28:02.234 --> 00:28:03.400
So you can let us
try to do

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.767
this clustering
and dupe detection on our own,

00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:10.868
or of course you could set that
yourself with rel="canonical."

00:28:10.868 --> 00:28:12.701
Okay, before
I get to adding content,

00:28:12.701 --> 00:28:15.100
nobody has questions
if you want to go to the mic?

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.467
Good? Yeah.

00:28:18.467 --> 00:28:22.133
audience member: You were
talking about the number of--

00:28:22.133 --> 00:28:25.234
extremely large number
of links on your site.

00:28:25.234 --> 00:28:26.801
What is that number?

00:28:26.801 --> 00:28:28.901
What is--what do you consider
extremely large?

00:28:28.901 --> 00:28:31.267
Ohye: So yeah,
usually that has to do

00:28:31.267 --> 00:28:33.467
with something
that's nearly infinite.

00:28:33.467 --> 00:28:35.801
Meaning like a calendar
that's going on and on.

00:28:35.801 --> 00:28:37.534
Or like the positional
encoding.

00:28:37.534 --> 00:28:40.167
audience member: So, like,
30,000 isn't a lot.

00:28:40.167 --> 00:28:41.667
Ohye: Oh, that is a lot.
Yeah.

00:28:41.667 --> 00:28:44.200
But, you know, if we detect that
you don't have that much content

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.868
and we are
seeing that much,

00:28:45.868 --> 00:28:47.968
we'll trigger
that note to be sent.

00:28:47.968 --> 00:28:49.968
audience member:
Okay. Thank you.

00:28:49.968 --> 00:28:52.567
audience member: On the
canonical naming portion of it,

00:28:52.567 --> 00:28:54.968
is that limited just
to a single domain?

00:28:54.968 --> 00:28:57.667
So if you have multiple domains
pointed to the same Web site,

00:28:57.667 --> 00:29:00.200
can you point to
the root domain as opposed to

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.901
the one that is being
indexed at the time?

00:29:02.901 --> 00:29:04.000
Ohye: No, you need to--

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.334
It only works
within the same domain.

00:29:05.334 --> 00:29:08.234
audience member: Okay.

00:29:08.234 --> 00:29:09.567
Ohye: Yes?

00:29:09.567 --> 00:29:11.534
audience member: Onto your topic
of session I.D.s,

00:29:11.534 --> 00:29:17.434
I've had trouble with the
session format that Java uses.

00:29:17.434 --> 00:29:19.968
It's a semicolon
followed by a session I.D.,

00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:22.501
and it seems that Google
often indexes all of those,

00:29:22.501 --> 00:29:24.767
it's not recognizing that
as a session I.D.

00:29:24.767 --> 00:29:27.400
Ohye: Okay.
Do you have a domain example?

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.200
I can bring that back
to our team.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.934
audience member: It'll just
be J SESSION I.D.--all caps.

00:29:32.934 --> 00:29:34.634
And anyone who's
used Tomcat or--

00:29:34.634 --> 00:29:35.667
Ohye: Oh, I mean
do you have a domain

00:29:35.667 --> 00:29:37.334
that actually
shows this problem?

00:29:37.334 --> 00:29:40.033
audience member: This particular
form of session I.D.

00:29:40.033 --> 00:29:41.701
is often added
by your container,

00:29:41.701 --> 00:29:44.300
so you'll have a Web site that
doesn't have sessions at all,

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.734
but when Google comes along
and crawls it,

00:29:45.734 --> 00:29:47.067
it'll get a session I.D.

00:29:47.067 --> 00:29:49.467
if you happen to be
using Tomcat and Java.

00:29:49.467 --> 00:29:50.801
Ohye: Yeah, I got you.

00:29:50.801 --> 00:29:52.501
But do you just have
one example that I can just

00:29:52.501 --> 00:29:53.968
make sure I take back to them
where you're like,

00:29:53.968 --> 00:29:55.434
"Here's a problem I've seen
on this site"?

00:29:55.434 --> 00:29:56.534
audience member:
Citycarshare.org

00:29:56.534 --> 00:29:57.534
has that problem.

00:29:57.534 --> 00:29:58.534
Ohye: Citycarshare?

00:29:58.534 --> 00:30:00.000
audience member:
Citycarshare.org.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.634
Ohye: Great. ".org."
audience member: .org.

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:04.501
Ohye: Okay. Perfect.

00:30:04.501 --> 00:30:06.901
You guys, I'd love
to get more feedback

00:30:06.901 --> 00:30:08.300
on some stuff
that you see.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.467
'Cause you're the best audience
to get this from,

00:30:09.467 --> 00:30:10.467
so let me know.

00:30:10.467 --> 00:30:11.834
Yes.

00:30:11.834 --> 00:30:14.601
audience member: I had one quick
question about the Flash.

00:30:14.601 --> 00:30:18.400
You were talking about that text
is indexed by Google now.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.300
Is it all text,
or just selectable text?

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.667
Ohye: It should be all text.
audience member: All text.

00:30:22.667 --> 00:30:24.734
Ohye: That's visible to the user
and not in an image.

00:30:24.734 --> 00:30:28.467
audience member: Okay.
Ohye: Thanks.

00:30:28.467 --> 00:30:29.801
audience member:
I have a question

00:30:29.801 --> 00:30:31.667
regarding
the Webmaster Tools.

00:30:31.667 --> 00:30:34.501
You pointed out
that if you wanted

00:30:34.501 --> 00:30:35.868
a U.K. site,
for instance--

00:30:35.868 --> 00:30:36.868
Ohye: If you wanted a what?
A U.K. site?

00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:38.000
audience member:
If you wanted a site

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.434
that's targeted towards
a U.K. audience,

00:30:41.434 --> 00:30:44.467
are you better off
using a ".uk"?

00:30:44.467 --> 00:30:46.901
Basically right now
we have a .com,

00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:49.434
which is doing pretty good,

00:30:49.434 --> 00:30:54.901
and I was wondering
if we should get a uk.xyz.com

00:30:54.901 --> 00:30:58.968
to target
the U.K. content, or--

00:30:58.968 --> 00:31:02.767
Basically currently our target
is the North American market.

00:31:02.767 --> 00:31:04.734
Ohye: So you're thinking
about a subdomain?

00:31:04.734 --> 00:31:07.734
audience member: Yeah,
so should we use uk.xyz.com,

00:31:07.734 --> 00:31:12.234
or should we say
xyz.co.uk?

00:31:12.234 --> 00:31:13.801
Which would be
a better option?

00:31:13.801 --> 00:31:17.100
I mean, this one already
has a lot of authority

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.834
with Google and I guess
other search engines.

00:31:19.834 --> 00:31:25.033
So would I be better off going
with a subdomain on this one,

00:31:25.033 --> 00:31:29.200
or just go to a completely
different TLD?

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.501
Ohye: Yeah, those are hard--
those are tough questions.

00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:34.133
It kind of matters also
for your marketing team.

00:31:34.133 --> 00:31:35.701
If you have a subdomain,
are you looking

00:31:35.701 --> 00:31:38.801
to target a bunch of other
subdomains, other countries?

00:31:38.801 --> 00:31:40.200
audience member:
Eventually, I guess.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.701
Ohye: Okay, so here's
the thing.

00:31:41.701 --> 00:31:43.267
I mean, you could
do studies on this.

00:31:43.267 --> 00:31:45.267
You have to--It's a hard
decision to make.

00:31:45.267 --> 00:31:47.934
But essentially
a user in the U.K.--

00:31:47.934 --> 00:31:50.067
He wants his site
to appear for this user.

00:31:50.067 --> 00:31:51.734
If they see a .co.uk,

00:31:51.734 --> 00:31:54.601
they automatically know
it's tailored to them, right?

00:31:54.601 --> 00:31:57.100
They're used to seeing
that extension of the TLD.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.200
If they see a subdomain,
are they as likely to see it?

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.501
I don't really know.

00:32:00.501 --> 00:32:02.000
But from a ranking
perspective,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.567
we can target
both of those to that area.

00:32:04.567 --> 00:32:06.400
So if you do a subdomain,

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.767
then you're gonna want to verify
that in Webmaster Tools,

00:32:08.767 --> 00:32:11.200
and it'll be targeted
to users in the U.K.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.734
If you do
the cc TLD.co.uk,

00:32:13.734 --> 00:32:16.300
it'll automatically
target those users.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.834
So we won't treat it
as the same domain, necessarily,

00:32:18.834 --> 00:32:19.901
if you use it
as a subdomain.

00:32:19.901 --> 00:32:22.100
Both are kind of
viable options.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.100
audience member: I see,
but you'd be able

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.100
to use the Webmaster Tools
to say--to choose--

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.901
I saw your drop-down box
first thing.

00:32:29.901 --> 00:32:32.934
This one should be targeted
to such and such audience.

00:32:32.934 --> 00:32:34.601
So can I do that
with subdomains as well?

00:32:34.601 --> 00:32:37.667
Ohye: Yes. A verified subdomain
or sub directory.

00:32:37.667 --> 00:32:38.667
audience member:
Oh, beautiful.

00:32:38.667 --> 00:32:40.934
Ohye: So you could
say uk.xyz.com

00:32:40.934 --> 00:32:42.868
targets
the United Kingdom.

00:32:42.868 --> 00:32:45.167
audience member: And just
a quick comment,

00:32:45.167 --> 00:32:46.934
regarding the onclicks.

00:32:46.934 --> 00:32:48.267
I know it's not
a new thing;

00:32:48.267 --> 00:32:49.834
you guys have been doing that
for about a year.

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:52.601
We started noticing that
on my site a year ago.

00:32:52.601 --> 00:32:55.133
Because we were--
basically didn't want Google--

00:32:55.133 --> 00:32:56.634
We have a lot
of inventory pages.

00:32:56.634 --> 00:32:58.334
We didn't want Google
to target that.

00:32:58.334 --> 00:33:00.467
One day we realized
that your search engines

00:33:00.467 --> 00:33:03.033
were just coming in
and going past the onclicks.

00:33:03.033 --> 00:33:05.601
'Cause that was
our Robot.txt.

00:33:05.601 --> 00:33:06.767
So it's been
going on for a while.

00:33:06.767 --> 00:33:08.133
Ohye: Okay, yeah,

00:33:08.133 --> 00:33:09.534
I think we're letting you know
about our status.

00:33:09.534 --> 00:33:12.567
We kind of, as they say, turned
the jets on just recently,

00:33:12.567 --> 00:33:15.300
but yeah, we were
trying to experiment.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.801
Yes?

00:33:16.801 --> 00:33:20.033
audience member: Do you know
if .ws domains are generic,

00:33:20.033 --> 00:33:21.868
or if they are
country-targeted?

00:33:21.868 --> 00:33:24.167
'Cause I know those have been
released publicly recently.

00:33:24.167 --> 00:33:26.334
Ohye: .us?
audience member: .ws.

00:33:26.334 --> 00:33:28.801
Ohye: Oh, I'm not sure
what that corresponds to.

00:33:28.801 --> 00:33:31.033
audience member: Yeah,
it was a national code,

00:33:31.033 --> 00:33:33.634
but I think now it's
just for "Web site."

00:33:33.634 --> 00:33:35.734
It's kind of like
the .tv and stuff.

00:33:35.734 --> 00:33:37.133
Ohye: I think we would
probably take

00:33:37.133 --> 00:33:39.267
the official version
of what that corresponds to.

00:33:39.267 --> 00:33:41.534
I mean, I could check that out.
.ws?

00:33:41.534 --> 00:33:42.834
audience member: Yeah.
Ohye: Okay.

00:33:42.834 --> 00:33:44.000
audience member:
And then, um--

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.734
Ohye: Sorry I don't
know all my TLDs.

00:33:45.734 --> 00:33:48.067
audience member: And then
can you override that

00:33:48.067 --> 00:33:50.634
with the targeting
in Webmaster Tools?

00:33:50.634 --> 00:33:53.100
Ohye: If it's a .ws?
audience member: Yeah, if it--

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.868
Ohye: If it's considered a GTLD,
you'll have that pull-down.

00:33:55.868 --> 00:33:58.067
If it's not, then you won't
be able to pull that down.

00:33:58.067 --> 00:33:59.234
audience member: Oh, okay,
then I think it is.

00:33:59.234 --> 00:34:00.734
'Cause I've seen it
on there before.

00:34:00.734 --> 00:34:02.400
All right. Thanks.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.567
Ohye: All right.

00:34:03.567 --> 00:34:05.667
So we'll move on
to the next section.

00:34:05.667 --> 00:34:08.067
So this is about
adding content.

00:34:08.067 --> 00:34:11.901
So we'll start first
with just text.

00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:13.934
I don't like to get
into this keyword talk,

00:34:13.934 --> 00:34:15.100
but keywords
are important.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.534
If you want to rank
for a certain word,

00:34:16.534 --> 00:34:19.901
you should use it
in your text naturally.

00:34:19.901 --> 00:34:21.467
One of my friends
often jokes

00:34:21.467 --> 00:34:23.501
that he worked
for a shoe company

00:34:23.501 --> 00:34:25.868
who wanted to say--they said,
"We don't call it running shoes,

00:34:25.868 --> 00:34:28.834
we call it
athletic footwear."

00:34:28.834 --> 00:34:30.767
And that's great, they can call
it whatever they want,

00:34:30.767 --> 00:34:33.234
but you want to adopt
the language of your users,

00:34:33.234 --> 00:34:34.934
and it's not often
that I would type,

00:34:34.934 --> 00:34:37.701
when I look for running shoes,
"athletic footwear," right?

00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:39.334
So a great thing to do
is really use

00:34:39.334 --> 00:34:42.200
the keywords that people
will search for.

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.100
Of course be readable
and natural.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.100
You know, keyword stuffing
is spamming users,

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.834
it's spamming
the search engines.

00:34:48.834 --> 00:34:51.400
Now if you want
to add images.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.200
Just some tips for you.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.367
For Image Search,
here are some of the signals.

00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:57.601
We're gonna look at the text
surrounding the image,

00:34:57.601 --> 00:35:00.000
so having good text as well as
good headings is helpful

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.133
to help us understand
what your image is about.

00:35:03.133 --> 00:35:05.901
Additionally, the quality
of the image matters.

00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:07.734
So you don't want
anything placeholder,

00:35:07.734 --> 00:35:09.167
You don't want anything
low resolution.

00:35:09.167 --> 00:35:12.534
Really quality images are what
we want to return to users.

00:35:12.534 --> 00:35:15.701
And another part is about
image attributes like alt text.

00:35:15.701 --> 00:35:18.567
This is a great thing to add.
We look at this very well.

00:35:18.567 --> 00:35:20.667
In fact, if you have
just an image link,

00:35:20.667 --> 00:35:23.133
we'll actually use the alt text
as your anchor text.

00:35:23.133 --> 00:35:25.367
so alt text
is very important.

00:35:25.367 --> 00:35:27.968
And of course
good filenames.

00:35:27.968 --> 00:35:31.133
I don't know if you've seen
the Lolcat invisibl olimpiks.

00:35:31.133 --> 00:35:32.601
It's hilarious.

00:35:32.601 --> 00:35:35.033
But you want to use filenames
that are hyphen-separated

00:35:35.033 --> 00:35:41.033
versus the camera default,
right, which is, like, DSC.

00:35:41.033 --> 00:35:42.300
audience member:
One question.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.434
Ohye: Sure.

00:35:43.434 --> 00:35:44.567
audience member:
You mentioned hyphen twice.

00:35:44.567 --> 00:35:46.133
What about
the underscore?

00:35:46.133 --> 00:35:47.834
Is that worse?

00:35:47.834 --> 00:35:49.534
Ohye: Yes, it is
a little worse. Yeah.

00:35:49.534 --> 00:35:52.133
Hyphens will be automatically
seen as word separators,

00:35:52.133 --> 00:35:53.834
whereas
underscores are not

00:35:53.834 --> 00:35:58.801
seen as a full-strength
word separator.

00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:00.267
Okay.

00:36:00.267 --> 00:36:02.167
So I've been saving this one
to talk to developers

00:36:02.167 --> 00:36:07.133
because a lot of SEOs
know not to do this,

00:36:07.133 --> 00:36:08.934
and the developers
are the only people I think

00:36:08.934 --> 00:36:11.000
that are really savvy enough
to know to do this.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.167
But it's not a good idea

00:36:12.167 --> 00:36:14.634
if you want to be found
in search engines.

00:36:14.634 --> 00:36:16.100
And the idea is they think,
oh, you know what,

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.267
I've got these images
that have some text in it,

00:36:18.267 --> 00:36:21.100
so to let search engines
know about my text,

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.567
I will actually
use "text-indent: -999."

00:36:24.567 --> 00:36:26.033
So we all know
what this does, right?

00:36:26.033 --> 00:36:28.667
It's gonna push it off
the screen so no one can see it.

00:36:28.667 --> 00:36:32.300
But being a search engine,
we understand that happens.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.734
So let me just tell you
why this is a bad idea.

00:36:34.734 --> 00:36:36.767
The reason why it's bad
is because this is

00:36:36.767 --> 00:36:40.934
a long-time-been-around
spam technique.

00:36:40.934 --> 00:36:43.067
People love this.
They put white on white text.

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:44.501
You know, that's
kind of hidden text.

00:36:44.501 --> 00:36:46.834
In this case they're trying
to put it off the screen.

00:36:46.834 --> 00:36:48.968
So we can find
tons of examples of this.

00:36:48.968 --> 00:36:50.667
Again, I don't want
to, like, shame anybody,

00:36:50.667 --> 00:36:55.467
but this site, you know,
obviously did text-indent: -999.

00:36:55.467 --> 00:36:58.067
And then they just put a whole
bunch of links at the bottom.

00:36:58.067 --> 00:37:02.234
Right? Try to, like, boost
their links to other sites.

00:37:02.234 --> 00:37:06.467
Spam. Penalty.
You know, not gonna do well.

00:37:06.467 --> 00:37:08.834
So if you want
to do image replacement, it's--

00:37:08.834 --> 00:37:10.868
I mean, if you want to just--
if you're using images,

00:37:10.868 --> 00:37:12.567
use alt text if possible.

00:37:12.567 --> 00:37:16.501
If not, try to do things
like sifr, sprites.

00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:19.300
Even less to a degree is
something like &lt;noscript&gt;,

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.000
but again,
alt text is best,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.667
then something
like sifr and sprites.

00:37:22.667 --> 00:37:25.100
Text indent--risky.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.434
Okay. Just want
to make that clear.

00:37:26.434 --> 00:37:29.200
You can do it, but if you care
about your rankings,

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.133
not a great idea.

00:37:32.133 --> 00:37:33.667
All right.

00:37:33.667 --> 00:37:36.234
Again, just to let you know,
we're trying to serve our users,

00:37:36.234 --> 00:37:39.300
but we also
care about you, for sure.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.200
So we actually will
send messages if we think

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.934
that you're a legitimate site
doing something like this.

00:37:43.934 --> 00:37:47.501
So here's an example of a hidden
text message in Message Center.

00:37:47.501 --> 00:37:50.467
Well, we let you know that
we detected some of your pages

00:37:50.467 --> 00:37:51.934
using techniques
outside our guidelines,

00:37:51.934 --> 00:37:53.601
and we go on.

00:37:53.601 --> 00:37:56.968
Again, we really just want
to help you out here.

00:37:56.968 --> 00:37:58.000
Now for videos.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.701
this is all
fairly basic SEO stuff.

00:38:01.701 --> 00:38:04.801
But if you have videos, YouTube
does a lot of good things.

00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:07.367
They have static
HTML navigation,

00:38:07.367 --> 00:38:09.767
text descriptions,
good titles,

00:38:09.767 --> 00:38:12.467
you can visibly see
the popularity of a video,

00:38:12.467 --> 00:38:15.133
so you can see the views,
you can see the ratings.

00:38:15.133 --> 00:38:17.267
They have comments
that help users become engaged.

00:38:17.267 --> 00:38:19.934
Comments can also be a turnoff,
but, you know,

00:38:19.934 --> 00:38:21.534
it also keeps
the people there.

00:38:21.534 --> 00:38:23.701
They have related videos
that you can see

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.734
that keeps it sticky
on the site,

00:38:25.734 --> 00:38:27.033
so you keep
looking at more.

00:38:27.033 --> 00:38:28.534
Which I think
we've all done.

00:38:28.534 --> 00:38:31.367
Like, an hour passes, and you're
like, what am I doing?

00:38:31.367 --> 00:38:33.501
And of course the best thing
about video optimization

00:38:33.501 --> 00:38:35.667
is to create
a compelling video.

00:38:35.667 --> 00:38:38.133
One that people
do want to share.

00:38:38.133 --> 00:38:41.100
And if you're hosting on your
own, uptime is important.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.067
That's why YouTube kind of
does so well, and Metacafe.

00:38:44.067 --> 00:38:45.901
These are sights that
we can rely on the up time

00:38:45.901 --> 00:38:48.033
when we show them
in search results to users.

00:38:48.033 --> 00:38:49.200
Yes.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.968
audience member:
Hey.

00:38:50.968 --> 00:38:55.100
We wanted to--We see that if you
have a site

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.000
that's targeting, say,
U.K. audience,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.400
and you have--
Sorry.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.133
And you have your servers
in U.K., it tends to do better

00:39:03.133 --> 00:39:06.000
on search engines,
and that's fine.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.334
We can also rent
a server in the U.K.

00:39:09.334 --> 00:39:13.968
But we're trying to go to see
the ends and to the cloud,

00:39:13.968 --> 00:39:17.767
and we're very much wondering
how Google would treat

00:39:17.767 --> 00:39:21.000
if the whole site
is hosted on the cloud, say.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.567
I mean, would they
actually say

00:39:23.567 --> 00:39:25.200
that it was meant
for a U.K. audience.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.634
Ohye: Yeah.

00:39:26.634 --> 00:39:29.534
Again, the webserver IP--I mean,
that might be your experience

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:32.133
that your ones that are hosted
in the U.K. do better,

00:39:32.133 --> 00:39:34.167
but that might not be
the actual factor.

00:39:34.167 --> 00:39:36.868
It could be a lot of factors
that lead to it doing better.

00:39:36.868 --> 00:39:38.968
So again, Web server IP,
I just mentioned that

00:39:38.968 --> 00:39:40.133
because it's--

00:39:40.133 --> 00:39:42.567
it's a very tertiary
signal, though.

00:39:42.567 --> 00:39:44.601
Again, first we're
gonna look at TLDs,

00:39:44.601 --> 00:39:45.734
and then wherever
you host it,

00:39:45.734 --> 00:39:48.601
whatever cloud
it happens to be in,

00:39:48.601 --> 00:39:51.634
you could actually target that
in Webmaster Tools, right?

00:39:51.634 --> 00:39:53.467
So those are gonna be
two strong signals.

00:39:53.467 --> 00:39:54.901
Web serv IP--
I'm just mentioning it

00:39:54.901 --> 00:39:56.767
because as you choose to host,
I want you to know

00:39:56.767 --> 00:39:58.300
that that could
be a factor.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.634
But if you have the other two
covered, then you'll be fine.

00:40:01.634 --> 00:40:04.667
Yeah, you mentioned
about the text indent thing

00:40:04.667 --> 00:40:06.033
to basically
hide content.

00:40:06.033 --> 00:40:07.067
Ohye: Yeah.

00:40:07.067 --> 00:40:08.501
audience member:
What about all the--

00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:10.267
I know for our site we have
a lot of content that might be

00:40:10.267 --> 00:40:12.868
in, like, coda sliders
or, you know,

00:40:12.868 --> 00:40:15.601
potentially an accordion
so it's visibility hidden

00:40:15.601 --> 00:40:16.901
or you know,
what have you--

00:40:16.901 --> 00:40:18.334
Ohye: Display none
or something.

00:40:18.334 --> 00:40:20.133
audience member: How do you--
how would you ever discern

00:40:20.133 --> 00:40:24.667
between, you know,
legitimacy there and...

00:40:24.667 --> 00:40:25.968
Ohye: Okay,
so another great thing

00:40:25.968 --> 00:40:27.133
about talking
to developers is that

00:40:27.133 --> 00:40:28.801
almost they're
always legitimate.

00:40:28.801 --> 00:40:30.000
Which is good.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.868
So, you know, we realize
that that's a lot--

00:40:33.868 --> 00:40:36.501
that a lot of code on the Web
does stuff like that.

00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:38.634
That uses display none,
visibility hidden.

00:40:38.634 --> 00:40:41.467
It's not something
we're looking to penalize.

00:40:41.467 --> 00:40:43.367
But we do think
that there are other ways

00:40:43.367 --> 00:40:45.033
if you can figure out
other ways.

00:40:45.033 --> 00:40:47.133
But in some cases
that's all you can use.

00:40:47.133 --> 00:40:48.634
And I think you'd
probably notice

00:40:48.634 --> 00:40:51.200
that those sites aren't hurt
in rankings, by any means,

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.968
because we're aware
of stuff like that.

00:40:53.968 --> 00:40:57.734
I think text indent to us
is just usually so flagrant.

00:40:57.734 --> 00:40:58.901
I mean, you might be
doing it for a good reason,

00:40:58.901 --> 00:41:02.133
so if you're doing
text-indent: -999,

00:41:02.133 --> 00:41:03.968
we're not saying, like,
take a whip to all those sites;

00:41:03.968 --> 00:41:05.033
they're going down.

00:41:05.033 --> 00:41:06.067
That doesn't
happen like that.

00:41:06.067 --> 00:41:07.601
We actually
evaluate all of them,

00:41:07.601 --> 00:41:10.033
but that just becomes a signal
that you're gonna be flagged.

00:41:10.033 --> 00:41:12.033
We consider that
fairly risky.

00:41:12.033 --> 00:41:14.334
So it's not a determinant
of being penalized,

00:41:14.334 --> 00:41:16.400
but it's just something
we want to discourage.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.734
Yes?

00:41:17.734 --> 00:41:19.267
audience member: Do pages
in the root directory

00:41:19.267 --> 00:41:20.734
get a higher
page rank priority

00:41:20.734 --> 00:41:22.968
than anything
under a subdirectory?

00:41:22.968 --> 00:41:25.234
Ohye: Uh, no,
they don't.

00:41:25.234 --> 00:41:27.033
I think the only problem
that you might see--

00:41:27.033 --> 00:41:28.234
I mean,
this isn't ranking,

00:41:28.234 --> 00:41:29.701
you probably won't
see a problem,

00:41:29.701 --> 00:41:32.133
but from users' perspectives,
if you go on and on and on

00:41:32.133 --> 00:41:34.934
in every subdirectory, then you
might have some problems there.

00:41:34.934 --> 00:41:37.634
They might be less likely to
share that link with each other.

00:41:37.634 --> 00:41:40.033
Therefore you'll have
less link love.

00:41:40.033 --> 00:41:41.801
Page rank
can be affected.

00:41:41.801 --> 00:41:44.267
So it's still good
to keep them fairly short.

00:41:44.267 --> 00:41:46.067
But, you know,
getting beyond, say, ten

00:41:46.067 --> 00:41:48.868
kind of becomes
hard to handle.

00:41:48.868 --> 00:41:50.868
One thing about videos
I wanted to mention as well

00:41:50.868 --> 00:41:52.434
is video sitemaps.

00:41:52.434 --> 00:41:54.501
So this isn't
part of sitemaps.org yet,

00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:56.701
but you could submit
a video sitemap to Google,

00:41:56.701 --> 00:41:59.801
giving us a list of your URL,
the thumbnail, and description,

00:41:59.801 --> 00:42:05.267
and then we can use that
as we process your videos too.

00:42:05.267 --> 00:42:07.601
Okay, so responding
appropriately.

00:42:07.601 --> 00:42:10.234
What this has to do with
is response codes.

00:42:10.234 --> 00:42:13.400
So we've got our domain,
we're setting it up,

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.167
we chose technologies, you know,
we've put stuff in the head,

00:42:17.167 --> 00:42:18.167
and now we're
gonna talk about

00:42:18.167 --> 00:42:21.067
how do we respond
to get requests?

00:42:21.067 --> 00:42:23.033
So here are
the key response codes.

00:42:23.033 --> 00:42:26.801
200s--That's your URL exists,
that's straightforward.

00:42:26.801 --> 00:42:29.601
We don't want you to serve 200
if it's actually a 404.

00:42:29.601 --> 00:42:31.434
That's called
a "soft 404."

00:42:31.434 --> 00:42:32.501
A lot of times
people do that

00:42:32.501 --> 00:42:33.601
and redirect it
to their home page

00:42:33.601 --> 00:42:35.501
or try to do
something like that.

00:42:35.501 --> 00:42:37.934
In those cases, again,
we're crawling,

00:42:37.934 --> 00:42:39.267
and we're just seeing
more duplicates,

00:42:39.267 --> 00:42:41.634
so there's no need
to really do that.

00:42:41.634 --> 00:42:44.834
Just go ahead and serve
a 404 when it 404s.

00:42:44.834 --> 00:42:47.968
301--This is important
if you have content

00:42:47.968 --> 00:42:50.367
that you actually want
to change the URL for.

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:52.300
A 301's gonna do that
because it'll say,

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:54.634
"301 says it's
moved permanently."

00:42:54.634 --> 00:42:56.033
So essentially
we'll say,

00:42:56.033 --> 00:42:58.434
take everything from this source
and move it to this target.

00:42:58.434 --> 00:43:02.801
So search results will have this
target URL and not the source,

00:43:02.801 --> 00:43:04.033
so that happens
with a 301.

00:43:04.033 --> 00:43:08.100
And all that link popularity
goes from A to B.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:12.267
404: File not found.
Same to us as a 410.

00:43:12.267 --> 00:43:13.367
I often get
into discussions

00:43:13.367 --> 00:43:15.000
where, like,
"But 410 means gone!"

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.133
and I just don't want
to do that here.

00:43:17.133 --> 00:43:19.634
So now we treat that
the same as a 410.

00:43:19.634 --> 00:43:22.234
And if you're gonna do
temporary site maintenance,

00:43:22.234 --> 00:43:24.033
some things that
we've seen developers do

00:43:24.033 --> 00:43:25.367
is, oh, I'm gonna robot out
my site right now,

00:43:25.367 --> 00:43:27.300
or I'll no-index everything

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.601
because I want to
bring it down for a day.

00:43:29.601 --> 00:43:32.300
Or maybe they'll say,
I'm gonna serve 404s everywhere.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.934
And that's actually
not our preferred method

00:43:34.934 --> 00:43:37.834
because a 404 signals to us
that it's not around, right?

00:43:37.834 --> 00:43:39.868
If you give us a 503
when you do this,

00:43:39.868 --> 00:43:42.400
then we'll know to come back
and check it again.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.567
So if you bring
your site down,

00:43:43.567 --> 00:43:47.033
go ahead and give us
a 500 response code.

00:43:47.033 --> 00:43:50.734
All right, this is
one of my favorite--

00:43:50.734 --> 00:43:52.834
maybe my favorite
feature.

00:43:52.834 --> 00:43:55.934
I'm gonna go with favorite--
in Webmaster Tools.

00:43:55.934 --> 00:43:58.934
And what this is
is crawl errors.

00:43:58.934 --> 00:44:01.033
And so actually, well,
the next slide is my favorite.

00:44:01.033 --> 00:44:02.267
Sorry.

00:44:02.267 --> 00:44:05.267
Here we'll show you
response codes for URLs

00:44:05.267 --> 00:44:06.400
that we've had
problems with.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.234
And you can just go ahead
and verify this.

00:44:08.234 --> 00:44:10.067
So there's things like
URLs that are unreachable,

00:44:10.067 --> 00:44:11.801
URLs that timed out.

00:44:11.801 --> 00:44:13.100
If you have
hosting problems

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.667
you can kind of notice
some of that here.

00:44:14.667 --> 00:44:18.367
That you'll have a lot
of time outs or something.

00:44:18.367 --> 00:44:21.300
Okay, this is
my favorite feature.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.300
Now what it is
is crawl error sources.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.968
So it's part of
this big movement--

00:44:25.968 --> 00:44:29.734
I don't know if you've heard--
about cleaning up the Web.

00:44:29.734 --> 00:44:32.133
And what you can do now
is fix broken links.

00:44:32.133 --> 00:44:34.200
So inside your site,
if it's verified,

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.801
and we can
show you crawl errors,

00:44:35.801 --> 00:44:39.734
now when you have a 404, we'll
actually tell you for each URL

00:44:39.734 --> 00:44:41.667
where it was linked from,

00:44:41.667 --> 00:44:44.801
or that that's an internal link
or an external link.

00:44:44.801 --> 00:44:46.567
See, that's
pretty powerful

00:44:46.567 --> 00:44:47.868
because now
you can actually

00:44:47.868 --> 00:44:49.734
figure out more about
who's linking to you,

00:44:49.734 --> 00:44:52.234
you could say--you can reach out
and say, "Hey, you know--"

00:44:52.234 --> 00:44:54.100
You could improve
your user experiences.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:55.634
"This is actually
the URL of my content,"

00:44:55.634 --> 00:44:57.868
or, you know, "you misspelled
this, or you mistyped this.

00:44:57.868 --> 00:44:59.200
"Let's go ahead
and clean that up

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.667
so they can come straight
to what you wanted."

00:45:01.667 --> 00:45:03.501
I think this will be fun
because I think

00:45:03.501 --> 00:45:05.334
kind of that seamless
Web experience

00:45:05.334 --> 00:45:06.901
would be really
fun as a user.

00:45:06.901 --> 00:45:08.734
So you can go ahead
and clean up your 404s

00:45:08.734 --> 00:45:11.667
through
crawl error sources.

00:45:11.667 --> 00:45:13.601
audience member: Question.
Ohye: Yes.

00:45:13.601 --> 00:45:16.667
audience member: I've been using
the Webmaster Tools,

00:45:16.667 --> 00:45:21.734
and I noticed that I have some
crawl errors on external links,

00:45:21.734 --> 00:45:23.234
and, you know, I don't know
who these people are

00:45:23.234 --> 00:45:25.801
who linked to me,
and they put in mistakes.

00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:27.934
How can I get them corrected
or eliminated from--

00:45:27.934 --> 00:45:29.767
Ohye: Okay.

00:45:29.767 --> 00:45:32.334
Got it. Did everyone
hear that question?

00:45:32.334 --> 00:45:34.133
So one answer,
of course, is money.

00:45:34.133 --> 00:45:35.400
No, I'm just kidding.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.300
What you usually do, I mean,
most people have, right,

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.200
like "admin @ the address"

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.701
and you can go ahead
and email that.

00:45:40.701 --> 00:45:43.300
That's kind of a--
or "webmaster @."

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.467
That's one good way
to try it out.

00:45:45.467 --> 00:45:47.334
That's kind of the approach
that we usually use

00:45:47.334 --> 00:45:49.167
to try to email people
when we have messages

00:45:49.167 --> 00:45:51.367
and they're not verified
in Webmaster tools.

00:45:51.367 --> 00:45:54.334
In the past we've just tried
to do those admin or webmaster.

00:45:54.334 --> 00:45:55.667
Some default
email address.

00:45:55.667 --> 00:45:56.701
audience member:
So it's up to me

00:45:56.701 --> 00:45:58.868
to correct it
with people linking.

00:45:58.868 --> 00:46:01.000
I can't just say
this or that.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.701
It may not
stay eliminated.

00:46:04.701 --> 00:46:07.100
Ohye: No, it'll still
exist on their site, right?

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.801
audience member: What about
creating a rule

00:46:08.801 --> 00:46:11.534
in your .htaccess
that redirects

00:46:11.534 --> 00:46:13.801
the bad adverts
to the good adverts?

00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:15.868
Ohye: Okay. Got ya.

00:46:15.868 --> 00:46:18.367
So this questioner asked--
good question, thank you.

00:46:18.367 --> 00:46:21.701
He asked, "Can I redirect that
404 to the appropriate page?"

00:46:21.701 --> 00:46:23.100
Of course.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:25.467
In that case,
that's not a soft 404, right?

00:46:25.467 --> 00:46:27.334
You're actually saying, here's
what they actually wanted,

00:46:27.334 --> 00:46:28.567
let's go ahead
and fix that.

00:46:28.567 --> 00:46:29.901
You could do that
as well,

00:46:29.901 --> 00:46:32.701
but for me I kind of like
getting it to the source,

00:46:32.701 --> 00:46:33.901
like making
that relationship

00:46:33.901 --> 00:46:35.801
and figuring out
what they wanted.

00:46:35.801 --> 00:46:38.067
But I'm a connection
person.

00:46:38.067 --> 00:46:39.501
So, yeah.

00:46:39.501 --> 00:46:40.834
audience member:
I see that Google

00:46:40.834 --> 00:46:43.100
is real slow
with the 301s.

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:47.167
If you put a 301 on some pages,
it takes Google up to a month,

00:46:47.167 --> 00:46:49.200
or a long time,
to get to it,

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.934
and I always wondered
if I could put that in my XML.

00:46:52.934 --> 00:46:56.234
We have, usually, like,
a few hundred pages like that.

00:46:56.234 --> 00:47:00.300
So should I put that
in the Google XML sitemap,

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.901
and with the updated date,
so that--

00:47:02.901 --> 00:47:06.267
because that it reads
every few hours.

00:47:06.267 --> 00:47:10.067
And would there be a penalty
if I did--took that approach?

00:47:10.067 --> 00:47:13.267
It seemed a little risky
so I never tried it.

00:47:13.267 --> 00:47:15.100
Ohye: I think in your sitemap,
too, you'd probably

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.701
want to put the source URL,
not the target, if you're--

00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:21.000
so that we crawl the old one
and know that it 301s.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.601
audience member:
That's what I mean.

00:47:22.601 --> 00:47:24.434
Ohye: Okay, so I think
the reason why the 301s

00:47:24.434 --> 00:47:26.167
might not be taking
as quick effect

00:47:26.167 --> 00:47:28.601
is usually because we haven't
crawled that content as readily,

00:47:28.601 --> 00:47:30.901
and it's just not getting
through our index as quickly.

00:47:30.901 --> 00:47:33.300
So if, like, you have
a news site, right,

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.100
we actually crawl
and index news really fast

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.901
because it has to be shown
to users really quickly.

00:47:36.901 --> 00:47:38.701
So we'll pick up
things like 301s

00:47:38.701 --> 00:47:40.300
for those quick crawls
that are quickly--

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.334
always modified
fairly quickly.

00:47:42.334 --> 00:47:43.968
If you have static content
that you just changed,

00:47:43.968 --> 00:47:46.300
it is gonna take a while
before we crawl it,

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.167
and then before it
gets through our pipeline.

00:47:48.167 --> 00:47:50.267
audience member:
Yeah, I guess my question is--

00:47:50.267 --> 00:47:51.567
Ohye: "Can you
speed it up?"

00:47:51.567 --> 00:47:54.000
audience member:
Ye--No, no, no, not quite that.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.167
Would Google think
that I'm, like, fooling the bot

00:47:56.167 --> 00:48:00.701
by saying that this page
is changed in the XML sitemap

00:48:00.701 --> 00:48:04.234
and all the change
has been is a 301 to the--

00:48:04.234 --> 00:48:05.234
301 to another page?

00:48:05.234 --> 00:48:06.567
Ohye: No.
audience member: No?

00:48:06.567 --> 00:48:08.834
That'd be all right?
Ohye: Yeah. That's fine.

00:48:08.834 --> 00:48:13.567
audience member: Since
the sitemap XML was mentioned,

00:48:13.567 --> 00:48:15.534
are you gonna
talk about it?

00:48:15.534 --> 00:48:19.534
Or relations between it
and of the, you know,

00:48:19.534 --> 00:48:24.400
just regular pages, or sometimes
people do sitemap in HTML?

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.234
What's the relations
between those?

00:48:26.234 --> 00:48:27.701
Ohye: Sure, I'm not
gonna talk about it,

00:48:27.701 --> 00:48:29.667
but I will
now that you asked.

00:48:29.667 --> 00:48:32.667
Okay, there's different
types of sitemaps you can have.

00:48:32.667 --> 00:48:34.868
There's lowercase "sitemap"
with lowercase S,

00:48:34.868 --> 00:48:36.734
which is like
an HTML sitemap, right?

00:48:36.734 --> 00:48:38.567
Where you click on a tab
and it says "sitemap,"

00:48:38.567 --> 00:48:39.901
and it shows you
the links

00:48:39.901 --> 00:48:42.934
and some type of navigation
scheme, group, somehow.

00:48:42.934 --> 00:48:45.601
What we're talking about--
that's good for users.

00:48:45.601 --> 00:48:48.133
And search engines
can follow that as well,

00:48:48.133 --> 00:48:50.501
but what we're talking about
is an XML sitemap,

00:48:50.501 --> 00:48:53.734
or just a sitemap that is
purely based for search engines.

00:48:53.734 --> 00:48:56.367
And you can
create this sitemap

00:48:56.367 --> 00:48:58.300
and submit it through
Webmaster Tools,

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.100
or you can ping Google
or ping Yahoo!

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.133
or ping Microsoft
with that URL.

00:49:02.133 --> 00:49:05.667
Additionally you could put this
XML sitemap for search engines

00:49:05.667 --> 00:49:07.167
in your Robots.txt file.

00:49:07.167 --> 00:49:09.767
So as you have all these
disallowed rules,

00:49:09.767 --> 00:49:11.200
you could also
put "sitemap:"

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.968
and then the URL
to your Robots.txt file.

00:49:13.968 --> 00:49:15.667
Now what this
sitemap file does for us

00:49:15.667 --> 00:49:18.968
is it's a list of the URLs
that you want crawled, right?

00:49:18.968 --> 00:49:20.300
It's not stuff--

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.167
it's not duplicate content
or any of that.

00:49:22.167 --> 00:49:24.167
And we'll actually
use this file

00:49:24.167 --> 00:49:26.133
to feed those URLs
to our crawler,

00:49:26.133 --> 00:49:28.167
and then it will
then be processed.

00:49:28.167 --> 00:49:30.567
So it maximizes
your chances of being crawled

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:32.901
if you create a sitemap.

00:49:32.901 --> 00:49:34.701
But--do you
understand that?

00:49:34.701 --> 00:49:36.167
Part of it? Okay.

00:49:36.167 --> 00:49:37.934
But the reason why I didn't
talk about it as much here--

00:49:37.934 --> 00:49:39.400
I kind of mentioned it--

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.601
is that it's no substitute
for good link architecture

00:49:42.601 --> 00:49:44.868
and strong URL structure,

00:49:44.868 --> 00:49:45.901
if that makes any sense.

00:49:45.901 --> 00:49:47.133
So a lot of times
people are like,

00:49:47.133 --> 00:49:48.400
"oh, I didn't really
link my stuff well,

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.868
but I have a sitemap."

00:49:49.868 --> 00:49:51.868
You know, a sitemap is fine,
but we're actually still--

00:49:51.868 --> 00:49:54.534
Once we get that list of URLs,
it comes to our crawl team,

00:49:54.534 --> 00:49:56.934
and we have to prioritize
what should be crawled when.

00:49:56.934 --> 00:49:58.534
We're not gonna say--

00:49:58.534 --> 00:50:00.367
Especially if you're
a spammer or something, right?

00:50:00.367 --> 00:50:02.434
"You gave us 30,000;
we'll go crawl them right now."

00:50:02.434 --> 00:50:03.701
Doesn't happen like that.

00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:05.300
Again we kind of apply
some algorithms to it,

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.801
try to be smart about it.

00:50:06.801 --> 00:50:10.501
So it's best to have strong link
architecture within your site.

00:50:10.501 --> 00:50:12.067
And it's also--
as a huge bonus,

00:50:12.067 --> 00:50:13.634
is just to submit
a sitemap to us,

00:50:13.634 --> 00:50:16.033
or to create one and put it
in your Robots.txt file,

00:50:16.033 --> 00:50:17.634
and then it'll be
picked up automatically

00:50:17.634 --> 00:50:19.667
by Google, Yahoo!
and Microsoft.

00:50:19.667 --> 00:50:21.467
So it really maximizes
your chances

00:50:21.467 --> 00:50:22.634
to be seen
by our crawler.

00:50:22.634 --> 00:50:24.567
audience member:
Just to clarify this question,

00:50:24.567 --> 00:50:27.067
so I've seen sites
where a sitemap

00:50:27.067 --> 00:50:30.334
is not actually
intended for users,

00:50:30.334 --> 00:50:35.601
but it looks like it was
just dynamically generated

00:50:35.601 --> 00:50:38.234
to direct the crawler
in certain directions.

00:50:38.234 --> 00:50:42.300
So sitemap creates--
has a lot of links and stuff.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.400
So this thing
versus sitemap XML.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.734
So what should I do?

00:50:46.734 --> 00:50:50.467
Should I do this one, both,
or only a sitemap XML?

00:50:50.467 --> 00:50:53.300
Ohye: I'm not sure what that one
exactly looks like,

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.367
but a sitemap XML file
for sure will be picked up,

00:50:55.367 --> 00:50:57.534
especially if you declare it
in your Robots.txt

00:50:57.534 --> 00:51:00.167
or you submit it
through Webmaster Tools.

00:51:00.167 --> 00:51:02.734
So the safe answer
is to do a sitemap XML file,

00:51:02.734 --> 00:51:07.567
'cause that's
the standard for us.

00:51:07.567 --> 00:51:11.567
Okay, so back
to these 404s.

00:51:11.567 --> 00:51:13.367
This was ugly. I don't know
if you remember this.

00:51:13.367 --> 00:51:16.367
This is Google
in the old days.

00:51:16.367 --> 00:51:19.234
But in Webmaster Tools
in our Help Center,

00:51:19.234 --> 00:51:21.834
we actually have
some JavaScript code.

00:51:21.834 --> 00:51:23.501
And you just tell us
what language,

00:51:23.501 --> 00:51:27.868
and we'll let you copy and paste
this code that you can apply

00:51:27.868 --> 00:51:30.801
so that now you have
these friendly 404s.

00:51:30.801 --> 00:51:32.934
So in the past
it just said, "Not found";

00:51:32.934 --> 00:51:34.367
now with this code
you'll actually--

00:51:34.367 --> 00:51:37.701
you might have closest matched
URLs that we found on your site.

00:51:37.701 --> 00:51:39.667
You can also get a link back
to the home page,

00:51:39.667 --> 00:51:41.767
a search box,
things like that.

00:51:41.767 --> 00:51:43.901
And a link to your
sitemap file too.

00:51:43.901 --> 00:51:47.267
So again, you know, a 404 is not
a great experience for a user,

00:51:47.267 --> 00:51:49.767
it's gonna happen, but when it
does, give them some other way

00:51:49.767 --> 00:51:54.000
to stay on your site and find
what they were looking for.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.133
All right, so now
engaging the community.

00:51:57.133 --> 00:51:58.601
This part is, you know,

00:51:58.601 --> 00:52:01.968
kind of all the social media
stuff you've been hearing about.

00:52:01.968 --> 00:52:03.767
First I just want
to give you this quote.

00:52:03.767 --> 00:52:09.167
This is from Clay Shirky, from
his book, &lt;i&gt;Here Comes Everybody.&lt;/i&gt;

00:52:09.167 --> 00:52:15.100
He says...

00:52:20.434 --> 00:52:22.000
Right, so this is
all about building

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.167
and engaging
his community.

00:52:25.167 --> 00:52:29.133
So if you want to use a blog,
how do you do this?

00:52:29.133 --> 00:52:31.434
Well, a good thing to do is not
just to put anything out there,

00:52:31.434 --> 00:52:33.501
actually to become an authority,
someone people look to,

00:52:33.501 --> 00:52:36.534
someplace that people go
to read your articles.

00:52:36.534 --> 00:52:39.167
Use categories
that are also keywords.

00:52:39.167 --> 00:52:40.801
That's important too.

00:52:40.801 --> 00:52:43.000
And of course
keep your blog secure.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.567
Blogs are easily hacked,

00:52:44.567 --> 00:52:47.267
it's kind of becoming
on the increase as well.

00:52:47.267 --> 00:52:48.601
And know that we give you

00:52:48.601 --> 00:52:50.767
hackable software warnings
in Webmaster Tools.

00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:52.667
Again, we're trying
to communicate more with you

00:52:52.667 --> 00:52:54.667
about how you can
better your site.

00:52:54.667 --> 00:52:56.267
So I could list
a whole bunch of things here,

00:52:56.267 --> 00:52:58.501
but I actually just
give you this query term.

00:52:58.501 --> 00:53:00.901
If you query
"matt cutts seo blogging tips"--

00:53:00.901 --> 00:53:02.901
he's this guy we work with,
he's great.

00:53:02.901 --> 00:53:04.501
He actually will give you
a whole bunch more

00:53:04.501 --> 00:53:06.767
that you can look at.

00:53:06.767 --> 00:53:09.033
So let's go
to some FAQs.

00:53:09.033 --> 00:53:10.200
You might be asking,

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.767
"All right, should I publish
my full content,

00:53:11.767 --> 00:53:13.400
or just a snippet
of my blog?"

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.801
Well, it's your
own preference.

00:53:14.801 --> 00:53:17.934
Obviously if you want to do
something with analytics.

00:53:17.934 --> 00:53:20.968
But from Google's perspective it
doesn't make a huge difference.

00:53:20.968 --> 00:53:23.334
It's mildly better if we see
the full content first,

00:53:23.334 --> 00:53:25.834
but you could do
what you like.

00:53:25.834 --> 00:53:27.300
Just having been
to a lot of conferences

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.467
where we talk
about stuff like this,

00:53:28.467 --> 00:53:31.100
most users do prefer
to see the full content.

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:33.000
But again,
it's your choice.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000
People also ask about duplicate
content on their blogs.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.501
"I have an archive link,

00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:39.234
"and then it lists
all the same blog posts,

00:53:39.234 --> 00:53:40.467
"but now with
a different URL.

00:53:40.467 --> 00:53:42.067
Can I Robots.txt
that out?"

00:53:42.067 --> 00:53:43.634
And the answer
is yes, of course.

00:53:43.634 --> 00:53:45.534
Again, just be careful and
make sure you do it properly,

00:53:45.534 --> 00:53:47.734
but go ahead.

00:53:47.734 --> 00:53:51.267
So if you're asking this,
what about tweets, right?

00:53:51.267 --> 00:53:52.434
Good question.

00:53:52.434 --> 00:53:55.000
Well, unlike blogs
that use ping services

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.234
to let everyone know when
a new blog has been published,

00:53:57.234 --> 00:53:58.701
to let the search
engines know,

00:53:58.701 --> 00:54:00.467
Twitter doesn't
do the same thing.

00:54:00.467 --> 00:54:01.901
There's no ping service.

00:54:01.901 --> 00:54:04.100
So of course we will
index tweets if we see them,

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:07.334
but it has to be--currently--
linked to on the Web.

00:54:07.334 --> 00:54:09.834
So if it's linked to,
then it can be found, crawled,

00:54:09.834 --> 00:54:11.634
and indexed, and returned
in search results,

00:54:11.634 --> 00:54:13.367
but it's not
that automatic process

00:54:13.367 --> 00:54:17.868
that you see often
with blogs.

00:54:17.868 --> 00:54:19.901
All right, so also when you
want to engage the community,

00:54:19.901 --> 00:54:22.133
you might be thinking
about comments and reviews.

00:54:22.133 --> 00:54:24.000
So some of
the benefits of this

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.534
is that it can help your users
make an informed decision.

00:54:27.534 --> 00:54:29.767
It also helps them communicate
with you with comments,

00:54:29.767 --> 00:54:31.968
or communicate
with each other.

00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:35.000
But just know
if you do want comments,

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.734
I'd host it
on your own site

00:54:36.734 --> 00:54:38.267
rather than have them
go to some third party

00:54:38.267 --> 00:54:40.968
where they might then engage
in this third-party site, right?

00:54:40.968 --> 00:54:43.067
'Cause a lot of it
you're doing for engagement.

00:54:43.067 --> 00:54:46.033
So while there are third-party
comment sites out there,

00:54:46.033 --> 00:54:48.367
it's probably something you'll
want to do within your site.

00:54:48.367 --> 00:54:49.834
This is for kind of
search-friendly reasons,

00:54:49.834 --> 00:54:53.167
and also
for user stickiness.

00:54:53.167 --> 00:54:55.901
Oh, but you do need
to moderate for spam.

00:54:55.901 --> 00:54:58.467
Next, also,
if you do reviews.

00:54:58.467 --> 00:55:00.701
Let's say you want to sell
women's high heels,

00:55:00.701 --> 00:55:02.300
and you've got reviews
of women saying,

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:03.801
"Oh, this doesn't
pinch my toes,"

00:55:03.801 --> 00:55:06.367
or, like, "I could run
in this or play basketball."

00:55:06.367 --> 00:55:09.000
That's terrific, but what you
want to do is keep those reviews

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.834
on the same page
as your main product.

00:55:11.834 --> 00:55:14.267
So they don't go to a separate
URL to see that review

00:55:14.267 --> 00:55:15.634
because now you've got

00:55:15.634 --> 00:55:17.501
this product description
of high heels,

00:55:17.501 --> 00:55:19.868
but then you have
people commenting over here.

00:55:19.868 --> 00:55:21.467
You really want to put
all that content

00:55:21.467 --> 00:55:23.667
that's relevant
to that product on one page.

00:55:23.667 --> 00:55:25.567
So when people link and say,
"Oh, I love this--

00:55:25.567 --> 00:55:27.300
"you know, I just added
some comments here.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:30.000
I love this product," and they
share it with their friends,

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.801
it's only that one URL
that's being

00:55:31.801 --> 00:55:33.100
shared around
and linked to.

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:35.334
It's not these
two separate URLs.

00:55:35.334 --> 00:55:39.133
So comments I'd usually keep
on the same product page.

00:55:39.133 --> 00:55:40.801
Also when
it comes to reviews,

00:55:40.801 --> 00:55:42.767
you might've seen
this announcement.

00:55:42.767 --> 00:55:43.934
At developer conferences

00:55:43.934 --> 00:55:46.033
I always get asked
about microformats.

00:55:46.033 --> 00:55:48.767
So now I have an answer.

00:55:48.767 --> 00:55:51.133
We just released rich snippets,
and what this does

00:55:51.133 --> 00:55:53.467
is take sites
that are based on reviews,

00:55:53.467 --> 00:55:55.200
or descriptions of people

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.534
which are set
at social networking sites,

00:55:57.534 --> 00:55:59.467
and if they're
marked up--

00:55:59.467 --> 00:56:01.367
Something happened to my slide;
looks kind of funny.

00:56:01.367 --> 00:56:03.467
But if they're
marked up in RDFa,

00:56:03.467 --> 00:56:07.667
or with a microformat review
or hCard,

00:56:07.667 --> 00:56:09.100
we can actually
show that here.

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:11.400
So you can see
that snippet now has stars

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.667
for the rating
as well as price range.

00:56:14.667 --> 00:56:17.000
So that's done
through microformats.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.234
We're looking
to expand that as well.

00:56:19.234 --> 00:56:20.834
Okay, so about
engaging the community,

00:56:20.834 --> 00:56:22.801
what can you do
through Webmaster Tools?

00:56:22.801 --> 00:56:25.000
Of course you could
check your backlinks.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.100
This is a good way to see
who's linking to you,

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.767
you can find out
who your fans are.

00:56:29.767 --> 00:56:32.434
So you might realize you have
audiences you never knew about.

00:56:32.434 --> 00:56:33.868
If I'm selling
high heels,

00:56:33.868 --> 00:56:35.767
I'm thinking my audience
is primarily women,

00:56:35.767 --> 00:56:37.367
it might actually
be the case that there's

00:56:37.367 --> 00:56:39.501
a lot of men out there,
you know, in these--

00:56:39.501 --> 00:56:41.100
 &lt;i&gt;GQ&lt;/i&gt; or something
that are like,

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:42.834
"Actually, this is
the new fashion."

00:56:42.834 --> 00:56:44.067
And if I start
to check my backlinks,

00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:45.868
you know,
see my server logs,

00:56:45.868 --> 00:56:47.300
that's where I could
start to find out

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.868
who's linking to me
and where they're linking to.

00:56:50.868 --> 00:56:53.667
The next part about this is
just to maximize your traffic.

00:56:53.667 --> 00:56:57.300
And Webmaster Tools will
show you up to 100 queries now

00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:00.901
of the queries that brought
your site up in search results,

00:57:00.901 --> 00:57:02.234
which are
the impressions,

00:57:02.234 --> 00:57:05.467
as well as the actual results
that people clicked on.

00:57:05.467 --> 00:57:06.934
And we'll show that
for seven days,

00:57:06.934 --> 00:57:08.634
two weeks,
or different months.

00:57:08.634 --> 00:57:10.367
So again that's
a lot of data here.

00:57:10.367 --> 00:57:11.934
And you can use that
to actually maximize

00:57:11.934 --> 00:57:13.267
what you're getting
impressions for

00:57:13.267 --> 00:57:15.300
and make sure you
get that clickthrough.

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.534
So here's another way, you know,
to understand your community

00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:22.667
and figure out ways to give them
more of what they want.

00:57:22.667 --> 00:57:27.667
I wanted to end this
presentation with this question.

00:57:27.667 --> 00:57:29.234
So it's our pop quiz.

00:57:29.234 --> 00:57:30.601
"Do you think
it's better--"

00:57:30.601 --> 00:57:33.701
I was actually asked this
at an SEO developer meet-up.

00:57:33.701 --> 00:57:39.601
[reads]

00:57:39.601 --> 00:57:45.534
So I'll let you think
about that for a few seconds.

00:57:47.367 --> 00:57:48.767
Okay.

00:57:48.767 --> 00:57:51.033
So what I think this person's
asking is essentially--

00:57:51.033 --> 00:57:52.467
if you take it
to extremes--

00:57:52.467 --> 00:57:55.267
she was asking,

00:57:55.267 --> 00:57:58.100
"Would it be better to have
the number one ranking--"

00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:59.367
or something,
you know,

00:57:59.367 --> 00:58:00.868
she could think
in terms of these, like,

00:58:00.868 --> 00:58:03.634
"Is it better to have the number
one ranking for this keyword,

00:58:03.634 --> 00:58:06.067
or is it better to have
hundreds of followers?"

00:58:06.067 --> 00:58:08.601
You know, you're kind of looking
at it two different ways.

00:58:08.601 --> 00:58:10.467
But I think what
you actually need to do,

00:58:10.467 --> 00:58:11.634
and that's why
I like this question,

00:58:11.634 --> 00:58:13.133
is just take a step back.

00:58:13.133 --> 00:58:15.000
Okay, 'cause we're not
just talking about rankings,

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.901
and we're not just
talking about followers.

00:58:16.901 --> 00:58:19.968
What you actually probably want
on your site is conversions.

00:58:19.968 --> 00:58:21.634
Right, it's not just
getting that traffic,

00:58:21.634 --> 00:58:22.934
it's making a conversion.

00:58:22.934 --> 00:58:24.601
That conversion
can be anything.

00:58:24.601 --> 00:58:26.400
It can be purchasing
a microwave,

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:29.300
it can be hiring you
as a freelance developer,

00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.467
right, there's a lot
of things you might want--

00:58:30.467 --> 00:58:32.734
signing up
for a newsletter.

00:58:32.734 --> 00:58:34.200
But--So if you
look at that--

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.367
So what you actually
probably want is a conversion.

00:58:36.367 --> 00:58:38.367
That's the ultimate goal.

00:58:38.367 --> 00:58:40.200
And how do people
make conversions?

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.834
Well, kind of using
pseudo-psychology,

00:58:42.834 --> 00:58:44.801
I would say a lot of people
make conversions

00:58:44.801 --> 00:58:47.567
when they feel that they're
well-informed and comfortable.

00:58:47.567 --> 00:58:48.901
Okay?

00:58:48.901 --> 00:58:50.834
And where they kind of
get some of this information

00:58:50.834 --> 00:58:52.934
is either from their friends,
like in social media,

00:58:52.934 --> 00:58:55.267
where they heard about you or
they heard about your microwave,

00:58:55.267 --> 00:58:58.434
or they just kind of did
a search and found your site.

00:58:58.434 --> 00:59:00.567
Right, so there's still
these two places where they can

00:59:00.567 --> 00:59:02.868
get information and then
make that conversion.

00:59:02.868 --> 00:59:05.200
But I would say
that most importantly,

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.667
people want to feel comfortable,
they often research,

00:59:08.667 --> 00:59:09.968
and when they research they
often

00:59:09.968 --> 00:59:11.667
go through a search engine
to find your site,

00:59:11.667 --> 00:59:12.834
or they'll
come onto your site

00:59:12.834 --> 00:59:14.234
and actually
read more about you.

00:59:14.234 --> 00:59:15.567
So while they might
hear about you

00:59:15.567 --> 00:59:18.167
through some social
media network, or, you know,

00:59:18.167 --> 00:59:20.300
they might hear
about you through a tweet,

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.801
what they're probably gonna do
in the end is want to know more,

00:59:22.801 --> 00:59:25.133
and that's gonna usually
come through your site itself.

00:59:25.133 --> 00:59:26.567
So when it comes
to this question

00:59:26.567 --> 00:59:29.334
about creating a site
or working in social media,

00:59:29.334 --> 00:59:30.734
I'm kind of old school,

00:59:30.734 --> 00:59:33.067
and I also work at Google,
so I'm obviously biased,

00:59:33.067 --> 00:59:36.400
but I think if you create a site
that's helpful to users,

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.267
it's accessible
on multiple platforms,

00:59:38.267 --> 00:59:41.300
whether it's a desktop
or it's a mobile phone,
