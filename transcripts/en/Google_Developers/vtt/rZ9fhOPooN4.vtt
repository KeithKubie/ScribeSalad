EUGENE OKSMAN: My name is
Eugene, and this is Akhilesh.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.470
And together we run the
mobile SDK for Salesforce.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.030
Our mission is pretty simple--
to help developers create

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.920
amazing mobile apps that are
powered by the enterprise data.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.300
So when it comes
to creating apps

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.220
that you use at your job, your
employee-facing applications,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.890
Salesforce is a
great platform that

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.910
allows you to consume
your enterprise data

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.730
and put that inside
any mobile experience.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.780
Obviously no mobile
conversation is

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.150
complete without getting into
the debate between native

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.380
and HTML5.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.810
You've all been there.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.590
Our position is pretty
straightforward.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.625
It depends on you.

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:39.300
You make the decision
on an app by app basis.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.289
That's why when we talk about
our mobile SDK, we layer it.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.580
And we provide you with all
the essential functionality

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.880
that you need to create a really
solid enterprise mobile app.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.660
So we start by
providing identity

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.540
via the OAuth2 standard.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.680
We have a secure
offline database in case

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.370
your app needs to work when
it's completely disconnected.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.360
We have API wrappers and data
synchronization techniques

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.140
so that you can easily move
objects and data back and forth

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.370
between the cloud and
your mobile applications.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.550
But when it comes to
creating the user interface,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.620
we give you the
choice-- especially when

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.514
it comes to creating
HTML-based apps.

00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:12.430
There are a lot of great
frameworks out there.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.770
All of them have their merits,
and it's really up to you

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.970
how you leverage them.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.310
So now by combining your
HTML with a hybrid container

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.910
that we have based on
PhoneGap, web developers

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.020
become mobile developers.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.440
And ultimately, we believe
that is the future,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.220
enabling every web developer
to become a mobile developer.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.480
But I'm here to talk about
our journey with Polymer.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.310
About a year ago, I
was on Hacker News,

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.770
like I start my daily
morning, and I saw this link

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.200
to this brand new framework.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.160
I was like, all right.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.350
I'll go check it out.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.970
I started watching the video
with Matt from Google I/O,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.570
and I was just
completely blown away.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.110
This is from last year.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.267
So in my excited state,
I ran over to Akhilesh

00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:49.100
and started ranting.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.770
It's like, come on!

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.810
We have to try this framework.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.380
It's amazing.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.940
It's easy.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.740
It's powerful.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.450
Look at Designer.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.116
Look at Sandbox.

00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:55.074
It's so cool.

00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:56.240
He was like, yeah, whatever.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.610
You talk to me in [? bren. ?]
You framework every single day.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.110
But as we started
this conversation,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.050
we realized that
Polymer was unique.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.289
It was based on polyfills.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.830
A lot of the platform
stuff was going

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.830
to go away and be
baked into the browser.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.729
And that was a really
attractive to us.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.300
That's why we released our
first version of our components

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.390
based on Polymer at
our annual conference.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.060
And we demoed that on stage
in front of a large audience.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.525
So now I'll go into Sandbox and
show you what we demonstrated.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.240
So what I have here is
an instance of Sandbox

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.470
that we wired up with several
Salesforce components.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.000
So I'll start by dragging
over the visual components

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.420
for the navigation.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.370
Pretty simple components
of starting up.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.226
And then I'll drag over a list.

00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:39.600
And the idea here
is that we want

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.300
to build a product catalog
for L'Oreal, a branded product

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.580
catalog that they could
submit to their employees

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.760
and into their apps.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.120
So now that I've dragged
this UI list element,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.466
you just saw a lot of data.

00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:51.090
Well, this component
behind the scenes,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.709
made according to our cloud,
it got all of the information,

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.250
with the proper
security permissions,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.670
and rendered this list.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.380
Pretty cool.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.600
It was that simple.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.690
And if you look at the
code, all it is right

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.630
now is just three lines.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.410
But now I want to
transform this list.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.340
I'm pointing to one of
our accounts tables,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.990
but I'm building
a product catalog.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.110
So I'll change this to
point to the product table.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.270
And just like that,
everything changed.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.640
New REST API call, new data.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.184
I can then further decorate
this particular table

00:03:19.184 --> 00:03:20.975
by changing some of
the exposed attributes.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.340
Let's add a picture.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.870
And just like that, new
data has been sent back

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.920
to this visual element.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.190
No change in code, just
changing the parameters.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.950
And the behaviors and this list
automatically reflect that.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.770
But this app was
supposed to be branded.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.370
It was supposed
to be for L'Oreal.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.440
Now Akhilesh and I are
not web developers,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.580
so we decided to leverage
the power of the web

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.519
by going to L'Oreal's website
and taking their stylesheets.

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.060
So we literally went
to this website,

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.880
copied some of the
style properties,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.200
put them into our app.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.560
And now when we change the
stylesheets to that of L'Oreal,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.260
immediately the look
and feel changes

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.700
of this particular component.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.670
And it's that simple.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.570
It's the same 20 lines of code.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.780
And it looks like
magic, but it's really

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.120
the power of web components,
all the complexities hidden.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.790
And as a developer, this
is all you have to use.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.500
So this was our first
release, and we've

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.995
learned a great
deal about Polymer.

00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:15.370
And I'll hand it
over to Akhilesh

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.985
to talk about what
we built next.

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:18.610
AKHILESH GUPTA: Thanks
so much, Eugene.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.529
So as Eugene sort of
showed us the journey,

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.540
all we started with
simple elements.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.380
Actually, we have come
quite a long way now.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.690
We have kind of built up
our own sort of gallery

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.360
of our own elements here.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.430
And initially when
we started, we really

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.815
did not have much of an element.

00:04:34.815 --> 00:04:37.020
We started with some
basic data elements.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.340
And you can see in this
category, and lot of people

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.540
sort of talked about
this beforehand,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.430
you need to think about elements
in two different categories.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.320
The ones which are
just data elements,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.410
or non-visual elements, they
just do behind the scenes

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.090
all the work for you and
help other visual elements

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.760
to really render properly.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.830
So we have few data elements,
such as S Object collection

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.020
here to sort of point to
some tables inside Salesforce

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.490
and gather some list of
records from Salesforce

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.900
and the detail to fetch any
record detail from Salesforce.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.260
But then we started to
work on some UI elements,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.310
and we had some the simplest
in view elements initially,

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.330
just to show simple application.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.105
But then we actually
started to work around

00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:21.100
with the rest of our
colleagues, and we

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.000
realized that our
user experience

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.840
team had been working
on a prototyping

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.670
framework with Angular.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.920
And they were building a
bunch of different components

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.280
in Angular, like web
directives almost,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.880
to help build a design
framework so that they

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.675
can test new designs and do
some user research with them.

00:05:39.675 --> 00:05:40.550
So we talked to them.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.810
We told them about Polymer,
and they were super excited

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.309
about that.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:45.650
And within actually
few hours, they

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.790
were able to turn their
Angular components

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.880
into Polymer components.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.540
And you can see
the gallery here--

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.930
and this is all hosted
on a Heroku website--

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.180
you can see there is a whole
gallery of more than 100+

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.934
components.

00:05:55.934 --> 00:05:58.100
And you can see if I drag
and drop, like for example

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.240
this element.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.740
It's a simple
anchor doc element,

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.310
we call it, and exposes all the
properties on the right side.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.310
Through our designer tool, I
can go change anything here.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.320
I can put my name.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.080
And that's the
beauty of Polymer.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.450
I change any attribute
that start to show up.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.070
So all these elements which
were, like whatever, Angular

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:22.100
earlier, were now Polymer with
live binding capabilities.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.710
We have a calendar component.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.600
We have a navigation component
I can pull down here.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.524
So if you're building
an application,

00:06:32.524 --> 00:06:34.940
you want to have some navigation
on the left side-- we all

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.314
are used to that
through Facebook

00:06:36.314 --> 00:06:37.610
and other applications.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.260
A notification section.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.260
So we have your built, building
these sort of core elements

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.050
for prototyping.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.460
But now when we could
attach them with real data,

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.240
they really can
come alive and may

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.880
help you build a proper
application, which is exactly

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.120
which I kind of want
to show you here.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.520
So what we can do
here, for example,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.650
I can pull a simple
list element,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.990
which is nothing
but a static HTML.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.910
It's creating simple list
of [? ULL and LIs. ?]

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.570
And what I can do is I can
bind with real data coming

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.560
from Salesforce.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.040
But to do that, I'll first just
log into Salesforce account.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.970
It will ensure that
OAuth flow and give me

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.490
a session from Salesforce.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.530
And I can drag and drop
this invisible element

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.320
behind the scenes
which is just running

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.580
a query against
our account table.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.060
And I can bind these
two together now,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.900
just by simply selecting
my collection object

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.140
and using the
collection property.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.220
And while it quickly just
pulls all my account records,

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.040
sales account records
from Salesforce,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.680
or the box using other
APIs, I can go back

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.470
to my collection element,
change anything here.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.200
If I want to look at,
say, Contact Table,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.044
look at the recent
items from there.

00:07:44.044 --> 00:07:45.460
I can just change
some properties,

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.530
and now I have a
list of contacts

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.410
coming from Salesforce.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.910
So let me show you
some more stuff.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.510
I can put some list
header in there

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.490
to make it more contextual.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.090
I can go to my list
header element.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.940
Drag it up there on the top.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.990
Give it more context.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.540
Bind back to my data element.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.870
And specify the object on
our table am I looking at.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.662
Give some visual
indication of the icon.

00:08:11.662 --> 00:08:13.870
So now it shows exactly
which kind of information I'm

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:14.780
looking at.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.534
But this is, again,
the simple view.

00:08:17.534 --> 00:08:18.950
When we look at
these demos, we're

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.170
always concerned about, OK.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.450
Can I really build an
application with this?

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.660
So what I was doing
was we actually

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.550
built up a scaffold
element, which

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.211
basically nothing but a
container in some ways,

00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:30.710
where you can put
a navigation area.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.400
So I can drag and drop my
navigation element here,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.641
which I showed you guys
a little bit earlier.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.140
So I can just drag
and drop it here.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.400
So I have now
navigation working.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.610
I have a notifications area.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.169
I can drag and drop
notifications here.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.170
And then I was centrally
sort of manager of it,

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.730
I can build my application.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.440
And I can put these elements
now back into this guy,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.490
and bind this whole
application from my navigation

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.290
on the left side.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.920
So what I could do is go
back to my collection object.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.370
Instead pointing
at the start value,

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.880
I can select it
from a navigation

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.150
and say, selected
as object property.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.080
And voila! it automatically
pulls in accounts.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.610
So now if I tap
on opportunities,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.654
it's pulling my
opportunities list.

00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:15.320
And so I was able to
build that quickly.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.320
And it's kind of a
cooking show that I'm

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.430
showing you now
the final product.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.930
So like this is the
full application.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.950
But I can select any object--
and it's kind of the designer

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.350
is a little broken here.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.980
But ultimately, it gives
me the simple [INAUDIBLE],

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.310
which is just 20 lines
of simple HTML tags

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.160
which anyone can understand.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.750
And the power which comes with
Polymer and Mobile SDK, which

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.830
we as a product
are working on, I

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.200
could just copy/paste
the simple HTML.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.050
Go back to Xcode where I
can create a new project

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.290
with Mobile SDK, which works
across on iOS platform.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.910
It's a simple HTML page.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.670
I can just drop this HTML here.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.230
Save this guy, and run
this in my iOS simulator.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.250
It will launch this application.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.040
Authenticate against Salesforce,
using my Salesforce login flow.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.700
And I have now the
same application

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.730
running as a native application.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.230
I can just choose any object,
look at the details right here.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.994
I have notifications.

00:10:12.994 --> 00:10:14.660
It's a fully-fledged
working application

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.524
that I could build in
just 20 lines of code.

00:10:18.524 --> 00:10:24.907
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:24.907 --> 00:10:26.590
AUDIENCE: Say that
link is available?

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.800
EUGENE OKSMAN: So yeah.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.230
So this is part of
our announcement.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.730
Yeah.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.580
So here's the link.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.614
You go to bitly/mobilepacks.

00:10:31.614 --> 00:10:33.780
We're an open company, and
so we encourage everybody

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.404
to start playing with
these frameworks.

00:10:35.404 --> 00:10:37.240
All of the source is
available on GitHub,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.940
and we're putting Designer Host
on Heroku onto this website.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.890
So if you want to build
an enterprise app,

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.360
get a free developer account
and start using Polymer.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.092
And together we're going
to change the world.

00:10:47.092 --> 00:10:48.403
[APPLAUSE]
