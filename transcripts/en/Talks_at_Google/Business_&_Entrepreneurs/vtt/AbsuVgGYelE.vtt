[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.346 --> 00:00:08.220
SPEAKER 1: Hello everyone,
and please join me

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.510
in welcoming Asif Saleh.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.080
Asif is a Senior Director
of Strategy, Communications,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.650
and Empowerment for BRAC
and BRAC International.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.860
He oversees the advocacy
information and communication

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.220
technology and
communications departments,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.710
as well as social
innovation lab.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.160
He also manages BRAC's
empowerment initiatives,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.680
including human rights and legal
aid services, migration, urban,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.950
and skills development programs.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.620
Prior to joining
BRAC in 2011, he

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.140
was the Executive
Director at Goldman Sachs

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.270
and previously worked for IBM.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.630
He was recognized for his
work by Asia Society's Asia 21

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.820
program, the Bangladeshi
American Foundation,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.980
and was selected as
an Asia 21 fellow.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.830
Asif connects private
and social sectors

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.250
to develop and scale
innovations that uplift some

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.620
of the world's poorest people.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.950
A bit of context on BRAC.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.810
BRAC is the world's largest
nonprofit organization

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.740
and is based in Bangladesh.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.310
It's a global leader in
developing and implementing

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.190
cost effective,
evidence based programs,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.230
to assist more
marginalized people

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.830
in extremely poor, conflict
prone, and post disaster

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.810
settings.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.900
These include initiatives
in education, health care,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.980
micro-finance, girls
empowerment, agriculture,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.920
human and legal
rights, and more.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.320
In 2016, BRAC employed more than
110,000 people in 11 countries,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.590
with a global expenditure
of about 900 million.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.650
With low middle income countries
like Bangladesh developed

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.550
developing very rapidly, both
high and low tech solutions

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.350
will be instrumental
in bridging growth

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.050
growing socioeconomic divide.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.170
Asif provides
insight on how BRAC

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.009
will reach 130 million people
in changing the way poverty is

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.870
addressed worldwide.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.784
Thank you, please
take the floor.

00:02:14.784 --> 00:02:16.034
ASIF SALEH: Thank you so much.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.630
Let me start talking a
little bit about myself, just

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.810
to give a personal context.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.650
I grew up in Bangladesh,
and when I was 18

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.950
I left to get my higher
education in the United States.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.780
So I got a degree
in Computer Science,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.120
and when I graduated, what
I wanted to do with my life

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.670
was more about solving
business problems.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.440
And I graduated at the time when
tech jobs were quite plentiful,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.180
and I landed with four
offers before I finished

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.020
my graduation, and I decided to
take up a job at Goldman Sachs.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.320
And my motivation
was that I didn't

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.090
want to be a
programmer who was just

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.780
coding at the back bench,
just nobody looks at him,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.850
I actually wanted to be
where I work with people

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.750
and solve problems.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.060
And before I knew it, I spent
almost 12 years at Goldman,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.120
working with trading, and
electronic trading, algorithms,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.750
and all these things.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.580
But something was
not quite right.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.166
And I felt like this was not
quite what I was meant to do.

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:31.540
Probably not the
kind of problems

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.750
I wanted to solve for
the rest of my life.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.350
So I started a
charity back in 2001

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.610
in my free time, which was
a platform for diaspora

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.250
Bangladeshis to
connect and also work

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.430
on a cause for human rights
victims in Bangladesh.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.820
And the idea was
to raise awareness

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.430
on human rights issues and
also to rehabilitate them.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.550
And I'm glad to see there
is a fellow member here,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.610
[INAUDIBLE], who's here,
who was a member of this

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.310
and I connected with a
lot of young Bangladeshis

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.600
during that time.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.460
And the organization
actually grew quite rapidly.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.030
Before I knew it, we had like
nine chapters in nine cities,

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.480
and we were connected
all around the world.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.940
And we were doing
projects and we had

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.970
5,000 people in our network.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.460
So that was my thing.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.190
I figured that this is something
that I was kind of prone to do,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.260
so I had to take
a leap of faith.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.320
I had to decide what I wanted
to do with the rest of my life.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.130
So at one point, I decided
to end my career at Goldman,

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.960
and move back to
Bangladesh, and started

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.550
to work in the
development sector.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.010
And that's where the
rest of my life started.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:54.000
So I actually, from the
number one investment bank,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.070
I joined the number one NGO,
which is the BRAC, so quite

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.270
a large shift.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.770
But interestingly, from what
to add to what [INAUDIBLE] said

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.200
about BRAC, I think
when I joined BRAC,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.690
it was quite an
interesting learning,

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.870
because BRAC is
something so unique

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.650
that there isn't
a lot of charity

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.150
organizations like BRAC.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.320
Because BRAC kind
of uses whatever

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.560
works to solve a
developing problem.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.740
So whether it's business, if
it's a market based solutions,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.620
I think it's fairly agnostic
to what kind of solution

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.490
would work.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.730
And that resulted to BRAC
from being a very small relief

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.280
organizations to what a giant
behemoth that it is right now,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.760
which has very, very large
scale programs in education,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.760
to running the largest
non-government school network,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.990
to one of the largest
microfinance network,

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.060
to very big health networks
all around the country.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.940
And it expanded
outside Bangladesh

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.970
about 12 years ago now,
it's in 12 other countries.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.530
So as you heard, it's total
budget, global budget,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.980
is about $1.1 billion,
with about 70%

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.580
of Bangladesh's budget comes
from its own resources.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.350
And we are slowly on a path
to become self-dependent

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.700
for our Bangladesh programs in
the next five to seven years.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.310
But what BRAC has is that
it's quite unique in the sense

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.830
that it has these large scale
programs that I mentioned.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.410
It also has about 15
social enterprises.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.810
It has about seven
large investments

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.880
that it made, from bank,
to insurance companies,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:45.540
to various other at a
university, it's quite unique.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.140
But there is a kind of method
to all this large expansion,

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.710
and in order to
get to that I think

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.330
I should talk about a quote that
our founder, Sir Fazle Hasan

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.170
Abed, talks about a lot of time,
which is "Poverty is not just

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.640
poverty of money or income.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.770
We also see a poverty of
self-esteem, hope, opportunity,

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.910
and freedom.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.120
People trapped in a
cycle of destitution

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.420
often don't realize their lives
can be changed for the better

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.910
through their own activities.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.760
Once they understand that, it's
like a light gets turned on."

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.290
So at BRAC, we are
in the business

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.820
of turning those lights on.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.320
So whether it's about financial
inclusion, or education, or any

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.020
of our livelihoods
program, it's all about

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.630
turning that light on,
giving people the tools

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.690
so that they can
change their lives.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:44.560
So today I'm going to tell you
two stories, 30 years apart,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.170
about two of the biggest
challenges we have faced

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.630
and what we learned about
the role of technology

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.750
and social innovation
in those challenges.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:59.035
So first case story is about
fairly low tech solution

00:07:59.035 --> 00:08:00.160
with a high touch approach.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.000
Imagine you are an
illiterate mother

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.160
back in the early
80s in Bangladesh,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.470
in rural Bangladesh.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.310
You live in an
extremely remote region,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.340
the country is still
reeling economically

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.880
from the war that happened
about 10 years ago.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.040
But this isn't your
biggest concern.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.400
Your concern is about
your sick child, who

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.440
was suffering from diarrhea.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.610
And your thoughts are
consumed with her,

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.530
because you don't
know what to do.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.870
The nearest hospital
is about five miles,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.059
you don't have the money to
take your child to the hospital.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:42.059
You don't have access
to any physician nearby.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:46.230
So what do you do
in that situation?

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.960
Particularly when you
know that about one

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.030
out of five children
in your community

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.290
dies suffering from diarrhea.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.980
Dehydration that's caused
from diarrhea and cholera

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.850
was one of the primary
killers of child

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.490
under five in Bangladesh.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.750
About one out of seven children
in Bangladesh right after war

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.780
would actually won't make
it to their fifth birthday.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.590
So when that's the
scenario you're working on,

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:21.830
actually this kind of related
of why we had so many children,

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.720
each household had so
many children in there,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.060
because if you don't know
how many would survive,

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.061
you actually don't think about
family planning that much.

00:09:29.061 --> 00:09:30.560
Actually recently,
there was a quote

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.050
by Melinda Gates
the other day, who

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.480
highlighted that "if parents
believe their children

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.700
will survive and if they
have the power to time

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.640
and space their
pregnancies, that they would

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.750
choose to have fewer children."

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.870
So parents living in
poverty in rural Bangladesh

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.170
didn't have control of what
their children's lives are

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.510
or their futures.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:56.150
So it wasn't that there wasn't
a solution available, there was.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.870
Actually in the 60s, there was
a breakthrough in treatment

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.010
for diarrhea, right?

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:06.500
A concoction of
water, sugar and salt

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.490
called oral rehydration
therapy, or ORT was tested

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.590
by a group of researchers.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.310
However this
concoction, if given

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.420
to the children
at the right time,

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.190
would actually save 96.5%
of the children, as opposed

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.490
to 70% who would not make it.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.300
But there was another problem.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.560
The treatment was out of
reach for poor families

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.560
and remained mostly
in the hospitals.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.450
Because one, you had to
get the proportion right.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:43.190
The researchers did have
the idea that at some point,

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.490
they will market
it and they will

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.190
make the instruction
available for people,

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.650
but when you have
illiterate mothers

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.390
all around the country,
the instructions

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.250
actually not very useful.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.780
When you have instructions about
giving spoons and measurements

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.380
right, when most
of the households

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.140
don't have even spoons,
doesn't really work.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.372
So what do you do in
that kind of situation?

00:11:09.372 --> 00:11:11.330
Because if you don't get
the measurement right,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.340
if you have too much salt,
it may kill your baby.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.310
If you have too much
sugar, it may actually

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.690
reverse the effect
of the ORT saline.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:25.100
So that's where, I guess, the
power of delivery comes in.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.730
Around that time, BRAC
was about 10 years old.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.780
And there was a guy
called Sir Fazle Hasan

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:37.610
Abed who moved back from London,
leaving his cushy job at Shell

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.180
Oil, and decided
that he was going

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.400
to actually work
towards rebuilding

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.320
the country after the war.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.770
And pretty soon, the
relief organization

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:55.700
actually slowly expanded into
other development activities.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.700
And he was from
the private sector,

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.820
and he understood
scale very well,

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.170
and he was all about
problem solving.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.680
So when he heard about the
problem, one of the things

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.130
that he tried, he started
experimenting in his kitchen

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.100
with unrefined
sugar known as gur

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:18.740
in Bangladesh, which is fairly
well available in rural areas.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.160
So he found out that
about three finger pinch

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.810
of salt, a handful
of sugar, gur,

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:31.730
and half a liter of boiled water
actually can make the same,

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.270
have the same effect that
this World Health Organization

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:40.330
that came up with the antidote
for, the ORT solution.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:46.520
So that's how easy to
make solution arrived.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.710
But then how do you
actually teach it

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.936
to the rest of the country?

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:52.310
How do you actually
go to mothers

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.500
and tell them that this
is actually going to work,

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.870
and this is what you should do?

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.940
So that's where the
biggest challenge came in.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.310
And World Bank's president
recently said the quote

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.850
that "it's not the question
of what to deliver,

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.960
it's about it's about
how to deliver it."

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.820
In the social
development space, it's

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.020
all about not innovation
itself, but how do you actually

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.670
deliver the innovation.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:23.600
So a media advocacy
campaign wouldn't

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.480
have worked at that time
because only 20% of people

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.610
have access to radio
and television.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.900
So it would have to be
sandals on the ground.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.290
People talking to people,
people changing behaviors.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.210
So that's what
BRAC started to do.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.900
So it recruited
small groups of women

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.870
from communities to become
health promoters themselves.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:50.610
The groups traveled on
foot, went door to door,

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.320
showing mothers how to
make these solutions.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.740
Later monitors went in and
checked how many of those

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.770
mothers actually learn how
to make those solutions.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:05.540
And it was an iterative process,
there were failures plentiful.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.340
We learned as we went along.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.590
So staff tweaked their
approach as they went along.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:17.600
And one thing, sorry, one
example of our learning

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.090
has been that when
the monitors went back

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.610
after the first lot
of training happened,

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.000
we found out that about
90% of these mothers

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.230
learned how to make
those solutions.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.590
So you would think
that was a success.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.430
But only 10% of them actually
gave it to their children

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.680
when their children were sick.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.170
So people were scratching
their heads, what went wrong?

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.370
A group of anthropologists
were sent to do some research,

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.100
and they found out
was very interesting,

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.690
not rocket science.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.860
But because the fathers weren't
involved in this process

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.260
and they were the
key decision makers,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.780
so they actually
wouldn't let the mothers

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.710
give this strange concoction to
their child when they got sick.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:05.120
So that's when the
next battle started.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.040
So we started training men.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.830
We started treating the fathers.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.990
And this is just
an example, but as

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.380
other issues evolved, the
process was continuously

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.440
modified, which led to
continuous improvement

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.934
of the outcome itself.

00:15:19.934 --> 00:15:22.100
So BRAC then worked with
the Bangladeshi government,

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:27.490
of course, to kind of
scale up nationwide.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.340
It basically, eventually,
went to every single household

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.340
in Bangladesh, teaching
mothers how to make ORT.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:40.040
And that's a media
advocacy campaign

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.120
followed to sustain
the effect, eventually.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.890
And just to kind of
finish off the story,

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:53.090
there was this long article
on this in New Yorker magazine

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.380
a couple of years ago.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.230
I'm just going to
read a few quotes.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.350
"Coaxing villagers to make this
solution with their own hands

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.560
and explain the messages
in their own words

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.330
while a trainer
observed and guided

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.750
them achieved far more
than any public service

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.680
ad or instructional
video could have done.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.170
Over time, the changes could
be sustained with television

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.120
and radio and the
growth of demand

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.280
led to the development
of a robust market

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.340
for manufactured oral
rehydration salt.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.370
Three decades later
national surveys

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.840
have found that almost 90% of
children with severe diarrhea

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.610
were given the solution.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.120
Child deaths from diarrhea
plummeted more than 80%

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.060
between 1980 and 2005.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:43.530
Bangladesh now has the highest
use of ORT in the world."

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.220
So this is the
quote I love, and I

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.870
think it's relevant to a lot
of you who are in technology.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.520
I mean, "we yearn
for frictionless,

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.200
technology solutions.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.350
But people talking to
people is still the way

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.030
norms and standards change."

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.970
So there were some
early lessons in this,

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.720
just to quickly summarize.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.290
Even 30 years ago.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.730
I know data is big now,
but even 30 years ago, data

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.500
was king then at
that time as well.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.270
We constantly looked at
the numbers and evolved.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.869
Number two, social
innovation is not just

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.859
about product innovation.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:31.560
It's about a continuous process
of adjustment and tweaking

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.400
as you go along.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.050
It's about process
innovation as well.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:39.100
And number three, the
simpler your solution is,

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.070
the easier it is to scale.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.800
So it's very, very
relevant to the part

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.750
of the world we operate in.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:50.310
So fast forward
about 30 years later.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.280
So this is the second story
I'm going to talk about,

00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:01.150
which is more about when
high tech meets high touch.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:06.210
How do you get rural women,
and men of course, to trust

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.710
and understand that mobile
money will improve their lives?

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:16.350
Just to set a context,
there's a story

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.950
that our microfinance
director talks about,

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.520
that when we
introduced mobile money

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.990
for our microfinance borrowers
to pay their loans on time,

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.390
they would send the mobile
money through their phone

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.120
and then they would
walk to our offices

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.110
and come and make sure that
it actually has come through.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.400
Because in a country
where system often fails,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.310
you always want
that piece of paper,

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:49.890
to make sure that this is
your proof that you actually

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.610
have done it, you
don't actually have

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.220
a lot of trust in your system.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.910
So it was actually
quite interesting,

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:01.350
because to have them trust an
SMS message of confirmation

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.570
was actually quite
a large shift.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:11.030
So the idea for
mobile money came in

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.230
from a different context.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:18.470
I mean, I think when, 30
years later, Bangladesh

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.850
has become a lot more urbanized,
it's not as rural anymore.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.970
Also people have become
a lot more mobile.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.940
They're traveling,
they're seasonal migrants

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.697
who are coming back and forth
from villages to cities,

00:19:32.697 --> 00:19:34.280
they're working in
the cities and they

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.500
want to send money
to their families.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:43.490
So there was a big need of safe,
reliable and affordable means

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.140
of sending money back home.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.440
Of course, people found very
creative way of sending money.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.960
They send it through the
overnight bus service,

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.410
they would send the money
through post-office,

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.470
through selling airtime,
or physically carrying cash

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.550
home every few months.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.200
But there was a big need or
something which actually did it

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.910
quickly and reliably.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.780
So that's where the solution
came in, which is the Bkash,

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.600
the mobile financial service.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.660
It inspired by the
success in East Africa,

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.780
with M-Pesa and some
of the other companies

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.760
that worked really
well in Africa.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.840
BRAC bank started Bkash
in 2011, with a mission

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.680
towards including
the very bottom

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.390
of the people, financially.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.810
Which means that actually,
not only just remittance

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:36.260
but the big vision is that
introducing financial products

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.120
and services that
works for the poor.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.320
So it was a great
fit for Bangladesh,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.170
because in Bangladesh
we have 90%

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:49.400
of the household has
mobile phone, but only 30%

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.870
has bank accounts.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:54.305
So if you can give
people with the phone,

00:20:54.305 --> 00:20:58.520
a bank account
should work wonders.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.300
But the problem was, just to--

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.560
so before I get into
the problem a bit,

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.720
just to give you an
understanding of how

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.880
the solution worked, it's not
just a mobile to mobile money.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.500
There's a role of
an agent network

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.530
within the organization.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.510
The idea is that a
rickshaw puller, say,

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.480
who works in the city wants
to send money to his family,

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.260
would actually go to an
agent, who would actually

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:28.300
take the physical cash,
put it in his bank account,

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:33.350
mobile money account, and then
they have the money transferred

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:38.270
either directly to the
family or to an agent

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.690
who's lives nearby to
the other family member

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.250
and then the family
could use it.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.190
I mean if the money
was transferred

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.430
to the bank account
of the sender,

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.960
they could also use it for
other purposes as well,

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.650
like buying things directly.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.280
But we don't have
ecosystem yet quite ready,

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.770
so money's mostly being used
for remittance purposes.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.950
So this is how it worked.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:10.280
But the problem was that it
also went on to the delivery.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.910
Nobody knew Bkash, right, why
would people's trust Bkash?

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.750
But everybody knew
BRAC at that time.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:21.680
And BRAC's, this is
just our operations

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.100
in terms of where we are, in
terms of in the country itself.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.730
So we have a network
all across the country.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:34.490
So what we started to build
up was this agent network.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:39.560
And we worked with all
these borrowers that we have

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.720
who actually own stores.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.530
So there are these small
shop owners who we went to

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.480
and say that, you
know the community,

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.470
the community knows you, are
you interested to be an agent?

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:55.580
And initially, there was
not a lot of understanding,

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.847
but people came along listening
to us, because we said,

00:22:59.847 --> 00:23:01.430
this is going to
work for you and this

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.971
is going to work for everybody
else in the community as well.

00:23:03.971 --> 00:23:07.820
So 10,000 agents
signed up initially.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.720
And once we did it, and that's
where the early adopters came

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.050
in, and then we started
working with growing

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.210
the user base going forward.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.860
And the rest is
pretty much history,

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.480
because Bkash has seen
very, very rapid expansion

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.010
over the last five years.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.170
Just to show you
some numbers, this

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.050
is a slightly dated
number, but we now have,

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.630
it is now the largest
mobile financial service

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:36.500
in terms of how many
people have direct accounts

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.770
in the world right now.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:46.220
We have about, in Bangladesh,
we have about 41 million people

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.750
with accounts, and about 80% of
them are Bkash account holders.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.900
You can see some of the
numbers, the rapid growth.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:58.010
We have almost close
to about $50 million

00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.300
being transacted daily.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.690
Now the agent network
boasts about 600,000

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.830
around the country.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:12.590
It all just happened
in just four years.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.470
But we didn't want to
rest in this laurel,

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.280
however, because as I said,
that the primary mission was

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.580
to actually empower
the poor financially.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.440
So we looked at
the numbers again,

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.000
and we saw that there were
far less women who signed up

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.280
than men for Bkash accounts.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.550
And at the same time, people
were still accessing it

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:38.210
primarily as through the agent
network not directly accessing

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.050
themselves.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.930
And if you don't access
it directly yourself,

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.170
then financial products and
services built up for you,

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.720
you're not going to actually
see a lot of benefit for it.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.520
So I'm going to
see a small video

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.770
in terms of how we took
that as a next step,

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.909
in terms of increasing
the literacy for women.

00:24:54.909 --> 00:24:56.450
And this will probably
give you a bit

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:02.810
of a glimpse of what we mean
by this high touch involvement.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.830
Let's look at a two
minute video very quickly.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.782
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:06.782 --> 00:25:10.198
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:23.143 --> 00:25:26.390
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:27:47.096 --> 00:27:50.512
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:59.784 --> 00:28:00.760
[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.290
ASIF SALEH: So the
work is still ongoing.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.140
I think the user experience
needs to be a lot better,

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.120
so we're working on that.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.590
But I think there are
some key learnings, right,

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.460
in both these two stories.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:23.250
So I think person to
person interaction

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:26.010
does shift social
norms and builds trust.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:32.040
And for a lot of
technology adoption,

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.040
it's not just about
technology itself.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.680
It's about changing mindsets.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.620
So it's very important
to have that person

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.690
to person interaction.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.390
And then secondly, which is
very relevant to the first one,

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.690
that it's not just not
the product itself,

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.900
and it's not how we
deliver technology,

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.870
it's actually as
important, if not more

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.120
than the technology itself.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:05.640
And the last one is that when
high tech meets high touch,

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.640
the early days of
tech adoption actually

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.650
really happens at that time.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:16.560
And I think that's also
where the magic happens.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.710
And I want to sort
of end on that note

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:28.050
that, sitting in 2017
right now, there are so

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:33.000
many immense sort of progress
that has happened in technology

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.910
and about to come in
the next few years.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.750
We are looking at some
amazing disruption

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.000
can happen in this market.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.040
You can think about, imagine
if these 100,000 health

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.590
promoters who are
across the country

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:54.870
having access to this diagnostic
tool who can go house to house,

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.000
collect data, send
data to the cloud,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.370
have AI engine looking at it,
give some diagnostic ideas,

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:06.510
and link them to specialists
all around the world.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.250
Amazing things can happen.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:12.180
I'm thinking very
focused, customized,

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.380
specific, financial
products being delivered

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.860
to various groups all
around the country,

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.640
because you have
access to the data.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.120
Bkash is sitting on a
huge data gold mine,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.332
understanding when people
send money, what people will

00:30:28.332 --> 00:30:29.790
do with the money,
you can actually

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:34.920
come up with very, very useful
products in the coming days.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.272
You can look at the
jobs market in form

00:30:38.272 --> 00:30:42.300
of both, how you can make
matches so that you can

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.780
increase the wages for the
people who don't have access

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.910
to those key information.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:51.180
So amazing things can
happen in the coming days.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:55.350
I just want to sort of
think that if Google,

00:30:55.350 --> 00:31:00.100
with all its resources, smarter
engineers, that you guys are

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:04.400
all out here, you can
partner with some of the more

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.190
sophisticated distribution
network that we have at BRAC,

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:09.930
real magic can happen
in the coming days

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:11.730
and real disruption can happen.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:16.440
And personally speaking
over the last few years.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.380
As I have learned to
have bigger dreams,

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.560
I actually have learned to
appreciate slow innovation

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.430
a lot more than I used to.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.640
This is a picture
of a train station,

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.370
particularly during
a festival time.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.370
I love to show this picture
in our presentation.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:36.690
I mean, it's
chaotic region, it's

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.500
a chaotic country, enormously
resource constrained.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.370
But at the same time,
enormous social capital,

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.796
enormous resilience that is
built into the social fabric

00:31:47.796 --> 00:31:48.420
of the country.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:52.020
So we do come up with this
interesting social innovation.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.770
So I actually have a lot
more appreciation for this

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.700
than I used to have in the past.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.790
So I will conclude at
that and then would

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.800
love to hear you
guys in the coming--

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.610
thank you so much.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.820
SPEAKER 1: So the
first question is,

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.090
how can Global Tech companies
based in Silicon Valley

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.100
work with BRAC
across these existing

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.900
programs in micro-finance,
healthcare, education, et

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:21.400
cetera?

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:28.354
Is it possible to collaborate
on opportunities, ideas?

00:32:28.354 --> 00:32:29.770
ASIF SALEH: Yeah
I think there are

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:36.340
more opportunities than
ever now, because not only--

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.100
so BRAC actually
works in Bangladesh

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.070
and 11 other countries in
Asia and Africa as well.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:47.260
We almost use Bangladesh as
a hub for experimentation.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:51.236
So the idea is that we
have these large sort

00:32:51.236 --> 00:32:53.110
of distribution channels
as I was mentioning,

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:57.730
both in the financial sector,
education, and other sector,

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:01.960
which lets us scale
up relatively easily.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.230
But what we lack is
we don't have so much

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.600
technical prowess over there.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.240
And I think with the
infrastructure getting

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:14.890
ready in the country
and also the region,

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:18.541
it's not so much about all
the access is an issue,

00:33:18.541 --> 00:33:20.290
I think there's still
an issue but they're

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:22.570
are going to be resolved
very quickly in the next two

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.380
or three years.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.400
But what we lack is this
matchmaking to happen.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.600
I think basically we need
smarter products and services

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:37.000
that are designed, built for,
thinking about those people

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.830
in the next billion market.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.620
And then we need a very
smart distribution channel

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.930
and this high touch
approach that we mentioned.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.990
So we have a social
innovation lab

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.510
at BRAC, which looks at
some of these issues.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:53.170
This innovation fund, thing
that you saw-- innovation

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.630
mobile money thing that
you saw on the video,

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.910
it's being supported
by Gates Foundation,

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.640
but this is something that
is run by the Innovation Lab

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.570
So we are looking constantly
at external opportunities

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.310
where we can make these matches.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:10.870
So I think particularly
in the next three

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.480
or four years, I see a lot of
these kinds of partnerships

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.960
being built. Because in
every sector, whether you

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.429
call it health, education,
financial sector, agriculture,

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:24.550
technologies is
becoming the disruptor.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:29.020
And the foster we adopt
and have those high touch

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.770
approaches, I think there
are tremendous gains

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:35.320
to be made in the coming days.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.989
SPEAKER 1: So is BRAC doing
any programs for startups

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:40.389
in developing countries?

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:42.280
ASIF SALEH: Yes.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.870
What we have started
in Bangladesh,

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:52.840
we have had a number of things
both internally and externally,

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:58.040
from the lab, we run a number of
innovation funds, very focused.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.700
So one thing we started,
Mobile Money Innovation Fund,

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.640
where we asked our
large workforce,

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.590
there was internal
competition, we

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:08.440
said, give us your idea
on how mobile money can

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.540
improve service delivery
for the poor people.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.990
That attracted a
lot of intrapreneurs

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:20.020
to give their ideas,
and some of these ideas

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.850
were piloted and expanded.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.160
Then we launched
another innovation fund

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.200
for urban challenges.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.230
Urbanization, as you know, is
the biggest challenge, and now

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.530
unplanned urbanization
in that part.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:36.520
So we asked for external
companies and innovators

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.350
to give their ideas.

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:42.160
So what we are doing now
is we are incubating them

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.050
for about a year.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:45.820
So we are working
with them in terms

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.390
of grounding their
ideas with our network,

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.150
and then if some of
these actually stick,

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.070
then we are going
to help them launch

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.860
to become a full fledged
company and help them

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.970
with initial financing.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:01.990
We are also expanding and
doing a lot of investments

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:03.730
in terms of some of
the new startups.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:08.080
We just recently made an equity
investment in a tech startup

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.440
called Maya, who's founder
is here, Ivy Russell.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.240
Maya is doing
great work in terms

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.840
of creating a
community for women

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.450
and providing them
basic services.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.990
So they have some
fantastic ideas

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:27.060
on expansion going
forward as well.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.150
So the idea is not that BRAC
will have to do everything.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.620
The idea is that as long as
it is true to the mission,

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.470
we will have a network
of organizations

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:38.660
who will do the same
work that we want to do.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:42.990
And sometimes actually,
they can do it better.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:45.912
They're very focused
and they actually

00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:47.120
can do the work a lot better.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.160
So in the coming days, you'll
see a lot more expansion

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.771
like this where we are going
to be investing in companies.

00:36:53.771 --> 00:36:55.270
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned that BRAC

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:56.561
has moved into other countries.

00:36:56.561 --> 00:36:58.510
So I'm curious what
changes and what

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.990
stays the same when you take
programs to other countries?

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.060
ASIF SALEH: Very good question.

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:05.800
Actually a lot changes.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:11.090
We don't necessarily
take everything as is.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:14.090
And sometimes also, not
necessarily everything

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.770
happens in Bangladesh
first, sometimes

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:18.420
we also see the reverse
innovation as well.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.930
But I think what
we see in common

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:26.390
is that across the new
countries we operate,

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:29.810
these are mostly fragile
economies, or either

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:32.600
post conflict countries.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.060
So we start, typically,
with micro microfinance,

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.410
financial inclusion.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:38.780
And then as it starts
to build the network,

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.470
then we go into other programs.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.170
In some areas that we
see that a common element

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:49.350
is the role of the community,
the social capital.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.970
We have certain things very
common across the board.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:56.360
We tried to build them as
part of the program design.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.490
We have the notion of
the social network,

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:00.560
we formed these clubs
with young people

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.200
in Uganda which
works really well

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.200
which, again, the genesis came
from a program in Bangladesh,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.960
but then it morphed
into something else.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.720
In Bangladesh we didn't have
financial microfinance built

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.630
into the young people's clubs.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:18.500
Here in Uganda, when we saw that
this was actually a big need,

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.480
because a lot of these--

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.220
early pregnancy
was a big problem,

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.010
and a lot of these
single mother they

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:28.411
want to get into jobs and
livelihood generations.

00:38:28.411 --> 00:38:30.410
So we introduced the idea
of financial inclusion

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:31.970
fairly early in these clubs.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:37.110
So that's how we actually
tweak the model over time.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:41.920
And we are now looking at taking
some of our skills learning,

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.650
we have gone into the skills
program quite big in Bangladesh

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:49.430
and we want to take some of
those in other parts of Africa

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:51.050
as well.

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:53.000
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
the wonderful talk.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.940
You talked about, when
you talked about Bkash,

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.520
you mentioned
about trust factor.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.690
One of the area your
Bkash could be very useful

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:04.580
of the remittance
is the e-commerce.

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:08.150
And e-commerce has a huge amount
of trust factor deficiency.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:11.600
What do you learn in
the remittance sections

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.640
of the Bkash transaction
that could be useful

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.540
for e-commerce as well in
Bangladesh or outside as well?

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.050
ASIF SALEH: So I think
e-commerce in Bangladesh

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:24.680
is starting to take off, but
there are still lots of issues,

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:29.630
because the ecosystem
is not quite built yet.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:33.530
You still have problems with
the delivery of packages

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:37.880
and so the distribution
channel is not quite there.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.320
But I think we are
seeing, if you look at,

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.060
although the numbers are fairly
small in the early stage,

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:49.070
if you look at the numbers,
they look very, very promising.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:55.300
But interestingly, we
have a large retail chain

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:59.600
called Aarong, those of you
from Bangladesh know Aarong.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.450
It actually started aarong.com
about three years ago.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:05.150
And from some of
the numbers there,

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:09.440
we see not different
from India, people still

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:15.090
are not very comfortable in
doing electronic purchasing.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.525
They are still doing
cash on delivery.

00:40:17.525 --> 00:40:21.740
The cash on delivery is not
good for e-commerce sector,

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.990
but people are still more
comfortable in doing that.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:29.270
And so in aarong.com's number,
about 70% of the purchases

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.760
still happen through COD's.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.950
And Bkash numbers are
relatively smaller,

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:40.640
but I think that's also due to
the fact of user experience.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.010
I think Bkash is
launching a new app

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:45.320
in this year, which is
going to make the user

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.650
experience a lot better.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:53.900
But once that happens,
the Bkash should take off

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.660
more quickly than credit card,
because credit card is more

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:01.340
difficult. I think nobody
is hand-holding anybody

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.010
in e-commerce, I think
that's the big factor.

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:06.680
But this notion of
associated e-commerce

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.161
has started in India, which
basically uses intermediary,

00:41:11.161 --> 00:41:11.660
right?

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:15.680
So you have these centers
where people can go to

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.770
and they have access to internet
and laptops and all that,

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:20.960
and they help you browse.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.650
This is what you have available,
and then they let you buy it,

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:27.380
and the packages actually
come to that center.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.860
And so they take a small cut
and then they make the fee.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.100
So that's becoming also, that
has also started to happen.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.460
So I think same kind
of hand-holding,

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.200
so somebody to take them through
that experience initially,

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.740
that needs to happen.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.904
So I think that that's
interesting learning,

00:41:42.904 --> 00:41:44.320
because right now
we are just kind

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.180
of assuming that its just
going to happen automatically,

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.180
and it's not.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.466
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:49.466 --> 00:41:50.840
SPEAKER 1: Last
question, I guess

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.640
it's coming from
the Dory, is BRAC

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.390
considering expanding to India?

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:59.060
ASIF SALEH: This request
has come in quite a lot,

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:05.300
but in the past we have
worked with partners in India.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:10.590
India is a bit more complicated
in terms of regulations.

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:13.860
So what we want to do
is work with partners.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.320
I think we have got
specific invitations

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.780
to work in the education
sector, microfinance sector.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.150
So we worked with a
company called Bandhan

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:25.440
in the past, which was
started by a former BRAC staff

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.430
and now has become the largest
microfinance Institute in India

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:32.580
and has become the
big national bank.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.816
So yeah, we would love to work
in India as long as we can find

00:42:36.816 --> 00:42:38.190
the right partner,
but we are not

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:41.670
going to directly start
an operation there.

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:44.040
Thank you so much
for your time, and--

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:47.390
[APPLAUSE]
