00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.970
&gt;&gt;Richard: Welcome to this week's Android
Developer Office Hours.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.130
I'm in London with Nick Butcher--

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.130
&gt;&gt;Nick: Hello.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.310
&gt;&gt;Richard: and Matthew Gaunt, here--

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.310
&gt;&gt;Matthew: Hi.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.000
&gt;&gt;Richard: to answer your Android Developer
technical questions around Android and talk

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.670
about the Android operating system in general.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.740
Things that we won't be talking about include
product roadmaps, huge releases, and stuff

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.509
that we're not supposed to talk about.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.429
We've really got quite a full Hangout today.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.480
It has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.450
I think we're absolutely full in fact.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.350
&gt;&gt;Todd: Ten is the maximum, right?

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.350
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, we're in.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.809
We have all ten people in, so sorry if you
didn't get in straight away.

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.750
Maybe these people asked their questions and
we answered them, but they can drop out and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.250
some other people can be able to get to ask
them later.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.789
Still hoping we can get Sparky in from our
Munich office.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.489
'Cause he's generally--.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.579
Ron is with us as well today.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:53.579
Hey, Ron.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.579
Nice to see you.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.460
Well, not see you, as the case may be.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.059
'Cause Sparky has the answers to the questions,
generally, so it's quite good if he comes

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.890
in.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.500
Let me just repost this onto the Android Developers
plus page.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.750
It's still a little bit--.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.750
All right.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.340
Let me add the moderator to the Android Developers
plus page, so that people know where they

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.410
found their links.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.790
Today's moderator.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.600
[thumping noises] If anyone has any questions
during the Hangout, whilst we're just sorting

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.010
this out at the very beginning, please feel
free to start asking.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.560
&gt;&gt;Todd: Well, I've got one.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.060
You know if Jellybean [unintelligible] languages
to the Android operating system to the Galaxy

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.250
Nexus [loud knocking] anyhow and how those
languages now belong to the base languages

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.680
that come to every device.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.430
So, is it dependent on the feeling of the
OEM?

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.430
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.260
Same answer is that we've always given you,
Todd, when you've asked that question, four

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.990
or five times before.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.990
[chuckles]

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.250
&gt;&gt;Todd: No, I don't know if the--.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.250
I know.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.250
With Jellybean maybe it's changed.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.250
I don't know.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.250
&gt;&gt;Nick: It's the same as always.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.780
Like, we put out a set image, but it's up
to the carriers and OEMs to choose what they

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.740
think their image, so what languages finally
make it through is up to whoever owns the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.740
build.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.790
&gt;&gt;Todd: Well, you did a really good job with
[unintelligible] anyhow.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.530
I've been running with it with quite a while.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.190
It's nice job.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.750
&gt;&gt;Richard: Excellent.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.099
&gt;&gt;Todd: Only, yeah.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.450
It's pretty nice.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.010
&gt;&gt;Richard: Fantastic.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.010
OK.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.050
Well, Manashu's been dying to get this question
in before the broadcast started.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.400
So let's have a quick look at Manashu's question.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.379
I have a problem.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:48.080
I unzipped a zipped file on the SD card and
after unzipping, dot csv, and import csv in

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.080
SQLite.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.099
I had that a lot.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.909
For your information, I want to tell you I
don't know how this feels.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.090
Will you help me please?

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.250
Is that a question?

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.610
&gt;&gt;Al: I think he's asking how to import csv
into SQLite.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.940
&gt;&gt;Richard: After it being a csv, import csv
in SQLite.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.959
We used to have a canned answer for how to
pre-prepare SSWLite databases.

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.540
There's a really good answer on Stack Oveflow
that I will pull out and add into the links.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.560
There a couple ways of doing it.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.580
You can either pre-prepare the database as
a SQLite 3 database file using AV Shell and

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.159
things like this.

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:37.540
Or, you can import as a bulk import afterwards,
into a new SQLite database or a device.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.110
The last one's gonna take a little bit of
time and you'll have some duplicated data.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.190
Let me just pull off the Stack Overflow link
and add it into the comments.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.330
[keyboard clicks]

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:55.349
&gt;&gt;Nick: Essentially, what we end up doing
is ending up reading the file, right?

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:02.350
And creating content values and inserting
them into your database yourself.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.350
[pause]

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.430
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yes, you do.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:14.810
I'm not certain I feel good about, but I'm
sure I'll find this pretty quickfully.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.459
We're looking up there not because our screen,
tis a thousand inches.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.130
. And actually, I can just stretch the full
there because all the questions appear on-screen

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.810
is up in the sky somewhere.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.270
And that's where my light is attached to the
wall.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.260
That's where our web browser lives as well
as you'd expect.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:40.410
&gt;&gt;Nick: Our system issues, other question
where Sparky, Sparky is trying to join at

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.410
the moment.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.370
He's just having a few technical issues and
hopefully, he'll jump in to the Hangout soon.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.370
There's still hope.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.400
There's also another question, which I also
want the answer to.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.430
What will happen to Todd's hair?

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.350
&gt;&gt;Richard: What happened to To--?

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.140
Ah, yes.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.920
&gt;&gt;Todd: Well, the answer to that is the army.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.640
That's what happened.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.020
&gt;&gt;Nick: The army.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.020
That's what I thought.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.020
&gt;&gt;Richard: I thought so much, yeah.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.020
[pause]

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.020
&gt;&gt;Matthew: Hey, hang on a sec.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.020
There's a question about a monkeyrunner.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.070
&gt;&gt;Richard: Oh, he has a question about--.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.070
Whoa.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.700
Ari says he's trying to create an automated
two-way process for his Android device as

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.700
a monkeyrunner.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.960
Having searching a lot over the web, it seems
to me that [unintelligible].

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.250
Sorry people watching on the live stream.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.010
This is quite a long question.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.150
I've been able to run successfully the monkeyrunner
through the command and loading a Python.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.220
Now he's pacing more and more as we go.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.680
I find it a big hassle to connect to the device
every time I want to run a command.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.700
Is there any way I can do this without connecting
to the device every time?

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.900
[feedback on audio]
We do have quite a bit of testing done inside

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.600
the new developer Android dot com site.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.280
It has updated the scripts you need for monkeyrunner.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.660
So, if you haven't checked it in the last
three or four weeks, it might be useful for

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.660
you.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.920
I don't have a specific answer to how to keep
the device connected so that you don't have

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.390
to keep reconnecting to run the monkeyrunner.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.070
It sounds strange that it's disconnecting.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.070
[pause]

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.070
Copy links.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.640
&gt;&gt;Nick: Anyone else have any experience with
monkeyrunner.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640
Can't offer anything here.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.390
&gt;&gt;Richard: That might be handy.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:35.250
&gt;&gt;Al: I've only ever seen disconnects when
it's running out of memory on the actual device

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.690
itself, when the firmware starts to fail.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:43.400
I've not seen it with a generally well-written
application behaving as it should without

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.400
any issues.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.090
So, it might be worth looking over the application
just in case there are some memory leaks or

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.030
things like that, which could be eating up
the RAM on the device.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.980
&gt;&gt;Richard: Good answer.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.630
[unintelligible].

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.930
All right.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.580
So.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.880
That was--.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.530
Deleted.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.520
So, we're still waiting for Sparky to join.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.520
Do we have an update?

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.760
&gt;&gt;Charles: Not at the moment.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.500
&gt;&gt;Richard: Go on, Charles.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.500
[unintelligible]

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.240
&gt;&gt;Charles: Yeah, sure.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.580
It's to do with the navigation, navigating
within the stack.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.720
So, the problem we have is we're creating
a widget.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.770
The user touches a part of the widget, which
takes the user into the app, a deep link within

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:38.770
the app.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.300
So our question is with regard to what happens
when you hit the back button, at that point

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.180
once you've navigated into the app.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.630
So, it's probably helpful to give an example.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.450
So, the YouTube app, when you have the YouTube
widget.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.890
You hit a video.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.410
It takes you to the video, obviously, within
the YouTube app.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:04.030
Interestingly, when you hit back, it takes
you back to the launch activity.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.870
But if you have the Gmail widget, for example,
you hit an email.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.060
It takes you into the email within Gmail.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:15.300
But if you hit the back key, it takes you
to the inbox list.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:21.540
So, the question, I guess, is what is the
recommended behavior?

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.120
&gt;&gt;Nick: What Gmail's doing.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.600
&gt;&gt;Charles: What Gmail's doing?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:30.630
&gt;&gt;Nick: The general post, the way I remember
it at least is 'cause you can resume all the

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:35.779
activity and so on, is you don't wanna think
about exactly where you can focus, where a

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:38.390
user can resume that, the Gmail active tier
at any time.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:43.860
And so, if they hit the back button, it will
take them back to the home screen.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.110
That would be like an unexpected behavior.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:51.910
So the key is that if there's a usual place
that you get to that screen from, that widget

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.810
should take you there.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:59.570
&gt;&gt;Charles: So the TaskStackBuilder, whatever
it's called, doesn't work pre-three point

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.570
null.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:05.620
It just, as far as I'm aware, it doesn't actually
support three point null.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.200
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, there's a version in support
library.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.710
That's one point six.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:10.710
&gt;&gt;Charles: OK.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.710
So that will work.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.060
It will have the same behavior as back to
one point six?

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.510
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.960
&gt;&gt;Charles: OK.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.960
I'll take a look at that.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.960
Thanks.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.960
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, there's two things.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.020
You can take a look at that.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.240
The other thing that helps you in the navigation
is in four point one, in Jellybean.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.010
There's a new attribute on activity where
you can find a parents.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.310
And so, the support library will help you
out there as well.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.360
You obviously can't backwards compatibility
change activity.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:42.300
But you can add a metadata tag, which defines
the parent.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.190
So, add a whatever the metadata tag is to
the activity.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.190
Same with parent.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.190
Whatever it is.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.640
If you take a look at the Google I/O app,
from this year, that's a great example of

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.740
how to do this.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.790
&gt;&gt;Charles: OK.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:56.790
Thanks.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.890
&gt;&gt;Nick: You're welcome.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.990
&gt;&gt;Matthew: [unintelligible] multiple parents.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:05.240
You'll have a tier parent and have another
parent fit.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.960
&gt;&gt;Nick: As long as you specify each parent.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.960
&gt;&gt;Matthew: Yeah.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.960
&gt;&gt;Nick: Doesn't change.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.280
It just helps the app do the right thing.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:18.940
&gt;&gt;Richard: Any more live questions from people
in the Hangout?

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.280
OK.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:28.220
I'll just take the first one off the top of
the moderator.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:34.270
Is there implementation of the content provider
that returns a cursor in plain, old Java objects?

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:38.160
Actually, a cursor implementation that contains
objects?

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.120
There's not one that I know about.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.120
[pause]

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.520
&gt;&gt;Todd: Did they just die or something?

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.070
Did London fall off?

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.570
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah, London have just fallen off.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.390
They're back again.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.800
&gt;&gt;Richard: Someone kicked the cable or something.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.460
&gt;&gt;Charles: We lost you just after you said
there wasn't a content provider implementation

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.540
you knew about.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.510
&gt;&gt;Richard: You might want to check the Open
Source in the third party round.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.130
Does anyone on the Hangout know of one?

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:17.440
I guess, I hope, they'll request the question,
search the internet boards first.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:24.170
But at the same time, it's not particularly
hard to go from SQLite to POJO in the substantiation

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.170
afterwards.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.720
Take the data in.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.980
Build it back up again.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.671
&gt;&gt;Charles: There are a few object relational
mapping tools as well that can take a lot

00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:38.410
of that heavy work and do it for you.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.230
If he has a look around, they'll be some around
that--.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.250
[static]

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:49.210
&gt;&gt;Richard: We brought Sparky with us this
time.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.210
Hey Sparky.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.280
Good to see you.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.280
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Hey.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.360
It's good to be here.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.330
&gt;&gt;Richard: You sat at your desk in the Munich
office right now.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.880
&gt;&gt;Sparky: That is my desk in the Munich office.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.400
&gt;&gt;Richard: You and your big [indistinct]

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:08.029
&gt;&gt;Sparky: As you know, as you know, the new
version of Mac O/S Mountain Lion shipped today.

00:12:08.029 --> 00:12:14.400
And myMacbook, being two full versions of
the O/S behind, is beset with such feelings

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.640
of inadequacy and anxiety that it refuses
to connect on any wireless network in the

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.640
office.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.660
So, I had to go to a place where I have a
wired network.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.330
&gt;&gt;Richard: How come you're not using Chromebook,
Sparky?

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.080
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I keep that one at home.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.080
&gt;&gt;Richard: Interesting.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.020
You have the choice.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.400
&gt;&gt;Todd: I think London died again.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.180
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah, we think Sparky being here is
making the London drop out every few minutes

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.440
or so.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:46.660
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Well, I think our network went the
same place that Todd's hair went.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.660
&gt;&gt;Todd: Yeah.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.090
&gt;&gt;Charles: It's for the army.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.090
[laughter]

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.279
&gt;&gt;Richard: Very well.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:55.900
So we've just tackled the first question off
the top of the moderator.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.350
&gt;&gt;Nick: I know it's one of those things that
[unintelligible] as well is to have a bind

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:04.690
method on your project, which accepts cursor
so you can use that.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:05.690
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Cursor?

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:06.750
What's this about cursor?

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.130
You must be looking at moderator questions
I haven't seen yet.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.840
&gt;&gt;Richard: No, it's just a new one that's
added in.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.260
&gt;&gt;Nick: That's OK.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.150
&gt;&gt;Richard: We're on it.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.570
&gt;&gt;Sparky: All right.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:22.390
&gt;&gt;Richard: Rich Johnson, welcome and [unintelligible].

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.390
Don't know why we're still on the air twice.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:29.890
So as it is, you wanna take the next moderator
question, Sparky?

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.950
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Sure.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.220
[pause] You just did, did you do this?

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.090
&gt;&gt;Richard: We did the cursor or POJO objects.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.160
&gt;&gt;Al: Is there any implementation of a content
provider that returns cursor or POJO objects?

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.890
That was just done.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.740
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I'm way behind you guys.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.740
Oh, there we go.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.230
Now I see it.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.160
Ah, that's a good one.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.029
You got a ton of new questions since last
time I connected.

00:13:54.029 --> 00:13:55.029
&gt;&gt;Richard: Crazy.

00:13:55.029 --> 00:13:56.029
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible].

00:13:56.029 --> 00:14:02.000
&gt;&gt;Sparky: That one's not even at the top of
my list.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.029
Have you looked at the C2DM question?

00:14:04.029 --> 00:14:05.450
&gt;&gt;Al: Not yet.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.780
&gt;&gt;Richard: I just did.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.780
&gt;&gt;Sparky: All right.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:13.210
Matt from Warwick wants to know, with C2DM
being deprecated, are there any changes anticipated

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.470
for how cloud messaging, GCM, is implemented
in the future now that Google cloud messaging

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.850
is the primary method?

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.800
Or can we rely on GCM for the foreseeable
future?

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.720
Well, my crystal ball is a little bit overcast
today.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:33.800
But I would guess that, at the very least,
GCM will be no less stable than cloud to device

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.610
messaging was, which is that they ran it for
a couple of years and then gave it a nice

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:43.660
graceful exit strategy with giving people
lots of time to change over to the new method.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.029
And at the very least, I think you can expect
at least that level of support for Google

00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:49.800
cloud messaging as well.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.310
&gt;&gt;Charles: It seems at the moment that the
Google cloud messaging is quite active because

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.750
every week or two, I'm seeing public announcements
about new features being added and tweaks

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.750
being made.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.460
So, it seems pretty active from what I've
seen.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:10.710
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Well, cloud to device messaging,
C2DM, basically went into feature freeze several

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:11.710
months ago.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.839
And all the new development has been taking
place in GCM.

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:21.320
&gt;&gt;Nick: And it still has significant advantages
over C2DM as well, right?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.250
Like the fan-out and so on.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.380
[feedback and beeping noises]
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.300
And not least of which is that you don't have
to request Cordis anymore.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.110
Not only do you not have to request Cordis,
but you don't have to sign up for an account,

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.110
either.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.839
You just, you publish your app and--.

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:41.930
[pause]
[static]

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:55.050
Whole, this whole off-login client, or client
login two-step to get your server side messaging.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:16:01.149
[beeping] We just give you an API key that
you can use.

00:16:01.149 --> 00:16:05.420
So there's this whole login process your server
has to do is no longer the case.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.200
&gt;&gt;Richard: Just out of interest, Sparky, do
you know why we allow space for three sender

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.940
IDs per application?

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.770
&gt;&gt;Sparky: No.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:18.390
&gt;&gt;Nick: The reason I heard is if you have
three different topics, streams, something

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.390
like that, you might be able to do it that
way.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.390
&gt;&gt;Matthew: Conserve and send the messages.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.750
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.880
&gt;&gt;Richard: Fair enough.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.010
I did wonder.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.600
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I'm not buying that.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.630
I think one is enough.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:30.630
[laughter]

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.660
&gt;&gt;Richard: One for all your apps.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.660
&gt;&gt;Nick: But yeah.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.840
As Sparky says, our method is being actually
developed.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.380
So, if you are working on it and have feedback,
then make sure you send it through.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:44.490
I mean, you can screen that by us or, what's
that guy's name?

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.370
Francesco Nerieri, is it?

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.370
The en--.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.370
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.370
Francesco.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.600
&gt;&gt;Nick: Francesco, that's it.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.340
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, he's cool.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.810
And he's quite active in the Android C2DM
forum.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.680
&gt;&gt;Charles: Wasn't he also on the state-side
Office Hours last week?

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.070
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yes, he was.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:07.150
&gt;&gt;Charles: So it might be worth if someone's
looking, looking into cloud messaging, having

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.840
a look at the state-side Office Hours from
last week and seeing what he said in that.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.980
&gt;&gt;Richard: Fair enough.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.140
&gt;&gt;Al: I don't know why we keep dropping out.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.490
Someone's put a time bomb inside our machine
of some sort.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.080
&gt;&gt;Charles: Everybody's trying to download
Mountain Lion.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.120
&gt;&gt;Richard: No.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.170
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible].

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.690
&gt;&gt;Sparky: It's network bandwidth reservation
of the Olympic Committee.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.350
&gt;&gt;Al: They can get in our internet pipe as
well now.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.240
They're laying on the cord.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.800
&gt;&gt;Charles: You can't say any more words about
the Olympic Committee and you'll be in trouble

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.800
with the branding police, Sparky.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.590
&gt;&gt;Al: The tubes are stuffed.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:52.980
&gt;&gt;Richard: Samuel, in the G+ post, [static]
is asking is there G+, Facebook smiling drop-down

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.610
menu tool?

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.210
One that I've seen so far is [unintelligible].

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:00.890
That he--.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.190
&gt;&gt;Nick: No, he has [unintelligible].

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:10.040
He has, through his advanced course, talked
me through some of the techniques he used

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.960
that are a bunch of Open Source implementations.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.310
I think there's one called River Menu, which
looks pretty nice.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.480
&gt;&gt;Sparky: There's a couple of major threads
on Stack Overflow.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.480
You can just search right there.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.480
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.480
I'll see if I can find it.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.480
[pause]

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.480
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yes.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.860
At the moment you're done already.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.480
I'm crossing it out.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.470
Or using someone else's.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.470
[pause]

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:43.070
&gt;&gt;Matthew: I'm sure he'll make his way into
there at some point or another.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.740
&gt;&gt;Richard: I'll refresh this page.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.930
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Not seeing it just yet.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.360
Should I take another question from moderator?

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.250
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, sure.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:19:01.730
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Will there be an API or STK to provide
custom cards for Google Now?

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.730
I don't know.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.860
&gt;&gt;Richard: Ah, we read a the disclaimer for
the start of here that we won't be talking

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.110
about product roadmaps, future releases, stuff
that we can't allow.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.660
So, will there be a question that causes that?

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:12.660
Move on.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.550
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Then that makes me really eager
to take the next one from the moderator, which

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.490
is "Google Maps and speech recognition got
offline on functionality lately.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.870
Is there any way to leverage these within
our own apps?"

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:23.870
I don't know.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:24.870
Not that I've heard.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.550
&gt;&gt;Richard: He's talking about functionality,
right?

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.040
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Not that it--.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.220
I had thought so, at least in the case of
the speech recognizer.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.940
I wasn't able to turn up any solid information
confirming that.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.890
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, Google Maps, there isn't
anything you can do there and speech recognition

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.840
is transparent.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.850
If there isn't any network it will try to
find one and then [unintelligible] select.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:54.030
&gt;&gt;Matthew: I think there might be some cases
where offline that you use online functionality.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.340
That the results of that are surprisingly
clear.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:02.850
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, if you have spotty networks,
if you have some connectivity, low bandwidth

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:07.770
or yeah, [unintelligible] time or something,
then it will roll over to the offline.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.670
&gt;&gt;Richard: Trying to give you the best experience
possible as a user.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:14.480
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, the whole point of speech interaction
is that it's fast.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.950
If you have to sit around waiting for long
times, it's pretty useless.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.430
So we try to avoid that.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.110
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: Can I add something?

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:29.770
As we're talking about speed and latency and
audio, I'm experiencing some troubles with

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.340
the media player.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:36.670
When I'm trying to play a file, it only plays
the first few milliseconds or so.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:37.750
And it's not reproducible.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:42.970
So, it has something to do with the mark A.
I use it at the same time or something.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.080
I'm not very sure about this.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.030
So maybe you could say something about that.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:53.730
&gt;&gt;Richard: The media player has quite a complex
life cycle.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:59.760
Have you read all the documentation on it
and made sure that you're following the correct

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.440
life cycle for the stream?

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.110
If it's not fully prepared and you've got
the callback setting string repaired and you

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.530
get run on it, you are gonna run into that
kind of problem.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:08.530
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: Yes.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:15.679
So, I got some method to override where it
fully loads the thingy and then it starts

00:21:15.679 --> 00:21:16.679
over.

00:21:16.679 --> 00:21:18.440
Yeah, I'll just do that.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.700
&gt;&gt;Richard: Even when it, you do get the error,
it's already come back and said the video's

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.700
ready to go.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.440
And then it tries to play it and it still
falls apart.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.640
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: Yeah.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.640
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.210
Do you have any stack tracing or any actual
errors that come out of it?

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.840
Or, is it, there's nothing logged at all?

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.770
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: No, I actually don't get
anything in my log.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:43.540
To be honest, all my cable just broke so I
can't test it in my emulator because we can't

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.160
shake the emulator and yeah.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.160
So, I'll test this tomorrow.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.070
&gt;&gt;Richard: You can't shake the emulator?.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.070
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: No.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.070
Can you?

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.070
&gt;&gt;Richard: Why can't you shake it?

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.420
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: Uh.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.950
&gt;&gt;Richard: Why do you want to?

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:58.220
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: Well, I've got in my code,
I've got a shake list now.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.630
So, I use it on the poll.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:07.460
And I implement something just like, emulator
shake with the little button or something.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:08.799
&gt;&gt;Richard: Fair enough.

00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:11.690
No, I cannot shake the emulator, but you still
need the cable for it.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:15.590
Anyway, the latest version of the emulators
allow you to pass in sensors from the device

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.590
into the emulator.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.590
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: OK.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.590
Good.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:19.590
&gt;&gt;Richard: A cable, you haven't got a cable.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.960
You must have a cable.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.600
Is that just me?

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.630
I've got so many micro-USB cables.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.150
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: Just one.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:33.309
&gt;&gt;Al: The guys open at ten and they have a
sensor simulator, which I think might be able

00:22:33.309 --> 00:22:36.810
to rip emulator shake on a device with an
emulator.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.220
So I put the link up for that.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.100
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I found that in Stack Overflow,
too.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.240
I'll post that as well.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:52.550
&gt;&gt;Todd: You know, I had one comment about
Jellybean that it's really, you can see that

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.550
it's much faster than ICS.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:23:02.690
The only comment against it is when you have
to follow apps like, for example, the Desk

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:09.080
Phone app and Skype, you're required to press
three different buttons just to make a phone

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:17.490
call, which is really annoying because you,
it used to be two and now it's three.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.420
[feedback noises]
[unintelligible comments]

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:22.320
&gt;&gt;Richard: because we dropped out again.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:29.570
&gt;&gt;Todd: Well my point was about Jellybean,
[feedback voices] that you have to use three

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:32.620
different buttons if you got two phone apps
just to make a phone call.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.620
[pause]

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:40.040
For example, you've got the normal phone app
in Skype.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.730
&gt;&gt;Richard: Oh, you mean the always and just
one style?

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:44.750
&gt;&gt;Todd: Yeah.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:45.750
&gt;&gt;Richard: Application pick-up.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:46.750
&gt;&gt;Todd: Yeah.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:47.750
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yes.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:48.750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:52.929
&gt;&gt;Todd: It's a bit annoying, if you see what
I mean that I have to press three different

00:23:52.929 --> 00:23:55.800
buttons just to make a, just to dial a number.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.880
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yes.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.990
The always behavior is fine, but the just
once behavior is somewhat annoying.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.990
I agree.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.990
All right.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.990
If you use that a lot--.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.990
[pause]

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:14.710
&gt;&gt;Todd: with the defense with browser, then
like with Skype and normal phone calls, it's

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.100
called different use cases.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.690
The browser is usually for the same case,
if you see what I mean.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:20.690
&gt;&gt;Richard: Normally.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.210
I do know what you mean.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.169
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, you just set the phone to always
and then--.

00:24:25.169 --> 00:24:31.510
&gt;&gt;Todd: Well, because sometimes I call abroad
and to call abroad from Israel is quite expensive,

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.640
so I use Skype.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.870
And it's much cheaper in Skype than this way.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:36.870
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:37.870
&gt;&gt;Todd: So--.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.720
&gt;&gt;Richard: I wouldn't be surprised if that
changed at some point, but I don't know.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.770
&gt;&gt;Todd: Well, it used to be two buttons and
now it's three, so you know?

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:50.140
&gt;&gt;Richard: There's certainly been quite a
few conversations about that application selection

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.140
dial-up.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:56.660
&gt;&gt;Todd: Well, the other thing that you know
that they improved about it is switching between

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.809
keyboards, because it used to that you have
to press a long press on the space button,

00:25:00.809 --> 00:25:01.809
that it switch.

00:25:01.809 --> 00:25:07.270
And now you've got this Grow button that you
can just press on it and it switches the keyboard

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.919
instead of having the pop-up that you--.

00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:11.179
&gt;&gt;Richard: You win some and you lose some
with the keystrokes.

00:25:11.179 --> 00:25:13.030
&gt;&gt;Nick: Can't please everyone.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.680
&gt;&gt;Todd: True, but you know it's getting there.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.250
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:21.180
Well, where are we, Sparky?

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:26.680
I think you're going to Muteland, Sparky.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.680
[pause]

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.910
Well, do you want to unmute, or can you not
talk?

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:33.910
&gt;&gt;Sparky: OK.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:34.910
Yeah.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:40.610
There's a couple of questions on moderator
that I actually know the answers to, I think.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.850
One is, I'm building an app that includes
a live audio stream.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.240
I want to use RTSB.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.080
Is this supported on all Android O/S versions?

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.640
I can't speak to all, but I've seen forum
posts talking about it way back in the days

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.640
of Cupcake.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.669
So, I would tentatively say yes.

00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:59.960
&gt;&gt;Richard: I've got a little bit of input
on this one.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:05.140
So, we were playing around getting some RTSB
streaming going.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.180
We tested it, I think, up to Honeycomb.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:12.870
But I believe Media Player does work on it,
but if you're expecting it to just be a completely

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:16.740
live stream, there is buffering on the Media
Player that I don't think you can get around.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:25.590
So, as far as I'm aware, it is supported,
but there is that slight latency in terms

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.360
of buffering, et cetera.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:35.500
&gt;&gt;Richard: The official page says [unintelligible]
&gt;&gt;Charles: Could it be it's a codec issue

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.230
as much as RTSB support?

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.870
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, we--.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:40.870
[pause]

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:46.280
&gt;&gt;Matthew: Well, they were in the right format.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:57.121
So, I mean, the obvious example to try and
make you've got it right, which is a bit of

00:26:57.121 --> 00:27:01.550
a nasty way of doing it, but yeah, is getting
a [unintelligible] to your device to make

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:05.080
sure the actual stream is valid and the right
codec.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:14.809
And then, if it's the case that that trick
does work, then yeah, you're gonna have to

00:27:14.809 --> 00:27:16.240
dig deeper.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.240
[laughs]

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.240
[pause]

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.789
&gt;&gt;Richard: And I'll also post the official
supportive media codecs and steams.

00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:30.620
There was a page in the Developer documentation
about it, which does suggest quite the same.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.970
RTSB is supported.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.059
And it says that HT63 is probably the only
format.

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:38.880
MP4 or 3GP is supported throughout all versions
of Android as well.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.539
&gt;&gt;Matthew: Is it possible on mobile devices
for OEMs to add extra codecs?

00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:44.539
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:27:44.539 --> 00:27:46.390
Samsung loads their device with codecs.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:50.570
&gt;&gt;Matthew: 'Cause I know that what happens
with Google TV, so yeah.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.990
&gt;&gt;Richard: You just have to pay for licenses.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:55.760
&gt;&gt;Nick: And you gotta make sure you're using
an MP4 file.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.780
You gotta make sure it's set up in the proper
streaming format.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.870
So, you need to make sure that some of them,
I think the mood atom needs to be before any

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:12.080
of the data atoms as well, which is a pretty
standard thing, so you can check that your

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.770
stream is in the right format.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:17.770
&gt;&gt;Richard: Nice.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:18.770
[pause]

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:19.770
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Should we take another one off on
the moderator?

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:20.770
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yep.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.590
&gt;&gt;Sparky: How about this one?

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:29.690
With preferences activity being deprecated
and preference fragments not being available

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:34.799
staring with the 11th, is it recommended to
check if the new API is available or just

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:38.039
wait for the support library to catch up?

00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:40.130
I don't know exactly about the support library.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:46.440
Here's a partial answer from Gabriel Indburn,
from Germany, that says he doesn't think performance

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:51.350
preference fragment can be added to the library
due to some internal dependencies.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:56.130
I can't really speak to that, but in my own
experience, there's only just a few lines

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.690
of difference between a preference activity
and a preference fragment.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:05.530
So, what I would probably do is try to factor
that out into its own encapsulated bit of

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:10.590
code and just call it from either the activity
or the fragment, depending on what you did

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.020
tech support for.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.620
That's my recommendation.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:20.970
I tested this a little bit, for example, and
I can either read the same XML fragment, the

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:26.740
same XML parcel in either one in the same
application, which is fine.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:30.900
Given that although we've deprecated it, preference
activity still works.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.730
I kinda have a hard time telling people, "No,
don't use that.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:35.820
Just use nothing."

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:41.520
I mean, it's the, without it being in the
support library, you can't access it on Gingerbread,

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.200
which means you can't access it on something
like 60 to 90 percent of the devices out there.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.840
And I'm reluctant to give that advice.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:54.330
So, I would say go ahead and do the dual implementation
method.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.240
It's not that much extra work.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:01.840
&gt;&gt;Al: There's an interesting thread on the
action bar Sherlock Issue Tracker that covers

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.179
this and covers the reasons why it's unlikely
to make it into the support library as well.

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:10.220
So, I put a link up to that in case anyone
wants more info.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.440
[pause]

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.890
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:22.150
Anything else from inside the Hangout before
we jump to the next moderator question?

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.380
No one?

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.000
[pause]

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.610
No.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.230
OK.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.080
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Next up on the moderator.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.490
This, oh, wait.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:40.630
Call the recognizer intent and have it return
a result no matter what and not show the error

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:45.280
message or connections errors and such.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.880
Probably not, but I don't know.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.880
[pause]

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:58.180
&gt;&gt;Man in hangout: Did you just catch that?

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:03.370
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, I don't know about the recognizer
intent.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:08.799
I would say if it does return error codes,
probably not a way to suppress those.

00:31:08.799 --> 00:31:12.820
I suppose you could have it try again.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.200
Put it in Async Task or something.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:21.490
But I don't know of a way to, I mean, I haven't
looked into the API, but a priori I don't

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:26.929
know of a way to force it to return a result.

00:31:26.929 --> 00:31:36.570
&gt;&gt;Richard: Well, the API doc says he returns
the intent or just know it's not available.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.360
[pause]

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:43.210
So, I guess the problem is you call the recognizer
intent.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:47.441
The UI's coming up, put a little microphone
in it and let the pulsing try to recognize,

00:31:47.441 --> 00:31:51.200
but if there's no connection, the use is gonna
get narrowed and have to dismiss.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.750
And then it goes back to the app with just
a null response.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:32:00.159
So, it's calling functionality that's in another
part of the system and then try to control

00:32:00.159 --> 00:32:01.159
that.

00:32:01.159 --> 00:32:05.100
And yeah, to my knowledge, that's, there's
no extras you can add on to the recognizer

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.100
intent.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.940
There certainly aren't any specified in the
documentation, which would allow you to say

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.630
if there's no connection then don't show it.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:16.870
The obvious thing to do would be to check
connectivity before you call the recognizer

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.150
intent.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:23.660
And if there isn't activity, don't lead it
up to the voice recognition.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:29.200
Although, of course, that changed with Jellybean
anyway, where we have offline voice recognition.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:35.360
So maybe you're saying you're on Ice Cream
Sandwich or before and there's no connection,

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.820
then don't show the recognizer options.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:44.000
It might be a reasonable solution to your
problem.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.340
And the next one is, "How do I get the Galaxy
Nexus or Nexus S to emulate an unencrypted

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.340
tag?"

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:57.841
I'm wondering if you're trying to do it programatically
or if you just want to do it as a test of

00:32:57.841 --> 00:32:58.841
the device.

00:32:58.841 --> 00:33:04.130
If you just want to emulate a tag, you can
download the NXP software out of the Playstore

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:08.020
and you can read and write tags or pretend
to be tags and do things like that.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.360
&gt;&gt;Nick: And it's a pretty complex subject
as well.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.659
It really depends on what the tag type is,
because we really only support one particular

00:33:13.659 --> 00:33:15.049
tag type, which I--.

00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:16.100
&gt;&gt;Richard: [unintelligible] push.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.100
&gt;&gt;Nick: No.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.679
I wish I could get the name offhand.

00:33:18.679 --> 00:33:19.750
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I think the MIFARE.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:24.150
&gt;&gt;Nick: No, no we don't support MIFARE.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:26.299
It's an ISO standard one that we support,
but we, yeah.

00:33:26.299 --> 00:33:28.170
It's a really, really quite complex situation.

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:29.351
So, it's quite open-ended.

00:33:29.351 --> 00:33:34.200
So it depends on what the tag on the end of
that is.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.200
[pause]

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.409
&gt;&gt;Sparky: There you go.

00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:41.580
&gt;&gt;Nick: But yeah, the app will probably be
your best app, your best bet to try and do

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.580
that.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.059
&gt;&gt;Richard: And even if you're trying to do
something else, the NX app has an advanced

00:33:46.059 --> 00:33:50.470
mode to debugging, which is just excellent
for trying to sweat any issues at to see what

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:53.630
content's are tags and what format tags are
in, things like that.

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.320
You can grab that out of the Play Store.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:04.830
Do you have anything else from the comment
stream?

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.919
[pause]

00:34:07.919 --> 00:34:21.929
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I 
added Nick's recommendation to my answer there.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:24.990
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:26.519
[unintelligible].

00:34:26.519 --> 00:34:40.799
&gt;&gt;Nick: So, Android [unintelligible] can I
do ISO one four four three dash four?

00:34:40.799 --> 00:34:43.950
Oh, and what if they're classic, sorry.

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:47.229
Not the standard [unintelligible].

00:34:47.229 --> 00:34:49.569
That's what we use it for.

00:34:49.569 --> 00:34:52.529
&gt;&gt;Richard: Hopefully the person who was asking
that question--.

00:34:52.529 --> 00:34:53.529
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yes.

00:34:53.529 --> 00:34:56.559
He was trying to emulate anything other than
those, then he might be out of luck.

00:34:56.559 --> 00:35:02.589
&gt;&gt;Richard: Hopefully he's watching the video.

00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:05.599
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible] moderator.

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:12.400
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Next question is how can I mock
the account manager in Android Tasks?

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.719
Currently the default [unintelligible] private.

00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:17.239
Planning to add a mock account manager.

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:22.480
I have not gone into the depths of what you
can mock and what you can't mock in the Tasks,

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.309
so I can't really speak to that.

00:35:25.309 --> 00:35:30.719
I could look it up, but I have not done so
in advance.

00:35:30.719 --> 00:35:33.420
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, again, that's a new--.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.940
Put the question, did look it up.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.710
[pause]

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:52.460
There seems to be some answers on the Android
Google Group, which may or may not work.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.430
By the way, I'm just checking that out and
having a search.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:36:00.940
We don't have, there's any [unintelligible]
on whether there will be one in the future.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:05.410
Four more in this page.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:11.859
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Did you cover the question about
the, about making the phone app more tablet-friendly?

00:36:11.859 --> 00:36:14.980
&gt;&gt;Richard: No, that's where we were just about
to go.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:15.980
&gt;&gt;Matthew: [unintelligible].

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.029
[feedback voices]
&gt;&gt;Nick: For example, I want to make my apps

00:36:19.029 --> 00:36:20.029
more tablet-friendly.

00:36:20.029 --> 00:36:24.359
So how do I keep a phone layout for Phones,
also display large images when you use it

00:36:24.359 --> 00:36:25.630
in stores on tablet?

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:26.630
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I don't know.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:27.630
I think that one's a complete stumper.

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:30.990
I don't think we're gonna be able to answer
that.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.349
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Richard: It's not possible.

00:36:32.349 --> 00:36:33.380
You should [unintelligible].

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:38.200
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, well, there's two major ways
you can do this.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:43.970
So, if you need to let it have a completely
distinct layout, then you can just provide

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:48.140
a different layout easily using the resource
qualifier on the layout directly.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:53.509
So, you have your layout directory containing
your layout for phones.

00:36:53.509 --> 00:37:00.569
Then, you could have a layout dash X-large,
or say dash SW600, for example, if you want

00:37:00.569 --> 00:37:06.170
it to say I need a minimum of 600 DPs size
screen in order to show this larger layout.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:08.910
And then you have an alternative layout in
there with the same name.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:11.180
So, that's one way you can have a different
layout.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.839
So go and check the development docs for that.

00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:17.599
Another technique which I quite like as well
is if you, if the same layout works well for

00:37:17.599 --> 00:37:22.690
both the phones, but say I like my Nexus 7,
you want to have slightly larger images.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:24.880
You can just use the dimensions bar.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:29.390
And so similarly, in your values, probably,
you might have a value dimens XML in your

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:33.239
values folder saying the image size should
be 100 dp.

00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:41.880
But you have an overloaded version in your
values dash SW600 dp, which has a similar

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.270
file for overrides that value.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.759
It says the image size should be 150 dp.

00:37:45.759 --> 00:37:50.990
So then, when you reference that size from
your layout, you'll get the right version

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.140
depending on what device you're running on.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:57.630
So, you can use the same base layout, but
just add bigger image sizes or text sizes

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.799
or whatever it is you might like.

00:37:58.799 --> 00:38:02.630
&gt;&gt;Richard: Very well, this is very well covered
in the docs as well.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:08.619
If you just search for supporting multiple
screen sizes on Android, then you can see

00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:10.079
all the details on that as well.

00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:13.569
You gonna say something there, Sparky?

00:38:13.569 --> 00:38:14.569
Sorry.

00:38:14.569 --> 00:38:16.480
&gt;&gt;Sparky: There we go.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:23.190
I was gonna say those size qualifiers, those
size buckets, do those work on alternative

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:24.700
drawables as well as on layouts?

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.660
I thought they did, but I'm not sure.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.890
&gt;&gt;Richard: Drawables you do via densities,
right?

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:32.829
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Well, yeah.

00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:35.420
&gt;&gt;Matthew: There as well.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.650
Usually that includes the screen width.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.700
&gt;&gt;Richard: But you still do it?

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.280
&gt;&gt;Matthew: No, 'cause you can still--.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.359
See, what you could do is probably if you
were doing the size, width and [unintelligible].

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:53.559
&gt;&gt;Richard: You should look at the supporting
multiple screens page.

00:38:53.559 --> 00:38:54.559
&gt;&gt;Matthew: Yeah.

00:38:54.559 --> 00:38:57.839
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, should have looked at the
supporting multiple screens page.

00:38:57.839 --> 00:39:00.930
I think that's gonna have the answer.

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:04.539
&gt;&gt;Matthew: But before you would've had dash
X-large.

00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:07.420
And then you could have any dpi by it.

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.700
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.950
&gt;&gt;Nick: And make sure the order is right as
well because the order is important.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:13.950
[pause]

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:17.950
&gt;&gt;Matthew: There's a hierarchy.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:19.930
&gt;&gt;Sparky: And document it.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.950
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yes, very much so.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:26.380
&gt;&gt;Sparky: And if you don't wanna look at the
documentation, you can just add your qualifiers

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.380
using the graphical tool in the IDE.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:33.640
Then you click some and it'll put them in
the right order for you.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.779
[pause]

00:39:34.779 --> 00:39:44.609
&gt;&gt;Richard: I was just looking through the
different qualifiers and you can even specify

00:39:44.609 --> 00:39:48.049
the qualifier for the country codes, the country
code.

00:39:48.049 --> 00:39:53.109
If you want to add different graphics detected
by the country of the device automatically,

00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:56.519
you can put your own CC and country code in
there.

00:39:56.519 --> 00:40:03.229
That's on providing alternative resources
for qualifiers.

00:40:03.229 --> 00:40:05.460
[pause]

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:14.249
There's a lot of different qualifiers now...
[unintelligible], car, desk, television, or

00:40:14.249 --> 00:40:15.249
appliance?

00:40:15.249 --> 00:40:16.249
&gt;&gt;Nick: These are old.

00:40:16.249 --> 00:40:18.079
[unintelligible]These will be as well.

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:19.190
[pause]

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:21.420
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.650
[keyboard clicks]

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:24.760
Right.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:34.259
Now we can go on to the next one.

00:40:34.259 --> 00:40:35.959
[pause]

00:40:35.959 --> 00:40:39.359
&gt;&gt;Sparky: OK.

00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:44.459
I'll get mine.

00:40:44.459 --> 00:40:49.349
So the next one on the moderator is sort of
a long, complicated question from [unintelligible]

00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:50.349
in Greece.

00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:53.019
Says I want a development app that's quite
dynamic.

00:40:53.019 --> 00:40:56.900
It has to correspond to some specific tables
in a database.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:02.660
It comes from a user-contented website and
I'll have to create buttons and strings and

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:07.099
stuff that comes up from the web server.

00:41:07.099 --> 00:41:13.599
This sounds to me kind of like your basic
client-server application can probably use

00:41:13.599 --> 00:41:20.249
any sort of arrestable API, using Silk or
using JSON or whatever.

00:41:20.249 --> 00:41:27.499
I don't see that there's anything about this
that doesn't fall into a very broad category

00:41:27.499 --> 00:41:29.710
of applications that we've seen on Android
before.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:37.930
So I think it's definitely doable and probably
involves quite a lot of code.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:43.500
So, the writer says is there a library?

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.500
[feedback noise]
No.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:49.579
I don't think, there might be some, couple
libraries, but for anything this complex,

00:41:49.579 --> 00:41:53.319
I don't think you're gonna be able to get
around writing a lot of code.

00:41:53.319 --> 00:42:01.050
Maybe you can use some techniques to accelerate
your database access.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:05.729
If you're adding databases on the device,
but yeah.

00:42:05.729 --> 00:42:08.859
Pretty much you're talking client-server application.

00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:12.519
It's sort of a solved problem.

00:42:12.519 --> 00:42:21.349
Nothing ground breaking there.

00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:23.690
When will Slovakia beat in Street View.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.650
That's an application question, not a development
question.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:28.319
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, the next two questions are.

00:42:28.319 --> 00:42:31.319
Nothing totally appropriate.

00:42:31.319 --> 00:42:34.319
Applicational feature requests.

00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:38.319
Can you get one?

00:42:38.319 --> 00:42:42.819
&gt;&gt;Sparky: And how can I get Chrome on my Android?

00:42:42.819 --> 00:42:46.940
The answer from the other reader is supported
by ICS and above.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.950
And I'll accept that as the correct answer.

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.430
&gt;&gt;Matthew: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:51.430
That's true.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.430
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:56.339
Which means I believe we've got through the
moderator questions.

00:42:56.339 --> 00:43:03.420
&gt;&gt;Nick: There's a question in the G+ frame
where Boyd asks, it says that he loves holo

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.529
theme so much.

00:43:04.529 --> 00:43:07.049
Can he use it elsewhere?

00:43:07.049 --> 00:43:08.049
Yes.

00:43:08.049 --> 00:43:09.049
[laughter]

00:43:09.049 --> 00:43:10.049
&gt;&gt;Richard: How?

00:43:10.049 --> 00:43:17.849
&gt;&gt;Nick: No, he says can he use it on Gingerbread
apps, even IOS or web apps?

00:43:17.849 --> 00:43:18.849
Sure.

00:43:18.849 --> 00:43:25.609
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I'd say Gingerbread is not too hard
because it's, you've got all your XML scripters.

00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:29.269
Porting the whole thing to IOS, that sounds
to me like a world of pain.

00:43:29.269 --> 00:43:34.819
I mean, yes, you can copy the appearance,
but you can't actually port the assets directly.

00:43:34.819 --> 00:43:37.640
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, I'm just gonna slip a little
in there.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.299
I would say you can, yeah.

00:43:39.299 --> 00:43:43.279
As Sparky says, you can probably get hold
of the assets and the general padding and

00:43:43.279 --> 00:43:47.279
the build by looking in platform resources
directory.

00:43:47.279 --> 00:43:49.730
But you probably wanna stop and think, is
that what you really wanna do?

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:55.959
Like, I'm a big advocate of having apps that
are native on that platform that they're on.

00:43:55.959 --> 00:44:02.279
I'm not gonna say, it is case for an app,
like follow the holo theme on Gingerbread,

00:44:02.279 --> 00:44:09.940
even though it was introduced after that platform
is a distinctively unmanageable task to really

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:10.940
keep an app.

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.970
Like, looking completely native on every version
of Android out there.

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:19.999
So, if you're gonna put any effort into making
the app look great, I'd say make it look great

00:44:19.999 --> 00:44:22.749
on the newest stuff on holo and it's OK.

00:44:22.749 --> 00:44:24.059
I mean, that's what we do at Google.

00:44:24.059 --> 00:44:27.099
If you take a look at Gmail application or
the Play Store, for example.

00:44:27.099 --> 00:44:32.229
They're both very holo kind of themed application
and they look the same on Gingerbread.

00:44:32.229 --> 00:44:35.479
So yeah, you definitely can do that.

00:44:35.479 --> 00:44:37.230
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Turnabout is fair play, isn't it?

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:42.319
Wouldn't it be nice to see an application
on IOS for once that's a clone of its Android

00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:44.599
version instead of vice versa?

00:44:44.599 --> 00:44:49.249
&gt;&gt;Al: All the resulting stuff are partly Android
Open Source projects, it's all Apache licensed,

00:44:49.249 --> 00:44:51.019
so there's nothing stopping anyone going for
that.

00:44:51.019 --> 00:44:56.219
&gt;&gt;Todd: Well, I can tell you that in Israel,
they actually started producing apps on Android

00:44:56.219 --> 00:44:58.709
before they start on IOS.

00:44:58.709 --> 00:44:59.709
Pretty surprising.

00:44:59.709 --> 00:45:03.890
&gt;&gt;Richard: We've had partners whose apps have
been rejected from the IOS build because they

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:04.890
looked too Androidy before.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:09.349
You just don't get to see them on IOS 'cause
they rejected it before they landed in the

00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:10.349
store.

00:45:10.349 --> 00:45:11.349
&gt;&gt;Todd: No, no, no.

00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:12.940
They didn't develop them just because they're
delayed.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:18.670
They like, for example, a big telephone company
here, they just produced an app that shows

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:21.950
you free wi-fi that belongs to their network.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:25.390
Like, that's 02 and other companies in the
EU.

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:31.499
And they said the iPhone IOS will come soon,
but the Android is already out.

00:45:31.499 --> 00:45:32.940
&gt;&gt;Richard: Thanks, man.

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.289
&gt;&gt;Todd: It's completely Android-style, IOS
free whatsoever.

00:45:36.289 --> 00:45:37.289
Quite surprisingly.

00:45:37.289 --> 00:45:38.289
&gt;&gt;Richard: Brilliant.

00:45:38.289 --> 00:45:43.380
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, it's been about six months or
so since we launched the Android design site

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:49.920
and we're starting to see not just keen Android
advocates and developers, but also just the

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.070
big companies really starting to embrace that.

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:55.390
And I think that that's what they long for
is an official place saying, "This is what

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:57.170
Android app looks like."

00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:00.739
And then the people start to follow that.

00:46:00.739 --> 00:46:02.969
So, it's brilliant to see.

00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:05.650
&gt;&gt;Todd: Yeah, that's what happens today.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:09.490
The thing also, you know, Android is, I think
the advantage of Android is also is the fact

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:15.420
that it has so many varieties of devices as
opposed to one device.

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.459
Do you see what I mean?

00:46:17.459 --> 00:46:18.779
Because usually that's the way I see it.

00:46:18.779 --> 00:46:22.420
If you look at another family, it's very rare
that you'll see in one family the same device

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:26.859
sold to all the people in the family as opposed
to--.

00:46:26.859 --> 00:46:29.160
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, of course.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.309
I agree.

00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:31.940
My, are we frozen?

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.020
No, Nick's just sitting very still.

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:37.650
[laughs] I've got an HTC HD.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:41.589
My dad's got a Nexus S. I've got a Galaxy
Nexus.

00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:45.220
My brother has got a Samsung Galaxy S, too.

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.229
Android family.

00:46:46.229 --> 00:46:47.229
All different devices.

00:46:47.229 --> 00:46:48.640
There you go.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.089
&gt;&gt;Nick: Beautiful story.

00:46:50.089 --> 00:46:51.089
[laughter]

00:46:51.089 --> 00:46:53.740
&gt;&gt;Richard: We've all got our Nexus stuff.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.369
I've got one.

00:46:55.369 --> 00:47:00.349
&gt;&gt;Todd: I can also tell you right now, they
announced that Jellybean got, started rolling

00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:03.369
out for the Zoom, also.

00:47:03.369 --> 00:47:04.369
They just started it.

00:47:04.369 --> 00:47:05.369
&gt;&gt;Nick: Oh, yeah?

00:47:05.369 --> 00:47:07.029
&gt;&gt;Todd: About a few hours ago.

00:47:07.029 --> 00:47:10.039
They said on XPA that some people started
getting it.

00:47:10.039 --> 00:47:11.039
&gt;&gt;Nick: Great.

00:47:11.039 --> 00:47:16.849
So, that's a Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, obviously
the Nexus 7 and now the Zoom, wi-fi.

00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:20.210
&gt;&gt;Al: The Zoom wi-fi rollout is only preview.

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:22.740
It's not going out to the public over the
air.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.619
It's part of Motorola's Early Adopter Program.

00:47:24.619 --> 00:47:28.690
They're trying to get people to test it before
they do a live rollout.

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:30.170
&gt;&gt;Todd: I doubt that--.

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:34.380
&gt;&gt;Nick: This is Motorola pushing out their
devices, not the ones that Google control.

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.319
The American wi-fi builds.

00:47:36.319 --> 00:47:41.989
&gt;&gt;Todd: American wi-fi I thought was being
controlled by Google, isn't it?

00:47:41.989 --> 00:47:45.519
&gt;&gt;Al: Motorola run a test program before they
release the stuff across to Google.

00:47:45.519 --> 00:47:48.390
And they're running the test program at the
moment for the Zoom.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:51.339
&gt;&gt;Todd: Well, I am trying to install it right
now.

00:47:51.339 --> 00:47:55.130
I'm not part of the test group, but I downloaded
it, manually.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:56.960
Hopefully, I'll be able to start with the
USB.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.789
&gt;&gt;Richard: That's the Android way, Todd.

00:47:59.789 --> 00:48:03.130
Of course you downloaded it manually.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:04.130
Of course you pushed the device.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:05.130
&gt;&gt;Todd: What about the--.

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:07.949
&gt;&gt;Richard: The latest in, our Nexus 7 commercial,
they were using an unlocked Nexus 7.

00:48:07.949 --> 00:48:12.910
&gt;&gt;Todd: But where is the fun in that?

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:16.019
If you get it straight away without trying
to install it yourself.

00:48:16.019 --> 00:48:17.049
&gt;&gt;Richard: See.

00:48:17.049 --> 00:48:20.640
You feel like you're in control, right?

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.299
&gt;&gt;Todd: And what about the Nexus Q?

00:48:23.299 --> 00:48:26.930
What version of Android does that run on its
base?

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.520
&gt;&gt;Richard: What did you find on yours, Al,
when you decomposed it?

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:34.029
&gt;&gt;Al: I was running a tweaked version of Ice
Cream Sandwich, like four oh four.

00:48:34.029 --> 00:48:39.539
It had lots of little changes in it 'cause
it was an Android at home device.

00:48:39.539 --> 00:48:40.999
&gt;&gt;Nick: Sneaky.

00:48:40.999 --> 00:48:43.199
&gt;&gt;Richard: All right.

00:48:43.199 --> 00:48:45.339
Excellent stuff.

00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:48.480
We'll keep the video down in length a little
this time and see if it increases the number

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.039
of YouTube watchers later on.

00:48:51.039 --> 00:48:53.769
So, thank you all very much for dropping by
today.

00:48:53.769 --> 00:48:58.069
And we'll see you all again at two PM next
week for the next Android Developer Office

00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:59.069
Hours.

00:48:59.069 --> 00:49:01.319
&gt;&gt;Man in the Hangout: Thanks, guys.

00:49:01.319 --> 00:49:04.319
Hey guys, I have one big off-topic question.

00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:05.390
Can I just--.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:07.209
&gt;&gt;Richard: I'm pressing the button.

00:49:07.209 --> 00:49:11.259
&gt;&gt;Man in the Hangout: OK, so I have Chrome
browser.

00:49:11.259 --> 00:49:15.269
And when I select text, Chrome thinks it's
a mouse gesture.

00:49:15.269 --> 00:49:18.630
How do I turn it off?

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:19.630
[laughter]

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:20.890
&gt;&gt;Richard: Chrome browser on Android?

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:24.150
&gt;&gt;Man in the Hangout: No, on my PC.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:25.150
&gt;&gt;Richard: What?

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:27.740
There's no gestures in Chrome on your PC.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:28.740
Just select text.

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.579
&gt;&gt;Man in the Hangout: I select text from right
to left and it takes me back a page.

00:49:32.579 --> 00:49:34.890
&gt;&gt;Richard: Have you just installed a new mouse?

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:35.890
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:37.349
That sounds like an Apple--.

00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:38.359
On which device?

00:49:38.359 --> 00:49:42.569
&gt;&gt;Man in the Hangout: On an HP Dell Probook.

00:49:42.569 --> 00:49:46.519
&gt;&gt;Richard: Well, maybe you need to go to the
Chrome Office Hours, not us.

00:49:46.519 --> 00:49:48.069
&gt;&gt;Man in Hangout: All right.

00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:49.069
Will do.

00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:51.529
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Do you have any extensions and stuff?

00:49:51.529 --> 00:49:53.549
&gt;&gt;Richard: It happened on mine.

00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:54.549
Yeah.

00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:58.859
[unintelligible] Safe mode or whatever it's
called now.

00:49:58.859 --> 00:49:59.859
Bye.

00:49:59.859 --> 00:50:01.220
Thanks for that.
