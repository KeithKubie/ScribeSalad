00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.629
For this blue graph, I know the y intercept is at 1. So my y intercept, or my b

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:09.401
is positive 1. To find the slope, we just move from this point to another point

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:13.884
in the line. I'm going to move to this point. So I move up 4, and then right 3.

00:00:13.884 --> 00:00:18.459
These are both positive directions. So I have 4 3rd. For the red line, I start

00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:23.074
at the y intercept, which is at negative 3. To find the slope, I can go to

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:28.436
another point. I see another point there. So I travel down 3 units, and write 4

00:00:28.436 --> 00:00:33.857
units. Here, this direction is down. So it's negative 3, and the 4 is positive,

00:00:33.857 --> 00:00:38.810
since I moved to the right. So, negative 3 4th. Congrats if you got both of

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.727
those right.
