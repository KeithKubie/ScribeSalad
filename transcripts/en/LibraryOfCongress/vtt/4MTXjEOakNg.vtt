00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.030
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Welcome to
the Library of Congress.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.330
I'm John Cole.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.810
I'm the director of the Center for
the Book in Library of Congress,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.950
of which the Young
Readers Center is a part,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.540
even though we say the Young
Readers Center, as does the Center

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.230
for the Book, belongs
to the whole Library.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.820
And, one of our jobs is to
promote books and reading

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.090
and literacy in libraries.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.360
And, since the Young Readers
Center opened in 2009,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.410
we can say that we
are now doing this

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.810
for everybody, people of all ages.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.490
And, the Library of Congress
itself is a wonderful institution,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.300
but it's 18 to 20 reading
rooms, as you probably know,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.900
have traditionally since the
late 19th century have been open

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.140
for 16 or older.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.960 position:56%
And, after -- and in the period when
I came for a while it went up to 18

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.330
and older, then came
back down to 16.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.790
And, now over -- open to everyone,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.300
as Thomas Jefferson
would truly appreciate.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.360
The Center for the Book itself was
created in 1977, by Daniel Boorstin

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.630
when he was Librarian of Congress,
and he felt it was important

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.960
for this -- the Library
to have a place and also

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.590
in particular have programs that
reached to the general audience

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.910
that promoted books and reading.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.390 position:56%
We weren't even talking about
literacy in 1977, believe it or not.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.920
Now, we say that our goal is to
stimulate public interest in books,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.070
reading, literacy, and libraries.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.680
We have a special literacy
awards program,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.260
and also to encourage the study
of the role of books, reading,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.070
and literacy and libraries
in our culture.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.190
And, it's in that sense
we're so happy to be --

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.970
be able to present
Leonard Marcus today.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.350
Leonard has -- I think many of
you know, Leonard is a expert

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.240
in all phases of the
children's book world.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.680
And, we're very lucky to have him.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.550
What we're going to do today is to
have a presentation from Leonard

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.190
of which he has prepared
specially for us.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.620
But, in addition, we will have
a question and answer period.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.610
And, I know some of
you have been part

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.620 position:56%
of the Lewis Carroll celebration
going on at the Library of Congress,

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.890
and have already been
up to the Rare Book

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.990
and Special Collections Division,
or where there is a display

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.050
of the rare books, copies, and
various editions of "Alice".

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.530
And, others of you, I know,
participated in this two-for-one,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.830
this double-header of a
celebration, in part starting

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.780
with our Young Readers Center
of -- last Friday, when,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.140
those of you who weren't
able to join us,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.010
there was a special
dress-up story time featuring

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.310
"Alice in Wonderland."

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.150
All costumed children were invited
and did join in an Alice parade

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.310
on the first two floors of
the Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.390
Inside the Young Readers
Center, and I just took Leonard

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.340
down to see the Young
Readers Center.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.820
He actually, the last time
he came, he gave a talk

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.020
for the Center for the Book.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.190
We were still in construction
down there.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.460
So, it's been a while,
but he was impressed

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.830
with the wonderful family
atmosphere and the developments

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.860
of the Younger Readers Center,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.470
which is on the ground
floor in this building.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.210
And, if you haven't seen
it, I hope you will.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.240
And, I should say that -- a
special thank you, really,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.300
to the head of the
Young Readers Center,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.200 position:56%
Karen Chafey [assumed spelling], who
is here, and also to her assistant,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.500
Kaheed Mohamed [assumed spelling].

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.780
They really have entered
into this spirit

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.770
of this Lewis Carroll
celebration, and in fact,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.280
they've pulled their boss into
it in many different ways.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.080
I have an interest in the
history of the Library of Congress

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.700 position:56%
and it was Karen who actually went
to an earlier talk that Leonard gave

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.400
at the Rosinback Museum in
Philadelphia about "Alice"

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.660
and came back excited to remind
me of the small collection --

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.320
connection of the Library
of Congress had in helping

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.990
to return the original
manuscript of "Alice" back

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.520
to the British Library
where it is on display.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.620
It happens that last week I was
lucky enough to be in London,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.710
and lucky enough to have a day --

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.530
a good part of a day
at the British Library

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.660
and I had a wonderful time
looking at their "Alice

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.350
in Wonderland" exhibit,
which has been up.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.060
Many of you have probably
seen it, I hope.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.570
And, to see their special
Alice's Popup Gift Shop,

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.650
and also to come back with a
copy of what they are selling,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.380
which is their new edition of
"Alice's Adventures Underground",

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.790
which is the actual facsimile.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.560
And, the store, but I'm not going
into it because we have to get

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.690
to Leonard fast because we only
have between one and two o'clock

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.790
to return to the Rare Book Division
to see the rest of the display.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.950 position:56%
But, here is how the return -- it's
a long store, but the -- Alice is --

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.710
the manuscript was
sold to an American,

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.920
and eventually found
its way back to England,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.420
and this is when the
heirs were short of money.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.070
And, there's a description
of this in the --

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.620
this little book that
I'll just read,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.480
and then I'll quickly
introduce Leonard.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.410
And, it's talking about how the
manuscript was sold in 1928, of --

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.990
to an American, and the -- of --
then it went on, put up for sale

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.990
at Sotheby's and went to a
donor who then died in 1946.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.260
Following the death
of its American owner,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.080
the original "Alice" manuscript,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.990
depicted here with these
wonderful illustrations

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.820
by Lewis Carroll came
up again at auction.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.420 position:56%
Rosinback, Dr. Rosinback, bought it,
and this time for 50,000 dollars.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.140
Initially it was 28,000 dollars.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.000
A plan was then hatched, and
here's how this plan was described

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.300
in this book.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.520
I know it is -- we -- other
of us have different version.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.560
It was hashed out by the prominent
bibliophile Leslie Rosenwald.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.170
You were in the Rosenwald Room if
you were up at the exhibit earlier,

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.600
who persuaded a group
of wealthy benefactors

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.700
at the famous little book should
be returned to its own country

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.040
as a gesture of thanks

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.340
for the British people's
gallantry in World War Two.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.690
Six, November, 1948, the Library of
Congress, Luther Evans at the time,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.290
sailed for England on the Queen
Elizabeth, taking the manuscript

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.730
with him, and occasionally
sleeping with it under his pillow.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.580
On 12 November, he presented it to
the British Museum as an expression

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.950
of thanks to a noble people
who kept Hitler at bay

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.250
for a long period, single-handed.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.900 position:56%
The Archbishop of Canterbury, who
accepted it on behalf of the nation,

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.690
proclaimed this gesture as
an unsullied and innocent act

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.380
in a distracted and sinful world,

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.960
a sentiment which would have
appealed to the story's creator.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.480
Now, Leonard is -- has
prepared a special talk --

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.880
illustrated talk for us today.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.620
Of those of you who don't know
Leonard may know him as an author

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.200
of many books related to the
worlds of children's books.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.350
He in particular has taken
an interest in recent times

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.100
in illustrators and
illustrated children's books,

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.870
and this is my last way
to introduce Leonard.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.590
This is the book that really helped
us at the Library of Congress.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.910
This is called "Show Me a Story,
Why Picture Books Matter",

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.260
and why it mattered to us was, we
had just created the Children's --

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.570
the young people's center in 2009.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.870
This book was published in
2012, I had already met Leonard.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.600
He was talking about his
work with illustrators,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.480
and another important
project for the Center

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.950
for the Book is the
National Book Festival.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.380
And, we were just moving --

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.660
moving in a serious way toward
expanding it, toward something

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.960
that was also new at the
time, graphic novels.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.980
And, one of the wonderful
parts of this particular book,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.840
which I brought for Leonard to sign

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.780
and then I rediscovered
he'd already signed it,

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.550
was that it has the biographies,
and it really helped introduce

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.110
at least John Cole to the world

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.750
of children's book
illustration in an important way.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.520
We're lucky to have
Leonard Marcus here today.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.920
He's prepared something for us.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.210
He'll tell us about it, and join me

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.600
in welcoming children's
book authority

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.510
and advocate, Leonard Marcus.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:26.980
[ Applause ]

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.280
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus:
Well, good afternoon.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.020
It's really an honor to be
here and see so many people.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.780
Since we're in the
Library of Congress,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:39.430
I want to just mention two American
associations with the beginnings

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.710
of "Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland."

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:48.090
Lewis Carroll improvised the
story for the three little girls,

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.830
the daughters of the
dean of Christchurch,

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:57.830
Oxford where he was a
teacher on July 4, 1862.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.920
And, he intended to publish the
book exactly three years later

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.450
on the fourth of July in 1865.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.270
Actually a few copies were
printed, but then the illustrator,

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.320
John Tenniel, saw how
poorly the reproduction

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.940
of his line work had
been and he insisted

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:21.130
that the printing be
scrapped and started over.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.610
Carroll and Tenniel and
their publisher, MacMillan,

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.650
came up with a novel solution.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.360
They decided to send the unbound
pages from that first printing

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.680
to America because the Americans
wouldn't know the difference

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.930
between good printing and bad.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.710
So, when -- result of that was
that "Alice" was actually published

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.120
in the US a little bit
before it was published here.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.960
And, the British edition came
out, not in 1865, but 1866.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.260
So, we are actually celebrating
the 150th anniversary of "Alice"

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.740
in the British fashion today.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:02.000
So, I'm going to talk about Lewis
Carroll as a man, as a thinker,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.880
and as someone who
was influenced by one

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.340
of the great countercultural
movements of the Western --

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:15.720
modern Western world, Romanticism,
and as an influencer of another one

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.950
of those movements, surrealism.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.570
"Alice" chronologically
falls right in --

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:25.530 position:56%
smack in the middle between those
two developments in Western culture.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.890
To look at Lewis Carroll,
you would never guess

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.600
that he was any sort
of revolutionary.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:36.240
It's hard to imagine him with a
beret and a [inaudible] cigarette,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.890
which is how you would
imagine the Surrealists.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.850
But, in fact, just about everything

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.390
that he did involved
questioning received wisdom.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:51.580
Certainly as a writer for children,
he came up with another way

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.760
of thinking about childhood
and approaching the business

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.270
of making a story for children

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.640
than had really been
seen before in print.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.300
That implied a different
understanding

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.230
of what children were really like.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:10.020
In other realms, he was one of the
very first amateur photographers,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.450
and one of the very best.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:17.520
And, by all indications,
he was someone

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:23.470
who challenged his own
father's sense of what it meant

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.930
to be a religious person.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.850
His father was an archdeacon
in the Church of England.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.600
He trained to -- to be and
became a deacon of the church.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.850
But, unlike his father he
thought that theater was --

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:42.120
that the stage was as good a
place for truth to be spoken

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.330
as the pulpit, whereas many of
the more orthodox Christians

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.340
like his own father
rejected theater out of hand.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.970
So, he was constantly
rethinking what he'd been taught,

00:12:54.970 --> 00:13:02.020
and that in some ways is the
message if -- of "Alice" itself.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.420
This is a book, very, very
well-known book in England

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.220
with which the young Lewis
Carroll, who's real name

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.040
of course was Charles Dodson,
would have grown up with.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.930
It was a book that was meant to
guide children to be industrious,

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.170
hard-working, well-behaved.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:26.500
This is the most famous rhyme
from that book, and those of you

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.510
who aren't familiar with the rhyme
but find that it sounds familiar,

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.790
it's because it's one of the poems

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.810
that Lewis Carroll
parodied in "Alice".

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:41.510
These of course are
emblematic of industry.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:48.530
Lewis Carroll was the third of
11 children, the oldest son,

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:53.010
and he relished the role
of older brother while he

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.270
and his siblings were growing up.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.410
He did magic shows for them.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.830
He dressed up with a turban.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:08.070 position:56%
He had a little puppet theater where
he was the impresario of shows.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.360 position:56%
And, he wrote poems and made funny
drawings like the one you're looking

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.330
at right now to be
published in quotes,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.050
in a magazine that only
circulated within the family.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:24.790 position:56%
So, he was in fact very industrious,
but in ways that were very different

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:29.770
from the ones that Isaac Watts
had, you know, advocated.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:34.910
Here is a rhyme from one of
those family magazine poems.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.500
Let me read to you.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.640
This is not complete,
but you'll get the gist.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.220
"I have a fairy by my side,
which says I must not sleep.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.990
When once in pain I loudly cried,
it said, 'You must not weep.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.280 position:56%
If, full of mirth, I smile and grin,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.550
it says, 'You must not laugh.'

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:58.580 position:56%
When once I wished to drink some gin
it said, 'You must not quaff.'" And,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.220
it goes on, and then
it ends with a moral,

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.930
as all good children's
book were meant to do.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.140
His moral is, you mustn't.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.100
So, he was, as a 13 year
old, which is how old he was

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:17.190 position:56%
when he wrote this, he was already
engaged in parody in a particular --

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:24.150
poking fun and taking symbols and
people of authority down a notch.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.920
He was showing a great deal
of independence of mind.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.040
And, he was urging that on his
younger brothers and sisters.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:37.470
He grew up to become an admirer
of the poetry of William Blake.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:44.250
And, Blake, of course, had a vision
of childhood which lifted the child

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.230
to the level of a --
a spiritual seer.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:51.290
Blake claimed that as a four year
old, an angel had appeared to him

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.260
in the window of the home
where he was growing up.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.730
He thought that children
had a more direct contact

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:01.130
with the spiritual
realm than adults did.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:05.580
And, as the kind of founder --
founding figure of Romanticism,

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:11.090 position:56%
he planted that notion that children
are closer to essential reality

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:15.600
than the adult -- adults are, and
that adults kind of lose contact

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.860
with that sort of knowledge by
-- by living a conventional life.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.220
This is something that Blake said

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.570
that I think Lewis Carroll
could well identify with.

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.550
"The doors of perception
were cleansed.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.660
Everything would appear
to man as it is, infinite,

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.140
for man has closed himself
up till he sees all things

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:42.280
through narrow chinks
of his cavern."

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:48.200
When Lewis Carroll was a child, he
was born in 1832, this is a book

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.060
that he might well have known.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.380 position:56%
We don't know if he had a copy then,
but he owned a copy as an adult.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.110
And, he gave this particular copy,

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.690
which is at the Rosinback
Library, to a child friend.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.530
Struwwelpeter, German book,

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.100
sort of swept through
Europe and North America.

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.700
It became a very, very well-known
children's nook in the 1840s.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.360 position:56%
It was a parody of cautionary tales.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:15.290
It was meant to allow the child
and the parent to laugh together,

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:19.420
rather than for the parent to
feel that he was lording it

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.470 position:56%
over the child in -- in
instructing the child how to behave.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.350
This book appeared the
following year in England,

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.380
Edward Leer's "The Book of
Nonsense", in the same new,

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:36.240
playful spirit that Lewis
Carroll developed even further

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.820
in "Alice" 20 years later.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.830
And, this is the parody of
the poem from Isaac Watts.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.660
"How doth the little crocodile
improve his shining tail,

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.700
and poured the waters of the
Nile in every golden scale.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.430
How cheerfully he seems to grim.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:57.820
How neatly spreads his claws,
and welcomes little fishes

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.030
in with gently smiling jaws."

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.510
Well, nothing very sweet
about that, you know?

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:09.770
And, Alice the character is always
moving away from her good behavior,

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:13.270
the sort of Isaac Watts
version of herself that you meet

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.620
at the very beginning of the story
towards someone who's a lot more

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.810
curious, more daring, not as nice.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.380
But, more real.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:29.270
Industrial Revolution was part of
the big change that was happening

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.970
that made the Romantics
feel they had to respond.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.430
People were living in terms of
-- thinking in terms of science

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.990
and logic and losing
touch with the spiritual

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.940
or the sense of wonder in life.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.160
Wordsworth, of course, wrote
about this in this poem.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:54.150
And, here in this very famous poem,
he resorted to lyricism in a sort

00:18:54.150 --> 00:19:00.140
of ecstatic vein, hoping
to connect with people,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.300
to get them to reconnect
themselves with the --

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.570 position:56%
the unseen and the wondrous in life.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:11.290
He thought that poetry
could do that.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:16.090
The Surrealists, when they came
around a hundred years later,

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.390
would feel that lyricism
wasn't enough,

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.500
and decided they needed
shock tactics.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:27.610
And, surrealism really is all
about a jolt to the system in order

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.590
to get people to break out of
their conventional way of thinking

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.700
about things, in order to have a --

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.460
to be put back in contact
with the sense of the unknown

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.400
and the sense of the wondrous.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.790
This really is the visual
counterpart of Wordsworth's poem.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:52.000
Hans Christian Anderson was
another figure we know of by name

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.920
from this time, and
Anderson was writing

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.560
as a modern man wonder tales.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.340
And, he was trying to figure
out how you could make a place

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.810
for the wonderful in literature
-- literature of the modern age.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:11.000
And, so he thought perhaps
the way to think about it is

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.100
that wonder exists but most
of us just don't notice it.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.100
And, maybe it's just the children
who are a little bit more wide-eye,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.510
as Blake had said, who are
more likely to notice the --

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:25.970
the little creature
living in the flower cup.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:30.140
And, maybe it's the child who,
being more wide-eyed and honest

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.350
with himself, is the one
who's most likely to see

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.090
that the emperor has no clothes.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:41.040
And, the emperor is
naked is not so far

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.090
from you're nothing
but a pack of cards.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:49.380
And, in "Alice" Lewis Carroll
really undermines almost every kind

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.180
of authority that a
child was likely to know.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.270
The authority of adults, the
authority of judges and jurors,

00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:00.970
the authority of kings and
queens, the authority of logic

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:04.430
and language itself as
words slip in and out

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:09.050
of their conventional meanings.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:13.530
We don't know exactly
what Lewis Carroll thought

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.380
about Charles Darwin, whose "Origin

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.030
of Species" appeared six years
before "Alice" did in England.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.330
But, we know that he owned
19 books by or about Darwin.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.090
So, he must have been interested.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.880
And, if you think of the fish
footmen and other characters

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.320
that he created and the
portmontowards [phonetic],

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.090
which are amalgams of
two different words.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.740
Or, the puns that he
used where one word seems

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:41.540
to mean opposite things
or unrelated things.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.650
And -- or the scene where the baby
turns into a pig all of a sudden.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:49.740
You see that Lewis Carroll
was fascinated by the prospect

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:55.000
of transformation in
the world, and of the --

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.270
the transient nature
of the material world.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.110
Lewis Carroll was a devout
Christian, and Darwin did nothing

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.000
to destroy is faith in God.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.710
But, he nonetheless seems to
have been fascinated with this,

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.990
and at the very least
thought of natural selection

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.580
as ripe material for
parody and humor.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:25.150
And, certainly some of that
finds its way into "Alice", too.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:31.490
He was also a reader of the
new literary genre of fantasy.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:36.380
And, George MacDonald was a
friend, in a way a mentor of his,

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.070
it was MacDonald and his
children who read the

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:43.120
"Alice" manuscript before
it was even being considered

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.600 position:56%
for publication and who urged him to
think about turning it into a book.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.010
And, of course, fantasy is also
a kind of story which departs

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:57.840
from reality as described
biblical -- in biblical terms,

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.070
but which in a sense puts
the author in the position

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.160
of being a subcreator, a little god

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.520
who is inventing an
alternate universe,

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.740
which is kind of what
Carroll does in "Alice".

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:15.610
As I mentioned before, he was very
open to the theater as another kind

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.620
of arena of transformation.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.910
This was a photograph
taken by Lewis Carroll

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:26.270
of the most famous stage
actress of his day, Ellen Terry,

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.580
with whom he became a friend.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:35.430
And, when Lewis Carroll years
later had occasion to write

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:40.680
about the making of "Alice", he
described the scene on the river

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.350
in these terms, as a kind of --

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.390
time of reverie for
him and improvisation.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:52.860
Surrealists would look back
at this as an indication

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:57.420
that Lewis Carroll tapped --
had tapped into his unconscious

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:02.000
and that he was doing it in the
way that they aimed to do as well,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.860
to see what would come
to the surface

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.600
without exercising any
sort of rational control.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.730
Lewis Carroll is sometimes
thought of as an odd-ball recluse,

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.350
but actually he was
a very social being.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:22.020
He frequently took the train
from Oxford to London to go

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.020
to the theater and to
visit art galleries

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.370
and to visit his artist friends.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.170
He was close to many of the members

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.770
of the Pre-Raphaelites
painter's group,

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.980
and was very familiar
with their work.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.190 position:56%
This is a painting that we know
that he admired, and it's a painting

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:44.560
about a family who are listening
to music and being transported

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.590
to a kind of dream-like state.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:52.170
So, it's very much in line with
the quote I just showed you

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:55.730
of how Lewis Carroll
said that he had come --

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:59.550
come to making up the story
about Alice in the first place.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:03.290
This is another painting that
we know that he liked very much.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:08.560
The girl there at first glance
might seem to be the embodiment

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.480
of innocence, but at second glance,

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.450
she clearly has something
on her mind.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:18.850
This is a thoughtful,
wide-eyed, deeply aware person.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.980
And, this image of childhood is the
one that interested Lewis Carroll,

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.200
and that he carried over
when he made the manuscript

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.180
that John was talking
about a moment ago,

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.400
"Alice's Adventures Underground",

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.980
the precursor to the
Wonderland book.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.870
He had seen this painting
just probably weeks

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.180
or months before he
drew this picture.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:50.080
And, there is how it
looks within the book.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.050
Lewis Carroll was a perfectionist,
and when he was persuaded

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:59.380 position:56%
to publish the book, he decided that
what he had done as a one-off gift

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.660
to a child friend wasn't
good enough.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.820
So, he set about rewriting
and expanding the manuscript

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.670
and also engaging the best
illustrator that he could find,

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.460
and that was John Tenniel,

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:18.100
who was the lead cartoonist
for Hunch Magazine.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.260
Now, if you look closely at
this image, you'll see --

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.490
you'll recognize one
of the characters

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.650
in it, to the left of the line.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:30.110
That is the very first appearance
in print of the character

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:36.750 position:56%
that we have come to call Alice,
thought his image was done before --

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:41.360
just about a year before the
Alice book was published.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.810
And, probably before Tenniel
knew that this was going

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:49.680
to be his representation of
the heroine of the story.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.470
So, it seems that he had a
kind of back-log of characters

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.870
that he could use, and he
happened to plug Alice --

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:01.060
the Alice one into this
image, which is of --

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.790
was created for a story
about the America Civil War.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:08.010
Notice, this is 1864.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:15.250
So, there's Tenniel, and this
image is a very good representation

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:21.160 position:56%
of his ability to embrace the
strangeness of the Wonderland story,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.770
but with a sense of humor
so that you don't feel

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.890
that the discordant elements,

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:31.030
like the frog which is
also part human are --

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.900
are primarily disturbing.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.120
They're more funny than otherwise,

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:40.070
whereas one of Tenniel's
inspirations, JJ Grandfield,

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.720
French satirist from
20 years earlier,

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:48.910 position:56%
clearly had darker ambitions in
terms of the tone that he was trying

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:55.990
to set as he called out
the animal nature of --

00:27:55.990 --> 00:28:00.450
on people of pretense
in polite society.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:06.930
And, here, flashing forward for a
moment, Max Ernst, clearly looking

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.630
at Grandfield and probably
Tenniel, too,

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:19.120
used some of the same techniques
to disturb and question reality.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:26.000
Lewis Carroll, as I mentioned,
was a fine portrait photographer.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.150
This is a photograph that he took

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:31.070
of Alice a few years before
the time of the story.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:36.130
It's a penetrating image and
probably one of this very best,

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:39.460
and it shows that Carroll was

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:44.280
in a sense a psychologist,
more than a moralist.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.890
And, in fact, you could say that
whereas children's literature

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:52.140
up until that time had been
about building character,

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:57.970
Lewis Carroll was more about
developing characters and showing

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:03.240
that within a given self, a
given individual there are --

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:09.130
this is a kind of rouge's gallery
of characters all competing to be

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.950
at the center of the stage.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:17.220
This Alice clearly has
a deep emotional life,

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.300 position:56%
and I think this photograph,
perhaps more than any other he took,

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.390
shows that he was a kind of
forerunner for the things

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:29.070
that Freud would write about
just a few decades later.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:33.760
Freud, of course, became a major
influence on the Surrealists

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:39.040
because Freud was writing and
giving names to unconscious states

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.460
that the Surrealists felt were
the part of human experience

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.900
that most people were
not in touch with,

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:50.420
were denying if they
even knew they existed.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:56.050
And, Freud's interest in dreams
became a kind of inspiration

00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:01.060
for the Surrealist to -- to pay
more attention to their own dreams

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.970
and to try to tap into
them for artistic purposes.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:09.800
World War One was also an
enormously disruptive influence

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.920
that had a great impact on
the artists that became known

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:19.390
as the Surrealists, because all the
old empires were coming to pieces.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:25.200
And, it seemed that it was time
for an art that did not aspire

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.020
to a grand synthesis,
but rather one that aimed

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:35.930
at breaking people's
certainties into bits.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.820
That's, I think, the
reason that collage became

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:43.870
such an important art medium in
the years after World War One.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:48.810
And, it's also -- it also gave
the Surrealist a kind of roadmap

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:54.850
for taking images and putting them
together in ways that didn't seem

00:30:54.850 --> 00:31:02.460 position:56%
to belong and for -- for that reason
provoking the kind of puzzled,

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.980
short-circuited response
in people's rational mind

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.490
that they were really aiming for.

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:13.860
This is Andre Breton, who
was kind of the ringleader

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.430
of the Surrealists
and the theoretician.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:19.930
He wrote the two Surrealist
manifestos,

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:24.050
and this is a very interesting
quote because like Lewis Carroll

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:31.360 position:56%
and like the Romantics, he looked to
children as having a better purchase

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.930
on truth than the adult world did.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.610
I'll read this.

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:39.190
"The mind which plunges
into surrealism relives

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:42.340
with glowing excitement
the best part of childhood.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.430 position:56%
From childhood memories and from a
few others, there emanates a feeling

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:50.650
of being unintegrated, then
later of having gone astray,

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.590
which I hold as the most
fertile that exists.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.450
It is perhaps childhood that
comes closest to one's real self."

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.960
If you think about Alice
falling down the rabbit hole,

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.230
everything that she thinks
she knows falls away from her,

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:08.540
her school learning, her good
manners, she curtsies as she falls

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.700
down the hole, but it
doesn't do her any good.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.580
Language, do cats eat
bats or do bats eat cats.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:22.370 position:56%
Suddenly words untethered to reality
become interchangeable she mentions

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:25.030
her cat, you know, her
friend, her companion,

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:28.260
but where is -- where is Dinah.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.440
It was that -- that is
what Breton means, I think,

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:37.660
when he talks about childhood and
the lack of things coming together,

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.410
which in a sense is more real.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:44.550
It's -- it's the opposite of
putting out arbitrary barriers

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:48.770
that make the world seem
reasonable even if at the price

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.930
of falsifying the reality.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:57.540
So, the Surrealists came up
with some very interesting ways

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:03.120
of jolting people back
to that sense of sort

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.870
of a truthful disconnectedness.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:11.680
We sort of take for granted that
words and the images we associate

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.010
with them are -- are one.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:16.890
But, really they aren't
and this painting is meant

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:20.830
to make you rethink everything
you know about language

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:24.180
and the material world and
how they relate to each other

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:29.920
and if nothing else to show that
it's imperfect connection at best.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:35.790
The Surrealists were very
expressive about their ideas

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:41.560 position:56%
and in the 1930s Andre Breton listed
out some of the artists and writers

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.240
that he considered his precursors.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.120
And, as you read down the list
you find a somewhat puzzling list

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.320
and -- and for various reasons.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:54.710
You find Lewis Carroll
among his forbearers.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:34:02.240
The 1930s was a big time
for Lewis Carroll's legacy.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:06.290
In 1932, the hundredth
anniversary of its birth,

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:08.290
there were almost no celebrations.

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:09.590
It's interesting.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:13.070
People had forgotten
about him more or less.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.050
A few years later, an effort
was made to change that.

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:19.650
The Complete Works of Lewis
Carroll were published in England

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.340
and then in the US in 1936.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.970
And, there were major
exhibitions in England, France,

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:30.580
and the US of Surrealism, all
of which made some reference

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:35.030
to Lewis Carroll as
having been an inspiration.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.820
This is the poster from
the British exhibition.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:42.800
And, this is the one from New
York's Museum of Modern Art,

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.220
which this drawing from
"Alice's Adventures

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:49.900
in Underground" was
exhibited, and which appears

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.220
to have influenced
Max Ernst, I think,

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.860
when he came to make
drawings inspired

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.800
by Lewis Carroll a
number of years later.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:05.920
Probably the artist who was closest
you might say to Lewis Carroll,

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.030
and in some ways the closest
to being an illustrator

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:11.400
of Lewis Carroll was Rene Magritte.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:17.190
And, I thought it would be fun to
show you how one can actually think

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:20.790
of Rene Magritte as having
illustrated Alice, whether

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.880 position:56%
or not he was trying to consciously.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:30.690 position:56%
It would be very surreal of him to
have done it unconsciously, in fact.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:35.230
So, here's one of my favorite
Magritte paintings and it calls

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:40.820
to mind an essay, or actually kind
of math puzzle, mind experiment

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:45.950
that Lewis Carroll wrote having
to do with the time zones.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:50.720
And, Lewis Carroll was actually
partly responsible for the creation

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.820
of the International Dateline,
because he began to think

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:58.800
about the consequences of
having different time zones

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.630
around the globe and how at a
certain point, it becomes yesterday

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.410
and today at the same
-- in the same place.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.250
And, how do you make sense of that?

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:11.220 position:56%
And, it was -- creating an arbitrary
line like that which became the way

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:16.110
for the world to -- to make some
sense, some imperfect sense.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.240
His essay was called
"Where Does the Day Begin?"

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.800
This is the scene where
Alice is growing

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.600
and growing inside of
the lizard's house.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.740
It seems very much to have
been in the background

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.140
of this painting by Magritte.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.910
And, here's the passage.

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:37.420
"Still, she kept on growing.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:41.280
As a last resource, she put
one arm out of the window,

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.780
one foot up the chimney, and said
to herself, 'Now, I can do no more.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:52.930
Whatever happens, what will become
of me?'" Here's Alice puzzling

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:59.160
over this bottle wondering
whether to believe the tag or not.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:03.370
Think of that painting
of Magritte's pipe.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.140
[Inaudible] it's colored
because this comes

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.090
from a later abridged edition
done for younger children

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:10.200
in the nursery [inaudible].

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:15.080
And, here again, Magritte
is playing games with words

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.420
and images associated with them.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.540
You know, for the bowler
hat for instance,

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.980
the caption in French means snow.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:28.830
So, he's saying -- but
in a sense, you know,

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:32.970
the words that he chose are just
as good as labels for those objects

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.710
as the ones that we
conventionally would apply to them,

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.510
which is part of his point.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:39.830
The arbitrary nature
of the relationship

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.930
between language and reality.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.580
It's very well to say drink me,

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.950
but the wise little Alice was
not going to do that in a hurry.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:50.520
No, I'll look first, she said

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.950
and she whether it's
marked poison or not.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.050
Smart child.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:38:01.780
Here is the caterpillar, the
kind of implacable wise man.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:08.890
And, here is Magritte
looking through you.

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:10.870
Who are you?

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:15.040
And, here is Alice holding a pig

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.810
that had only moments before
had been a human baby,

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.130
and she's puzzling
over what happened.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:26.120
This is [inaudible], not Magritte,

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:29.980
but who wasn't really a
Surrealist but he was pretty close.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:32.970
"The baby grunted again.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.110
This time there could
be no mistake about it.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.440
It was neither more
nor less than a pig.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.250
She began thinking over
other children she knew

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:42.070
who might do very well as pigs.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.390
She was just saying to herself,

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:48.910
if one only knew the
right way to change them."

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.990
What a wicked sense of humor.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:52.290
Which way?

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.220
Which way?

00:38:54.220 --> 00:39:02.470
And, here the famous Mad Tea Party
scene, tea parties being occasions

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:08.090
of domesticity genteel
social behavior.

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:12.900
And, this Surrealist object by
Meret Oppenheim from the 1930s,

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:17.440
where tea cup and what goes
with it has been transformed

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:23.040 position:56%
into a feral object, something
wild, meant to be shocking and meant

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:27.870
to kind of knock you off your
pedestal of social certainty.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.550
And, the Cheshire Cat.

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:43.650
"Well, I've often seen a cat
without a grin, thought Alice.

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:47.840
But a grin without a cat, it's
the most curious thing I ever saw

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.000
in all my life."

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.230
A number of the Surrealists
took a shot

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:57.920 position:56%
at at least making one-off paintings
inspired directly by "Alice".

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:06.530 position:56%
I think they were by and large
self-consciously eroticized versions

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:11.020
of what they kind of perhaps
felt superior to when they --

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.260
to the extent that they looked
at it as a children's book.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.520
So, I think, like this
painting for instance,

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.280
I just don't find all
that convincing.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:24.890
Maybe this one's a little bit
better by Dorothy Tanning.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:30.440
And, this by -- when Rene Magritte
actually tried to illustrate Alice,

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:36.530
I think that's when he
didn't quite pull it off.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.510
Salvador Dali did his
own addition, though,

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.790
and I've been looking at it lately.

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:44.410
And, the more I look at it
the more I -- I like it.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:48.860
It's very different from the art by
him that we're more familiar with,

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.140
the hyper-realistic paintings
where perspectives are distorted

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:58.130
and certain images are called
up as compelling symbols

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:02.250
like melting watches for example.

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.450
It's much more Impressionistic,
but it --

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:10.040
the images exist on many levels,
and it has almost the quality

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:14.230
of a dream image that
you're able to peer into.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:17.590
And, I think that's what
he was probably aiming for.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:21.420
This is the title page,
and this girl --

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:27.450
woman with the jump rope becomes
his Alice in the kind of motif

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:32.080
that reappears everywhere
in unexpected places.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.820
This is a -- is a painting
that he would have known

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:39.870
and clearly was affected
by, by de Chirico.

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:44.140
And, here's a painting
by Dali in which you see

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:49.980
that figure appearing way --
long before he illustrated Alice.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:53.990
But, here -- and here
is a picture from --

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:57.830
from his book, from,
I think it's 1969.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:02.330
The more you look at
this, the more you see,

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.350
and it's not just one reality.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:09.860
There are many layers that
have been brought together

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.160
in a way that only dreams can do.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:21.600
And, finally, this sculpture
from Mexico City based

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.840
on the poem parody of Isaac Watts.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.640
So, thank you very much.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:36.250
[ Applause ]

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:39.630 position:56%
So, we have time for some questions.

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:41.040
We have ten minutes,
if anybody would

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.180
like to ask one, or make a comment.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.490
Yeah. Yes?

00:42:46.490 --> 00:43:03.030
&gt;&gt; I'm interested in your thoughts
on the intersection between fantasy

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:14.010
and surreal, because you've
shown us a bit of both.

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:19.510
But, I'm interested in that notion
of representation and the --

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:24.780
the idea of fantasy, which I
think Carroll was interested in

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:29.510
and this idea of something
that's beyond that maybe tapping

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:32.500
into the unconscious mind.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.790
Just interested in how you see
the difference [inaudible].

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:40.570
&gt;&gt; You -- you're interested
in the difference

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:44.850
between fantasy and Surrealism?

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:50.290
Well, I think fantasy -- I mean
the Surrealists were interested

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:55.570
in dreams and I think they thought
of dreams as a productive fantasy

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:57.510
that is generated by
the human unconscious.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:01.270
So, I'm not sure that they would
have tried to make a distinction

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:06.840
so much as to see dream life as
a subset of fantasy, I suppose.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.370
Yeah. I mean, the Surrealists
were interested in --

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:12.050
in operating with as little control

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:15.870
over their artistic
process as possible.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.930
So -- so I suppose you could
make a distinction because,

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:23.100
like JRR Tolkien talked
about writing fantasy

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:28.160
as being a subcreator as -- as
stepping into the role of a god.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.570
So, now, as I -- I'm sort
of thinking as I speak,

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:33.890
and it seems to me that you
could make the case that fantasy

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:38.370
and Surrealism were opposed
to each other in that sense.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:42.700
You know, to the extent that
the Surrealist really wanted

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:46.100 position:56%
to cede control and that that was
essential to what they saw as the --

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.830
the way to getting at
sort of the deepest truth.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:50.130
And, that would the
opposite of someone

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:51.430
who builds an alternate universe.

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:52.730
Yeah.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.030
&gt;&gt; I had a quick question
about the [inaudible].

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:55.330
I'm over here.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:56.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: You're over here.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:57.930
Okay. Yeah.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.230
&gt;&gt; About Carroll, I know your
focus was on the Surrealists,

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.530
but you kind of zoomed passed
the futurists, and I was curious,

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:01.830
do your thoughts about the
connection with playing

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:03.130
with the actually depiction
of language and words,

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.430
and any other connections
and impressions

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:05.730
that -- with the futurists.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.030
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: I
-- I -- you know, I --

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:08.410
I don't know as much
about the futurists.

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:09.710
I mean, I know -- I know something.

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.900
But, sounds like perhaps you want
what [inaudible] say something

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.240
about that though.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:19.320
&gt;&gt; I've forgotten the
technical term for when you --

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.230
when you depict a language moving.

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:26.440 position:56%
Like, Carroll perhaps was one of the
first ones to use that in his work.

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.500
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: In the way of
concrete poetry where with the --

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.530
the image of the tail
in the shape of the-- .

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:32.830
&gt;&gt; -- Yes.

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:35.630
And, that was something that the
futurists enjoyed and I wondered

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:39.570
if there were other types
of connections with Carroll

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.280
and possibly the futurists.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.110
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Offhand,
I -- I just don't know.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.410
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:45.710
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Yeah.

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:48.750
So, yes, sir?

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:55.610
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] kind of
subgenre, books, fiction,

00:45:55.610 --> 00:46:05.150
works of art in all forms about
Alice, and a [inaudible] of tones

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:10.540
and from the innocent to the
horrific, especially it seems

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:13.380
in the -- lately by women authors.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.070
And, they're more fascinated
by Alice.

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:21.910
And, I was wondering why Alice
has become such a fertile source

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:25.950
of inspiration for these
writers and artists.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:30.020
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, I think there's
something every basically true

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:33.880
about his representation of her.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:40.230
You see, too, in a way two opposing
aspects of a developing human.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:45.350
You see the social self, the one
who has learned certain lessons

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.770
about how to behave among other
people at the very beginning.

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.750
And, then she falls
down the rabbit hole

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:55.050 position:56%
where it all becomes irrelevant, and
she's suddenly put in the position

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:59.410
of really any -- you know,
hero in the classic sense.

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:01.880
Somebody who's completely
on their own

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:07.000
in an unknown, uncharted situation.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:13.040
So, I mean, her -- her quest, it
is a quest in a way, you know.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:16.870
Like, Ulysses, it's --
there's something very --

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:21.830
there's a core reality to -- to the
experience that she goes through

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:26.270
and it's a beautiful way of
describing the experience

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:28.850
of childhood and growing
up and just being human.

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:31.750
You know, we talk about growing up.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:35.940
Alice grows up, down, this
way, that way, and really her,

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:42.360
you know multidirectional fits and
starts experience is much truer

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.840
to what anybody who's being honest
with themselves would report

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:51.760
as the true nature of, you know,
living and learning in this world.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:59.200
So, and, I mean, we're -- we're
always being put upon by people

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.540
who think they know
better than we are,

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.280
and that happens to
Alice all the time.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:09.320 position:56%
And, she has to cope with situations
where the consequences are serious

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.860
and the choices are unclear.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:15.210
You know, should she drink from
that bottle or shouldn't she?

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:21.600 position:56%
People she has been taught to
expect good things from turn out not

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:26.690
to be helpful or wise
or even friendly.

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:33.710
So, there's so much reality in
this apparent nonsense, you know.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.570
The nonsense just becomes a way

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:41.780
of in a sense making it
bearable and interesting.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.440
It's -- it's a deeply
realistic book, I think.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.270
So, yeah?

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:50.460
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] as you're talking

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:55.190
that her process really
is the process of science.

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:57.810
And, there's a reason
-- there's a reason

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:02.680 position:56%
that Martin Gardener was a
mathematician did an annotated book.

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:06.450
And -- but I wonder if you know,
and I haven't looked at that

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:09.190
because it didn't connect,
but the OSS Science

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:12.860
and Engineering Festival happens
to be meeting in town this weekend.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.880
And, you know, with all of the
talk about STEM this and STEM

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:21.170
that for education, Alice
is the perfect embodiment

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:26.460
of the scientific process and
kind of a mental way into people

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:31.840
who immediately tune out when
you say the word science.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:37.650 position:56%
And, I'm wondering whether there's
been any connection made in that way

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:42.270
to -- to try to use Alice,
particularly for children.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:45.740
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, there's a book
called "Alice in Numberland",

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:49.950
you know, where the
mathematical ideas that-- .

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:53.100
&gt;&gt; But, beyond math, sort of as
you're talking about, you know,

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.890
the fits and starts, that's
what research and sort

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.190
of discover is all about.

00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:59.490
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: I see.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:00.790
I see. Yeah.

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:02.090
&gt;&gt; You know, maintaining the
child mind of curiosity-- .

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:03.390
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: -- I see.

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:04.690
Yeah-- .

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:05.990
&gt;&gt; -- To make discoveries.

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:07.290
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:08.660 position:56%
So much has been written about
Alice that I would be willing to bet

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.130 position:56%
that someone has written about that.

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:14.420
But -- but I mean, he of
course was a scientist

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.980
as well as an artist himself.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:21.840
And, so he kind of brought
together within him different ideas

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.960
about truth, you know,
measuring truth

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.630
that were available in his time.

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:30.480
Yeah. No -- no, I think
you're right.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.150
Yeah. I -- I wish I could
have been, you know,

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:36.330
sat at one of his math classes.

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:37.880 position:56%
It might have been very interesting.

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.360
But, he spoke with a stutter and
I have a feeling he didn't feel

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.370
that comfortable in
front of an audience.

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:44.670
Yeah.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:49.970
&gt;&gt; Lewis has one of the very best
descriptions of weightlessness

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.880
as "Sylvia and Bruno",
with [inaduibnle].

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.180
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Okay.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:58.230
It was just said that in a
later book of his called "Sylvia

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:01.770
and Bruno", he gave -- Lewis
Carroll gave what is described

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:04.150
as the best description
of weightlessness.

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:05.450
Yeah. Yeah.

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:13.070
&gt;&gt; So, do you think that "Alice in
Wonderland" is a children's book?

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.930
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: I think the best
children's books are for everybody.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:19.390
So, that's a slightly
different -- I'm --

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:25.120
I'm sort of rewriting
your question in a sense.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:28.450
We -- we live in a less
literary time than he did.

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:33.410
The character Alice has studied
French at the age of seven,

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:36.370
and I think knows a little
bit of Latin as well.

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:39.030
You know, think how many
seven year old you know

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:40.340
about whom you could say that.

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.240
I mean, there would
be some of course.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:48.600
But, I think it's -- today,
it's a book that children

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:52.060
who are good readers are likely
to read at a slightly older age

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:56.060
than Victorian children would have.

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.360
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.710
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: You never know.

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:05.590
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Please, wait
until the microphone gets

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:06.890
to you, if you [inaudible].

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.190
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: All right.

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:10.970
The question is is "Alice" really
a children's book, and I'm saying

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:15.880
that it probably -- readers, young
readers today would be older --

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.910
somewhat older if you can make
a generalization than the ones

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:23.220
who read it when it was
new in Victorian England

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.800
because of the way the culture
and education have changed.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.780
And, also we're Americans,

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.790
and British English is not
exactly the same thing, either.

00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:35.630
But, I also think that it's as
much a book for some children

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.400
as it is a book for some adults.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:44.750
&gt;&gt; I'm -- would be interested in
your comments on Alice's sister --

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:50.570
Alice's sister who comforts her
when she's back above ground,

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:54.250
but dismisses her experience
I think.

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:57.760
Do you -- do you have
a take on that?

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.940
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: I never
sensed that about it.

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:04.460
To -- on what basis
do you think that?

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:09.000
What is it she say that -- I mean,
it's true that she's presented

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.340
as a little bit insensitive at
the beginning in that she's --

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.650
Alice is bored by the
book, you know,

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:18.290
that she offers her to look at.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:20.430
But, that's not at all surprising.

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:24.960 position:56%
I mean, it just shows you that -- it
-- it's just setting the story up,

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.930
you know, for Alice to be
more on her own, and to be --

00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:34.150
to follow her own curiosity
and her own impulses, I think.

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:36.490
You know, and it's her saying
the boring adults, you know?

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:37.990
Children know more.

00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:42.310
It's -- it's really the Romantic
view of the child right there.

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:44.860
You know, she's reading some
boring book, doesn't have pictures,

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.160
doesn't have conversations.

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.460
What good is it?

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:53.680
&gt;&gt; Do you know anything about
the author of Mary Poppin's books

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.460
and whether she was
influenced by Lewis Carroll?

00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:00.340
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Yeah,
PL Travers, no doubt.

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:06.500
Yeah. "Alice" was enormously
popular and I think everybody

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:10.060
who was interested in children's
book as a reader let alone

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:13.600
as a writer would have
-- would have read it.

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:18.090
I mean, she -- PL Travers
was kind of a mystic.

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:22.430
I mean, she was interested
in mythology, too.

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:26.250
You know, so she had
other -- other influences.

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:31.360 position:56%
She saw Mary Poppins really as a
kind of supernatural goddess figure.

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:35.370
And, the Disney version
is really very different

00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:37.480
from what she had in mind.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:42.110
So, it's, you know, you can't
make a kind of -- it's the --

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:45.190
exactly the same world
that she's interested

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:46.610
in that Lewis Carroll
was interested.

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:50.570
But, certainly there was
an affinity I would think.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:51.870
Yeah, sir?

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:57.590
&gt;&gt; Talked a little bit about the
Realists and the Pre-Raphaelites,

00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:01.330
and you contrasted
that the Surrealists.

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:04.860
Wondering if you see some
similarities, either in terms

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.140
of what the message was
that they were trying

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.720
to convey or the artistic styles.

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:12.450
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Well, I mean,
the Pre-Raphaelites seem to be,

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.530
maybe they wouldn't have
said so, but they seemed

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:16.660
to have been interested
in the dream realm,

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:20.230
you know, in the spiritual realm.

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:22.420
And, you know, you could
certainly say the same thing

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:24.730
about some of the Surrealists, too.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:26.750
Yeah. Yes, I think so.

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:32.010
I mean, they weren't
interested in the Pre-Raphael --

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:34.700
Pre-Raphaelites were masters
of realistic technique,

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.700
but they weren't interested
in just painting things, like,

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.250
you know, fruit on the table.

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.520
They -- they were trying to
get in some spiritual essence

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.550
that lay beyond the visible.

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:48.020
And, to that extent, I mean,
they, the Surrealists were trying

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:52.070
to catapult people
out of the mundane.

00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:54.650
Yeah. Yes?

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:57.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yes, what are your -- right here.

00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:00.960
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Okay, yeah, it's
hard to -- it's impossible to tell.

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:07.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; What are your top three most
surreal aspects of the "Alice" book?

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.420
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Well, one
would be -- there's several, like,

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:15.940
fade-out, fade-ins that
connect some of the same things.

00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:19.440
You know, the way they --
there's a kind of dream logic

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.160
to the way the story unfolds.

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:24.290
So, that would be one of them.

00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:29.580
That's distracting.

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:30.880
Surreal.

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.790
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:34.610
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Yes, I know.

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:43.360
I know. I mean, the -- the
unreliability of language,

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.660
which comes up in the form of
puns which are misunderstood

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:50.480
and which sometimes redirect
the action in surprising ways

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:56.120 position:56%
with the queen, you know threatening
to decapitate people, for example.

00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:02.650
And, with all the misunderstanding
that arise as a result of that.

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:05.650
And, I think the fact
that Alice as --

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:09.710
is the character who turns
out to be the most knowing.

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:13.410
And, that conforms with
what Andre Breton had said

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:18.710
about the ideal state really
that Surrealism was aiming

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:23.970
to put its viewers or its
audience in was a state of-- .

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:34.280
-- A sort of -- of a more
fractured understanding

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.300
of the -- of the world.

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.980
I mean, I think he --

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:43.890
the Surrealists thought that
people had everything much too pat,

00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:45.190
you know?

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:47.160
And, he wanted to break it up,
they wanted to break it up for them

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:52.940
so they would see the fragmentary
and inconclusive nature of reality.

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:55.310
And, Alice -- that is
Alice's experience,

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:56.710
more than anybody else's.

00:57:56.710 --> 00:58:00.230
everybody else is pretty sure
of themselves in that book.

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:01.530
So, yeah.

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:03.220
&gt;&gt; John Cole: We have time
for two more questions.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.750
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: These are
good questions, by the way.

00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:07.050
I feel -- yeah?

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:09.670
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Let's
wait for the microphone.

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:10.970
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Yes.

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:12.270
Over here.

00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:13.570
Yep?

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:18.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I noticed, and I was just curious
whether it had occurred to you

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:23.010 position:56%
that a painting that you pointed out
of the little girl in bed, you know,

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:25.570
with the -- her head
cocked and the, you know?

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:26.870
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Yes.

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.170
Yep.

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:29.470
&gt;&gt; And, the shoulder showing.

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:30.770
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Yes.

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:32.200
&gt;&gt; And -- and then the
gypsy Alice, the photograph.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.500
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Right.

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:34.800
Right.

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.490
&gt;&gt; Is that -- do you
think that influenced him.

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:37.790
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Yes-- .

00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:39.090
&gt;&gt; -- Because it's such
a lovely parallel there.

00:58:39.090 --> 00:58:40.480
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Yes, absolutely.

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:45.020
&gt;&gt; And, almost like the way he
would see her in his mind's eye.

00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.320
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Right.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.620
Absolutely.

00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:51.900
I mean, when Lewis Carroll
saw a painting that he liked,

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:53.790
and that was the case
with the one that I showed

00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:57.560
with the family listening to music,
he brought those people together

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.060
and photographed them in that pose.

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:03.690
I mean, he was -- that's
how methodical he was

00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:09.220 position:56%
and how connected he felt or moved
he felt by certain images, you know?

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.520
So, absolutely.

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.590
Yeah.

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:16.560
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] take the photograph
and that was the painting

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.860
that you're referring to-- .

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:19.160
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: -- Right-- .

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.460
&gt;&gt; -- Was 1864.

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.760
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Right.

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.060
Well, in that particular example,
but in the example I just gave,

00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.450
he photographed it after
seeing the painting.

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:29.580 position:56%
So, it's -- what my point -- it's --

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:34.180
it's that this kind of
relationship interested him.

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.680
Right. I mean, it may be
coincidental in that case,

00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.870
but on the other hand there may
be other images that predate,

00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:45.280
which would be just the same.

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.320
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] painting copied
as a photo with Isa Bowman.

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:49.620
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Okay.

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:50.920
Yeah. Thank you.

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.590
One more, I think.

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:57.740
Or, have we come to the end.

00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.680
&gt;&gt; John Cole: There's
got to be one more.

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.980
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Right.

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:02.280
Make it -- make it a hard one.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.580
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Here we go.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.880
[Inaudible].

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.830
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: These
have been too easy.

01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:08.370
&gt;&gt; Excellent, excellent
talk, Leonard.

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:09.670
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Thank you, yeah.

01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:10.970
Thank you.

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:12.270
&gt;&gt; I don't really have a
question but just a comment

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:15.980
on the lady's question, the lady
who was sitting in front of me

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.640
but has disappeared
like the Cheshire Cat.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.980
She asked about the mouse's
tail and the kind of --

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:26.450
the concrete poetry [inaudible]
there is a technical term.

01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:30.790
It's called technopaegnia,
unstructured play, if you will,

01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:33.340
which sums up Carroll in a phrase.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.640
&gt;&gt; Leonard Marcus: Yes.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.940
Very good.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.240
Thank you.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.540
Yeah. Great.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.840
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, please join me

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.640
in thanking Leonard
for a wonderful talk.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:52.360
[ Applause ]

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.530 position:56%
Leonard, it was really excellent,
and it was a talk that stretched you

01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:59.380
and stretched the audience,
I think, a little bit.

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:04.450
And, just opened up the yet one
more layer of the world of Alice

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:07.530
and the various manuscripts.

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:10.570
You're going to now -- there
are two places we'd like you

01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:12.370
to go if you haven't been.

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:15.930
One would be upstairs, which I
referred to at the beginning.

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:19.110
It's in the Rare Book and
Special Collections Division

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:23.770
in the Rosenwald Room, and I'll be
happy to lead a group to upstairs

01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:26.350
to the back if you -- we
could just gather in --

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.710
in the foyer as we go out.

01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:31.990
But, also the other placed I'd
mentioned is the Young Readers

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:35.800
Center, which is in this building,
a completely different direction.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.210
You'll get a chance to follow
Kaheed is there and you can go

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:43.700
down a secret staircase
that's not quite secret,

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.210
but nonetheless a little surreal.

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:49.640
And, visit the Young Readers
Center where there are also,

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:54.730
I learned today, copies of books
with annotations from the Rare Book

01:01:54.730 --> 01:01:57.360
and Special Collections
Division upstairs.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.240
So, it's a nice example of pulling
out the collections that we have

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.950
and you'll see a wonderful
array and display

01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:10.360
of formats and content as well.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.350
But, thanks for joining us,
and another round of applause

01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:15.230
for Leonard Marcus
for a terrific job.

01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:17.440
[ Applause ]

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.100
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
