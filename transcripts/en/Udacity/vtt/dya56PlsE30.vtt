00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.760
So have a festival, what do I want to do with it?

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.170
&gt;&gt; Well, think about it. What are, what are the things in

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.230
a festival that you care about most? What do you want to track?

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.690
&gt;&gt; I want to know, I mean, I want to

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.920
know when the festival is. I want to know, I

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.240
want to know a lot of things. What it is,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.390
who's going, who, I mean, who's playing, tickets, everything.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.820
&gt;&gt; Great. Well, what we did now was created our festival object. And

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.150
so, that's going to be the overall thing that we store our data into.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.490
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.540
&gt;&gt; But then on that object, you can create fields,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.520
which are the characteristics about that object that we want to

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.770
track. So, the object being festival, those characteristics you named were.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.300
&gt;&gt; Like start date, and date, that kind of thing?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.790
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.000
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.800
&gt;&gt; So, in order to create those we can do that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.030
by going to this little tab on the right hand side.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.140
&gt;&gt; This little arrow guy?

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's our quick access menu to toggle between the

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.700
app, and the administrative set up. So, let's add some fields.
