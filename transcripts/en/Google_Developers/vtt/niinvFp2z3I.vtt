ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: Hi.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.700
I'm Adriana Cerundolo, program
manager for the global GDG

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.300
program.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.820
So GDGs are Google
Developer Groups.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.560
They're in-person meetups for
developers around the world

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.760
to learn about Google
Developer technologies.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.420
We have over 600 chapters in
over 100 countries globally.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.600
And these events, we
have over 7,200 of them

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.900
yearly, reaching over
35,000 participants.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.622
So this year, we have over
500 of them here at I/O.

00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:29.546
CROWD:[CHANTING] GDG!

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.849
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: So I have
a few GDG organizers here

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:46.890
with me, and we're going
to ask them what they're

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.100
going to bring back to I/O. Hi.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.716
So Gino, you're from a
GDG chapter in Nigeria.

00:00:54.716 --> 00:00:55.466
GINO OSAHON: Yeah.

00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.880
GDG, Port Harcourt, Nigeria.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.720
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: What kind of
events do you run in Nigeria?

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.820
GINO OSAHON: We
organize tech events.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.540
We organize user
experience events.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:13.317
We organize events to bring good
developers from Port Harcourt.

00:01:13.317 --> 00:01:14.650
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: That's great.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.530
And given the content
here at I/O this year,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.940
what are you hoping to
bring back to your community

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.930
and teach them?

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.800
GINO OSAHON: One of the
things I've learned here

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.380
is how to better
manage a community.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.460
So I'm going to back and see how
I can build a better community,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.660
work very well with
my co-organizers,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.330
get volunteers and other guys
that are interested in building

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.210
a good community,
and also introduce

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.110
good technologies that
could help developers

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.340
provide better solutions
to their clients over

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.354
in Port Harcourt.

00:01:51.354 --> 00:01:52.770
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO:
That's awesome.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.757
Thank you so much.

00:01:53.757 --> 00:01:54.715
GINO OSAHON: Thank you.

00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:57.048
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: I know we
have also another organizer

00:01:57.048 --> 00:01:58.780
from Nigeria here, Chinedu.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.150
Chinedu, talk to me
about what you're

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.160
hoping to bring back to
I/O, to your community

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.926
and any specific technologies
that you want to teach them.

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:07.300
CHINEDU CHUKWUELUE:
OK, it's been

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.750
a very beautiful experience
here out at the GDG summit.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.850
The day one and day
two was awesome.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.340
Day one we had CSI labs
and NVC communication.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.010
That has taught me how to
be a better organizer, how

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.560
to manage my team better,
how to see people better.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.460
On day two, we had
awesome breakout sessions,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.530
and I learned how to manage the
community, how to teach people,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.890
how to bring better
experiences to the community.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.750
So what I'm taking back
home is a whole lot.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.230
Because when I
get back home, I'm

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.140
going to make my chapter one
of the best in the GDG society.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.380
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: Thank you.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.102
And also Timea from GDG Vienna.

00:02:52.102 --> 00:02:54.770
What do you want to bring back
to your community from the I/O

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.905
content here today?

00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:56.780
TIMEA TURDEAN: Hello.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.060
I'm hoping to bring
back the enthusiasm

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.020
that I felt when the keynote was
on about all the new products

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.190
and technologies from
Google, especially

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.590
the Google Photos, which
I'm also very excited about,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.100
and the new Android
M, so super cool.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.680
And also to the
organizing team in Vienna,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.430
I'm hoping to bring
back very good examples

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.840
of how to improve our events,
like DevFest and Women

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.670
Techmakers.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.670
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: Nice.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.460
TIMEA TURDEAN: Thank you.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.020
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO:
So clearly if you

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.311
want to learn more about
Google Developer technologies,

00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:27.300
just go ahead and
find one near you.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.500
Woohoo!

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.384
