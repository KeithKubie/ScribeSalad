00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.420
After the Revolutionary War, George Washington
looked forward to a quiet retirement as a

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.770
gentleman farmer in Virginia.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.990
But this was not to be as he was repeatedly
called back to serve the needs of the new

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.000
nation he helped create.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.699
When he was called to serve as the United
States’ first president in 1789, Washington

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.980
said on April 16 of that year, “My love
of retirement is so great, that no earthly

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.780
consideration, short of a conviction of duty,
could have prevailed upon me to depart from

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.089
my resolution ‘never more to take any share
in transactions of a public nature.”

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.199
When his term was up, he was unanimously re-elected,
keeping him away from his home, Mount Vernon,

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:49.750
for another four years.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.800
As war was looming on the horizon in 1798,
Washington accepted command of American forces

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.000
once again, although this time around his
position was more ceremonial and advisory,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.040
rather than hands-on, due to his advanced
age.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.049
President Washington and his wife Martha finally
managed to make it to Virginia, where most

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.550
of their time was consumed with making the
long-neglected Mount Vernon solvent once more.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.800
The General took an active role in the running
of his plantation, overseeing the work of

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.840
the slaves (about 318 at this time working
at Mount Vernon) and other workers, and inspecting

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.190
his property.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.040
And he was doing just that on December 12,
1799 in a cold, miserable mixture of snow,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.090
sleet and rain on horseback for several hours.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.290
The following day, Washington didn’t feel
very well, stating he had a sore throat.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.070
But he still rode out during a heavy snowfall
to mark trees for cutting on his property.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.090
He was hoarse upon his return but made light
of it to his wife and secretary.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.110
When offered medicine he shrugged if off saying,
“You know I never take anything for a cold.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.800
Let it go as it came.”

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.740
(His wife had recently recovered from a cold,
so presumably he just thought he’d caught

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.740
the same.)

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.100
By the early morning hours of December 14,
1799, Washington was seriously ill.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.991
His breathing was significantly impaired,
so much so that he could barely speak, but

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:10.429
he would not allow his wife to seek help for
fear the night air would result in a return

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.670
of her own sickness.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.120
When their maid came to their room at sunrise,
she was sent to fetch Mr. Albin Rawlins, the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.959
estate overseer, who prepared a mixture of
butter, molasses and vinegar and helped the

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.269
General drink it.

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.590
The result was the opposite of what they’d
hoped.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.499
Instead of soothing his throat, attempting
to swallow the thick mixture nearly resulted

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:31.980
in him suffocating and sent him into convulsions.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.849
Next came that mainstay of medicine of the
time – bloodletting, of which General Washington

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.670
was a big fan.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.760
Mrs. Washington – not so much, so as her
husband was encouraging Rawlins to go for

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.569
the gusto, the Missus was telling him to dial
it back.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.540
Rawlins must have been very relieved when
doctors actually began showing up.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.370
Dr. James Craik, Washington’s personal physician
and friend, arrived and, seeing his friend

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.689
with an inflamed, swollen throat, bled him
once more.

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.260
At the time, it was thought that by removing
blood from the body, it could potentially

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.769
take down swelling and reduce inflammation.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.209
Dr. Craik also administered another oral medicine
comprised of vinegar and sage tea, and applied

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.540
a poultice to Washington’s neck (and later
elsewhere on his body) containing ground,

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.609
dried beetles.

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.400
These beetles contained a substance known
as cantharidin, which, when it comes in contact

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.169
with human skin, causes blisters to rapidly
form, again trying to balance out the fluids

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:29.359
in Washington’s body to reduce the inflammation
and swelling that was making it difficult

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.359
for him to breathe.

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.120
None of this worked.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.260
Another physician, Dr. Elisha Dick, arrived
at 3 p.m. and, seeing that Washington could

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.769
still barely breathe, it was decided that
they should risk bleeding the General once

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:41.769
more…

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.870
The last doctor to come, Dr. Gustavus Brown,
showed up shortly after, and all three agreed

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.199
to treat the patient rectally with calomel
and tartar.

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.959
(At least they didn’t blow smoke up his
backside, as was another common treatment

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.959
when people were suffering from breathing
issues, such as drowning victims.)

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.669
After a fourth and final bleeding and after
administering a substance to make Washington

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:09.849
vomit, with no positive affect, not surprisingly,
Washington had had enough.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.819
Having 32 ounces of blood removed over the
course of the day, induced blisters on various

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.950
places on his body, and lack of ability to
take in air, his life was slipping away anyway.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.500
He told the three physicians, “I feel myself
going.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.331
I thank you for your attentions but I pray
you take no more troubles about me.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.610
Let me go off quietly.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.349
I cannot last long.”

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.169
He had his wife bring him the two wills he
had made, which he read over and had one destroyed.

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.680
Among other things, he noted in his will that
all his slaves should be freed upon his wife’s

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.280
death and those who were too elderly or sick
to work should continue to be supported by

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.280
the estate.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.200
Further, those who were unable to acquire
an education on their own should be provided

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.520
with tutors to teach them reading, writing,
and some useful trade with which they could

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.990
then support themselves after being freed.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.830
A slave owner since the age of 11, Washington’s
views on slavery had changed radically over

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.180
the course of his lifetime, near the end of
his life noting in stark contrast to earlier

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.909
attitudes he had held,

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.419
The unfortunate condition of the persons,
whose labour in part I employed, has been

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.030
the only unavoidable subject of regret.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.629
To make the Adults among them as easy &amp; as
comfortable in their circumstances as their

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:21.400
actual state of ignorance &amp; improvidence would
admit; &amp; to lay a foundation to prepare the

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.349
rising generation for a destiny different
from that in which they were born; afforded

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.289
some satisfaction to my mind, &amp; could not
I hoped be displeasing to the justice of the

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:29.289
Creator.

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.349
He also instructed Tobias Lear to “arrange
and record all my late military letters and

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:34.349
papers.

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.690
Arrange my accounts and settle my books, as
you know more about them than any one else,

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.360
and let Mr. Rawlins finish recording my other
letters which he has begun.”

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.229
That done, he gave instructions on how he
wanted his body handled after his death.

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.430
Washington was a taphephobic (irrationally
terrified of being buried alive).

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.370
To avoid this, his specific instructions for
his body included “do not let my body be

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.300
put into the vault in less than three days
after I am dead.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.360
Do you understand?”

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.680
While today, the fear of being buried alive
is quite irrational in most parts of the world-

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.340
besides the more obvious ways we’re better
at telling, the widespread practice of embalming

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.819
guarantees the person is dead before burial-
in Washington’s time, it wasn’t necessarily

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.750
crazy to be afraid of this happening.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.710
For instance, in 1896, T.M.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.169
Montgomery, who was supervising the disinterment
of remains at the Fort Randall Cemetery, reported

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:29.960
that a little over 2% of those bodies exhumed
were definitely victims of being accidentally

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.960
buried alive.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.120
In other words, about 2% woke up, tried to
claw their way out, and were unable to do

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.199
so.

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:41.860
Given the oxygen supply in a coffin doesn’t
last that long, it is likely the actual percentage

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.150
of people buried alive was higher, when you
include the ones who didn’t wake, but were

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.240
still technically alive when buried.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.659
As another example, in the 17th century, William
Tebb compiled a list of 219 instances of narrow

00:06:54.659 --> 00:07:00.930
escape from premature burial; 149 cases of
actual premature burial; 10 cases in which

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.039
bodies were accidentally dissected before
death; and 2 cases in which embalming was

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:07.879
started on the still living.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:11.509
The reason the rate of being buried alive
was quite high around this time was primarily

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:16.630
due to the high number of people dying of
various diseases like cholera, smallpox, etc.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.949
These people tended to not get a close investigation
to make sure they were really dead, rather

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:25.270
than just unconscious, and they also tended
to be buried quickly to prevent the spread

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.770
of whatever disease they were thought to have
died from.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:33.220
In any event, Washington died at approximately
10 p.m. on Saturday, December 14, 1799 at

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.069
the age of 67.

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:39.160
When told that her husband was finally past
his pain, she said, “Is he gone?

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.160
‘Tis well.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.160
All is now over.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.310
I shall soon follow him.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.469
I have no more trials to pass through.”

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:49.650
So, beyond the doctors’ well-intentioned-but-more-harmful-than-good
“care,” what is thought to have killed

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:50.650
George Washington?

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.340
It’s believed today that President Washington
died of an inflamed epiglottis (the flap near

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.650
the base of the tongue that keeps food from
getting into your windpipe).

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.999
In extreme cases, swelling of the epiglottis
can block the airway sufficiently to cause

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:04.440
the person to suffocate.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.860
As to what caused the inflammation, this condition
is most often the result of a Haemophilus

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.009
influenzae type B or strep infection.

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:15.990
Whatever the underlying cause, the net result
was inability to get sufficient oxygen to

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.099
support the body.

00:08:17.099 --> 00:08:22.350
The massive blood loss he sustained in such
a short time may have also sent him into hypovolemic

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.139
shock, resulting in his heart being unable
to pump sufficient blood throughout the body.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:29.819
Combined with the lack of oxygen, this very
probably would have resulted in some of his

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:31.259
organs ceasing to function.

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:35.169
Interestingly, when it became apparent that
no safe amount of bloodletting was going to

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:39.900
reduce the swelling enough to allow Washington
to breathe normally, the second doctor, Elisha

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:45.310
Dick, suggested doing a radical new procedure
called a tracheotomy to open the airway to

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.700
allow Washington to breathe (something that
likely would have helped tremendously and

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.800
may have even saved his life in combination
with ceasing to bleed him anymore), but the

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.870
technique was so new (and the patient so illustrious
no doubt) that the other doctors argued against

00:08:53.870 --> 00:09:01.470
it and stuck to tried and true medical treatments
like bloodletting, inducing blisters via beetles,

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:10.260
and shoving stuff up people’s bums.
