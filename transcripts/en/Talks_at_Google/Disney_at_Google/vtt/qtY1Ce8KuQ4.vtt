DADO BANATAO: PhilDev is a
little bit of an anomaly,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:14.290
I would say, simply because we
took on the challenge of trying

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.360
to help the country,
the Philippines,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.480
develop itself economically.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.030
While there have been
so many foundations

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.930
started to help the
country, a lot of them

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.840
are humanitarian in
nature, or charitable.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.390
And that's OK.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.580
I mean, there is instantaneous
help to the needy.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.600
But we can tell
you, when we started

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.840
to do the research for
PhilDev we, right or wrong,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840
concluded that there
is not enough wealth

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.400
to affect the economy of
the country by doing that.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.530
So crazy people from
Silicon Valley, we said,

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.780
let's do something different
and see what happens.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.170
So the route of the theses,
or the strategic reason

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.950
for PhilDev is that-- and
again, this is further research.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.180
Talked to a couple
of Nobel laureates.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.960
Had dinner with them myself.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.000
And these are
economists that studied

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.500
the evolution of developed
countries after World War II.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.850
If you look at
Japan and Germany,

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.710
they were devastated
after World War II.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.350
How come immediately
after 20 years,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.610
Japan became the number
two economy in the world

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.640
after the US?

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.020
There was something there.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.120
And so they studied that.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.930
And so we adopted the
results of their study.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.370
And the one conclusion is
that a developing country

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.620
must have a global
economy if you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.680
want to be a developed country.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.650
Why is that?

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.270
Because in a developing
country, the economy size

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.540
is really, really small.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.690
The global economy, the size
of the economy of the world,

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.470
is infinity bigger.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.550
And if you think about it,
it's kind of intuitive,

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.650
that if all you do is
work within your economy,

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.389
only the rich get richer.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.170
Because they're the ones that
have the ability to invest.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.710
The poor stay there.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.650
That's one conclusion.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.520
Now how do you actually
tap the global economy?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.200
It's easier said than done.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.680
They also found
out that technology

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.310
is the key reason how one
can tap the global economy,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.960
through technology-based
products and services.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.680
EMILY NISHI: Thank
you so much, Dado.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.884
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:36.884 --> 00:02:38.050
EMILY NISHI: Very inspiring.

00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:43.110
I loved how you talked
about technology,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.840
and wanted to just extend a
huge welcome to you, Lea--

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.100
LEA SALONGA: Thank you.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.345
EMILY NISHI: --for being in
the heart of Silicon Valley.

00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:49.178
LEA SALONGA: I can't
believe I'm here.

00:02:49.178 --> 00:02:50.552
This is awesome.

00:02:50.552 --> 00:02:51.926
This is awesome for us.

00:02:51.926 --> 00:02:52.715
Yeah.

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:54.590
EMILY NISHI: So the
first question, actually,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.150
is I think everyone in this room
has grown up knowing about you,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.980
hearing about you, over the last
several years or decades, even,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.063
since you started your
career when you were seven.

00:03:03.063 --> 00:03:06.334
So you must have been working at
this for 10 years now at least.

00:03:06.334 --> 00:03:07.250
LEA SALONGA: Well, OK.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.800
Let's just leave it at that.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.050
EMILY NISHI: So this connection
that we have with you.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.730
We'd love to hear, what's your
connection with technology?

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.665
How do you use Google?

00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:16.380
Do you Google yourself?

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.900
Do you--

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.090
LEA SALONGA: Oh, God, no.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.890
No.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.140
No.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.470
I kind of stay away
from Googling myself.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.575
But then, there's so much
interesting content on YouTube,

00:03:26.575 --> 00:03:30.200
that you just can't
help but need to go in.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.090
And also, so many
videos from the TV

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.920
show that I just finished,
"The Voice of the Philippines,"

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.600
a lot of the
content from that TV

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.020
show is now
available on YouTube.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.150
So for people that have not
been able to see the show,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.650
if you're not subscribers
to TFC-- I mean,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.810
how many people would not
be subscribers to TFC?

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.268
I mean, if you're
Filipino, chances

00:03:52.268 --> 00:03:54.900
are you have TFC
in your house, just

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.795
to have a connection to home.

00:03:56.795 --> 00:03:59.170
But I mean, a lot of the
videos, a lot of the performance

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.370
videos, at the very
least, as well as

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.030
my very opinionated
comments on performances,

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.350
are available for anyone
in the world to access.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.190
And that's been
great, because I've

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.430
been able to then
use it as reference

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.269
for-- because the uploads are so
quick, to be able to look at it

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.630
and see what strategies to
adopt for the following week,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.130
and to see how the other teams
and the other competitors

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.010
are performing, and seeing
what we can do, and seeing,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.644
OK, that performance
was not so great.

00:04:32.644 --> 00:04:34.310
We need to improve
it for the next time.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.200
And so, I use it a lot for
research and information.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.930
And a lot of the
material that I've

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.940
been learning over the
last couple of weeks,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.769
Victor put everything
on an Excel spreadsheet.

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:48.310
And here's the YouTube link, so
that you can learn that song.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.800
And I'm like, all right.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.380
OK.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.030
There you go.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.970
Oh, OK.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.550
There we go.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.540
And so, YouTube
has actually been

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.540
helpful in that
regard for me as well.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.365
And I love playing
video games also.

00:05:01.365 --> 00:05:03.406
EMILY NISHI: I heard that
you're a bit of a geek.

00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:04.780
LEA SALONGA: I'm
a bit of-- yeah.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.712
EMILY NISHI: Tell
us more about that.

00:05:06.712 --> 00:05:07.420
LEA SALONGA: Yes.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.310
I have to put makeup on to hide
the dark circles under my eyes.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.030
I've spent many a
late night playing

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.680
a lot of console video games.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.090
And I mean, it's things like
"BioShock," "BioShock 2."

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.180
It's the "Assassin
Creed" series.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.160
And my favorite's "Assassin
Creed 2," only because

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.700
of the most charming
protagonist ever,

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.569
who is Ezio Auditore, if
anybody knows who that is.

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:35.860
And if you don't, shame on you.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.280
Because I think it's one of the
best video game series ever.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.690
And my husband and I both
are huge on video games.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.500
And I think there are
certain games where

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.760
I advance into the game
further than he does.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.994
And basically, it's like
a, honey, no spoilers.

00:05:56.994 --> 00:05:58.160
Don't tell me what happened.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.850
It's like watching
"Breaking Bad."

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.060
It's kind of to at that level.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.360
I haven't caught on yet
to the phenomenon that

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.000
is "Breaking Bad," and he does
not let me hear the end of it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.352
So I promised to catch up
on the plane ride home.

00:06:15.352 --> 00:06:17.310
So, I'll probably be done
with the first season

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.354
by the time I hit Manila.

00:06:18.354 --> 00:06:20.020
So at least he and I
will have something

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.270
to talk about when he picks
me up from the airport.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.530
So he's sad that it's over.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.560
So there's that.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.400
Both of us have gadgets galore.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.560
And it's kind of funny.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.820
From the time that we
met, we've almost always

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.540
had identical devices.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.330
I mean, when we first met, it
was the exact same Nokia phone,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.170
but in different colors.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.620
It's like, aw.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.610
It was meant to be.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.260
There was that.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.670
And then he adopted the
iPhone before I did.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.470
And I held onto a Nokia.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.820
But it was a little
bit more advanced.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.720
And he's like, why aren't
you hopping onto the iPhone?

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.990
I'm like, I'm going
to wait until I

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.940
can send to unlimited
numbers of people by texts.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.320
And there's still limits
to that technology.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.570
So, I need to hold off until
it can do what I want it to do.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.360
And when it did, and I'm like,
all right, I can sign on now.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.540
And so, since then, we've
had identical phones.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.350
And yeah.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.620
But we always get it
in different colors.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.470
And I always put a case on mine.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.970
Just because you need to
protect your investments.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:41.470
And he's vain about his iPhone,
so there's no case on it.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.264
There's no protective layer,
because it's so beautiful.

00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:46.180
I don't want a shield.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.346
I'm like, you're going to
regret that at some point.

00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:52.050
And he's dropped it so
many times at the gym,

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.590
at the office, at home.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.760
And then, I think there was
one time before we finally

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.510
replaced his 4s s with a 5.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.170
We were at the cemetery
visiting his mother.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.400
He had his iPhone in his pocket.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.880
Opened the car
door, stepped out,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:16.490
and it fell onto the pavement,
and cracked the glass,

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.460
and broke his heart
along with it.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.200
And of course in my
head, being a wife,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.310
anybody here who's a wife, you
know that voice in your head.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.170
I told you.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.284
I told you.

00:08:32.284 --> 00:08:33.409
Don't want to listen to me.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:36.090
OK, so you deal with that.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.039
So yeah.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.580
He was like, yeah, I'm going to
have to get the next one now.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.255
I was like, uh, duh, you think?

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:44.380
Just all these little things
that go on in my head.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.725
But yeah, so w were
always surrounded by it.

00:08:46.725 --> 00:08:48.680
And we have a
seven-year-old daughter

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:54.070
who's very tablet-savvy,
and smartphone-savvy.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.470
She has an iPad.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.090
An iPad Mini.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:08:59.880
She knows what to do with it.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.670
I don't have to
teach her anything.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.854
And it's cool that
technology has advanced

00:09:03.854 --> 00:09:06.020
to the point of being so
intuitive that you can give

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.630
a two-year-old that
bit of technology,

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.100
and then they'll be able
to navigate even better

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.150
than the grownups
can, sometimes.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.210
But we have to censor the
games, obviously, and the apps

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.580
that she is able to use.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.970
Like, can I buy-- no,
you cannot have that one.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.960
Can I wa-- no, you
cannot watch that movie.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.790
And of course, the parental
restrictions are activated.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.380
But yeah, we are in
technology I think

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.240
on a pretty high-end
consumer level.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.640
I mean, we're not
dumb-dumbs when

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.290
it comes to the
stuff that we have,

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.450
and the stuff that we use.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.030
And we employ a lot of it.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.660
And I employ a
lot of it at work.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.260
Obviously, I listen to music
and study music with my phone.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.751
And with the tablet,
being able to Xoom music,

00:09:52.751 --> 00:09:54.250
and being able to
go through lyrics,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:59.300
and being able to
use that for work.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:05.000
And I no longer get
CDs to study music.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.210
There's a television
program called

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:11.140
ASAP in the Philippines,
which is incredibly popular.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:16.250
It's a Sunday
afternoon variety show.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.710
And whenever I need to
appear as a guest performer,

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.930
their music department will
just send the mp3s for me

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:25.870
to listen to.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.190
And the technology then is also
employed by the music director.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.460
They have their own
software that they use,

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.020
which I know nothing about,
which my brother also

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.030
gets to use, where
they cut the songs,

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.170
and change pitches, change
keys, attach things together,

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.230
so that at least we have
some sort of schematic

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.530
going into a rehearsal.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.140
And we have an idea of what
to do in order to save time.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.830
So it's also been
incredibly helpful

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.715
with of productivity
side of that.

00:10:54.715 --> 00:10:55.590
CATHERINE BUAN: Yeah.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.890
Do you think technology has
made a big difference in-- well,

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:04.520
I hear that you use it for a
lot of inputs, and research,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.135
and rehearsal, and sort of
the incoming information

00:11:07.135 --> 00:11:08.790
and availability.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.740
But you are such a warm
person with a lot of emotion,

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.340
and that's such a
big deal in the arts.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.050
Do you think that
technology has also

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.040
gotten to a point
where you can actually

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.420
share more of that nuance?

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.150
LEA SALONGA: Well, I
think that it is possible.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.820
And with what Victor has
created with "Broadway Live,"

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:36.030
for example, which is able to
provide that kind of content.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.710
And the thing about
the arts and what I do,

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.200
which mostly is like, live
performing and performing

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.230
on stage, and it's usually a
very interactive medium, where

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.840
it's people who are maybe just
a few feet in front of you

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.150
and, there's that
kind of energy,

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.880
to be able to be savvy
enough to try and capture

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.661
that kind of a
performance-- first,

00:11:59.661 --> 00:12:01.660
you need to be in a room
full of people in order

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.802
to fully represent
the experience.

00:12:04.802 --> 00:12:06.260
And I mean, for
the performer, it's

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.750
important that it's a room where
there are however many people.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.530
For example, we did a
concert at the Allen Room

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.670
at Lincoln Center.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.490
And we filled it with friends
and members of the theatre

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.880
community.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.880
And I did the concert as
if I was just performing

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.850
for the people in the room.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.204
However, I also had to
be conscious of the fact

00:12:30.204 --> 00:12:31.620
that this was going
to be recorded

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.800
and eventually
digitally streamed,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.670
which would then bring this
experience into someone's

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.440
laptop, into
somebody's living room.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.000
And I mean now,
with the way you're

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.190
able to stream stuff from your
laptops, or from your phones,

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:47.280
onto a television set,
and then the experience

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.040
is right there in
your living room.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.609
So then, I have to be
conscious of, Lea, you

00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:53.150
have to look at this
particular spot,

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.316
because the camera is
capturing you from this angle.

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.740
And if you look a
little too high,

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.190
then you look a little weird.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.240
So there's also that.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.500
And he had to be a Nazi about
that, which I appreciated.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.070
And then, I'll hear
these big sighs

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.090
from the back of the
room going, ah, yes.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:15.734
And so, there's that.

00:13:15.734 --> 00:13:17.400
So the technology,
actually, in the room

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.560
was extremely present,
with however many cameras,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.110
with a whole big camera
set up, and with dollies,

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.750
and with cameraman, and
a recording console.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.060
And me having to figure out
which microphones to use,

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.350
and having to test that
to create one, the best

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.870
sound for me coming through
a speaker as possible,

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:42.040
and also for capturing
it for preservation.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.260
So I think the
technology enables people

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.650
to experience what's
going on in a concert hall

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.730
from their own home.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:54.380
But there also has
to be-- for me,

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.870
it's really helpful when
there are people in the room

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.610
to make it a very interactive
experience, and a very

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.760
immediate audience-performer
experience.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.984
That kind of interaction
is very, very unique,

00:14:04.984 --> 00:14:06.400
and if the room
was empty, I don't

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.125
think we would have been
able to make that happen.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.550
Not long ago, I saw the iTunes
Music Festival performance

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.840
of Lady Gaga.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.470
And I mean, it was wonderful.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.820
It was incredible.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.120
And I felt like I was there.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.370
But there needed to be also
this full audience that

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.090
was interacting with her,
and applauding, and laughing,

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.740
and crying, and
being in the room.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.380
There's something about that.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.860
I mean, it's great when
we're able to capture it,

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.020
and able to stream it, and
make the content available.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.820
But at the same
time, for what I do,

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.752
I need an audience in a room.

00:14:44.752 --> 00:14:46.710
CATHERINE BUAN: So it
enhances the [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:47.480
LEA SALONGA: It does.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.370
CATHERINE BUAN:
[INAUDIBLE] substitute.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:48.620
LEA SALONGA: Right.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.700
It's not a substitute.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.195
I mean, there's nothing like
being in a Broadway theater

00:14:52.195 --> 00:14:54.870
and watching say, a show
like "The Book of Mormon"

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.660
and seeing all of
these things happening

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.310
in the same room as you.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.174
And my husband and
I recently went.

00:15:02.174 --> 00:15:03.840
Obviously, we did not
take our daughter.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.320
That is not a show
to take children to.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.076
Absolutely not.

00:15:07.076 --> 00:15:09.200
And it was a show that he
would have wanted to see.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.990
And we had not really
listened to the cast recording

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.950
at the time.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.440
So a lot about what was
happening on the stage for us

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.250
was new.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.065
And there is so much profanity.

00:15:22.874 --> 00:15:25.290
If any of you have listened
to the cast recording of "Book

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:29.730
of Mormon," it's a bit
of a shock initially.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.210
But then after you get over
it, it's really, really funny,

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.570
and it's genius.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.390
And if you're a fan
of "South Park,"

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.870
this is right up your alley.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.720
It was just incredible.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.320
I mean, there is no replacing
that experience, obviously.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.029
But there is something to be
said about making it available.

00:15:48.029 --> 00:15:50.070
EMILY NISHI: That's amazing,
which shines through

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:51.653
in what you're talking
about, and what

00:15:51.653 --> 00:15:54.360
you've applied as you've learned
how the industry has changed.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.270
It's just the
depth of experience

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.541
you've had as a performer.

00:15:57.541 --> 00:15:59.040
One thing that I
think all of us are

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.209
familiar with that extensive
resume that you have.

00:16:02.209 --> 00:16:04.500
I mean, I think many of us
remember you from the Disney

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.420
movies, from the
plays you've done

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.815
on Broadway, in
London, and elsewhere,

00:16:08.815 --> 00:16:10.690
and just the sheer amount
of accomplishments.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.387
I tried to print
your Wikipedia page

00:16:12.387 --> 00:16:13.720
so that I could read about you--

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.178
LEA SALONGA: Do
not even read that.

00:16:15.178 --> 00:16:18.050
EMILY NISHI: And it kept
printing and printing.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:19.370
It was multiple pages.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.372
LEA SALONGA: I need to
figure something out.

00:16:21.372 --> 00:16:23.330
So, I'm sure there's
somebody in this room that

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.800
will be able to help me.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.450
No, no, no.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.470
Because I called Wikipedia
out on a tweet this morning.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:30.360
And I was very angry.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.300
And I said, Wikipedia, you suck.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.680
And yeah.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.340
Because there were so many
inaccuracies on my page.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:45.690
And the funny thing is, I tried
to correct the Wikipedia entry.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.550
But the thing is-- and I
read a "New Yorker" article

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.880
about somebody else that tried
to do this, and was unable to.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.440
So I put a blurb, which
was all of two lines,

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.430
Lea Salonga will be editing
this entry in the next few days

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.460
because of the egregious
errors contained

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.770
made by well-meaning people
who feel that they know

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.190
her career better than she does.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.930
Thank you.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.819
And I dated it.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.150
And I think there were some
really cool people that

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.839
took a screenshot of
it before somebody

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:16.629
went in again and edited it out.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.310
So my question is this.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:27.150
How does a person like myself
edit their own Wikipedia entry?

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.190
Because it seems to be much
more difficult than negotiating

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:36.600
rush hour traffic on the
405 in LA, and probably

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.200
10 times more frustrating.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.200
So maybe if somebody
from Wikipedia

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.783
would be able to
give me an answer.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.560
Tweet me at
@MsLeaSalonga on Twitter.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.550
You can find me,
and it really is me.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.480
And I do get combative and am
very opinionated with people.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.130
And the tone that I take
makes people say, oh, yeah,

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.920
that really definitely is her.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.520
I'm not the nicest
person in social media.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:08.400
I can be a little ornery, and I
can be a little bit obnoxious.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.940
But it's definitely me.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.240
And it's me jet-lagged.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.510
That's not nice.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.087
It's not me being nice.

00:18:14.087 --> 00:18:15.170
I'm not always diplomatic.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.253
I'm extremely opinionated.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:23.930
Which regular viewers of "The
Voice" would have noticed.

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.580
Yeah, but I've never made
anybody cry on "The Voice."

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.544
EMILY NISHI: Not yet.

00:18:28.544 --> 00:18:29.210
LEA SALONGA: No.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.560
I'm not Simon Cowell.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.940
First of all, I'm prettier.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.100
And yeah.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.820
But yeah.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.500
Yeah, so technology
has also been

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.780
able to help me stay
in touch with fans.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.360
It's no longer six
degrees or however

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.630
many degrees of separation.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.850
There's no more separation.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.660
If somebody decides
to say something,

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.350
I have all the
freedom in the world

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.960
to either ignore or engage.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.980
Ricky Martin gave me
a piece of advice.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.250
Do not, do not, do not engage.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.090
And he's actually told
a story about having

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.310
to be physically restrained
from his computer

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:14.177
by a friend when, I think,
one comment was just

00:19:14.177 --> 00:19:15.760
the straw that broke
the camel's back.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.270
And he was just like, why you?

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.170
And somebody said,
no, do not, do not.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.690
And yeah.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.937
Incredibly handsome celebrities
like that have a bad day.

00:19:27.937 --> 00:19:30.020
EMILY NISHI: I think
[INAUDIBLE] some celebrities.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.750
Do you have any
good stories for us?

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.640
You've worked in multiple
Hollywood circles

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.520
and Broadway circles, et cetera.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.910
Won multiple Tony Awards.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.410
You've rubbed elbows with a lot
of these interesting people.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.025
Any good stories
or favorite actors?

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.400
LEA SALONGA: Oh, OK.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.620
I have a story
about Hugh Jackman.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:56.590
And this is before his success
as Wolverine on "X-men."

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:01.890
Very few people-- when he
blew up like crazy on film

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.710
as Wolverine on "X-men."

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:08.510
When I saw the trailers,
I'm like, wait a minute.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.700
I know this guy.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:16.260
And I knew him because a
few years before the "X-men"

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.050
movie came out, there was a
concert in London called "Hey,

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.410
Mr. Producer," which
is available on DVD.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.850
Shameless plug.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.090
Insert here.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.780
And I was invited to
be part of the concert

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.459
to perform selections
from "Miss Saigon,"

00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:34.000
as well as selections
from "Les Mis,"

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.400
and to be part of this
big Sondheim section.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.154
And I was only too
honored to do it.

00:20:39.154 --> 00:20:40.820
One of the girls, one
of my girlfriends,

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.080
who had done "Miss
Saigon" with me,

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.504
she said, OK, for
the second act,

00:20:49.504 --> 00:20:51.170
for the Rodgers and
Hammerstein section,

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.810
you have to make sure that
you are sitting in the house.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:56.221
And I said, why?

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:57.220
She said, just trust me.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.920
Just do it.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.560
OK.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.540
So I sit in costumes.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.500
Still in whatever
costumer I was wearing.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:10.690
So I'm sitting a few seats
away from another actor.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.770
And from out of
nowhere, a capella,

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.620
you hear this voice
just singing, [SINGING]

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.515
"There's a bright golden
haze on the meadow."

00:21:21.515 --> 00:21:24.580
I'm like, who's that?

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.370
Who is that?

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:31.445
And it was the kind of a voice
that just made you sit up.

00:21:31.445 --> 00:21:34.730
And what's going on?

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.760
And you felt this anticipation.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.375
And then, here comes
this very tall, over 6

00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:43.710
foot man, dressed up.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.910
He was about to open two
weeks later in "Oklahoma."

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:55.280
And so he came out, this tall,
beautiful, rugged Australian

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.410
man, and just singing with
this big smile on his face,

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.600
standing straight and tall,
and extremely confident.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.220
And I'm like, oh my God.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.140
And I heard sighs from the
other ladies in the audience

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.190
at the time going, mm-hmm.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.420
Just looking at him.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.930
And he just continued to sing,
just note perfect, and smiling,

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.310
and gorgeous.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.290
And I'm like, oh my god.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:23.700
It's a musical theater man.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.760
And these kind of
men were so rare.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.380
OK.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:35.360
It's rare, because-- OK, I'll
have to be completely frank.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:41.720
Musical theater is often
considered as gay man's heaven.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.850
And I have had my share
of gay leading men.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:50.170
And some are able to play
straight better than others.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:56.110
But when I see
someone like that,

00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:02.190
and you're doing a musical
theater, you have no idea.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.320
It's like we get kind
of boy crazy at times,

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.100
because it's like,
they're so rare.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.660
It's like being a member of
"National Geographic," sighting

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.640
a very rare animal
out in the wilderness.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.460
It is of that magnitude.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.490
It's just magical when
you finally spot one.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.770
And you have to get your
binoculars out, and take

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:31.330
lots and lots of pictures,
and take copious notes.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:37.100
But he just stood
there and just sang.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.460
And I could not take
my eyes off of him,

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.830
because he was
beautiful, and magnetic,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.350
and incredibly charming.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:51.210
And I think the "Oklahoma"
film starring him is available.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.020
It's on YouTube.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.510
And you can find it on YouTube.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.230
And you'll understand
when you see this.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:02.500
And it was a charm that could
transcend-- once you looked

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.940
at his face, your heart
just fell into your stomach,

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.450
and you were just instantly
filled with adoration.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.240
And it's not even a carnal
desire, when you look at him.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.000
It's not even about that.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.990
Maybe a little bit about it.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.270
But it's just more
of this masculinity.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.930
And I mean, yeah, of course
he would be cast as Wolverine.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.870
And I just wonder
if on that set,

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:32.020
he ever broke out into musical
theatre songs with any other

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.690
member of the cast.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.630
And I mean, he was very
popular in Australia

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:39.830
as a quite well-known
musical theater leading man,

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:40.750
and his success.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.640
Then, moved to the West
End and onto Hollywood.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.410
And he's also won
his own Tony Award

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.420
playing another Aussie
in "The Boy from Oz."

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.980
And I'm just so
happy that he's just

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:59.190
garnered so much incredible
success on film and on stage,

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.890
and that he's not
forgotten his roots.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.550
And I think he
actually received--

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:04.925
I don't know if
it was management

00:25:04.925 --> 00:25:06.490
advice, or
representative advice.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.850
You shouldn't be
prancing on stage,

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:11.352
singing and doing
musical theater.

00:25:11.352 --> 00:25:13.310
And I'm glad that he
didn't follow that advice,

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:16.510
because his kind of
magic, there's something

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:24.630
about him live in a theater,
just a few feet away from him.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.300
I saw the films.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.940
I saw the "X-men" films, and
I've seen the YouTube clips.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.778
But there's nothing like being
a few feet in front of him.

00:25:35.778 --> 00:25:37.230
[SIGHS]

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:38.367
Yeah.

00:25:38.367 --> 00:25:39.450
There's nothing like that.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:44.520
I mean, he's pretty darn
special live and up close.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.500
CATHERINE BUAN: Lea,
speaking of celebrity icons,

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.050
having a person
like you, here-- I

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.320
mean your warmth is tremendous.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.700
And I think oftentimes, when
people come to see a celebrity

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.930
icon interviewed one
on one, it's to see,

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:01.660
who's the real
person underneath.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.240
And I have to say,
in a moment, we

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.470
feel like we all
know you already.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:11.384
But I still have to ask, what
do we not know about Lea?

00:26:11.384 --> 00:26:12.050
LEA SALONGA: Oh.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.044
And Victor's been one
of my best friends.

00:26:18.044 --> 00:26:19.960
I mean, he was the gay
of honor at my wedding.

00:26:23.094 --> 00:26:24.760
And my wedding was a
massive production,

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.210
and he directed that.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:29.046
So I mean, what do
people not know?

00:26:29.046 --> 00:26:29.920
I mean, I don't know.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.690
I mean, my life is
pretty much out there.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.840
And what you see is
pretty much what you get.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.180
And I pride myself on that.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.790
I mean, my family is that way.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.320
My brother is that way.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.060
My mother, oh, gosh, yeah.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.010
She's very transparent.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:48.670
Which is great.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:52.020
I mean, if she has any
disdain for someone,

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.630
the eyebrow goes up, and you
know where you stand with her.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.479
And it's great.

00:26:57.479 --> 00:26:59.270
I mean, if you're in
a good place with her,

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.870
then she is incredibly warm,
and incredibly hospitable,

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.020
and generous.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.380
But when she starts
to shut down,

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.960
then it's like,
good luck to you.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.689
I will be in the next
room if you need me.

00:27:14.689 --> 00:27:16.230
But yeah, incredibly
emotional woman.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.840
And I think both my brother
and I, we got some of that

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.340
from her.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.450
But obviously, we
are only half her.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.350
And the other half
is as our father, who

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:30.180
was very good at keeping
things close to the chest,

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:34.780
and at not always
letting other people

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.000
into what's going on here.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.550
He's actually a
mechanical engineer.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.890
So I'm the daughter
of an engineer.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:45.029
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:47.320
LEA SALONGA: That's something
not a lot of people know.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.700
He went to the US
Merchant Marine Academy

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.925
in Long Island in New York.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.470
I think it's like, Maritime
something something.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.680
It's a commercial Maritime.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.150
That's kind of what
his concentration was.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:09.390
And so, he did a lot of
that in the Philippines.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.900
And other funny
thing is that he said

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.482
that, when he was
still at the Academy--

00:28:14.482 --> 00:28:18.240
his story is about him
at the Academy-- he used

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.889
to take the train from
school to the city

00:28:21.889 --> 00:28:22.930
and watch Broadway shows.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.280
And he remembers having seen
"South Pacific" on Broadway.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.592
So it's kind of funny then, that
his daughter many, many, many,

00:28:29.592 --> 00:28:31.800
many years later, would end
up on the Great White Way

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.140
herself, not just once, but two
or three times, or four times.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.650
Which I think makes
him very proud.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:41.500
I would think.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.830
I would hope.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.930
So I think my love
for technology

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.010
must have come from that.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:51.780
So it have been a genetic
predisposition and curiosity

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.770
for that kind of stuff.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.300
EMILY NISHI: Speaking
of curiosity,

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.310
we'd like to invite the audience
to ask Lea questions directly.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.360
Anything you like.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.061
It's not off limits.

00:29:02.061 --> 00:29:02.810
AUDIENCE: Hi, Lea.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:06.320
My name's [INAUDIBLE], and I'm
from the YFPA organization.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.910
LEA SALONGA: Hey.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.030
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:16.940
My question is, I
saw on YouTube when

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.500
you were auditioning
for "Miss Saigon."

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.550
And I think it was
like, a documentary.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.440
Can you tell us about
that experience?

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.339
Because that was probably
more than 20 years ago or so?

00:29:30.339 --> 00:29:31.380
LEA SALONGA: Oh, my gosh.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.550
That audition was
filmed in 1988.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.180
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.684
Yes.

00:29:37.684 --> 00:29:38.780
LEA SALONGA: Oh, my gosh.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.880
That was a very,
very long time ago.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.370
I was a freshman in college.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.100
And I was actually in pre-med.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:50.990
So I would have taken a whole
completely different path

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:54.160
into the sciences.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:30:01.550
So the audition, that is only
a few minutes that actually

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:06.540
represented a three day
audition process for me.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.990
I mean, the first
day wasn't filmed.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.100
The first day was when all
professional singers and actors

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:19.490
were called and
invited to audition.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:20.550
Second day was open call.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.830
So I was on the
first day, because I

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:25.080
had been a professional
singer in the Philippines for,

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.900
at the time, 10 years.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.140
So I went in to sing.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.080
And I strategically
picked a song

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:36.220
from "Les Mis," having a feeling
that it might be possible

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.590
that the music from
this new musical

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.960
would be in a very
similar style.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.860
And they kind were not.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:54.550
But I mean, at least it gave the
people auditioning me a hurdle,

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:59.840
that it was something that they
were already familiar with.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.400
And then I sang a
pop song to give them

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.600
a bit of a range as
to what I could do.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.470
So the stuff that was captured
on film was my call back.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:15.740
And I had no idea if I was going
to be called back after that.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.610
So I then brought the
libretto of "Les Mis" with me

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.616
and asked them to autograph it.

00:31:21.616 --> 00:31:23.740
Because I didn't think I
would ever see them again.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.210
So I figured hey,
you know, what do I

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:28.550
have to lose at this point?

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:30.610
The experience was
very interesting.

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:35.550
I never had a three-day
audition process before.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:40.280
It was something that
was very new to me,

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.820
and very interesting,
and very nerve-wracking.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.670
And I mean, to actually
feel my knees literally

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:51.290
knocking against each other
while trying to keep yourself

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:55.360
together and singing a song
is extremely difficult.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:01.830
And at the age of 17,
it's-- I don't know how many

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.450
17-year-olds could
go through it.

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:05.950
But there were quite
a few teenagers

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:10.400
that were able to get over that.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.280
And there were a few
of us, not even 20,

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:17.700
that headed over to London
to actually start rehearsals

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.250
for that, show which
was pretty cool.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.230
AUDIENCE: I guess they just
sort of stole my question.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.730
I was going to ask about working
with Boublil and Schonberg,

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.440
and what that
experience was like.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.810
LEA SALONGA: Well,
the cool thing

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.192
about having worked with
Boublil and Schonberg-- I

00:32:34.192 --> 00:32:35.650
mean, first of all,
they're kind of

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.410
legendary in that they created
this incredible musical that

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:41.120
still had a life, and
was just recently turned

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:47.490
into a film, which again
starred Hugh Jackman,

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:48.280
going back to him.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.840
Working with these
two, it's actually

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.120
like having your
fathers at first.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.670
Because you're
trying to make sure

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.660
that you sing their music right,
and that you make them happy.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.360
Many, many years later working
with them on other things

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.340
after having added to my
resume, and after having

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:15.520
added to my body of work,
they sort of became equals.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.680
And my mouth got a
little more sassy.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.280
And Alain remarked,
I don't remember

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.720
you being like this
when you were 18.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.640
Yeah, we all grow
up sooner or later.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.192
But they are incredibly lovely,
lovely men to work with.

00:33:33.192 --> 00:33:34.233
Incredibly collaborative.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:39.360
And Claude Michel
for me, I will always

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.910
have a soft spot in my heart
for him, and not only because

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:45.990
of his musical gift, but also
for his love for my country,

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.850
for the Philippines.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.570
I mean, he set up Sun
and Moon Foundation,

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:50.720
which is an orphanage.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.890
And he adopted his
elder daughter--

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:57.840
he has two daughters--
his older daughter, Margo,

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.330
from the Philippines.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.950
And he comes back at
least once or twice a year

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:05.940
to look in on the
orphanage, and to make sure

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.689
that everything is
still running smoothly.

00:34:07.689 --> 00:34:11.820
And I don't know of anyone
of that kind of stature

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:16.420
to have that kind of
consistent commitment

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.360
to a cause like that, and to
always be able to make time.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.170
And he's brought his
wife Charlotte over

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:24.170
to look in on it.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.659
Or if he's unable
to make a trip,

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:28.940
then she does on his behalf.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.040
And he's just a wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful man,

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.790
period, as well as an
incredible musician,

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:39.290
to get to work
alongside on projects.

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:41.969
And it is an ongoing
relationship.

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:44.510
AUDIENCE: I appreciate all the
time you spend with your fans.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.719
And like, the stuff
you do on social media

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:46.900
is really exciting for us.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.370
I had a little
self-deprecating story.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.870
I went and heard you four years
ago in Louisville, Kentucky,

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:52.837
I guess, at a concert.

00:34:52.837 --> 00:34:55.170
And you were doing that thing
where you invited audience

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.139
members up to sing
"Aladdin" with you.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.287
And it was exciting, so I
was all psyched to do it.

00:34:59.287 --> 00:35:01.370
So I jumped up there, and
then I got stage fright,

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.250
and had to stop.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.652
And it was sort of a bummer.

00:35:03.652 --> 00:35:05.110
Some other guy ran
up to the stage.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:07.835
But then after that, it became
this real terrifying thing,

00:35:07.835 --> 00:35:10.210
because I thought, wow, I'm
always hesitating in my life,

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:12.800
and not making things happen.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.050
I couldn't sleep for two days.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:16.030
It was so ridiculous.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.752
And then all my
friends and I, we

00:35:17.752 --> 00:35:19.210
started calling
these moments where

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:21.400
you hesitate Lea
Salonga moments.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.492
It became a concept
in our discourse.

00:35:23.492 --> 00:35:25.700
CATHERINE BUAN: There's
actually a name now for this.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.336
OK.

00:35:26.336 --> 00:35:27.960
AUDIENCE: So, thanks
for that, I guess.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.997
It was really exciting year.

00:35:29.997 --> 00:35:31.830
LEA SALONGA: That's a
dubious honor to have.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.760
AUDIENCE: I had a lot
of adventures that year,

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.234
sort of trying to make the most.

00:35:35.234 --> 00:35:35.900
LEA SALONGA: Aw.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.500
Thanks for sharing that story.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.660
That's awesome.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:44.359
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:44.359 --> 00:35:44.900
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.260
My name is Jeannie.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.680
Nice to meet you, Lea.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.590
I'm in the field of
clinical psychology,

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.610
so we're in very
different fields.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:58.350
But as a clinician, one thing
that's important is self-care.

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:03.384
And so it's a global superstar,
how do you practice self-care?

00:36:03.384 --> 00:36:04.050
LEA SALONGA: Oh.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.770
Well, the video games actually
do help, strangely enough.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:16.940
It's one way to kind of vent
my anger and frustration

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:23.100
without actually taking it
out on an actual human being.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.240
So, there's that.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:33.910
I mean, just taking a wrench and
hitting a zombie in the face,

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:35.820
it feels really good to do.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.810
And so, I find that
very therapeutic.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:41.409
Just conversations
with my friends.

00:36:41.409 --> 00:36:42.950
And I always make
sure to have dinner

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.914
with a close clutch of friends.

00:36:44.914 --> 00:36:46.330
Victor is one of
them, and we have

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:50.830
a close clutch of girlfriends
and other friends in New York

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:51.730
City.

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.810
I'm there so frequently,
so there's always

00:36:54.810 --> 00:37:00.350
going to be like, a group outing
of some sort, where we eat,

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:02.030
and we talk.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:05.430
And a lot of the time,
it's not about theatre.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:06.970
We talk about relationships.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:10.010
We talk about children.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.090
And then we talk about the stuff
that has absolutely nothing

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:14.510
to do with the outside world.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:16.940
We talk about what goes
on in our own lives.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.620
And sometimes in
talking things out,

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:24.560
you're able to then, when you
hear yourself say something,

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.410
then everybody has input.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:29.380
Or if somebody else is
having a relationship issue,

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.050
me being blunt,
will not even filter

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:36.055
the thoughts that
pop into my mind.

00:37:36.055 --> 00:37:38.550
And they reach my
mouth before my brain

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.630
can tell me to stop talking.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:45.230
And sometimes, it's
appreciated, and sometimes it's,

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:48.100
I wish I didn't hear that.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.260
I mean, there's that.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.240
So it's extremely therapeutic
to kind of get back

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.280
in touch with the people
that know me best,

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.600
and with people that know me
unfiltered, and uncensored,

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.150
and real.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.560
I spend a lot of
time with my family.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.110
I spend a lot of time with my
daughter, and with my husband.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.470
And I guess part
of the self-care

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:14.190
is returning to a very
real life of school

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:17.570
pickups, and
parent-teacher conferences,

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:22.226
and heading to the grocery,
and in doing the stuff

00:38:22.226 --> 00:38:23.350
to take care of your house.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:24.724
And sometimes, I
guess, in taking

00:38:24.724 --> 00:38:28.101
care of other human beings, you
kind of take care of yourself

00:38:28.101 --> 00:38:28.600
also.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.750
Because then you have
another responsibility

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:35.850
that has absolutely nothing
to do with the work.

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.840
And sometimes, working
as a performer,

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:42.730
and when you have many
pairs of eyes looking at you

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.910
and trained on you, I mean,
there is always a danger

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:47.850
that you turn into this
narcissistic, self-centered

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:48.950
monster.

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.500
So when the energy then goes
from you to something else,

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.929
then it kind of
balances things out.

00:38:54.929 --> 00:38:55.970
CHRISTINE SONGCO LAU: OK.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:59.520
So we have some questions
that we gathered online

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.950
before this event
to make sure we

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:04.810
had enough representation for
people that couldn't make it

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:05.550
here.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.760
And one of the
questions we had online

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.340
was from Minnie [INAUDIBLE]
one of the Googlers here.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:14.310
She says, you were a freshman
at Ateneo during my senior year.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:15.850
And the biggest
news at the time was

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:18.620
that you got the lead
role in "Miss Saigon.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.180
If you had not become a
successful international

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:29.050
performer, what would have
been your second career choice?

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:30.800
LEA SALONGA: I
really don't know.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.457
It's not something I
really think about now.

00:39:34.457 --> 00:39:36.290
I try not to think about
what could've been,

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:39.490
because what is is
really pretty darn cool.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.010
So, I don't know.

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.010
I mean, I don't know that
I would have continued

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:50.520
my studies in
medicine, because I

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.910
didn't have a head
for chemistry.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.780
And just thinking about having
to go through organic chemistry

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.090
really terrified me.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:00.250
So I'm kind of glad
that things worked out

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:01.529
the way that they did.

00:40:01.529 --> 00:40:02.070
I don't know.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:06.870
I probably would have
continued on in the arts path,

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:10.489
but still kind of
keeping a toehold

00:40:10.489 --> 00:40:12.280
on the sciences a little
bit, because there

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.550
were certain things
that did interest me.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:17.509
But then again, I
really don't know.

00:40:17.509 --> 00:40:18.550
CHRISTINE SONGCO LAU: OK.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.425
One more question from
online, and then we'll

00:40:20.425 --> 00:40:21.510
go back to in the room.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.810
Another question we had
online from Google Moderator

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:26.650
is from Yao Ching.

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.070
Do you sing in the shower?

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.911
And if so, what song?

00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:32.660
LEA SALONGA: I actually
sing in the shower

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.720
when I need to study material.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.434
When there's a song
that's really wordy,

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:38.850
or a song that's
really difficult,

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:40.308
or something that
I just need to go

00:40:40.308 --> 00:40:43.950
over and over and over again,
then I do it in the shower.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.970
And the acoustics in there
are actually not bad.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:51.840
I can hear my voice really
clearly and be able to focus.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.360
So yes, I do, but not in
the way that people do.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:03.530
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask,
how do you juggle being a mom,

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.400
and then like the global
superstar that you are?

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.220
You kind of mentioned some stuff
about picking up from school.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.620
It's just a curiosity of
mine, because I'm a mom too.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.360
LEA SALONGA: Really well
thought-out scheduling,

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.200
I think.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.810
And also, shared responsibility.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:24.670
I mean, my husband does
the morning drop-offs,

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:27.490
because I cannot do them.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:28.570
Because I'm a night owl.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:32.950
And I hate getting up at
7 o'clock in the morning

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:33.920
to do a drop-off.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.520
No.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.600
I'm doing pick-up.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.090
You are doing drop-off.

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:38.540
And he's a morning
person anyway,

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.980
so it's not
inconvenient for him.

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:48.300
I think it's just keeping your
priorities straight, and making

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.380
sure that I spend most of my
time at home with my family.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:55.500
And when I do travel
outside of the country,

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.910
the time away is limited, or
the time away from my family

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:02.100
is limited, especially now that
my daughter's getting older.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.680
And I'm finding that she
needs me more and more

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:10.880
now, the older she gets, than
when she was much younger.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:16.350
It's kind of interesting
how that's happened.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:19.870
I do spend a lot of time
away from the Philippines

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.664
when she's on summer break.

00:42:22.664 --> 00:42:24.330
Because that is when
I'm able to travel.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:25.474
That's when I can perform.

00:42:25.474 --> 00:42:26.640
And then, she comes with me.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.160
And then we try to find
interesting stuff for her

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:29.840
to do.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.349
Museums.

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:34.390
I mean, we took her to
the Natural History Museum

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:38.450
in New York City when I was
there for a nice, long stay.

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:41.380
And so, she got to actually
see dinosaur fossils.

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.510
And she's really
interested in dinosaurs,

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.400
and she wants to be
a paleontologist when

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.820
she grows up.

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:51.230
And a fashion designer,
among other things.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.380
Yeah, so I think it's just
a matter of figuring out

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:57.600
what the priorities are, and
then scheduling accordingly.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:03.230
Which was what made "The Voice"
the perfect thing, because I

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:07.940
was able to be home and do what
I loved to do at the same time.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:12.790
And because of the
reach of TFC and where

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:18.070
ABS-CBN has placed
their networking,

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:23.540
I was still seen by an audience
worldwide, or at the very

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.694
least, in Filipino
homes worldwide,

00:43:25.694 --> 00:43:26.610
which was pretty cool.

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:26.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.830
We watched "The Voice"
too, and you were amazing.

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:29.180
LEA SALONGA: Thanks.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:29.750
Thank you.

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:31.262
And we won.

00:43:31.262 --> 00:43:37.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:38.720
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.530
My name's Rex.

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:41.910
I'm with YFPA.

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:42.410
It's funny.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.870
When I got the email invite for
this, as I scrolled through it,

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:49.460
the first words that caught
my eye were Princess Jasmine.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:54.240
And growing up, "Aladdin" was my
sister and I's favorite movie.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.310
And I was just wondering.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:44:00.040
So much of Disney's culture
is very magical, sort of

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.110
like mysterious.

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:05.800
And you got to work on arguably
one of the greatest Disney

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.730
movies of all time.

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:08.490
I was just wondering
if you could just

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:10.990
shed some light on your
experience with Disney,

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:12.032
and how that was.

00:44:12.032 --> 00:44:14.240
LEA SALONGA: It's actually
pretty magical for us too,

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.220
for the people that work.

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.720
It's like being in
the Emerald City,

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.450
and being behind the curtain
where the Wizard was.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:27.890
But it's also magical
behind the scenes.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:34.010
I mean, getting to work with
people like Alan Menken and Tim

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:37.940
Rice-- and these are musical
theater legends as well.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:43.980
Alan Menken having done
"Little Shop of Horrors,"

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:48.930
and and now he's represented
on Broadway in "Newsies,"

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.530
and also having done
"Beauty and the Beast"

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:53.360
and "The Little Mermaid."

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:57.540
And Tim Rice, who wrote
the lyrics for "Evita."

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.890
So that's part of his resume.

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:06.774
And so when I got to meet him,
and I was just this huge fan.

00:45:06.774 --> 00:45:07.940
The behind the scenes stuff.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:13.250
I mean, being cast as a voice
actor in a Disney movie,

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:17.430
it's refreshing, because your
actual appearance as a human

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:20.300
being has absolutely no
bearing on whether or not

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.720
you get the job.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.880
You literally can show up in
your pajamas, sing a song,

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.650
and go home, and it's all great.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:33.270
But the cool thing about
recording "A Whole New World,"

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.970
and even "Reflection"
in "Mulan,"

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:40.960
is that you do it in a room
with 75 other musicians,

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.670
and all of you playing in
concert with one another.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:51.800
And for me, that is just an
incredibly magical experience,

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.500
just singing with an
orchestra of that size.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.260
And the caliber of musicians
that are in the room,

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:03.260
it's just mind-blowing for me.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:08.220
And so as a singer, as
a musician, and getting

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.820
to experience
something like that,

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:14.640
and then later on
watching it on screen,

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.240
there's still the
whole, "how do they

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.820
do that" feeling when you're
watching a magician onstage.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:25.680
Disney is magical, period,
for the people that

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.845
work behind the scenes as well.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.490
"A Whole New World"
was recorded a few days

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.620
before my 21st birthday.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:40.646
So that was 20 or so years ago.

00:46:40.646 --> 00:46:42.270
And like, it still
blows my mind that I

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:44.452
got to be part of
something that wonderful.

00:46:44.452 --> 00:46:45.493
AUDIENCE: That's awesome.

00:46:45.493 --> 00:46:47.859
Thank you.

00:46:47.859 --> 00:46:48.400
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.890
Christine Velasquez with
Filipino Networking Association

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:52.380
of Silicon Valley.

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.500
First off, it's such
a treat and a pleasure

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.080
to be in your presence.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.497
I'm sure everyone could agree.

00:46:59.497 --> 00:47:00.330
I've heard you sing.

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:02.960
I've heard your name
throughout the years.

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:07.140
And to share in this energy
today is just such a treat.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:10.510
And being here and
seeing the realness

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:15.550
around the way you carry
yourself, how grounded you are,

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:20.550
and how down to earth
you are is something

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:23.510
that is so appreciated.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:26.070
And I wanted to
acknowledge that.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.210
So my question was
brought up earlier

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.940
about kind of more of the,
how do you balance all this,

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:34.030
being on the world stage,
and work-life balance,

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:37.030
particularly for
professionals and those

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:39.710
who are starting their
careers and such?

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:43.680
But you answered that in a
very nice, thoughtful way.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.660
So I thought that maybe
sharing more about your passion

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.950
and following your
passion, obviously.

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:51.560
What you've done
and accomplished

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.640
is the epitome of
following your passion

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.070
and being successful
on so many levels.

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:00.740
And if you can share a little
bit of insight on that,

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.970
and how that has really
helped you get you

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:05.660
to where you are today?

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.220
LEA SALONGA: OK.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:13.900
I think every person's
passion path is different.

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:19.140
But I guess it's really, try
to go as hard as you can,

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:22.990
I guess, when you're
in your 20's, when

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:24.520
you have the energy to do it.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:29.090
And my mother always
gave this advice.

00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:30.890
Just focus on your
career when you're

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:32.820
young and getting into that.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.927
Because when it comes time
for you to have your family,

00:48:35.927 --> 00:48:37.760
it will happen when
it's supposed to happen.

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.170
But when you're in your 20's,
try to focus on your work,

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:43.560
and establishing your
place in the world,

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.170
and figuring all that out.

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:51.360
So I think a lot of stuff
happened when I was younger.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.010
And then as I got
older, then I started

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:56.650
to think about
family and children.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:02.610
And so the work would go, kind
of taper it down a little bit.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:04.750
But then things would
then kind of do this.

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:08.250
And so, when I felt my career
would be on an upswing,

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:12.620
I felt the need to also
still take advantage of it,

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.600
but then it also would
involve travel and time away.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:19.280
So I mean, there is still
some degree of sacrifice

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.910
that needs to be made.

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:26.670
And also, I chose
my spouse well,

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:32.400
in the sense that his
support for what I do

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.280
and for me as a
human being is just

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.130
something I thank God
for every single day.

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:41.257
Because I mean, he
says things like this.

00:49:41.257 --> 00:49:43.090
He's like, honey, I
mean, I would never ever

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:45.520
stop you from doing
what you do, because you

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:49.650
are in a unique position
to inspire people.

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:54.270
And so, why would I ever
take you away from that,

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:58.080
and take that away from you?

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.540
So I mean, I will
always be behind you,

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.165
and I will always support you.

00:50:03.165 --> 00:50:04.540
But in the same
breath also, it's

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.289
like, we need you here
at home too though.

00:50:06.289 --> 00:50:09.180
So I guess it's just
balancing how much time

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:13.860
away, and also figuring
out with my family

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:18.590
and with my representatives just
what to accept, where to travel

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:21.384
to, where it's OK, and
trying to schedule things

00:50:21.384 --> 00:50:23.050
where the whole family
can come with me.

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:25.850
And it's just that
kind of thinking

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:32.090
that always has to be
being used up in my mind.

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:37.060
EMILY NISHI: So we're
going to wrap it up.

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:38.690
Thank you so much, Lea.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:41.980
I wanted to ask if you had
any parting words, as we start

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:45.642
to close, related to
actually being Filipino,

00:50:45.642 --> 00:50:47.600
and some of the work
you're doing with PhilDev.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.470
We'd love to hear
any advice for us

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:51.851
as we try to engage with our
community and inspire others

00:50:51.851 --> 00:50:52.350
ourselves.

00:50:54.389 --> 00:50:56.930
LEA SALONGA: Well, first of all,
to everybody here at Google,

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:58.471
thank you for the
invitation to come.

00:50:58.471 --> 00:51:01.670
I mean, as a nerd and
as a bit of a geek,

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:05.780
you have no idea how happy
I am to be here right now.

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.369
You just don't.

00:51:08.369 --> 00:51:08.910
There's that.

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:11.420
And for me to be able to share
a little bit of myself with you.

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.336
And since it's going to
stream on YouTube, hi.

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:18.560
It Is wonderful to align
oneself with an organization,

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.265
like PhilDev.

00:51:21.265 --> 00:51:24.020
And because I'm one
who believes more

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.610
in the "teach a man
to fish" approach

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:28.630
to life than "give a man a fish.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.120
And I learned this
firsthand, because I

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.916
put my younger brother
through music school.

00:51:35.916 --> 00:51:37.290
The return of
investment is going

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:41.910
to be incredibly high for
the rest of his natural life,

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:43.950
for as long as it keeps
on creating music,

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:49.080
for as long as he makes
this world a better place.

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:54.320
One, he's an incredibly
gifted musician.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.400
And the whole family felt
recognizing this gift,

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.060
we have to invest
in his education.

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:02.860
And it is that kind of approach
that I guess that PhilDev

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:07.740
is employing that
I feel resonates.

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:11.520
And being able to help raise
funds for the organization,

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.470
and being one to bring awareness
to the Filipino community

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:18.910
about this organization, it's
incredibly rewarding for me.

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:21.150
So I mean, thanks to
PhilDev for the invitation

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:25.500
to be part of Filipino
American History Month,

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.590
and to help kick it
off this weekend.

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:28.590
So, it's pretty awesome.

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:35.939
[APPLAUSE]
