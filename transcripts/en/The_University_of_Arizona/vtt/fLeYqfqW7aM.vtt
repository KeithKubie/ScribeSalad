KYLE MORRISON: I grew up with
dogs my whole life used them

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.920
for hunting.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.070
And hunting for explosives
or hunting for other animals

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.280
is very similar.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.170
I wanted a dog that's
good with people

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.630
that I can work,
large venues around,

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.070
large gatherings of people.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.570
So that's-- that
was very important.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.340
That he be social.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.190
I'm with him 40, 50 hours a week
while working and also at home.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.840
He's in my house.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.420
So at home he's just
like my other dogs.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.477
He's free in the house.

00:00:33.477 --> 00:00:35.560
Obviously we need that
relationship because I need

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.140
to know if he's--

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.509
how he's working that day.

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:41.050
We use the term "it
runs down leash."

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.740
So he senses if I'm
stressed or I'm upset.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.240
It runs right down
the leash to him.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.180
So it really is a dog team.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.660
SHELBY SMITH: Canine Companions
actually matches them for us.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.170
So they matched
Picasso and I based

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.630
on what they thought
was the best fit

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.150
and how he would work for me.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.740
They got it right (LAUGHING).

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.239
That's for sure.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.530
Picasso to me is just
more than independence,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.230
he's my best friend.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.870
He's somebody and
lean on, depend on

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.530
to get through daily
challenges that

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.430
comes with having a disability.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.710
So he's just my whole world.
