can being this hinge state buffer state
for any number of reasons that it

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:14.750
for any number of reasons that it
 

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:16.419
for any number of reasons that it

only Eastern Bloc but also to other
 

01:18:20.719 --> 01:18:23.500
only Eastern Bloc but also to other
parts of the world and so I think it's

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:23.510
parts of the world and so I think it's
 

01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:29.070
parts of the world and so I think it's
it's the war is also being productive

historical reason santa is an
 

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:29.700
historical reason santa is an
ideological reason so this is important

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:29.710
ideological reason so this is important
 

01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:32.880
ideological reason so this is important
this is a emergency topic I think that

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:32.890
this is a emergency topic I think that
 

01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:36.270
this is a emergency topic I think that
we have to consider and to end my

01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:36.280
we have to consider and to end my
 

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.990
we have to consider and to end my
reflection and even nowadays the

01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000
reflection and even nowadays the
 

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.740

restoration is using as an ideological

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:43.750
restoration is using as an ideological
 

01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:46.650
restoration is using as an ideological
instrument to change history because if

01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:46.660
instrument to change history because if
 

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:51.110
instrument to change history because if
you for instance one nation that

some buildings that were built in the
 

01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:14.070
some buildings that were built in the
70s now they are pulling down with a

01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080
70s now they are pulling down with a
 

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.820
70s now they are pulling down with a
quite a lot of comments and polemics but

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:17.830
quite a lot of comments and polemics but
 

01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:20.130
quite a lot of comments and polemics but
because these buildings are there

01:24:20.130 --> 01:24:20.140
because these buildings are there
 

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:21.480

register so they are using the
 

01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:31.920

very important theme and we we should
 

01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:57.000
very important theme and we we should
think about it make a brief comment on

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:57.010
think about it make a brief comment on
 

01:24:57.010 --> 01:25:00.330
think about it make a brief comment on
that and in a sense the opposite sort of

it's in a way that's also sort of

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:27.550
it's in a way that's also sort of
 

01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:28.680
it's in a way that's also sort of

of it's sort of a passive way of
 

01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:35.270

every case I think there was a lot of

01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:51.240
every case I think there was a lot of
 

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.000
every case I think there was a lot of
projection for a state image was

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:54.010
projection for a state image was
 

01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:55.530
projection for a state image was
constructed through architecture several

01:25:55.530 --> 01:25:55.540
constructed through architecture several
 

01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:56.850
constructed through architecture several
different kinds of architecture and

01:25:56.850 --> 01:25:56.860
different kinds of architecture and
 

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:59.130
different kinds of architecture and
several kinds of operations through

01:25:59.130 --> 01:25:59.140
several kinds of operations through
 

01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:02.460
several kinds of operations through
architecture but you pointed out in the

01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:02.470
architecture but you pointed out in the
 

01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:03.630
architecture but you pointed out in the
paper about Spain that there was a

01:26:03.630 --> 01:26:03.640
paper about Spain that there was a
 

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.370
paper about Spain that there was a
disjunction for example about actually

01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:05.380
disjunction for example about actually
 

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:06.840
disjunction for example about actually
there was a disjunction not just I would

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:06.850
there was a disjunction not just I would
 

01:26:06.850 --> 01:26:09.090
there was a disjunction not just I would
say not toward the end necessarily just

01:26:09.090 --> 01:26:09.100
say not toward the end necessarily just
 

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:10.740
say not toward the end necessarily just
toward the end but I guess throughout

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:10.750
toward the end but I guess throughout
 

01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:13.860
toward the end but I guess throughout
the period that your mapping of a what

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:13.870
the period that your mapping of a what
 

01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:15.690
the period that your mapping of a what
was projected in the home front so to

01:26:15.690 --> 01:26:15.700
was projected in the home front so to
 

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:17.340
was projected in the home front so to
speak and what was projected abroad and

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:17.350
speak and what was projected abroad and
 

01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:18.570
speak and what was projected abroad and
they were actually rather different

01:26:18.570 --> 01:26:18.580
they were actually rather different
 

01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:21.480
they were actually rather different
images you spoke with eco spoke about a

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:21.490
images you spoke with eco spoke about a
 

01:26:21.490 --> 01:26:25.170
images you spoke with eco spoke about a
sort of desire to or aspiration toward

01:26:25.170 --> 01:26:25.180
sort of desire to or aspiration toward
 

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:27.960
sort of desire to or aspiration toward
certain kind of cosmopolitanism which is

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:27.970
certain kind of cosmopolitanism which is
 

01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:29.810
certain kind of cosmopolitanism which is
very of course very evident in the

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:29.820
very of course very evident in the
 

01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:31.580
very of course very evident in the
the absorption of certain very specific

01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:31.590
the absorption of certain very specific
 

01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:34.879
the absorption of certain very specific
kinds of iconography and ash you spoke

01:26:34.879 --> 01:26:34.889
kinds of iconography and ash you spoke
 

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:37.040
kinds of iconography and ash you spoke
it's interesting because of course you

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:37.050
it's interesting because of course you
 

01:26:37.050 --> 01:26:39.800
it's interesting because of course you
have shown for sources which are for

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:39.810
have shown for sources which are for
 

01:26:39.810 --> 01:26:41.660
have shown for sources which are for
kind of polished published sources that

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:41.670
kind of polished published sources that
 

01:26:41.670 --> 01:26:43.520
kind of polished published sources that
translated or importantly sources yeah

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:43.530
translated or importantly sources yeah
 

01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:46.819
translated or importantly sources yeah
so of course who wear those books really

01:26:46.819 --> 01:26:46.829
so of course who wear those books really
 

01:26:46.829 --> 01:26:48.890
so of course who wear those books really
published for write their books not

01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:48.900
published for write their books not
 

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:50.359
published for write their books not
really necessarily for the home front

01:26:50.359 --> 01:26:50.369
really necessarily for the home front
 

01:26:50.369 --> 01:26:54.350
really necessarily for the home front
and so in both in all cases I wonder if

01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360
and so in both in all cases I wonder if
 

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.370
and so in both in all cases I wonder if
we could speak a little bit about this

01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:55.380
we could speak a little bit about this
 

01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:58.370
we could speak a little bit about this
subject and particularly because tracing

01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:58.380
subject and particularly because tracing
 

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:00.950
subject and particularly because tracing
be the limits of the reception of

01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960
be the limits of the reception of
 

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.240
be the limits of the reception of
architecture is very problematic very

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:02.250
architecture is very problematic very
 

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:03.770
architecture is very problematic very
difficult because of course it takes on

01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:03.780
difficult because of course it takes on
 

01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:05.180
difficult because of course it takes on
so many different cultural other

01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:05.190
so many different cultural other
 

01:27:05.190 --> 01:27:06.890
so many different cultural other
cultural forms it depends you could

01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:06.900
cultural forms it depends you could
 

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:09.020
cultural forms it depends you could
almost say another kind of kinds of

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:09.030
almost say another kind of kinds of
 

01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:11.540
almost say another kind of kinds of
cultural forms and media apparatuses

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:11.550
cultural forms and media apparatuses
 

01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:14.450
cultural forms and media apparatuses
which are sometimes related to the State

01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460
which are sometimes related to the State
 

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.490
which are sometimes related to the State
apparatuses and sometimes not so I

01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:16.500
apparatuses and sometimes not so I
 

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:17.569
apparatuses and sometimes not so I
wonder if we could talk about this a

01:27:17.569 --> 01:27:17.579
wonder if we could talk about this a
 

01:27:17.579 --> 01:27:22.220
wonder if we could talk about this a
little bit for himself in in Spain the

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:22.230
little bit for himself in in Spain the
 

01:27:22.230 --> 01:27:26.000
little bit for himself in in Spain the
end of the 50s was very surprising

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:26.010
end of the 50s was very surprising
 

01:27:26.010 --> 01:27:30.560
end of the 50s was very surprising
because Franco system became some kind

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:30.570
because Franco system became some kind
 

01:27:30.570 --> 01:27:42.859
because Franco system became some kind
of schizophrenic inside you read the

01:27:42.859 --> 01:27:42.869
of schizophrenic inside you read the
 

01:27:42.869 --> 01:27:45.260
of schizophrenic inside you read the
papers on you see or you see the things

architecture and this state certainly
there are different kind of temporal

01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:55.270
there are different kind of temporal
 

01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:56.910
there are different kind of temporal

01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:56.920
frameworks that are imposed on a history

of architecture in the history of the
 

01:36:58.030 --> 01:37:01.340
of architecture in the history of the

architectural history one wonders
whether that is the most it's certainly

01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:14.950
whether that is the most it's certainly
 

01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:16.980
whether that is the most it's certainly
necessary sometimes but whether it's the

01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:16.990
necessary sometimes but whether it's the
 

01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:20.040

most productive and in the case of each

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:20.050
most productive and in the case of each

of your presentations I thought that

01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:24.430
of your presentations I thought that
 

01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:27.090
of your presentations I thought that
maybe a more expanded framework is I

01:37:27.090 --> 01:37:27.100
maybe a more expanded framework is I
 

01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:28.430

very much on the state as a history of
the state as a kind of chronology and I

was wondering whether there might not be

was wondering whether there might not be
 

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:37.860
was wondering whether there might not be
a way of opening that up a little bit

01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:37.870
a way of opening that up a little bit
 

01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:40.730
a way of opening that up a little bit

kind of comment on the frames that you
 

01:39:01.659 --> 01:39:04.439
kind of comment on the frames that you
picked because it seems like the
