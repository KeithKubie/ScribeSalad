00:00:00.688 --> 00:00:05.141
- Hello everyone and welcome
to Khan Academy live SAT class.

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:07.523
My name is Eric Li, I'm an SAT tutor

00:00:07.523 --> 00:00:11.068
and one of the SAT experts
here at Khan Academy.

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:13.555
I'm so excited to be joining you today

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:15.334
and over the course of
the next three weeks

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:19.346
as we practice and prepare for the SAT.

00:00:19.346 --> 00:00:23.073
Before we jump into SAT math,
which is the topic for today,

00:00:23.073 --> 00:00:25.435
I wanna give you a sneak
peek at what's coming ahead

00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:27.378
over the course of the next three weeks.

00:00:27.378 --> 00:00:28.224
Let's take a look.

00:00:28.224 --> 00:00:32.626
So, today, like I said,
we'll be covering SAT math,

00:00:32.626 --> 00:00:35.515
but next Thursday, I'll walk us through

00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:38.388
some SAT reading topics
and the following Thursday,

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:40.889
we'll cover SAT writing.

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:43.171
Now each of these classes
is going to take place

00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:46.990
Thursday nights at 7:00 p.m.
Eastern, 4:00 p.m. Pacific,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.610
and we're covering a
different topic each time

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.554
so make sure to tune in.

00:00:50.554 --> 00:00:52.958
Now if you can't make
any of these classes,

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.996
don't worry because we'll
record all of the classes

00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:58.463
and send them out to everyone afterwards

00:00:58.463 --> 00:01:01.713
so you can review it whenever you want.

00:01:01.713 --> 00:01:03.794
So I'm super excited to
be going through this.

00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:07.961
And for today, we're gonna
focus on math like I mentioned.

00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:10.774
So what's the plan for today?

00:01:10.774 --> 00:01:12.975
Well, the first 25 minutes of today,

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:14.906
I'm gonna walk through how to avoid

00:01:14.906 --> 00:01:17.401
careless mistakes in the SAT math section.

00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:19.846
Next I'll show you how to approach

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.597
function notation problems,
which are a common concept

00:01:22.597 --> 00:01:25.231
tested in the SAT math section.

00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:28.080
Then in the next 25
minutes, you'll get a chance

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.869
to practice what you've
learned on Khan Academy.

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.542
And while you're practicing,
we'll have Khan Academy

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:37.622
and College Board staff on standby

00:01:37.622 --> 00:01:39.753
who can chat with you one on one about,

00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:42.602
and answer any question
you have about SAT math,

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.681
reading, writing, or anything SAT related.

00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:47.665
You'll want to make sure to
practice during this time though

00:01:47.665 --> 00:01:50.303
because these staff members
are only gonna be on

00:01:50.303 --> 00:01:52.800
until the end of the hour.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.421
Then in the last 10 minutes of class,

00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.362
I'll answer a few
questions, discuss homework

00:01:57.362 --> 00:01:58.860
and the plan for the next class,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.442
and then you'll get your badge
for completing the class.

00:02:01.442 --> 00:02:02.306
But remember you have to stay

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:05.225
to the very end of the
class to get that badge.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.599
So, that's the plan for
the next three weeks

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.123
and what we're going to cover today.

00:02:10.123 --> 00:02:13.282
And I'm so excited to
get started with SAT math

00:02:13.282 --> 00:02:16.819
and to help you practice and
prepare for your upcoming test.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.207
Let's jump in.

00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:21.005
So why are we talking
about careless mistakes?

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.897
Well, let me know if
any of these questions

00:02:24.897 --> 00:02:25.978
sound familiar to you.

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:29.365
So, have you ever solved
for the wrong variable

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:31.351
in an SAT math question?

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.510
Or maybe you missed a question because

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.873
your final answer was in the wrong units.

00:02:36.873 --> 00:02:38.762
Or maybe you were
working through a problem

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:41.702
and you stopped one step
short of the right answer.

00:02:41.702 --> 00:02:43.248
You were almost there, but not quite.

00:02:43.248 --> 00:02:46.151
Or maybe you went one step too far.

00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:49.281
Or maybe you made a simple
addition or subtraction error.

00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:52.401
Or this one is probably
the most annoying to me,

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:54.613
maybe you even got the right answer,

00:02:54.613 --> 00:02:55.651
but then you didn't transfer

00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:58.298
the right answer to the answer sheet.

00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:00.729
Well, all of these types of mistakes

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:04.588
are perfectly common human
mistakes that anyone can make.

00:03:04.588 --> 00:03:06.076
But what I'm gonna show you today

00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:08.638
is a process that's really helped me

00:03:08.638 --> 00:03:11.353
and helped other students
reduce the number

00:03:11.353 --> 00:03:12.796
of careless mistakes they make.

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:14.538
There are other ways to go about it,

00:03:14.538 --> 00:03:18.645
but this is one process that's
worked really well for me.

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:20.236
So let's take a look.

00:03:20.236 --> 00:03:22.902
So there are really four steps
that I'd recommend you take

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:25.631
to cut down on careless mistakes.

00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:28.169
So the first one is just
to read and understand

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.760
the question and any charts
or tables that you have.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.920
Now this is both the question
and any charts or tables,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.419
so don't move on until you
really understand everything.

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.523
And one thing you can do
here is underline as you go

00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:43.372
sentence by sentence to
break down the question

00:03:43.372 --> 00:03:46.612
rather than trying to
take it all in at once.

00:03:46.612 --> 00:03:49.259
The next thing I'd recommend
is that you think through

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.029
the steps you need to
take to solve the problem.

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:54.433
So this includes things like figuring out

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:57.938
which variable you're
solving for, so X or Y.

00:03:57.938 --> 00:03:59.520
This is thinking about what units

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.299
your final answer needs to be in.

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.434
And any operations that you need to do

00:04:04.434 --> 00:04:06.684
to get to the right answer.

00:04:09.188 --> 00:04:11.332
Once you know what steps
you're going to follow,

00:04:11.332 --> 00:04:13.923
you can then start
actually doing the math.

00:04:13.923 --> 00:04:17.161
I would do this on paper
or in the calculator.

00:04:17.161 --> 00:04:19.794
And I'd really discourage
you from doing the math

00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:21.954
in your head, 'cause
no matter how confident

00:04:21.954 --> 00:04:23.870
you might feel about the problem,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.110
the moment you're doing mental,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.935
you start doing more mental calculations,

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:31.216
you really up your chances
of making a careless mistake.

00:04:31.216 --> 00:04:34.741
Now, the last and final step
that I'd suggest you take is

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:37.183
to mark down the answer
in your test booklet

00:04:37.183 --> 00:04:38.709
before bubbling it in.

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:40.959
So say our answer was B 64.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.433
Then I'd recommend you
circle it or you write it

00:04:46.433 --> 00:04:49.756
and you box it so that when
you're transferring answers

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:52.646
for this problem to the answer sheet,

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:56.221
you have no doubt in the
world that your answer is B

00:04:56.221 --> 00:04:58.830
and the right answer makes it over there.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.923
So, to recap, you're gonna
wanna read and understand

00:05:01.923 --> 00:05:04.580
the question and any charts or tables.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.876
Think through the steps you need

00:05:05.876 --> 00:05:07.658
to take to solve the problem.

00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:09.872
Do the math on paper
or in your calculator.

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:11.885
And then mark down the
answer in your test booklet

00:05:11.885 --> 00:05:13.342
before bubbling it in.

00:05:13.342 --> 00:05:17.509
So this is a process that
we're going to now apply

00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:20.652
to real SAT math questions.

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:23.070
And let's take a look
at what this looks like.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.444
The first question will
be more straightforward

00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:27.684
and then we'll see how this applies

00:05:27.684 --> 00:05:30.735
to more complex questions as we go.

00:05:30.735 --> 00:05:34.530
So, let's take a look
at this first question.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.391
So, first step is to read
and understand the problem.

00:05:38.391 --> 00:05:42.779
So during a timed test,
Alexander typed 742 words

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:46.089
in 14 minutes, okay,
742 words in 14 minutes,

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:49.017
that's seems worth underlining.

00:05:49.017 --> 00:05:52.242
Assuming Alexander works at
this rate for the next hour,

00:05:52.242 --> 00:05:54.602
which of the following best approximates

00:05:54.602 --> 00:05:58.573
the number of words he
would type in that hour?

00:05:58.573 --> 00:06:01.691
Okay, so I have some information

00:06:01.691 --> 00:06:05.452
and for me it's helpful to write down

00:06:05.452 --> 00:06:08.383
the information I have
since it just helps me

00:06:08.383 --> 00:06:10.232
better understand it.

00:06:10.232 --> 00:06:13.137
We have 742 words in 14 minutes

00:06:13.137 --> 00:06:16.848
and then the question is, how many words

00:06:16.848 --> 00:06:19.062
would Alexander type in one hour,

00:06:19.062 --> 00:06:22.229
so in this case it's 60 minutes, okay.

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:24.095
So I understand the question

00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:26.352
and the information
that's been given to me.

00:06:26.352 --> 00:06:28.483
And the next thing I wanna do
is think through the process

00:06:28.483 --> 00:06:31.226
I wanna follow to solve this question.

00:06:31.226 --> 00:06:33.506
So I think the first thing I could do

00:06:33.506 --> 00:06:37.173
is figure out how many
words per one minute,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.352
per one minute, and then
because the question

00:06:42.352 --> 00:06:45.564
is asking me how many words
would he type in one hour,

00:06:45.564 --> 00:06:49.643
the second thing I can
do is multiply by 60.

00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:50.856
So that seems like a good process

00:06:50.856 --> 00:06:53.554
and will get me all the
way to the final answer.

00:06:53.554 --> 00:06:56.069
So now we can actually
start doing the math.

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:58.282
So to calculate words per one minute,

00:06:58.282 --> 00:07:02.032
I can just do 742 words
divided by 14 minutes

00:07:05.828 --> 00:07:07.367
and I'll pull up my calculator.

00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:09.206
In the real thing, you won't have this

00:07:09.206 --> 00:07:11.502
digital calculator, you'll have your own.

00:07:11.502 --> 00:07:13.752
But just bear with me here.

00:07:15.353 --> 00:07:17.094
Here I have 53 words.

00:07:17.094 --> 00:07:19.677
That's 53 words per one minute.

00:07:21.347 --> 00:07:23.097
Words per one minute.

00:07:26.234 --> 00:07:27.396
But I'm not done yet, right?

00:07:27.396 --> 00:07:31.563
So the second step here is
to multiply by 60 minutes.

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:35.294
And the interesting
thing you'll notice here

00:07:35.294 --> 00:07:37.630
is once I multiply by 60 minutes,

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.141
I've actually got a minutes
factor in the numerator

00:07:40.141 --> 00:07:43.487
and a minutes in the denominator,

00:07:43.487 --> 00:07:46.196
any unit divided by itself
is just gonna be one,

00:07:46.196 --> 00:07:47.966
so that would go away.

00:07:47.966 --> 00:07:52.133
And then if I do this math of
53 times 60, let's do that.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.427
Multiply this by 60.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.750
We get the final answer of 3,180.

00:08:00.888 --> 00:08:04.802
And then last step is to
box that answer or write C

00:08:04.802 --> 00:08:08.969
so that there's no chance
of me missing, misbubbling.

00:08:09.962 --> 00:08:13.647
So one thing, the last thing
I wanna show you here is

00:08:13.647 --> 00:08:16.819
what the process does
in questions like this.

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:18.872
So because we knew that
we needed to solve first

00:08:18.872 --> 00:08:21.920
for the words per minute
and then multiply by 60,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.511
it meant that some of these other answers

00:08:24.511 --> 00:08:25.629
were less tempting.

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:28.046
So while we got 53 words here

00:08:29.154 --> 00:08:30.937
and while it was an answer choice,

00:08:30.937 --> 00:08:33.124
we knew that that wasn't
the right final answer

00:08:33.124 --> 00:08:36.014
because we hadn't taken
the second step here

00:08:36.014 --> 00:08:38.687
of multiplying by 60
minutes to get to the hour.

00:08:38.687 --> 00:08:41.560
Hopefully this shows you
how to apply this process

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.074
with a question that has a few steps in it

00:08:44.074 --> 00:08:46.331
and you're dealing with some units.

00:08:46.331 --> 00:08:50.850
But let's see how this process
stacks up when we apply it to

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.575
a different kind of
question, different scenario.

00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:57.383
So in this next question,
let's give it a read.

00:08:57.383 --> 00:09:00.164
Geometry students
participated in an activity

00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:02.580
to classify the shapes in the room

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.660
by number of sides and color, okay.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.211
The table above displays the results,

00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:11.463
and then if a triangle
is chosen at random,

00:09:11.463 --> 00:09:14.960
what is the probability that it is blue?

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.808
Okay, so, we're classifying shapes

00:09:17.808 --> 00:09:21.808
and we have, we wanna
understand the probability

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.170
that if a triangle is chosen at random,

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.059
what's the probability that it is blue?

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:30.046
So before I move on from here,

00:09:30.046 --> 00:09:31.246
just 'cause I understand the question,

00:09:31.246 --> 00:09:33.905
doesn't mean I'm ready to
actually start solving it yet.

00:09:33.905 --> 00:09:36.916
Because in this case,
we have this table here

00:09:36.916 --> 00:09:38.786
that we want to tackle first.

00:09:38.786 --> 00:09:40.339
So let's take a look and make sure

00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:42.513
we understand the table
before we go any further.

00:09:42.513 --> 00:09:45.132
So we've got shapes on the left hand side,

00:09:45.132 --> 00:09:48.056
we've got these colors
here of red and blue.

00:09:48.056 --> 00:09:49.328
And then these total columns.

00:09:49.328 --> 00:09:53.594
So total, this total column
on the right hand side

00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:56.819
seems to be the number of shapes.

00:09:56.819 --> 00:09:59.480
And then this one on the bottom,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.311
this total column is number
of shapes that are by color,

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:07.000
and this one is shapes by type, okay?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.742
Okay, so now I understand the question,

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:12.144
I understand the table,
and now I can start

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:14.478
to think about how I would solve this.

00:10:14.478 --> 00:10:16.329
So, let's read that question again.

00:10:16.329 --> 00:10:19.782
If a triangle is chosen at
random from this activity,

00:10:19.782 --> 00:10:21.847
what is the probability that it is blue?

00:10:21.847 --> 00:10:26.014
So that to me says that
I'm gonna be focusing here

00:10:26.883 --> 00:10:29.827
on just the triangles because it says,

00:10:29.827 --> 00:10:31.836
if a triangle is chosen at random,

00:10:31.836 --> 00:10:34.580
so I'm not worrying about
these quadrilaterals

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.397
or the pentagons or the others.

00:10:37.397 --> 00:10:38.529
And then it's asking me,

00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:40.646
what is the probability that it is blue?

00:10:40.646 --> 00:10:44.163
Well, I've got the blue triangles here.

00:10:44.163 --> 00:10:46.107
There are three blue triangles

00:10:46.107 --> 00:10:49.644
and probability is always how many chances

00:10:49.644 --> 00:10:53.286
of getting something out of
the total number of chances.

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:56.916
That total number of
triangles then is here.

00:10:56.916 --> 00:10:59.387
And you've got three out of four.

00:10:59.387 --> 00:11:02.221
Now what I want to point out here is

00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:04.850
in this problem, understanding
the table was crucial

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.390
because you'll notice if you look at some

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.799
of the other answer choices,
the totals that you have

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:15.672
in the rest of the table
are also present here

00:11:15.672 --> 00:11:19.322
and if you didn't take your
time to understand the table,

00:11:19.322 --> 00:11:21.740
it might've been tempting to use

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.051
some of these other variables
that you see in the table

00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:28.641
like the 16, the eight
or even this one as well.

00:11:28.641 --> 00:11:30.976
But if you follow an organized process

00:11:30.976 --> 00:11:34.625
then that's how you can cut
down on these kinds of mistakes.

00:11:34.625 --> 00:11:38.429
So, we've done now a question with units

00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:40.211
and a few steps in the process.

00:11:40.211 --> 00:11:42.412
We've done a question now with a chart

00:11:42.412 --> 00:11:44.370
that you've been presented.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.493
Now let's take a look at what happens

00:11:46.493 --> 00:11:48.303
with a problem that has a few steps in it

00:11:48.303 --> 00:11:51.851
and you don't have a diagram drawn for you

00:11:51.851 --> 00:11:53.836
or a chart presented to you this time.

00:11:53.836 --> 00:11:54.669
Let's take a look.

00:11:54.669 --> 00:11:57.888
So let's give this problem a read.

00:11:57.888 --> 00:12:02.151
Cara is hanging a poster
that is 91 centimeters wide

00:12:02.151 --> 00:12:04.055
in her room, okay?

00:12:04.055 --> 00:12:07.133
The center of the wall is 180 centimeters

00:12:07.133 --> 00:12:09.792
from the right end of the wall, okay?

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:13.124
If Cara hangs the poster so
that the center of the poster

00:12:13.124 --> 00:12:16.207
is located at the center of the wall,

00:12:17.485 --> 00:12:20.971
how far will the left and
right edges of the poster be

00:12:20.971 --> 00:12:23.926
from the right end of the wall?

00:12:23.926 --> 00:12:26.398
Okay, so a little bit more information

00:12:26.398 --> 00:12:28.043
to work with this time, right?

00:12:28.043 --> 00:12:30.460
But this is where
breaking down the problem

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.851
piece by piece and drawing
a diagram as you go

00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:35.727
can really be helpful.

00:12:35.727 --> 00:12:37.050
So let's take a read.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.939
Cara is hanging a poster,
it's 91 centimeters,

00:12:39.939 --> 00:12:41.965
so I've got my beautiful poster,

00:12:41.965 --> 00:12:45.298
excuse my inability to
draw straight lines.

00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:47.048
So this is my poster.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.933
And we've got 91 centimeters here.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.280
And then I've got a wall that
I'm hanging this inside of.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.447
So if I draw this wall, and
it says the center of the wall

00:13:01.508 --> 00:13:05.369
is 180 centimeters from
the right end of the wall.

00:13:05.369 --> 00:13:07.451
So then I'm just gonna estimate

00:13:07.451 --> 00:13:09.938
the center's gotta be about there.

00:13:09.938 --> 00:13:13.356
If this is the center, the center is

00:13:13.356 --> 00:13:16.514
180 centimeters from the right.

00:13:16.514 --> 00:13:18.931
So we've got 180 centimeters.

00:13:20.387 --> 00:13:23.884
And then I have this diagram
and now I'm putting the poster

00:13:23.884 --> 00:13:26.072
so that the center of the poster

00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:28.851
is located at the center of the wall.

00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:32.768
So then I'm gonna move
that poster inside here.

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:37.414
And then this again is 91 centimeters.

00:13:41.205 --> 00:13:43.108
And now what is the question now?

00:13:43.108 --> 00:13:47.441
Now I have this diagram that
can help me solve the problem.

00:13:47.441 --> 00:13:49.936
The question is how far will
the left and right edges

00:13:49.936 --> 00:13:53.384
of the poster be from the
right end of the wall.

00:13:53.384 --> 00:13:56.122
Okay, so I've got this
right end of the wall.

00:13:56.122 --> 00:13:58.322
And I wanna know this distance,

00:13:58.322 --> 00:14:02.251
so the left edge of the poster
to the right end of the wall.

00:14:02.251 --> 00:14:04.216
And then the right edge of the poster

00:14:04.216 --> 00:14:06.756
to the right end of the wall.

00:14:06.756 --> 00:14:09.448
And I can label this one l and then

00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:14.132
I'll just change colors
here, this one I'll label r.

00:14:14.132 --> 00:14:15.578
So now that I have the diagram,

00:14:15.578 --> 00:14:18.873
it really helps to clarify
what I'm dealing with

00:14:18.873 --> 00:14:20.641
and what I'm solving for.

00:14:20.641 --> 00:14:22.869
So let's take these one by one.

00:14:22.869 --> 00:14:24.612
So if want to solve for this distance of l

00:14:24.612 --> 00:14:27.705
from the left edge of the
poster to the right wall.

00:14:27.705 --> 00:14:30.700
It looks like this 180 centimeters here

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.414
is a pretty good starting point.

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:34.954
So if I, it's at least 180 centimeters

00:14:34.954 --> 00:14:36.872
since I'm all the way to the center

00:14:36.872 --> 00:14:39.450
and then I have this half of the poster

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.988
that is just to the left of the wall.

00:14:42.988 --> 00:14:47.279
And because I know that this
poster is 91 centimeters wide,

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.612
I can add 91 divided by two.

00:14:51.666 --> 00:14:55.233
Then this should get me the value of l.

00:14:55.233 --> 00:14:57.570
If I do open up this calculator,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.570
I've got 180 plus 91 divided by two.

00:15:04.508 --> 00:15:07.072
And that'll get me 225.5.

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:08.572
225.5 centimeters.

00:15:11.813 --> 00:15:15.063
And now I want to go to the right edge.

00:15:16.877 --> 00:15:20.008
And I think I can use
this 180 centimeters again

00:15:20.008 --> 00:15:21.817
as a reference point
since I know that poster

00:15:21.817 --> 00:15:23.330
is right in the middle, right?

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.747
So we've got 180 centimeters.

00:15:26.707 --> 00:15:30.470
And then this time,
this half of the poster

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.781
is actually closer to the
right edge of the wall

00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:35.910
than this one, instead
of adding something,

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.694
it looks like we'll have to subtract.

00:15:37.694 --> 00:15:41.287
And again since I know that
this is 91 centimeters total,

00:15:41.287 --> 00:15:44.037
I can subtract 91 divided by two.

00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:49.118
And then pull up that calculator again.

00:15:49.118 --> 00:15:53.285
180 minus 91 divided by two
gets me 134.5 centimeters.

00:16:02.281 --> 00:16:04.464
So then I want to look
at my answer choices now

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:07.464
and I've got the left edge at 225.5.

00:16:08.787 --> 00:16:11.701
Okay, well that's one's
out and that one's out.

00:16:11.701 --> 00:16:15.034
And then the right edge should be 134.5,

00:16:15.916 --> 00:16:18.583
then my final answer again is C.

00:16:19.832 --> 00:16:23.206
So in this problem, it was very important

00:16:23.206 --> 00:16:27.190
to work through the
information given to you

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.158
step by step and to draw a diagram

00:16:30.158 --> 00:16:32.428
to help you work through
it piece by piece.

00:16:32.428 --> 00:16:35.428
Because if you had done the simpler,

00:16:36.288 --> 00:16:39.095
tried to skip through and do it mentally,

00:16:39.095 --> 00:16:43.038
you might've done 180 minus 91 or plus 91

00:16:43.038 --> 00:16:46.006
and you would've missed
some of the nuances

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.098
in this problem, but once
you draw the diagram,

00:16:48.098 --> 00:16:51.581
it becomes a lot easier to work through.

00:16:51.581 --> 00:16:54.831
So we've now done a handful of problems

00:16:55.809 --> 00:16:57.941
to show you how you can use this process

00:16:57.941 --> 00:17:01.152
to really reduce your chances
of making careless mistakes.

00:17:01.152 --> 00:17:03.207
And now I wanna move us on to

00:17:03.207 --> 00:17:05.367
tackling function notation problems.

00:17:05.367 --> 00:17:08.867
So let's keep going and let's take a look.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.360
So, function notation.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.527
Before I actually start
doing practice problems here,

00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:20.445
I just want to walk you through

00:17:20.445 --> 00:17:22.793
a quick review of function notations.

00:17:22.793 --> 00:17:24.695
So what is a function first?

00:17:24.695 --> 00:17:26.945
Well a function, a function

00:17:29.368 --> 00:17:32.121
is a mathematical expression that takes in

00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:33.704
one or more inputs,

00:17:37.295 --> 00:17:41.462
inputs, and generates only
one output, one output.

00:17:43.568 --> 00:17:46.510
And that's really key though,
having one or more inputs,

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:50.061
but all of those only ever
generating one unique output

00:17:50.061 --> 00:17:52.936
is what really sets a function apart.

00:17:52.936 --> 00:17:56.067
Now a few ways you might
see functions notated

00:17:56.067 --> 00:18:00.234
in the SAT is something
like f of x or maybe h of x

00:18:04.687 --> 00:18:06.792
or you might see a
composition of functions

00:18:06.792 --> 00:18:09.042
where you have f of h of x,

00:18:11.489 --> 00:18:15.406
and this is also equivalent
to this f o h of x,

00:18:18.335 --> 00:18:21.900
these two expressions are the same thing

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.327
just a different kind of notation.

00:18:24.327 --> 00:18:28.494
Now, let's say for example,
f of x equals x plus one.

00:18:30.363 --> 00:18:32.267
Another way you might see function show up

00:18:32.267 --> 00:18:34.887
is in a table format, so, in this case,

00:18:34.887 --> 00:18:39.325
you have this nice table
here of x and f of x.

00:18:39.325 --> 00:18:43.492
And for given values of x,
given this definition of f of x,

00:18:45.441 --> 00:18:49.103
you'd have certain values of f of x.

00:18:49.103 --> 00:18:50.882
So this is one way you might see it.

00:18:50.882 --> 00:18:53.745
And then the last way you might see

00:18:53.745 --> 00:18:56.312
a function show up is graphically.

00:18:56.312 --> 00:19:00.982
So here we have a graph where
there's x and there's f of x.

00:19:00.982 --> 00:19:04.399
And for example, there's one, two, three.

00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:08.602
And you've got one, two, three.

00:19:10.811 --> 00:19:14.023
For certain values of x, you might have

00:19:14.023 --> 00:19:17.273
corresponding values of f of x or y.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.939
With a chart like this
you can really trace

00:19:20.939 --> 00:19:24.260
on the x-axis and then go up and see what

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.967
the corresponding y
value or f of x value is

00:19:27.967 --> 00:19:30.090
at that value of x.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.237
So these are really,
this really covers a lot

00:19:33.237 --> 00:19:36.038
of the different ways
that function notation

00:19:36.038 --> 00:19:37.738
can show up in the SAT.

00:19:37.738 --> 00:19:40.619
But you haven't seen a
practice problem yet,

00:19:40.619 --> 00:19:45.072
let's now apply what we've
seen here to see it in action.

00:19:45.072 --> 00:19:46.854
So let's take a look here.

00:19:46.854 --> 00:19:49.484
Just 'cause we're no
longer focusing exclusively

00:19:49.484 --> 00:19:52.382
on careless mistakes,
doesn't mean we're changing

00:19:52.382 --> 00:19:55.663
our process though, so
same process as before.

00:19:55.663 --> 00:19:57.606
Consider the table shown above.

00:19:57.606 --> 00:20:00.971
What is the value of f of f of four?

00:20:00.971 --> 00:20:03.277
Okay, so I've got that as the question.

00:20:03.277 --> 00:20:07.031
And then I have a table here,
so for a given values of x,

00:20:07.031 --> 00:20:10.500
then I have corresponding
values of f of x.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.583
We've got f of f of four.

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:17.602
So when you have a function
notation question like this,

00:20:17.602 --> 00:20:19.584
the key thing to remember
is that you want to work

00:20:19.584 --> 00:20:21.251
from the inside out.

00:20:23.137 --> 00:20:24.216
Now what do I mean by that?

00:20:24.216 --> 00:20:26.160
I mean that the first
thing you wanna solve for

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.712
is this f of four and
then you can worry about

00:20:29.712 --> 00:20:32.962
the f of f of, I may just rewrite that.

00:20:34.587 --> 00:20:37.170
Then you can worry about the f,

00:20:40.274 --> 00:20:41.524
f of f of four.

00:20:43.884 --> 00:20:46.021
If I solve first for f of four,

00:20:46.021 --> 00:20:48.329
it's really asking me,
what is the value of f of x

00:20:48.329 --> 00:20:50.690
when x is four here?

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.488
So if I've got, use the
table, I've got four

00:20:53.488 --> 00:20:57.578
and the corresponding
value of f of x is zero.

00:20:57.578 --> 00:21:01.951
So then this zero I can
substitute into here

00:21:01.951 --> 00:21:06.879
and then this expression
simplifies to just f of zero.

00:21:06.879 --> 00:21:08.537
Then I can return to the table.

00:21:08.537 --> 00:21:12.704
And for that value, when
x is zero, f of x is two.

00:21:14.777 --> 00:21:18.110
So I've got two, I box the right answer.

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:21.243
Realizing now all of the answers

00:21:21.243 --> 00:21:24.235
to the sample problems seem to be C.

00:21:24.235 --> 00:21:25.502
(laughing)

00:21:25.502 --> 00:21:27.083
Promise that was not on purpose.

00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:30.175
But let's keep going and
see what this looks like

00:21:30.175 --> 00:21:32.187
when the table's a bit more complicated

00:21:32.187 --> 00:21:37.101
or there are a few more pieces
of information to work with.

00:21:37.101 --> 00:21:39.949
Okay, consider the table shown at left.

00:21:39.949 --> 00:21:43.243
What is the value of g
of f of negative one?

00:21:43.243 --> 00:21:46.170
Okay, so for me I prefer to see this as

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:48.898
g of f of negative one,

00:21:48.898 --> 00:21:52.300
that's just easier for me to understand.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.834
It's always okay to rewrite a problem

00:21:54.834 --> 00:21:56.790
so that it's a, or rephrase it,

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.991
so that it's easier for you to understand.

00:21:58.991 --> 00:22:00.962
So again this is similar to the last one

00:22:00.962 --> 00:22:03.879
and I want to work from inside out.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.754
But, let me make sure I
understand the table first.

00:22:07.754 --> 00:22:11.357
So this time I've got
given values of x here.

00:22:11.357 --> 00:22:13.664
And then I've got f of x.

00:22:13.664 --> 00:22:17.133
And then I've got g of x up here, okay.

00:22:17.133 --> 00:22:21.133
So I want to solve then
inside and then outside.

00:22:25.952 --> 00:22:29.665
f of negative one then, so
for, let's go to the table,

00:22:29.665 --> 00:22:33.243
when x is negative one,
what is the value of f of x?

00:22:33.243 --> 00:22:35.335
So it looks like we're right there.

00:22:35.335 --> 00:22:36.956
We've got two.

00:22:36.956 --> 00:22:41.814
And then we can plug this in
similar to the last problem

00:22:41.814 --> 00:22:44.705
and simplify this to say g of two.

00:22:44.705 --> 00:22:46.544
And in this case we return to the table.

00:22:46.544 --> 00:22:48.297
We're looking at two.

00:22:48.297 --> 00:22:51.767
And then this time I'm looking at g of x,

00:22:51.767 --> 00:22:54.934
so then I'm looking over here at four.

00:22:56.694 --> 00:23:00.313
So this is another example
of function notation

00:23:00.313 --> 00:23:04.481
just with a different
way of expressing it.

00:23:04.481 --> 00:23:08.616
And now we'll do one final
function notation problem,

00:23:08.616 --> 00:23:10.533
this time with a graph.

00:23:11.531 --> 00:23:13.975
So let's keep moving.

00:23:13.975 --> 00:23:18.211
So what is the approximate
value of g of f of five?

00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:21.548
So, that one makes sense to me.

00:23:21.548 --> 00:23:23.209
And then on this left hand side,

00:23:23.209 --> 00:23:25.449
I have the graphs of the function of f

00:23:25.449 --> 00:23:27.622
and function g shown below.

00:23:27.622 --> 00:23:31.789
So here's f, here's g, and then
for certain values of x here

00:23:35.239 --> 00:23:38.072
the y values of f and g are shown.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.962
And okay, so I think I understand that.

00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:44.689
Now again, I want to solve inside out.

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:48.522
So f of five and then
I've got g of f of five.

00:23:50.483 --> 00:23:52.762
And what we can do here is,

00:23:52.762 --> 00:23:56.677
we'll now have to reference
the chart here, so.

00:23:56.677 --> 00:24:00.174
When x is five, to solve for f of five,

00:24:00.174 --> 00:24:01.902
what is the value of f?

00:24:01.902 --> 00:24:05.953
So what I can do is trace up through here.

00:24:05.953 --> 00:24:10.120
And it looks like I'm
intersecting f here at nine.

00:24:11.225 --> 00:24:15.951
Then the value of f when x
is five is going to be nine.

00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:19.351
And I can substitute that into here.

00:24:19.351 --> 00:24:21.601
And this becomes g of nine.

00:24:23.146 --> 00:24:26.021
And then I can look at the table here.

00:24:26.021 --> 00:24:30.043
So when x is nine, I'm
here, I can trace up

00:24:30.043 --> 00:24:32.596
and this time I'm looking at x.

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:37.170
And it looks like I'm
intersecting here at seven.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.794
So then this value is seven.

00:24:39.794 --> 00:24:41.544
I mark down seven.

00:24:41.544 --> 00:24:44.027
And you're good to go.

00:24:44.027 --> 00:24:46.694
So now you've seen a few ways to

00:24:49.794 --> 00:24:52.978
reduce the chances of making
careless mistakes on the SAT,

00:24:52.978 --> 00:24:54.667
you've seen a few
different flavors of that

00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:56.001
with a few different problems.

00:24:56.001 --> 00:24:57.958
And you've also seen a
few different examples

00:24:57.958 --> 00:25:00.243
of function notation problems.

00:25:00.243 --> 00:25:04.273
So now, it's probably
easier to follow along

00:25:04.273 --> 00:25:06.092
as I was working through it,

00:25:06.092 --> 00:25:08.618
but to see if you've understood it,

00:25:08.618 --> 00:25:11.696
it's now your turn to
practice what you've learned.

00:25:11.696 --> 00:25:14.437
So head to khanacademy.org/sat,

00:25:14.437 --> 00:25:16.380
