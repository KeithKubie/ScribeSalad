[inaudible] it's the best.

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.730
It's if you don't fucking,
if you don't have to go anywhere,

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.060
first of all,
if you don't have to go anywhere,
you know,
if you get,

9
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:34.880
you get a wife and you got a kid,
you don't have to go anywhere.

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.780
People just come into your place.
It's the best,
you know,

11
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.810
all your stuff is there in the end.
People help clean up.
We,
I had,

12
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.080
I literally,
I had the perfect thanksgiving.
It was perfect.

13
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.620
<v 1>Did I want to thank everyone involved?</v>

14
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.310
<v 0>Oh,
I can't yell at my daughter's asleep.
Fuck,
I'm taping this at night.</v>

15
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:58.370
Sunday night.
Um,

16
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.310
the potato sweet potato pie killed.
I think I gave out some misinformation.

17
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:08.510
I just bought the wrong kind of sweet potato.
I bought a,
uh,

18
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.310
it was the white one,
which I'm hurt.
I use for other desserts,
but not for the Pi.

19
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.090
But people do actually use sweet potatoes for sweet potato pie.
You can add,

20
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.580
also actually use yams.
That's what I used.
Yams,
brown sugar,

21
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.470
cinnamon,
some Nutmeg,
a little bit of ginger.
Um,

22
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.780
some vanilla,
whatever,

23
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.830
in a whole bunch of sugar stirred the whole thing together.
And I tell you,

24
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:37.880
I was sweating it.
Okay.
Fucking white guy making a sweet potato pie.

25
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:39.920
You know what I mean?
I mean,
I'm living dangerously here.

26
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.910
I thought I was going to get booed like at the Apollo and uh,

27
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.600
maybe people were just being nice,
but I think,
uh,
I think everybody liked it.

28
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.260
Um,
so I was psyched.
And then my stuffing always kills my stuffing.
Always kills.

29
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:54.800
You know why?

30
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.290
Because it starts off with me melting as an entire stick of butter in a pan.

31
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.600
That's where,
and I go from there.

32
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.490
I don't care what you're making,
you can't lose.

33
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:09.350
If you start by melting a stick of butter in a Pan,
you know,
um,

34
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.070
he's fucking lunatics nowadays.
They will take that,
oh,

35
00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:17.240
can I pour that entire thing into my coffee?
I don't know what's going on.

36
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.050
All right.
I have a lot of stuff to promote.
I apologize for the AC,

37
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:23.060
but it's as hot as shit in here.
I don't know if he can hear that.

38
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:26.690
Run over my loudest voice here.
A bunch of stuff.

So I'm,
it's the,

72
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:34.540
one of the things I'm most proud of as far as all the things that,

73
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.910
um,
you know,

74
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.970
I've done in this business and I've watched my friends do the fact that we all

75
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:44.590
get together and make sure that his mom and his family are right around right is

76
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.530

So anyways,

77
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.950
onto the podcast,
well,
if I'm going to promote some stuff,

78
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:55.170
I might as well promote a few other things as a speaking of comedians and I got

79
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.920
to get her on this benefit one of these years.

80
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.950
A good friend of mine for way back in the day became a filmmaker and is now back

81
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.340

Um,

82
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.770
absolutely fucking hilarious.

83
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.930
And I was talking to you the night at the comedy store.
I didn't realize.

84
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.890
I told her,
uh,
you know,
my,
I really fucked.

85
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.460
I really fucked up my side big time by playing drums.

86
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:20.740
I think I already told you guys that how I was down there and I was just telling

87
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:21.100
her that,

88
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.180
you know how I messed it up and then I re screwed it up by playing drum.

89
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:27.280
She's like,
I didn't eat,
play drums.
I used to play drums.

90
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.050
I started talking to her mother,

91
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:32.140
used to be this famous jazz singer and she played at the cotton club and all

92
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:36.100
this stuff,
that real jazz gigs and shit sit in with all these legends.

93
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.670
Started talking,
all this drum stuff.
And she's a great comedian.
Anyway,

94
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:42.190

95

00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:05.060
country in the United States.

101
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.640
And me and Nia was sitting in bed watching it really low on the volume because,

102
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:15.620
you know,
I lovely daughter's sleeping in the other room and just cracking up.

103
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.290
It's fucking hilarious.
It's brilliant.

104
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:21.770
I haven't seen him in so long because he's a New York guy and I'm a big La phony

105
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:25.710
here.
And uh,
I sent him a text.
I told them how he,

106
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.690
that guy is fucking brilliant man.
Uh,

107
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.520
It's so cool the way he shot it.

108
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.450
It looks like almost lead us in black and white and probably did with a couple

109
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:38.810
of I iPhones that's just shot over the course of,

110
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.840
I don't know how many months of him screwing around doing bits fucking with the

111
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:46.760
crowd,
you know.

112
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.990
And he just would just would cut out and just say,
the seller,
this date,

113
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.760
the seller,
that date all shot at the cellar.
It's uh,
it's really,

114
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.630
it's really different.
It's awesome.

115
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.470
Judah Freelander America is the greatest country in the United States.
All right,

116
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:04.100
that's it.
Let's get into the end of the podcast here.
All right,

117
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.540
let's dig in to the God damn podcast.

118
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.620
I'm in a good way.
I did not do shit

119
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.030
this weekend.
I didn't do shit other than this morning.

120
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.350
I woke up and I got all my tax shit.
You know,

121
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.340
I do it at the end of every month.
I just get all my stupid receipts.

122
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:29.990
I organize them so I don't have a fucking avalanche,
you know,

123
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.340
April 14th to go through and throw it my accountant and make his life miserable.

124
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:38.810
I don't do that.
End of every month like a little old lady.
You know,

125
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:41.330
I try to balance the books.
I just do all of that.

126
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.710
And then all I have to deal with is whatever bullshit I did in the last 30 days,

127
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:48.320
rather than having to deal with 365 days.

128
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.190
It's the smartest fucking thing I've ever done.
Because I remember,

129
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.160
I remember back when I used to live with Bobby Kelly,
right?
We would sit in and,

130
00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.780
and you know,
we would do like a zillion spots a week.
You know,

131
00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:04.520
on the weekend you'd have like six,
seven,
eight spots a night,
you know,

132
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.100
and I was working in uptown and downtown,

133
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:12.101
so I'd have all these cab receipts and have all of these receipts from College

134
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.230
Gigs,
club gigs,
bus tickets,
train tickets,

135
00:08:15.231 --> 00:08:20.231
all of this shit shoved in like four different cvs bags by the end of the year.

136
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.220
And,
you know,
we had to do our own taxes back then or whatever,

137
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.970
and we would just be sitting there with this shitty fucking coffee table with a

138
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:35.990
giant plastic bags of receipts that God,
Dude,

139
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:39.080
why did we do this?
Why did we fuck it?

140
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:44.081
Why didn't we just along the way at least just have an envelope that said taxi

141
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:49.271
receipts that I would try it every year and on a good year I'd make it to march,

142
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.940
you know,
but I never made it for the whole year.

143
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.000
Most years I wouldn't even make it into February and I've just be like,
Eh,

144
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.320
fuck it.
Um,
but this year,
finally,
years later,

145
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:05.520
25 years in my career,
finally,
you know,
I finally been doing it.

146
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.410
And,
uh,
I kinda know where shit is,
like major shit,

147
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.370
life insurance and stuff like that.
I kind of know where it is.

148
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.690
Like I know it's in one of two different places.
I don't know which folder,

149
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.500
but um,
it's really made my life a lot easier.
Um,

150
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.280
or who's getting to my wife if make her life easier.
If I ever die.
It's like,

151
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.730
it's either in that box there in that box and it's sort of organized.

152
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:31.883
<v 2>MMM.</v>

153
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.450
<v 0>So anyways,
yeah,
I did not do shit this weekend.
Still didn't drink.</v>

154
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.900
I made it through.
I did not drink.
So I'm up to 102 days.

155
00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:41.990
By the time you listened to some in triple digits over there,
I'm like,

156
00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:43.800
fucking will channel it a bit.

157
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.420
So I got him by two fucking days.

158
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.070
Two points.

159
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:50.843
<v 2>MMM.</v>

160
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.400
<v 0>Yeah.
It wasn't that,
it wasn't that bad.
No one was really drinking.</v>

161
00:09:54.401 --> 00:09:56.290
So the temptation wasn't really there.

162
00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.183
<v 2>MMM.</v>

163
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.410
<v 0>And once the night was over and my daughter was awesome and she didn't cry</v>

164
00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:09.670
nothing.
She's just like,
she's so cool,
man.
He's so chill.
She's so,
you know,

165
00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:13.900
when people,
people actually say that when she gets upset,
she looks like me.

166
00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:15.700
That's when she looks like me.
You know what I mean?

167
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.910
And as much as that hurts me to hear that,
I know it's true.

168
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:28.020
So anyways,
um,
I ended up,
uh,
I,
you know,

169
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:30.480
when I'm home I usually am the one that puts her to bed.

170
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:36.280
I actually really enjoyed doing it and I haven't down to a whole system.
And,
uh,

171
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.330
the worst part is after they fall asleep in your arms and you got to set them

172
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:42.810
down in the crib and then they cry for a little bit and just walking away

173
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.480
knowing they're fine now when they just crying,
they were okay.

174
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.983
<v 2>MMM.</v>

175
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.820
<v 0>That's the hard part.
But,
uh,
I actually enjoy her falling asleep,</v>

176
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.490
you know,

177
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.170
laying on my arm so much that I usually let it go for like an extra 20 minutes

178
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.420
cause I figured some day,
you know,
she's going to be like,
Oh my God,
Dad,
God,

179
00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:07.830
you're so embarrassing.
I'm,
I'm really trying to take all of this shit in.
So,

180
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.280
um,
anyways,
I put her to bed

181
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.870
and uh,

182
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.010
was watching her on the little video and then I went out on my back porch and I

183
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:21.100
smoked arguably the best cigar of the year.

184
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.960
It was just perfect.
You know,
it was thanksgiving.
It was an event.

185
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.900
So there was no guilt of like,
look at me smoking a cigar.
What am I,

186
00:11:28.901 --> 00:11:33.790
some bomb at a track.
I said I smoked it.
It was fucking delicious,

187
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.790
delicious.
So it couldn't have gone any better.

188
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.490
And just when I thought my weekend couldn't get all any better,

189
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:44.350
I decided to watch every college fucking football game I could get my eyeballs

190
00:11:44.351 --> 00:11:47.920
on.
And I did.
And it did.

191
00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:50.380
I see some bright ones who please tell me,

192
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.840
please tell me you son of a bitch that you fucking sat down and you watch the

193
00:11:55.841 --> 00:12:00.841
war on I four interstate for that runs between the two underrated cities of

194
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:07.390
Tampa in Orlando,
Florida.
They don't get any respect.

195
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:08.950
You know,

196
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.540
you gotta be on the East Coast and south of Lake Okeechobee to get any respect

197
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:16.520
in Florida.
Even then,
they still laugh at you and if,
if just,

198
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.030
if you're living in Fort Lauderdale,
right?

199
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.770
You're up north on Daytona beach.
They all know you're doing meth,
right?

200
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.250
You gotta be down in Miami.
I got a buddy of mine for show.

201
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:30.790
He's going to be on my shows out there in Florida.
I'm doing show Hollywood,

202
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:35.791
Florida and in Orlando go into a magic game in between knocking off another team

203
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.930
and,
uh,
he's a Miami guy.
So I was trashing the most,
making fun of Miami.

204
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.250
I was like,
dude,
every guy in Miami is either a drug dealer or a promoter

205
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.510
or both.
I know that isn't true,

206
00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:54.190
but I just like trash in places that I enjoy going to.
Who doesn't like Miami?
Um,

207
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.020
anyways,
so interstate four runs between Tampa and,
uh,

208
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.540
and uh,
Orlando and I watched that game.
That game was fucking,

209
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.790
it was like watching a god,
this was like a video game.
I can't,

210
00:13:08.791 --> 00:13:10.710
I can't even remember what the fucking score was.

211
00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:15.711
It was like 42 35 and I got to tell you something with some of the fastest,

212
00:13:16.561 --> 00:13:20.730
most athletic to the fastest,
most athletic teams I've seen in a long time.

213
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.950
And I know that,
I don't know if they're not division one,

214
00:13:22.951 --> 00:13:24.900
I don't know what their deal is.
I don't know where they are.

215
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.400
But I know I've seen a lot of like good players come out of south Florida,

216
00:13:29.401 --> 00:13:33.690
central Florida.
Um,
so I don't know what happened.

217
00:13:33.691 --> 00:13:36.300
Maybe they fucked up in high school,
you know,
punched a teacher.

218
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.790
I don't know what happened,
but these guys look like they could take on.

219
00:13:38.791 --> 00:13:43.590
Anybody granted that at the same,
I don't fucking know.
It looked great.
Okay.

220
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.890
Everybody was flying around the field.
So,
you know,

221
00:13:46.891 --> 00:13:50.550
there was very few white people out there.
You know what I'm saying here?
Um,

222
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.490
so,
uh,
I'm watching this game.

223
00:13:53.491 --> 00:13:57.100
It's 42 35 and um,

224
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.540
central Florida is trying to be the first team ever in that conference or

225
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:05.130
whatever to ever to ever go windless and within two years go undefeated.

226
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.790
So they have a chance to do what they go 40 to like 35 or some shit and there's

227
00:14:10.791 --> 00:14:13.880
like a minute and a half left.
Right?
What are you going to do?

228
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.490
You're going to go into the prevent,
you're going to give up the whole,

229
00:14:16.491 --> 00:14:18.680
the first fucking 80 yards and then you're going to go into,

230
00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.470
then you're going to start finally playing defense.
Right.
You know,

231
00:14:21.471 --> 00:14:24.980
I hate the fucking prevent defense.
Well Guess,
guess what Central Florida does?

232
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:30.200
Evidently they didn't go into the prevent
cause inexplicably.

233
00:14:30.201 --> 00:14:34.400
Somehow this fucking guy got behind their defense with a minute and a half left

234
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.170
for like a 70 80 yard touched out,
which by the way,

235
00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:41.870
it was like a 20 yard pass and then he just ran 50 yards.

236
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:47.390
So I immediately tweet and all caps.
How the fuck do you let that happen?

237
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.170
As I'm finishing the tweet and hitting send,

238
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.570
it's now tied 42 42 south Florida kicks the fucking ball off,

239
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.060
a stunned stadium of central Florida fans are watching going,

240
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:05.360
can we at least get down to field goal position that we just fucking blow our

241
00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:08.000
whole season?
Fucking do it in central Florida.

242
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:11.480
Catches the ball that kickoff and ran the fucking thing back.

243
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.890
So then I had to tweet again.
How the fuck do you let that happen?

244
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.010
So now it's like 49,
42.
I'm sure he got the school wrong with.

245
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.110
So they both in the forties
and then I'm sitting there going,
well

246
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.230
those two plays are so fucked up.

247
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.830
They did easily central Florida could run this fucking ball back of south

248
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:34.880
Florida,
should say,
um,
they didn't,
and the game ended,

249
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:36.890
but Jesus Christ one an entertaining game.

250
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.330
And then the next day I watched a Michigan,
Ohio state,

251
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.970
and then I watched the iron bowl,
um,

252
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.980
and watched Auburn beat Alabama and uh,
watching Michigan

253
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.860
Verse Ohio State.

254
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:55.670
I've come to the conclusion that I fucking hate quarterbacks who run.

255
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.100
I hate a running quarterback.
I just can't,
I can't fucking stand,

256
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.170
you know,
I don't think it should be legal for a quarterback to run.
All right.

257
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.490
Or if you run,
then you get treated like a running back.

258
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:14.210
This whole fucking thing that you could wait till everybody,
everybody covers,

259
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.250
they called the right defense.

260
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.550
Nobody's open and then you can just take off running when nobody's fucking

261
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:22.970
looking.
That's all well and good,
but you should get stuck.

262
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.130
But it's all like he gave himself up.
He threw himself on the ground.

263
00:16:28.131 --> 00:16:32.930
Leave them alone.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
If you're going to take off running,

264
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.310
you should get stuck.

265
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.880
Either that or keep you fucking fucking running around as behind the goddamn

266
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:45.170
line.
It's fucking driving me crazy.
I'm a Michigan Fan,

267
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:46.280
so I'm watching that shit.

268
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.870
And Michigan's fucking defense was lights out and that fucking cunt

269
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:56.540
can't run an eight yards,
nine yards.
Guy couldn't complete a pass.

270
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:59.390
He couldn't feel pressure,
but he could fucking run.

271
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:02.330
And then when he ran there to be like,
Ooh,
he's a quarterback.

272
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.310
If I was coaching for the other team,
I'd be like,
listen,
hit the fucking guy.

273
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.730
Take the take the penalty.
I don't give a shit.

274
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.350
I'm not saying deliberately energy him,
but fucking hit him.
I don't care.

275
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.630
Now it drives me up.
It drives me up.
The congratulations to our house.

276
00:17:23.631 --> 00:17:27.960
I don't hate Ohio state or whatever.
I'm just more of a Michigan Fan.
Um,

277
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.210
and Michigan's just in a weird year.
I don't know what their deal is.
I mean,
they,

278
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.250
they don't have their quarterback.

279
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.940
I hate trash and college players because they're still kids or whatever.

280
00:17:37.941 --> 00:17:41.450
But he could have had a better game and use a little amped up in the beginning.

281
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:45.020
And I dunno what happened on that last play.
I think a miscommunication.

282
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.920
Maybe the guy ran broke off the pattern or whatever cause it will,

283
00:17:48.921 --> 00:17:53.580
you fucking threw it to the guy.
But um,
Jim Harbaugh,
oh,
in three.

284
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.520
Oh,
in three against Ohio state.

285
00:17:56.521 --> 00:17:58.440
You're telling me his wife had a good fucking weekend.

286
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.690
So he comes home with this fucking woody Hayes glasses all steamed up.

287
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:05.720
<v 2>Um,
yeah,</v>

288
00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.260
<v 0>but Jesus Christ at Defense Michigan's defense was great.
Um,</v>

289
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.870
and how about the kid that came in after,
uh,
Ohio state quarterback went down.

290
00:18:13.871 --> 00:18:18.760
He played great and he could throw the ball,
he could throw the ball and run.
Um,

291
00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.190
so maybe they get a future with him.
I have no idea.
And then I,
you know,
my,

292
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.520
I got a buddy Jay law head is a big Ohio state guy,

293
00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:27.810
so he's always arguing the case as to why Ohio,

294
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.880
Iowa state should be in the fucking playoffs every,

295
00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:32.740
he did it to me last shift fucking talking to me.

296
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:38.400
He tried to explain to me how Ohio state should be in,

297
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.850
in the,
the,
the,
the,
the 14 play off.
And it's like,
dude,

298
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.590
they lost to Penn state.
Penn State won the big 10 championship.

299
00:18:47.591 --> 00:18:51.130
Penn state doesn't make it in,
but Ohio state does.
He goes,
yeah,

300
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.880
I'll tell you why.
Strength of schedule early,
fuck,
it does all the fucking math.

301
00:18:54.881 --> 00:18:58.510
And then what happens?
They play Clemson and they get the old right there,

302
00:18:58.511 --> 00:19:03.160
Fred right.
31 to nothing.
You know,
somebody else should have been in there.

303
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:07.660
So I love Jay.
He was doing that to me again the other day via text,

304
00:19:07.661 --> 00:19:09.130
and I'm just laughing,
thinking like,
dude,

305
00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:14.350
he's always talking about our Alabama stinks and there's nobody fucking in the

306
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:19.090
sec.
It's like the big 10 sucks to pick 10 still sucks.
It's not that good.

307
00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:22.570
Penn state was overrated.
They were overrated.

308
00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.210
They lost to Ohio state and it was a huge fucking went.

309
00:19:25.211 --> 00:19:27.850
And then the very next week,
what happened?
I owe state beats,

310
00:19:27.851 --> 00:19:29.290
Penn state the next fucking week.

311
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:34.350
Penn state loses to Michigan State and Ohio state gets fucking raped rate by

312
00:19:35.681 --> 00:19:39.100
fucking Iowa.
So I dunno.

313
00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.120
He's always talking about how weak the SEC is.

314
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.450
It's like you get the fuck out of here.
You look at the big tent,

315
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:50.540
Jesus Christ.
How many teams you got laying down every week?
Rutgers,
Indiana,

316
00:19:50.541 --> 00:19:54.830
Purdue,
Northwestern.
Fucking Minnesota.

317
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.110
I hate to say Nebraska,
but that they're no good.

318
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:04.090
That's six fucking teams right then Michigan state is always half assed.
Oh Man,

319
00:20:04.091 --> 00:20:05.620
I'm going to get some fucking mail this week

320
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.590
in Michigan.
Isn't that good?
There's still trying to put it together.

321
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.590
So who the fuck are you playing out there?
I don't get it.
You know,

322
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.330
look at fucking Auburn,

323
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.290
Auburn beat Georgia when Georgia was number one and now they beat Alabama in

324
00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:24.110
Alabama was number one.
So Alabama is number one.

325
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.410
They take a loss in the last game of the season.
So now at they out,

326
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.350
the whole fucking thing is just,
it's just a,

327
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.780
a symptom of the game.

328
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.730
You can't have the march madness because everybody would be getting concussions

329
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.330
in ruining million dollar fucking career.
So this is the best system we got.

330
00:20:41.331 --> 00:20:44.960
So I guess it creates arguing,
but I gotta tell you,
um,

331
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.960
what a week.
Just the college football was fucking amazing.

332
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.180
Then I watched a little bit and I never watched PAC 12.

333
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:55.870
I watched it live that Washington,
Washington state,
Jesus Christ,

334
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:59.230
a bunch of players on those teams too.
Um,

335
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.700
and for some reason my wife just let me do it.
You know,
it was funny,
you know,

336
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.171
we actually,

337
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:08.770
we went out shopping after the Michigan fucking Ohio state game and I was so

338
00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:09.850
fucking pissed.

339
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.220
I was so fucking pissed cause I just felt like Michigan's data better defense,

340
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:15.820
they should've won.

341
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.910
And they just kept doing that little cunty fucking eight yards scamper for a

342
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:22.750
first down to keep the fucking drive alive was driving me crazy.

343
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.280
Um,
and then uh,

344
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.330
I dunno and then we just went out and I just say like,
you know,

345
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.110
I don't know why I get that into games,
but you know,
my,

346
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.350
my half could sense it and I just said,
yeah,
listen,
I just fucking,
you know,

347
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.780
I just watched the game.
I did not like the outcome.
Right.

348
00:21:43.781 --> 00:21:46.780
This is because Jesus Christ.
All right,
so then we'll walking around,
okay,

349
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.740
we're with all these people like you know,

350
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:52.930
Christmas shopping and shit and you know,

351
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.880
there was this group of fucking Asian people,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

352
00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.920
They will,
for whatever reason,

353
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:05.070
we're walking down the sidewalk like 17 people across and we were behind them

354
00:22:05.561 --> 00:22:07.570
and they will walking like half a mile an hour.

355
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.140
I don't know if they just got done eating Thanksgiving dinner.

356
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:13.720
I don't know what it was,
but I was having what this comic,

357
00:22:13.721 --> 00:22:18.520
I used to know John Bush used to call it walk rage instead of road rage.

358
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.950
He used to do this great bit about having walked rage in New York City and I was

359
00:22:25.951 --> 00:22:26.910
just sitting there like,

360
00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.820
how the fuck do you not [inaudible] I get it.

361
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:36.590
There's a whole family.
They are with their grandparents,

362
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.960
you know,
an agent.
People respect their elders.

363
00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.490
They're not like Americans.

364
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.030
When we would have thrown those old people in the home and we would have picked

365
00:22:47.031 --> 00:22:49.190
up the pace when we walked down the street.

366
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:53.310
So I was trying to respect their culture,
but at the end of the day,
I'm selfish.

367
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.560
So I was just like,
oh,
what the fuck's?
We finally get bye

368
00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.120
and my daughter didn't want to be in the fucking
strollers.

369
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:05.070
So I got her out and I'm carrying in my ribs of fucking talking to me and one of

370
00:23:05.071 --> 00:23:08.070
my shoulders is fucked up my mind.
I'm a mess,
right?
I'm like,
you know,

371
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:13.020
I'm like a fucking journeyman quarterback right now.
I'm like,

372
00:23:13.021 --> 00:23:14.700
Steve Grogan at the end of his career,

373
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.400
I should have been walking around with like that fucking neck brace.

374
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:18.900
So I'm already grumpy.

375
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:23.720
And then this lady's kid is having a fucking temper tantrum and was stopped at

376
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:23.940
the,

377
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.230
at the red light waiting to walk across the street and this kid is hitting this

378
00:23:28.231 --> 00:23:32.190
fucking note that is making my ears,
which are junk from playing drums,

379
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:37.380
vibrate in this painful way that's making my teeth hurt.
So Nia goes,

380
00:23:37.381 --> 00:23:39.960
hey,
we can cross up here and right as I do that,

381
00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:44.760
the fucking woman with the screaming kid heard it too and started following me

382
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:49.160
and is a saint aviation.
She was a beam up my fucking left eardrum,

383
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.100
which means just right alongside of it.
And I just,

384
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:53.840
I was walking away and I couldn't see.
She was right,

385
00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:56.480
but I couldn't understand why it wasn't getting quieter.
And then she came,

386
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.910
I turned around,
I saw that she was following this up there and I just,
I,
I,

387
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.770
I snapped,
I snapped.

388
00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:05.870
<v 2>Okay.</v>

389
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:06.950
<v 0>I was under my breath.</v>

390
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.820
Caught Jesus fucking Christ can get just fucking get that fucking kid the fuck

391
00:24:10.821 --> 00:24:15.050
away from me.
I was gone near stop.
Just let him go past Jesus fucking,
it was,

392
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.520
it was completely irrational.
I was 100% wrong,
but,
uh,

393
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.580
it was just all those things building up.
And like I said,

394
00:24:22.581 --> 00:24:26.120
I already walk around it as six,
so it's very easy for me to get back up to a 10.

395
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:31.820
So,
uh,
you stop talking to me.
And uh,

396
00:24:31.821 --> 00:24:35.960
then I was like,
ah,
here we go.
You know?
And then I was a baby about it.
I'm like,

397
00:24:35.961 --> 00:24:39.590
Oh really?
Do they,
they showed up for football game.
I'm driving over here.

398
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.040
We just bought this.
I did this.
I took the fucking garbage joke

399
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:52.260
just cause I drop a bunch of f bombs in public about some other woman's crying

400
00:24:52.261 --> 00:24:56.210
kid,
you know,
I did the dishes.

401
00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.380
That's not a push.
It's not a wash.
You know,
I thought like,

402
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.130
I thought that all balanced it out.
So,
you know,

403
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:07.160
I put up a good fight on the ride home and then I find just a mess,
like,
yeah,

404
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:09.860
right.
You're right.
I'm just arguing with,
cause I know you're writing.

405
00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:11.390
I'm embarrassed.
I shouldn't have done that.
Yeah.

406
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.183
<v 2>MMM.</v>

407
00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.920
<v 0>What do you,
what are you going to do?
I mean,</v>

408
00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:17.930
they wrote a song about me a long time ago.
Huh?

409
00:25:17.931 --> 00:25:21.080
I'm not a perfect person.

410
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.960
<v 2>Um,
yeah.
I don't know why I did that.</v>

411
00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.780
<v 0>You know,
something I would go to fucking anger management,</v>

412
00:25:29.781 --> 00:25:33.140
but I just don't feel like telling my stories all over again.

413
00:25:33.141 --> 00:25:35.090
I've already gone to therapy.
I just don't,
you know,

414
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.220
I'm going to retell these fucking things,

415
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:39.843
<v 2>you know,</v>

416
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.880
<v 0>going to reboot it like fucking full house on a Netflix.</v>

417
00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:48.010
<v 3>Okay.</v>

418
00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.860
<v 0>Oh,

Tell these fucking stories all over.
I'm sick of my stories.

421
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.770
That was part of my argument too.
I was just like,

422
00:26:06.771 --> 00:26:11.590

This is what I do.
Okay.
I,

423
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.050
uh,
I'm really good at being a comedian.
I make a great living.

424
00:26:15.051 --> 00:26:16.280
We have a great life,

425
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:20.510
but every once in awhile I'm going to drop a bunch of f bombs because a baby's

426
00:26:20.511 --> 00:26:23.360
crying.
Okay.
That's who I,
and you have some,

427
00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:27.860
I usually babies crying usually makes me laugh because I'm usually on a plane

428
00:26:27.861 --> 00:26:31.310
when they start crying and they were expressing exactly what I'm feeling and

429
00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:35.360
it's just like,
it's like a great comedy.
It's just like,

It's not supposed to be sexy.
It's not supposed to be inviting or whatever.

It seems to be like for fat white guys.

497
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:50.470

But like don't get so like you get,

00:30:56.921 --> 00:31:00.850
This is the fucking weight I was when I came into this business and people

501
00:31:00.851 --> 00:31:03.370
weren't like,

503
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.770
drinking a thousand fucking classes of booze and pizza.

504
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.240
That's all beer and pizza.

505
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.560
Then if I actually get to the weight that I'm supposed to be,
you're like,

506
00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:17.500
oh my God,

My heart is psyched right now.

507
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:22.340
It never said you look sick.

508
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.690

509
00:31:25.691 --> 00:31:27.520
Don't tell people I said that on the puck.

510
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:31.330
You said it and you made a sign and you held it up in the kitchen.

513
00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:43.770

No,

526
00:32:24.461 --> 00:32:29.290
I want more than that.
Why?
Because I don't want to just underwear.
Thank you.

527
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:33.040
And when I give you the underwear,
where should I put it up your age.

528
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.720
I did a lot of that over the net and it's a stocking stuffer.

529
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.580
Sorry I'm too close to the Mike here.
It's three out of copy.

530
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.930
It's all for dollar shave club.
Okay.
Why don't you get a microphone.

531
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.760
All right.

532
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.150

533
00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:50.984

535
00:32:54.551 --> 00:32:57.960

Beulah,
Google.
Good here you,

536
00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.490
you're used to screaming into a microphone,

537
00:33:00.491 --> 00:33:04.960
which is hilarious to me because the microphone is meant to amplify your voice.

538
00:33:04.961 --> 00:33:09.490
It's meant to carry it,
but you like like,

542
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.820
Well,

The microphone is in the other room.
Okay.

543
00:33:22.821 --> 00:33:24.720
I'm not doing that.
All right.

548
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.600
What do you call it when you have a favorite thing that you like to touch?

549
00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:46.210
<v 6>If you said this on our first date,

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.250
where is it?
I don't know.
What are you doing?

692
00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:46.440
And I'm looking at all the windows you have open on your why.

693
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.360
Why are women so fucking nosy?
That is so creepy.

694
00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:56.240
I'm just curious.
What was I looking up cunt with a k maybe.
Alright.

695
00:42:56.330 --> 00:43:00.620
Carnival.
A drummer.
Carnival.

696
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:05.670
That's how it's spelled.
Did they pronounce the Carnival or kind of Steve Judge.

697
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:10.280
Jesus Christ.
That guy's a beast.
Incredible.
Incredible.

698
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.390
Top to bottom.
Everybody in that band,
Singer,
Guitar Player,

699
00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:17.300
Bass Player at the whole fucking thing.
That drummer.
Unbelievable.

700
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:21.650
Please download that.
Listen to it.
Tell me how much you love it.

701
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:23.510
Australia where you got to,

702
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.240
you got any more bands like that or what do you hold now for every week I'm

703
00:43:26.241 --> 00:43:29.630
fucking sitting here like a little,
a little kid,
you know,
on Christmas.

704
00:43:29.631 --> 00:43:34.400
But no presence.
Just asking them.
They don't tell me anything.
I go down like toy,

705
00:43:34.401 --> 00:43:37.220
go all the way out to Perth and what thanks to I get.
Oh Australia.

706
00:43:37.221 --> 00:43:40.700
That's not cool.
Yeah.
I that that fucking album came out in 2010.

707
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:45.320
Why they treated me like that.
Neyo all right.
Anyways,

708
00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:50.450
out anyways,
shout out to little creatures.
Beer.

709
00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:55.490
Can we read the ones that I feel like I'm going to be able to jump in on first

710
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:58.500
and then I can leave and you can do what?
Don't care.

711
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:07.130
Can we
the last two progressive rock.

712
00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.450
Oh,
I know you don't give a fuck about that.
I'll read that one.
All right.

713
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:16.160
Emily Linden tweets.
You don't want to do this one?
No,
I don't know.
All right.

714
00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.890
What or who is Emily?
Linda.
I didn't know who he tells.
She was either.

715
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:23.600
She is somebody on the Twitter sphere.
She,
she's uh,

716
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:27.950
she's got,
um,
social media.
She tweeted some a shit about,

717
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:32.340
I don't know,
some shit.
I don't know.
Hey there,
Billy fair trail.

718
00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:37.830
<v 4>Um,
I imagine you've been sent this article many times over the last week I had,</v>

719
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:43.020
here's an excerpt from an article about what the writer for Teen Vogue tweeted.

720
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:45.990
A,
here's an unpopular opinion.

721
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:51.050
I'm not actually all that concerned about innocent men losing their jobs over

722
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:55.650
false sexual assault slash harassment allegations.

723
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.700
The benefit of all of us getting to finally tell the truth.

724
00:44:59.701 --> 00:45:04.701
Plus the impact on victims far capital's far outweighs the loss of any one man's

725
00:45:05.611 --> 00:45:07.170
reputation.
He said adding,

726
00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:12.090
if some innocent men's reputation have to take a hit in the process of undoing

727
00:45:12.091 --> 00:45:16.680
the patriarchy.
That is the price I am absolutely willing to pay.

728
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:22.080
It's hilarious.
You're not paying a price in that,
that the innocent guy is,
um,

729
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:27.110
the most cognitive cause I say the words stupid critique of Linden came from CNN

730
00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:34.470
anchored Jake tapper.
The lead host tweeted,
well,
this is CNN.

731
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.570
There's bad as Fox News.

732
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.770
I'm guessing you didn't get a good grade for your seventh grade book report on

733
00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:42.510
to kill a mockingbird.
Uh,

734
00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:46.710
referencing the classic novel that features the trial of a black man falsely

735
00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:50.760
accused of rape in the 1930s,
Alabama.
Um,

736
00:45:50.761 --> 00:45:53.510
you said if some innocent men's reputation,

737
00:45:53.511 --> 00:45:56.970
I have to take a hit in the process and doing the patriarchy that is a price.

738
00:45:56.971 --> 00:45:59.610
Same.
Absolutely willing to pay.
That's immoral.

739
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.180
Tapper wrote and it's not a price you would be paying by the way.

740
00:46:03.181 --> 00:46:06.870
It would be an innocent,
innocent men doing that.
Um,
all right.

741
00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.590
He said,
my wife is black,
is back to the guy running.

742
00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:14.670
My wife is black and she has a cousin who served six months in jail for being

743
00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:19.110
falsely accused of rape.
He lost his academic scholarship,
academic,

744
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:23.310
not sports scholarship and has been having trouble getting his life back on

745
00:46:23.311 --> 00:46:26.880
track since having his conviction overturned from being physically and

746
00:46:26.881 --> 00:46:31.380
emotionally abused in jail.
She said,
uh,

747
00:46:31.381 --> 00:46:35.130
that is she ever
alright.

748
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.120
She said that if she ever saw this woman in public sheet and I quote,

749
00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:43.050
slap the shit out of that irresponsible cont bill.

750
00:46:43.051 --> 00:46:47.250
I've never heard of used the seaward or even threatening violence against
anyone.

751
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.700
It's like that line.
Now you just go into a completely different direction.

752
00:46:50.701 --> 00:46:52.470
That line from Batman,
the dark night,

753
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.580
you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

754
00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.850
All right?
You're all over the place.
I don't know what's going on here.
Um,

755
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:04.770
what do I think that,
I think that's the tweets have somebody young.
Uh,
and,

756
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:09.740
and also it's kind of seems that it's a little WWE wrestling,
grandstanding,

757
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.560
knowing there's no way you write that,
not knowing,

758
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.910
you know,
it's like watching down there,
the,

759
00:47:16.911 --> 00:47:21.600
the notorious guy there and the MMA guy,
the crazy shit.
He says,

760
00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:26.610
he knows what he's doing.
Yeah.
And then everybody's like,
[inaudible] too cocky.

761
00:47:26.611 --> 00:47:29.980
I want to watch your moves.
And then that he wins and he

762
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.490
<v 6>gets your money.
I think that that's a,
I think that's all this is,
uh,</v>

763
00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.960
<v 5>white feminism.
So that's pretty much,</v>

764
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:40.440
yeah.
I mean,
that's pretty much,

765
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:45.470
this is why people don't like being labeled a feminist because of stuff like

766
00:47:46.141 --> 00:47:50.550
that.
No.
Elaborate.
Nah,
that's all I'm gonna say about it.

767
00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:52.870
<v 3>Okay.</v>

768
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:54.880
<v 6>I feel like nobody white and knows who you're talking about.</v>

769
00:47:54.881 --> 00:47:56.380
But everybody black right now does.

770
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:04.660
Oh my God,
was that shade?
Am I woke?
Um,
yeah,

771
00:48:04.661 --> 00:48:09.640
I mean that's just one of those,
uh,
I dunno.
I don't know.

772
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.820
I mean,
what do you do you know what?
That's how she feels.
That's how she feels.

773
00:48:12.821 --> 00:48:15.460
What am I supposed,
am I supposed to actually like,
like respond to that?

774
00:48:15.461 --> 00:48:17.710
Like that's like some sort of rational human being.

775
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.010
What do you mean what this person foaming at the mouth.
I don't know.

776
00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:22.390
They remind me of myself

777
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.930
when you think of this complete.
Yeah.

778
00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.200
And yet can I make this city more easier for you?
I love how you,

779
00:48:30.201 --> 00:48:33.220
you will only wanted to fucking respond to the ones that were easy and they want

780
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:36.430
to give you a chance to respond to you.
Like you like bill Belichick laying off.

781
00:48:36.431 --> 00:48:40.330
She's a,
yeah,
it's white phone is,
I know.
Cause you know,
but I,

782
00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:44.650
but I can elaborate.
I can get into these next to elaborate.

783
00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:48.800
<v 5>I don't want to,
I don't want to him.
Why?
I don't know.</v>

784
00:48:48.801 --> 00:48:53.750
Maybe I am being a worse,
but I just,
uh,
yeah,
I,
it's,
that's,
I don't know,

785
00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.810
there's really no other way for me explain it than to say that that's,

786
00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.690
it's just you.
It's a level of,

787
00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:03.163
<v 3>okay.</v>

788
00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:06.340
<v 5>Not,
not,
not,
they're not naive.</v>

789
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:08.623
<v 3>They're not</v>

790
00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:14.450
<v 5>like maybe just in a bubble or something.
Just like,</v>

791
00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:17.750
so sheltered,
sheltered.

792
00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:22.430
So it's like all they can focus on is like the one thing,
you know what I mean?

793
00:49:22.431 --> 00:49:24.620
And they just can't quite grasp.

794
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.240
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

795
00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.560
<v 6>Well that's a joke I do on my act.
You know,
when,
when,</v>

796
00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.200
like when I listened to feminists,

797
00:49:29.201 --> 00:49:32.440
like it's hard for me to listen to white women in the United States of America

798
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.900
complaining.
[inaudible] like going,
do you know,

799
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:41.230
you know what it's like to be me a slightly less awesome than what my life is.

800
00:49:41.231 --> 00:49:45.580
Like
if you look at the big picture,

801
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:49.990
um,
I'm sure that seems to be a giant gap between me and you,

802
00:49:49.991 --> 00:49:52.210
but if you look at everybody else's situation,

803
00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.400
we were at what kind of sitting on the same stone here.

804
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:59.590
So why don't you buy a run around the lady?
All right.
I'm sorry.

805
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:04.390
Am I a rebound chump?
Is this good idea?
Is this in your wheel house?
Yeah,

806
00:50:04.391 --> 00:50:07.840
I think so.
Keep going.
You'd be a great president.

807
00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:10.420
This is what president is due now.
They'd like,
they basically,

808
00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:14.500
I don't like the way that guy asks questions.
Let's bring this person in.

809
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.680
You don't have time for everything,
so you gotta you gotta weed through?
No,
I,

810
00:50:18.681 --> 00:50:21.760
I do have to.
I have time for all of these.
You don't have time.
I mean,
yeah.

811
00:50:21.761 --> 00:50:25.120
I'm not talking about you talking about me.
Can we read this one?

812
00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:29.330
This one looks good.
Okay.
All right.
Am I a rebound chump?
Probably.

813
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.170
Dear Billy forehead.
You're saying all this funny shit off the Mike.

814
00:50:33.171 --> 00:50:35.070
I'm telling you,
but they say and they can hear you.

815
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:39.860
I said probably repeat it again.
All right.
The time.
Yeah,

816
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:42.980
the time he's gone.
All right.
Huge Fan of your comedy and podcast.

817
00:50:42.981 --> 00:50:47.570
Did you hear that?
Nia?
Huge Fan of my comedy.
Huge,
huge,
huge,

818
00:50:47.571 --> 00:50:49.820
greatest,
greatest comedian ever going to do.

819
00:50:49.821 --> 00:50:52.380
Stand up on a golf course with my own name attached to it.

820
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:56.670
Donald Trump would think of your podcast.
I mean,

821
00:50:56.671 --> 00:50:58.260
I don't care what he thinks about anything,

822
00:50:58.261 --> 00:51:02.730
but I wonder what he would think about your podcast
as far as what?

823
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:05.430
I don't know.
Like do you think he would be into it or not?

824
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:09.080
Even though you trash them,
you trash everybody.

825
00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:10.850
I think he's busy running the country.

826
00:51:10.851 --> 00:51:14.450
I don't think he's listening to fucking early nod by the way that he tweets.

827
00:51:14.451 --> 00:51:17.840
He's clearly not that fucking busy.
He's not that busy.

828
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:21.730
Who has time to tweet the petty shit that he does?
He's got that.

829
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:25.940
What's great about Twitter doing all this?
The actual stuff.

830
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:31.100
He's just sitting there like,
you know the,
uh,
what do you call it?
The spot?
Like,

831
00:51:31.101 --> 00:51:34.310
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck.
He's just,
and he's working.

832
00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:38.780
He's got me all,
he's working Obama.
Bill Clinton work today.
Yeah.

833
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.710
That's a guy who worked at,
yeah.
Oh,

834
00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.040
I just get all flustered.
I can't even speak straight.
Anyway.
Come on.

835
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.670
Am I a rebound chump?
Is Trump really that bad,
dear Billy?

836
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:54.440
Forehead side?
Just like get Nia going.
I dislike it.
It's really,
I mean,

837
00:51:54.441 --> 00:51:56.970
I don't know.
You've got gotta give the guy and shit.

838
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:04.790
Why is the worst time in here?
Cause it was hot as fuck in here.
Oh,

839
00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:09.760
you usually the one who runs hot.
I know,
I know.
I know.
No,
I know.

840
00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.120
Am I a rebound chump Nicole,
can I tell him to shut the fucking thing off?

841
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.910
Jesus Christ.
This is why it takes forever.

842
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.310
You the second you bring a woman in the fucking thing.

843
00:52:22.311 --> 00:52:25.430
Like if you're going to leave that house,
everything has to be perfect.

844
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:29.420
Shut the fuck.
Oh my feet are together.
Rub them together like issue will.

845
00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:32.900
You're always are.
I need a Blakey.

846
00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:39.720
<v 4>Are you ready?
Okay.
Yes.
Huge Fan of your comedy in the podcast.</v>

847
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:43.020
Hearing you shoot the shit every week obviously makes me laugh,

848
00:52:43.021 --> 00:52:46.200
but also gives me insight and other things.
Anyways,
it's hard to find out.

849
00:52:46.201 --> 00:52:51.130
All right.
I get too many comments.
Thank you.
I met this girl Butoh little dude.

850
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:53.310
He's probably the best or that check while blah blah,
blah,
blah.

851
00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:57.720
I've ever been with and our personalities so far looks just as good.

852
00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:00.480
We are both in college and neighboring states,

853
00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.330
but we hang out a couple times a week on average.

854
00:53:03.331 --> 00:53:05.550
Things have been going great for the past two months.

855
00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:09.600
We have traveled around her state and she has shown me places I have never seen.

856
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:13.920
I did not expect anything to bloom like it has and was originally content with

857
00:53:13.921 --> 00:53:17.790
just being friends who fuck.
However,
after getting to know her better,

858
00:53:17.791 --> 00:53:21.960
she definitely seems like someone I could stick around with for awhile and maybe

859
00:53:21.961 --> 00:53:26.730
even date.
Um,
well what are you guys now?
Sightseeing?

860
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:30.520
He just said they're hanging out.
Oh,
just hanging out.
Okay.
Sorry.
Well,

861
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:34.200
if I have to read and also listen to what I'm saying,
like I can't do that.

862
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:39.480
The only thing is
that's called reading comprehension.
Bebe.
Yeah,

863
00:53:39.481 --> 00:53:41.580
I'm not good at it.
Um,

864
00:53:41.581 --> 00:53:45.370
the only thing she has and the only thing she got done.
Yeah,

865
00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:50.420
the only thing she has an ex who I suspect she's still hoping we'll come back.

866
00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.430
All right.
Incident one on our second date quote,

867
00:53:56.460 --> 00:54:01.460
she rented a movie on an Amazon on our x's account and got a texted him asking,

868
00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:05.953
<v 8>Huh?</v>

869
00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.710
<v 4>What that was about.</v>

870
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:13.850
<v 5>Oh,
you fucking sector about an Amazon movie.
Wow.</v>

871
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:18.250
Why is she,
what was she?
What is she doing?
All right.

872
00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:21.620
That's some bullshit right there.
You know,
good.
And God damn.

873
00:54:21.621 --> 00:54:24.700
Well you can't order on your ex's account and like they're going,

874
00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:28.850
they're still paying for that.
Ooh.
See the little mink.
See this one.

875
00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:34.050
<v 4>She seemed delighted that he was forced to communicate with her and she wired</v>

876
00:54:34.601 --> 00:54:37.510
him money and said,
sorry.
Incident number two.

877
00:54:37.511 --> 00:54:41.470
So he's obviously broken up with her.
Fucking dramatic.
Uh,

878
00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.480
you ready?
Okay.
Incident number two.

879
00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:48.670
She originally stated that they broke up back in February,

880
00:54:48.671 --> 00:54:52.420
but one night she let it slip that they had actually broken up in August.

881
00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:56.920
Just a couple months ago.
I acted like I didn't notice.
Good.

882
00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.220
That's probably good.
After banging one night,

883
00:55:00.221 --> 00:55:04.120
she starts joking about having a baby and what features it would have.

884
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:07.690
I have brown hair as the she and she ran over the,

885
00:55:07.691 --> 00:55:11.680
says the baby could be blonde,
the color of her exes hair.

886
00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:17.560
She then went on to say your ex's name was one of her favorite names for a boy.

887
00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:21.460
Oh my Jesus Christ.
Dude,
this is always good.
My God,

888
00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:23.930
this is getting ridiculous to the point,
I'm starting to not believe it.

889
00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:29.580
Thankfully she waited until I finished all my dick and balls would have deflated

890
00:55:30.191 --> 00:55:35.020
immediately during all this baby slash x talk incident number four,

891
00:55:35.021 --> 00:55:39.790
Jesus Christ,
buddy exhibit 1995.
Um,

892
00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:44.200
she still uses her ex's,
Amazon prime account to watch movies,

893
00:55:44.201 --> 00:55:49.120
but on two occasions she began snooping through his order history right in front

894
00:55:49.121 --> 00:55:53.530
of me,
either unaware of how off putting that is are simply not giving a shit

895
00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:57.570
disrespectful to myself and the x in my opinion.
Uh,

896
00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:02.080
another confusing twist is that she gets pissed off and sad if I referred to her

897
00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:06.190
as my friend.
We're not in an official relationship,

898
00:56:06.191 --> 00:56:09.250
so this would suggest that she is at least kind of interested.

899
00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:11.620
But with all this stuff going on about Rx,

900
00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:15.520
I think she might just like the attention I provide and thinks she may be

901
00:56:15.521 --> 00:56:16.480
stringing me along.

902
00:56:16.481 --> 00:56:21.481
She is also randomly accused me of using her for attention and having other hose

903
00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:24.040
,
uh,
neither

904
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.160
<v 5>of which are true.
Yeah.
You don't sound like a,
yeah,
that has a lot of hoes.</v>

905
00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:30.750
<v 4>Sorry for this long email.
It's hard to put all this bullshit into words,</v>

906
00:56:30.751 --> 00:56:34.680
which you are great at.
If the,
yeah,
he's in the emotional side of this.

907
00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:38.010
Maybe me just reading what you just wrote out loud will be enough.

908
00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:42.660
If the lovely Nia is nearby,
I would love to hear her take as well.
Thanks.

909
00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:47.410
Uh,
and go for a jog once in awhile.
Yeah.
All right.
What do you got it?

910
00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:48.360
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

911
00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:52.140
This girl is fucking crazy and she's not over her acts and she is using you to

912
00:56:52.141 --> 00:56:52.800
get jealous.

913
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:56.790
And if you don't mind banging her because she's hot and all that and letting it

914
00:56:56.791 --> 00:56:59.730
go,
then fine.
But if you're starting to catch feelings,
I would bail.

915
00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:04.250
<v 4>Wow.
You said that nice and quick.
I agree with all of that.
I concur.</v>

916
00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:05.960
That's exactly it.

917
00:57:05.961 --> 00:57:10.230
If you could somehow not get emotionally tied to her and just keep banging her

918
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:14.440
<v 5>disrespectful as fuck,
she is incredibly disrespectful.</v>

919
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:17.980
She does not care about you at all.

920
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:22.780
The things that she is saying and doing in front of you is so ridiculous.

921
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:25.780
Like how are you going to lie in bed with someone and be like,

922
00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:30.520
you know when I have a baby,
like I end up this,
you know Caleb,

923
00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:33.940
because this is also like,
so Michael Shit,
like Caleb,

924
00:57:33.941 --> 00:57:37.150
I just feel like it'd be the perfect name for a boy and he's just sitting there

925
00:57:37.151 --> 00:57:40.630
like,
are you serious?
Like your ex boyfriend?
Oh yeah.
You know what?

926
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:43.390
This could be great rude.
He should be en route.

927
00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:47.340
<v 4>He should just,
I dunno,
I think you should just say something just like,
listen,</v>

928
00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.780
you've,
I have,

929
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.070
but this is one of these people that [inaudible] you don't even say anything to

930
00:57:53.071 --> 00:57:56.820
him because it's not going to,
they're not going to sit there and be like,
Oh wow,

931
00:57:57.330 --> 00:57:59.670
I guess you're right.
I really shouldn't have done that.
It's just person.

932
00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.700
It's not going to give a fuck.
So whatever,
man,
you get to paying a hot chicken.

933
00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.650
She's not over the other guy.
So who gives a fuck?

934
00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:08.340
Thank God you didn't marry or they'll do and thank God that other guy broke up

935
00:58:08.341 --> 00:58:10.820
with her cause she seems,
I don't know.
Granted it's all you.
You're

936
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:13.900
<v 5>talk has the nerve to be mad at him.
When he called,</v>

937
00:58:13.901 --> 00:58:15.580
when he introduces her as a friend,

938
00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:20.140
she has the fucking nerve to get mad after all that craziness that she's putting

939
00:58:20.141 --> 00:58:22.120
him through.
[inaudible] get out of here.

940
00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:26.290
<v 4>Classic hot chick.
Crazy hot chick behavior though.
This is classic,</v>

941
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.810
crazy data to show that I've told,

942
00:58:28.811 --> 00:58:32.690
I think I told the two weeks ago that hot chick I'd met at the gym and she kept,

943
00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:33.520
you know,

944
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.590
giving me a number and she'd wanted to go out and I kept trying to get her up

945
00:58:35.591 --> 00:58:37.930
but she wouldn't go out with me.
And then finally she picks a date.

946
00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:41.170
Yeah come over,
we can hang on Saturday.
And she goes,
oh I'm moving.

947
00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:42.460
Can you want me to help her move?

948
00:58:42.461 --> 00:58:47.160
And I just burst out laughing because I'm not fucking doing that.
Huh.

949
00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:50.100
And she had some other chump who came over there too.

950
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:52.960
There's going to be the two of us standing there like maybe if I pick up

951
00:58:52.961 --> 00:58:57.190
something heavy you can fuck males is like,
she's all yours buddy.

952
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.660
<v 5>Wow.
Yeah.
I mean I can't knock the hustle,
but that's incredibly rude.</v>

953
00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.460
<v 4>Yeah,
that's the thing.
That's why that right there,
that statement.</v>

954
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:10.630
I can't knock the hustle,
but that's incredibly rude.
Funny.
That's why.
Oh,

955
00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:14.320
you're just being funny.
Honestly,
that's,
that's why I,
I I get all that,

956
00:59:14.321 --> 00:59:19.321
that that male feminism horseshit where they just sitting there drinking the

957
00:59:19.451 --> 00:59:21.980
fucking Koolaid.
Like women just,
you know,
there

958
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.240
<v 6>aren't as many,</v>

959
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:28.420
just as many fucking absolute sociopath psychos that have vaginas out there is,

960
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:29.980
it's not drinking the Koolaid.

961
00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.050
They're just saying what they think women want to hear and then they turned out

962
00:59:33.051 --> 00:59:34.160
to be fucking assholes.

963

We're going to go all the way to 12th on the 12th Day of Christmas.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.290
Tooth is bleached to bleed.

1000
01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:21.420
Seven eyebrow hairs plucked.
I don't know what to say.
Nick,
can you get me here?

1001
01:02:21.421 --> 01:02:22.920
Plugs for Christmas.
But here's the thing,

1002
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:27.450
I just want them right down the center of my head.
I want to get,

1003
01:02:27.451 --> 01:02:32.100
I want to grow a Mohawk.
Um,
okay.

1004
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.660
Anyways,
while she looks perfect,
she says,
okay.
She Bob up button.

1005
01:02:35.661 --> 01:02:39.390
Now she's saying she wants it for Christmas.
Jewish though.

1006
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.870
Sorry.
Or She's antisemitic?
No.
You know what a lot of Jews celebrate Christmas.

1007
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:50.630
What do you mean antsy?
Some.
Oh yeah,
maybe she goes again and I got an Undergrad,

1008
01:02:50.631 --> 01:02:53.920
I went to him.
Did you notice,
you know these,

1009
01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.580
you say like that she celebrates Christmas,

1010
01:02:56.581 --> 01:03:00.090
which I actually have two Jewish friends to celebrate Walmart titch to hang out

1011
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:03.540
in the side of my overalls,
you know,
so I know it's so stupid.

1012
01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:08.010
Act like only only southern white people are racist.
Oh Wow.

1013
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.210
All right.
Um,
now she's saying she wants for Christmas.

1014
01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:14.340
I told her she's perfect the way she is.

1015
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:17.310
I love you just the way you are.

1016
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.560
Um,
but she has low self esteem,
which he,
which dude is w?

1017
01:03:25.561 --> 01:03:28.930
H I c h not which w?
T c.

1018
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:37.290
H.
Wd is w.
H.
I.
T.
No,
it's w h.
I.

1019
01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:40.980
C h or w.
I.
T.
Z private pilots.
Oh,

1020
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.380
all right.
Which he is probably why she uses,

1021
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:51.510
why she's with my fat,
ugly as to begin with Jesus Christ.

1022
01:03:51.511 --> 01:03:55.620
Both of you guys know you're both like,
you know,
you have each other.

1023
01:03:55.621 --> 01:03:59.880
Just Rub your ugly body.
Oh,

1024
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:04.020
neat.
Wow.

1025
01:04:04.021 --> 01:04:05.880
That close to the holidays.

1026
01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:14.370
Am I a bad influence on you?
You're never mean like that.

1027
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.600
That's fucking hilarious.

1028
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:21.390
People know that I'm nice.
They just,
you know,
I have,

1029
01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:25.230
I have my people like me who like me,
but I have,
you know,

1030
01:04:25.231 --> 01:04:29.020
I have my moments where I can be a little rude for no reason.
Hey,
well this,

1031
01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:32.360
he's describing it this way.
I couldn't resist myself.
Yeah.

1032
01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.040
Can sometimes two negatives make a positive?
They have a great looking kid.
Um,

1033
01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:37.590
all right.

1034
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:42.540
We got into it the other night about it and now she's saying she's not happy in

1035
01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:46.980
her own skin.
Oh God.
She wants to be a dude and if I truly loved her,

1036
01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:48.990
then I should expect it.

1037
01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:53.730
I should accept it and get it for her as a Christmas present.

1038
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:57.900
Said some,
I was being a dick about dude on a manipulative fuck this chick.

1039
01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:01.980
This chick wants to get her.
No,
she's trying to trade up.
She's sicky you fat,

1040
01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:02.814
ugly ass.

1041
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:07.050
She wants you to buy some fucking save some of your cake money and spend it on a

1042
01:05:07.051 --> 01:05:10.470
fucking tits or to knows.
Right.
And I'll fuck that shit.

1043
01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:15.600
Fuck that shit.
I said I haven't felt this way about a girl in a long time.

1044
01:05:15.601 --> 01:05:17.980
I love her the way she is and I don't

1045
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.310
<v 0>want to see a fuck up or looks or a body.
I don't know what to do here at Billy.</v>

1046
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:26.170
Boy.
Any advice would be appreciated from you and the lovely Nia.
Yeah.
Fuck this.

1047
01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.290
Fuck this.
I,
I think you get out.

1048
01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:36.410
<v 6>Um,
you're saying he should break up with her,
get out used to break up with her.</v>

1049
01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:39.690
I should help her with herself.
Esteems fuck that.

1050
01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:43.320
What you're just going to give up on somebody you love because they have a low

1051
01:05:43.321 --> 01:05:48.300
self esteem and they're like freaking out about it and no,
you know something.

1052
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:53.130
I was,
I,
that was my advice until she said,
you should buy me that for Christmas.

1053
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.530
No fucking expensive.
That is,
yeah,
that's very expensive.
No,
no dude,
no nos.

1054
01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.820
Is she watching reality TV?

1055
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.420
She's going to try and get it on real housewives of fucking de Moines,
Iowa,

1056
01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.800
wherever the fuck you guys.
No,

1057
01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:08.340
you should really like if she's really trying to do this,

1058
01:06:08.341 --> 01:06:13.320
it's her body and it's her choice.
She should pay for it.
If she really,

1059
01:06:13.321 --> 01:06:17.430
really wants to do it,
she should save up her her pennies or whatever it is.

1060
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:20.340
Save up like $100 a week or whatever the fuck it is.

1061
01:06:20.341 --> 01:06:23.730
Cut Out all this other stuff,
bullshit that she's doing,
going out with friends,

1062
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:24.840
going out with you,

1063
01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:28.260
whatever the fuck and she should save up for it and just be like,

1064
01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.700
I don't feel comfortable and get with like paying for you to alter your body.

1065
01:06:32.701 --> 01:06:36.000
That's not something that I,
you know,
believe in.

1066
01:06:36.001 --> 01:06:38.880
That's not that maybe I have the money for.
It's like this is your body,

1067
01:06:38.881 --> 01:06:43.740
this is your choice and I support you either way B and no,
no,
no.

1068
01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:48.600
And I support you either way,
but I don't feel comfortable paying for it.

1069
01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:52.650
It was a sound of a dump truck backing up in the alley that you should just drop

1070
01:06:52.651 --> 01:06:57.000
her in.
Yeah,
no,
I love you,
but this is not,
I'm not doing this.
I would get out.

1071
01:06:57.001 --> 01:06:57.960
I feel comfortable.

1072
01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:00.270
I gotta be honest with you because those are boundaries right there.

1073
01:07:00.271 --> 01:07:03.180
And that's not,
that's not something you feel comfortable and easy thing to do.

1074
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:06.960
You are perfectly well within your right to say no to that.

1075
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:09.180
And if she has a problem with it,
then yeah,

1076
01:07:09.181 --> 01:07:11.970
I guess she can bounce and she's going to pass those

1077
01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:15.910
<v 0>slow self esteem,
body issues.
Ondor Ondor your fucking kids.</v>

1078
01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.180
It's going to be a nightmare.
She needs to go to therapy.
Oh,

1079
01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:22.750
I don't know what the fuck she needs to do,
but if I was you fuck that.

1080
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.190
Fuck that.

1081
01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:29.680
Fuck that you can you sit me and you need to pay for it.

1082
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:33.520
Fuck you.
Yeah,
that's ridiculous.
I would come over there.

1083
01:07:33.521 --> 01:07:35.470
I would dress up like Santa Claus when I broke up.

1084
01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.760
<v 6>Whoa.
Get the fuck out of my life.</v>

1085
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.240
<v 0>I'm spending all my money on me.
And to do you need,</v>

1086
01:07:43.241 --> 01:07:44.470
if you think you're fat and ugly,

1087
01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:47.590
you can do something about the fat and you can get a fucking personality.

1088
01:07:47.770 --> 01:07:51.110
So why don't you get all the money she wants you to spend on tits?
Wow.

1089
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:54.730
What are you fucking get a trainer.
Get a fucking training for yourself.

1090
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:56.830
Do to fucking move on from this train wreck.

1091
01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:02.140
Give me a Jesus Christ and almost ruined my fucking thanksgiving.
Yeah,
no,

1092
01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:03.940
I'm just kidding.
Anyways,
don't listen to me.

1093
01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.400
I'm not trying to tell you to fucking break up with it,
but that,
that,

1094
01:08:06.401 --> 01:08:09.400
that's a major like,
like,

1095
01:08:09.401 --> 01:08:12.430
what the fuck did you just say to me moment?
You know,

1096
01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.730
don't text during the Goddamn podcast.

1097
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:18.800
<v 4>Someone's let them know where we are.</v>

1098
01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:24.530
What are you having somebody over Bobo,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,

All right.

1099
01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:28.640
It's my,

I'm using his Netflix account right the front of you.

1100
01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:33.080
So fucking deal with it.
Yeah.
With you.
It'd be,

1101
01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:37.770
you know what I think is a great name.
Lamont,
um,
Prague.

1102
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:41.210
I'm trying to pick a stereotypical black name from way back in the day.

1103
01:08:41.211 --> 01:08:44.560
There was nobody named Lamont,
by the way,
except that guy on a San Franciscan

1104
01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:51.040
boo boo.
All right.
Progressive Rock.
Hey.
Oh,
Billy Baru.

1105
01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:54.590
Furred.
Uh,
glad to hear you looking into more progressive rock,

1106
01:08:54.591 --> 01:08:58.670
like every genre of music,
99% is unimaginably derivative.

1107
01:08:58.671 --> 01:09:02.750
Trash in 1% is really unique and well done.
Yeah.
Fay,
I like your perspective.

1108
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:07.550
Your percentage might be a little harsh.
I'd like to think 10% at least as good.

1109
01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:11.600
Even the good stuff can be off putting at first and just take some time to

1110
01:09:11.601 --> 01:09:14.090
digest.
Uh,
like good scotch.

1111
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:17.600
It might be harsh to most people at first,

1112
01:09:17.601 --> 01:09:21.070
but if you put the time and you find a lot of interesting shit going on,
uh,

1113
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:24.890
early generous genesis is some of my favorite checkout.
The tracks,

1114
01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.060
the musical box watch.
Did she wake up

1115
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:32.983
okay.

1116
01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.670
A watcher of the skies and dancing with the moonlit night.

1117
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:42.320
The compositions are complex and beautiful and Phil Collins Collins was really a

1118
01:09:42.321 --> 01:09:45.620
perfect drama.
Yeah,
he's one of my favorite drummers of all time.
Uh,

1119
01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:50.330
the band also had some amazing tracks,
like close to the edge,

1120
01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:54.800
a heart of the sunrise and gates of delirium.

1121
01:09:54.801 --> 01:09:59.690
Bill Bruford was one of their first was on one of their first few albums and was

1122
01:09:59.691 --> 01:10:02.210
a beast.
All right.
You're already mentioned King Crimson.

1123
01:10:02.211 --> 01:10:03.530
They had some truly great song,

1124
01:10:03.531 --> 01:10:06.350
but always had a few improvised stinkers on each album.

1125
01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:11.730
Check out 21st century schizo oid man LARCs tongues in aspect part two and

1126
01:10:14.061 --> 01:10:18.080
starless Bruford his drumming on two of those tracks.
Finally,

1127
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:22.070
he got to get into magma who was one of the,

1128
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:25.460
who has one of the best drummers who have walked the earth a hundred even heard

1129
01:10:25.461 --> 01:10:28.010
of this guy,
Christian Fandor.

1130
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:30.800
It's really his band.

1131
01:10:30.801 --> 01:10:33.740
He composed all of the music and their sound is totally unique.

1132
01:10:33.741 --> 01:10:38.510
They sing in an alien language so you don't get distracted by stupid lyrics.

1133
01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:40.910
Well,
what about their alien language?

1134
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:44.480
That sounds like something that sounds like a sketch.

1135
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:49.730
Will Ferrell would be at almost 70 years old.
Vander plays incredibly.

1136
01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:55.180
They are so good live that I've flown to La and London just to see them play in

1137
01:10:56.241 --> 01:10:59.540
the past couple of years.
I'll have to check this out.

1138
01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:04.520
Look up live videos of them playing the last seven minutes and zombies.

1139
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:07.520
Your drum teacher will vouch for them.
They ease easy.

1140
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:12.200
I'm also psyched to hear you mentioned Meshuggah.
Uh,
Oh yeah,

1141
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:14.190
they've aren't believable.
Uh,
there were another

1142
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:17.390
<v 6>one that takes a lot of time to get a feel for,</v>

1143
01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:22.380
but once you figure out that almost all of their songs are in a strange kind of

1144
01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:23.400
four,
four,

1145
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.240
they become one of the grooviest bands you've ever heard and there's no coming

1146
01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:30.540
back.
Enjoy your foray into the weirdness of progressive music.

1147
01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:36.140
You speckled asshole.
That's a good one.
Speckled asshole.

1148
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:40.320
That's it.
And they won.
So Nia,
how was your thanksgiving?

1149
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:45.690
It was delicious.
I don't mean the meal.
I mean,
how was the weekend?

1150
01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:47.520
Oh,
that's great.
Thank you.

1151
01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:53.260
There you go guys.
That's what I come to him to

1152
01:11:55.340 --> 01:12:00.090
rating positivity.
What you just said.

1153
01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:03.150
That's what I come home too.
I was like,
great.
Thank you.
And you said,
yeah,

1154
01:12:03.151 --> 01:12:06.630
that's what I come on zoo as if I was to some like negative Nelly.
No,

1155
01:12:06.631 --> 01:12:09.480
you just sounded like I was asking for your autograph as you rush through an

1156
01:12:09.481 --> 01:12:11.150
airport.
Great.
Thank you.

1157
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:16.890
Do you want me to say,
I just want you to throw a roll of paper towels at me.

1158
01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:21.550
That's what you should've done.
Stop it.
Get away from me,
uh,
get away from me.

1159
01:12:21.551 --> 01:12:25.620
He doesn't get it.
Stop it.
Get off of me.
I will clean myself.

1160
01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:31.260
I'm always picking at me.
You're a mother now.

1161
01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.630
Go downstairs and go fucking pick your daughter there.
Isn't she beautiful?

1162
01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.410
She's over here.
She's knocked out.

1163
01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:41.350
You can hear her breathing cause she's got a little stuffy know.

1164
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:45.150
I know we had the best day though.
Little snuggle.
What did you guys do?

1165
01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.120
Uh,
we watched the end of the Patriots game.
You know,

1166
01:12:51.121 --> 01:12:55.080
I watched the whole Patriots game and uh,
you know,
everybody's,
you know,

1167
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:58.710
that's one of the reasons why I don't get overly excited about a nine.

1168
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:03.150
And to record when you play in the Miami Dolphins,
which is already uh,
just a,

1169
01:13:03.151 --> 01:13:05.160
a franchise that has been transitioning,

1170
01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:08.730
trying to get to another level for fucking decades,
it feels,
feels like,

1171
01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:10.253
and you know,

1172
01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:15.180
Jay Cutler isn't playing and it's just one of those games.
We got like three,

1173
01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:17.460
four sacs,
which are gonna Pat our numbers.

1174
01:13:17.461 --> 01:13:19.250
So then we go into the plastic will be all day.

1175
01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.970
They got a decent pass rush and blah,
blah,
blah.
This,
like teams like that,

1176
01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:25.340
we'll pad your fucking stats.

1177
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:30.360
I've got to say that backup quarterback was actually pretty good.
Um,
but,

1178
01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:35.220
uh,
I,
I just,
and I love and Dhamaka Sue,
I just,
I don't feel he's a dirty player.

1179
01:13:35.221 --> 01:13:37.860
I just think that that guy plays in the wrong era.
He is,

1180
01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:40.680
he is a fucking Dick.

1181
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:45.390
Butkus violent world of Sam huff type of football player.

1182
01:13:45.391 --> 01:13:49.630
He's just playing in the millennial age.
I love that guy.
Um,

1183
01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.590
anyways,
so we watched that.

1184
01:13:52.591 --> 01:13:55.830
Then I've started to watch some of the rams saints game,
which was a great game.

1185
01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:01.040
And then,
you know,
she had a runny nose and stuff,
so I was constantly,
uh,

1186
01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.730
having to deal with that.
And I don't know that I read some books.

1187
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:09.690
She liked that baby phase.
It's book.
Yeah.
She loves that book.

1188
01:14:09.691 --> 01:14:12.610
I read that book too,
like five times.
Really?
Yeah.
She loves it.

1189
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:16.120
She likes it cause you act it out.
That's like,
you know,
yeah.

1190
01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:19.660
But she gets the faces too that they're making,
you know,
like,
like happy face,

1191
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:23.540
you know.
And then the last one I'll be like,
I go,
I,
you know,
I go laughing.

1192
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:27.410
I'm like,
kicky kicky and she'd look at me going,
hey,
he laughs too.

1193
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:32.290
It's fucking awesome.
That's a little like
she has like,

1194
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:36.610
she still has those,
the big belly laughs.
Like when you really get her,
you know,

1195
01:14:36.611 --> 01:14:38.590
like you'd go,
Oh,
I got her yesterday,
you know?

1196
01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.510
But then she does a little Kiki Kiki also,
which is like funny.
No,

1197
01:14:43.511 --> 01:14:45.940
but I got the belly blast yesterday when you was still mad at me.

1198
01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.770
Did you hear how hard I was making her laugh?
Yes,
I did actually.
Yeah.

1199
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:53.200
Uh,
where were you going to talk about that?
About your,

1200
01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:58.030
about what you're like completely,
you know,

1201
01:14:58.031 --> 01:15:02.710
being mad at the wrong person because you were upset about a game and like that

1202
01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.550
something,
wasn't that what it was was I was carrying Lola,

1203
01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:09.220
my ribs were killing me and then her in the Stroller,

1204
01:15:09.221 --> 01:15:11.800
I told her because she didn't want to be in the stroller.
I know,

1205
01:15:11.801 --> 01:15:15.490
but if she like has a moment where she's like,
Eh,
she'll be fine.

1206
01:15:15.730 --> 01:15:18.220
You keep it moving and she's fine.
She's not one of those,

1207
01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:21.490
cause she's not at that stage yet where she just screaming for 10 minutes

1208
01:15:21.491 --> 01:15:23.020
straight.
That's not who she is.

1209
01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:27.260
And plus she has to learn that you can't carry her all the time.
Yeah.
But no,

1210
01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.790
but she also wrote all the way over there in the car and then we walked up the

1211
01:15:30.791 --> 01:15:34.180
street,
we come back down the street.
She was like,
I'm over it,
you know,

1212
01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:37.180
in the this strapped in like astronauts.
I eventually,
I was like,

1213
01:15:37.181 --> 01:15:41.060
get this fucking thing off me.
I understand.
It's like,
yeah,
I wouldn't like to,

1214
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.960
I mean I'd like to be wheeled around,
but after while,

1215
01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:46.480
but by the time we got stuck in the ride at six flags.
Yeah.

1216
01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:51.070
That's what they feel like.
You think so?
Yeah.
Like fuck,
I gotta get out of here.

1217
01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:53.800
Yeah,
probably.
I would think so anyways.

1218
01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.460
Like having a full on parent conversation right now on the podcast and nobody

1219
01:15:57.461 --> 01:16:00.910
cares about this.
Alright,
sorry.
Anyways,
that's the podcast.

1220
01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.590
A Happy Thanksgiving post Thanksgiving weekend to you what?

1221
01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:10.120
What did you say about being mad at that little boy when we were going down the

1222
01:16:10.121 --> 01:16:12.370
street?
What did I say?
I don't know.

1223
01:16:12.371 --> 01:16:14.920
When I came in you were saying you were just talking about it.

1224
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:18.530
Did you talk about Utah?
I was gonna.
I was saying,
I said,
do I do this?
No,

1225
01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:20.170
I do that and you're just going to be a good dad.

1226
01:16:20.171 --> 01:16:23.110
I realized I was being a baby because I was embarrassed with my behavior there.

1227
01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:26.530
Is that enough?
Yeah,
and she's and she sat down.

1228
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:30.700
She sat down next to me afterwards.
I was watching the late game and she's like,

1229
01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.970
is this game going to make you upset?
Oh my God.
The amount of times,
Nia,

1230
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:39.490
I swear to God that if you were a guy,
I would just start swinging.

1231
01:16:40.210 --> 01:16:42.460
That was one of those moments I want to start swinging.

1232
01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.230
Wouldn't I would have done the most,
well,

1233
01:16:44.231 --> 01:16:48.580
most guys do acted like I was going to swing and not well,
you want to do

1234
01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:55.720
bring it.
I'm not the one.
You know what?
I am the one,

1235

but like they,

1249
01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:50.840
they really make it like a competitive thing.
I'm not talking about that.

1255
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:09.260
And I used to get a laugh back in the 90s because everybody knew,

1256
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:11.780
oh that was like funny.
Like oh hazing.

1257

And now it's like people actually die from that.
So No,

1258
01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.040
You did souls crushed.

1259
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:22.140
How about talking about them making you drink all the water and all that?

1260
01:18:22.141 --> 01:18:24.530
You know when he eat all these pancakes and then they die,

1261

1262
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:29.840
I'm talking about what the fuck they used to decent fucking beat the shit out of

1263
01:18:29.841 --> 01:18:34.030

The stories.
I used to hear

1264

the shit I used to fucking hear that people used to do to each other and I,

1265
01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:41.600
and I was just like,
I used to always think of that and then what?

1266
01:18:41.601 --> 01:18:43.250
Then you get to hang out with them afterwards.

1267
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:46.220
I'm not seeing that always fucking happened.
But Dude,

This is some pew pancake you have to fucking eat.

1270
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:54.380
And somebody finally said something about it and all these older people,

1271
01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.960
I think it was a Dartmouth or something and they were all mad like dude acute

That's so disgusting.
Why?
Why,

1274
01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:13.150

It's a to be in a,

1275
01:19:13.151 --> 01:19:17.750
in a group to do that sort of thing because they're fucking losers.

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:26.330
They've left their parents,

1279
01:19:26.331 --> 01:19:30.940
They want to feel like I always was just yeah I draw.

Hell yeah.

1280

01:19:34.431 --> 01:19:36.270
Like some of my relatives were in frats,

1282
01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:41.271

1283
01:19:41.370 --> 01:19:44.600

Spreading with bucket pate.

They could just beat the shit out of here.
It was bad.

1287
01:19:54.810 --> 01:19:56.930

1288
01:19:56.931 --> 01:20:00.350

1294
01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:19.980

1309
01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:12.300
At my age outlet when I was young kid,

1310
01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:14.520
I would have done whatever the fuck they said.
If I was 18,
19,

1311

I would have done whatever the fuck they said.
Yeah.

1312
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:20.970
So that's why they do it.
But yeah.

1318
01:21:41.531 --> 01:21:46.531

I want to hear like the Sorority,

1320
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:54.090
and I don't want to hear it because it's at this fucking time,

1321
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:56.610
because what you're going to do is they're creating,
this is how they,

1322
01:21:56.611 --> 01:21:58.470
everybody's looking at like Hollywood right now.

01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:02.850
Like it's this giant non-consent consensual,

1324
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:03.811
And it isn't.

1325
01:22:03.811 --> 01:22:06.750
Most people are here busting their ass to fucking great people and all that,

1326
01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:09.870
but then now they're going to say that everybody's out here of,

1327
01:22:09.871 --> 01:22:13.800

So that's true.
That's very true.

1330
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:25.770
And if they all have to go down,
I don't give a fuck because I'm a white chicken.
