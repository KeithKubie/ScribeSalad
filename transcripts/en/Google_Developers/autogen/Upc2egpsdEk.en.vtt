00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.230
 welcome everyone is saint paganotti 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.140
 today I speak of poles for polymer is one 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.150
 platform that allows today 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.189
 using the implementation of wood 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.810
 component is very high 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.989
 within your system 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.489
 developed the saint pin web applications 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.129
 a little differently than how 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.969
 let's imagine living polymers today 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.930
 levels the first called fondation is 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.940
 basically a collection of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.860
 policy and therefore of libraries that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.539
 compensate for potential deficiencies of the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.420
 browser against new ones 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.550
 html5 specifications and contains a series of 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.460
 own information and functionality 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.069
 of the framework and therefore give us 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.539
 precisely all the tools for 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:02.899
 use this this catch that 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.830
 I believe this technology and elements 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.620
 instead contains a collection of 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.900
 elements we can use 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.780
 combine to build our everything 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.760
 poli mea was born around the concept of 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.500
 morcone and therefore the possibility of 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.780
 build your own of clear elements 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.440
 for example of the new html tags but 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.210
 also operational features e 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.160
 mix and match these elements e 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.380
 very important thing and distribute 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.270
 these elements and to use them in 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.760
 applications 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.540
 this is in a nutshell what 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.210
 let's look at how we build today 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.800
 how can we build our own 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.500
 component benefiting from some 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.050
 components already present in the collection 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.480
 in the collection elements of pollina that 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.910
 it is offered to us first of all 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.530
 is a commitment of the new folder 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.260
 let's proceed with the installation of 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.110
 polymer we use boer than a package 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.390
 javascript manager and let's use it 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.790
 then invoking its instant function 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.789
 on the pollica polymer platform library 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.370
 and volley cal poly awakens 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.250
 an ok installation once done 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.569
 we build a new element 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.370
 new file and sorry that will be the 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.930
 container of our element then 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.060
 we can call it 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.250
 sp wall ok dot happens in mind 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.129
 among the various features it can 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.459
 food 200 web development there is also the 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.829
 possibility to use the link to 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.299
 include html pages in html page 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:45.659
 this syntax is foreseen from point c 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.219
 no browser is simulated yet 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.129
 thanks precisely to the use of the poles 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.349
 film of the foundation section and in 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.129
 this case the inside of the master file 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.260
 and people 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:03:00.709
 we are going to close the basic component of 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.810
 polymer which is what helps us then 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.239
 develop our entire application 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.480
 and also let's use a 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.659
 other polymer component that a 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.700
 element of poles but which gives us a hand 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.310
 in the area it retrieves information from 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.079
 pd remote services through ajax is a 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.569
 component already developed is called poly 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.480
 verjux and we do not introduce this 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:30.900
 simple inclusion after being there 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.419
 remember to have it installed because i 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.729
 individual components must be 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:39.150
 also installed and in this case 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:41.609
 also let's use as already done 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.049
 previously the same google for which 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:48.449
 bonini star polymer ajax and how 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.250
 result installation in the presence of 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:53.790
 this component we serve and it 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.159
 development of our component every 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.169
 polymer component differs from 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.340
 syntax pole but complaining let's go to 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:03.989
 define the name of our element e 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.810
 we can define as in this case 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.030
 come here with other boots if the item 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.359
 weeks we are defining will have 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.879
 of attributes and to which variable 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.650
 internal this tribute will have to be 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.930
 associated so we expect a 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.430
 query attribute and attribute here 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.079
 will be associated with workable inter 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.079
 languish as he saw fracts 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.120
 after doing this obviously 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.190
 we must always remember to close 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.500
 the element polymer element then 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.840
 let's close the polymeric element 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.639
 and once this is done we can 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.020
 proceed with the same of the temples in 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.260
 this case our element where 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.229
 go buy a list of videos from 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.090
 youtube and print them as a list for 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:53.130
 which we are going to do 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:55.229
 defined a template within the 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.250
 which we will go naked or in serious and 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:03.150
 simply a list of elements ok 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.130
 then murelle and within this one 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.430
 list of items we will use again 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.289
 the template tag this time with a 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.599
 practical function reads like a tribute 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.719
 particular is called di pitt e si 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:19.139
 continues a certain dexterity with 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:21.330
 the use of the template recognizes 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.510
 quietly this double parenthesis 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.180
 gafÃ  which means inclusion of a given 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.760
 dynamic and therefore in this case we will go 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.580
 repeat for each element of the set 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.159
 of the rai videos prints the title of 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.190
 this video is very important thing to 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:40.800
 remember in poles but is the president 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.380
 binding between what our team is 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.330
 of bindings with our time has given 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.699
 so now I have to update video 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:52.110
 immediately the teams not updated in 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:57.740
 template once this is done let's go 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:06:00.659
 to use the polymer component for 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.669
 the query through ajax 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:06.589
 component that we do not write but 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:08.699
 that we have centered within the 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:11.159
 of the pole library but between the 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.960
 elements of poly me is simply it 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:15.029
 with let alone with our need 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.650
 so I love to say that the component 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:21.250
 poles but jax 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:24.460
 that will return to the jasons of the team 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.350
 fiona those made on youtube videos 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.750
 we are going to specify we also note in 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.509
 this case the notation with double 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.340
 braces to the item q in this 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:35.759
 so we are saying that the value 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:40.210
 of the variable that must be 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:42.100
 used as a tribute qe we ask 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.840
 who helped be managed as jason e 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:48.910
 which was called a charge function 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.889
 video upon receipt of this feed 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:55.630
 done this we close ours 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:57.370
 template ok and we have to go to manage 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.990
 all the dynamic part so this 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.389
 template obviously has its own for 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.820
 display some of its components 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.800
 internal but for example the charge function 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.020
 the video we call upon here 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.479
 obviously to be managed to do 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.639
 we use a very simple tag 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:16.449
 script always inside the polymer 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:19.000
 lemont this tweet tags like it 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:21.729
 involves good polymer part precisely 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.970
 of the framework functions in this 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:29.620
 case we define the element that sp wall 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:32.289
 element is composed of a variable a 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.659
 internal attribute called videos 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:37.000
 which happens to be what we go 

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:40.300
 use within our cycle 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.250
 here you see credit videos in videos and 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:45.520
 videos is defined by default as in 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.820
 empty and one that enhances gods 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:51.010
 default with dumbo death but it is 

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.889
 obviously this enhancement will come 

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.599
 signed by the value to come 

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:57.610
 those in the tribute passed into the 

00:07:55.599 --> 00:08:00.490
 element declaration and has a 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:04.659
 function loads the video that is 

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:08.289
 worries about receiving the result of 

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:09.789
 ajax relation on this endpoint and in 

00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:12.600
 particular to extract from this 

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:15.240
 video interrogation is standard 

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.760
 the internal video variable being there 

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.190
 light binding does not interest us when 

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.860
 this function the call as 

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:25.110
 once the variable of 

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:30.150
 spunto videos we will observe in chain 

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:32.250
 update the repopulate page 

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.860
 precisely the page with the list of videos 

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:37.530
 of research once this is done 

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:40.020
 our complete element contains everything 

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.610
 what interests us is one of itself 

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.340
 used on the page 

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:47.460
 so we expect a lot of index.html 

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:51.210
 very simple is structured as follows 

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:53.670
 a doctype the request to ours 

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.830
 anger towards our platformer file 

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.800
 of blair that basically introduces 

00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.240
 all the phil poles needed for the 

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.210
 behavior of the behavior of 

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.440
 this of this demo and all the 

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.770
 applications that we would like to do with 

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:10.290
 policy let's use the import tag 

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.940
 and let's include our element 

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:15.390
 which in turn by closing the 

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:19.290
 elements on which it depends and we use the 

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:24.030
 cement sp wall with a different from then 

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:25.790
 in this case nirvana and what there is 

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:30.210
 expect we expect the item 

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:34.530
 once in the page it is replaced 

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:40.170
 with the associated anes template we do 

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:45.120
 a test we carry on our own 

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:49.860
 index update to the page and behold 

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:55.200
 precisely the list of the first results 

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:57.480
 in the query to youtube of con 

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.790
 the eagle the nirvana but there is more 

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.070
 if we move on to spector and ci 

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:04.260
 we lose in the console 

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:13.730
 if we go to target our 

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:13.730
 item by tag so 

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:23.630
 sp bull ok ok let's hear about targeting 

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:25.550
 our element we note that the following 

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:29.690
 obviously it exists if we go to 

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:33.440
 edit attribute in our query 

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:35.480
 item for example going to use 

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.410
 chrome as a word like clear of 

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:41.540
 research what happens is that 

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:43.610
 the list is automatically updated with 

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.230
 the new values ââsaid nothing 

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.510
 from the attribute just modified this 

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:52.520
 thanks to the tadi function from the meeting of 

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:55.310
 live binding has previously we say 

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.920
 introduced this is all I hope to 

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.870
 intrigued enough and pollen 

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.160
 still in the state of pre alpha but vi 

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.270
 I highly recommend giving it 

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.540
 quick View 

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.540
 See you soon
