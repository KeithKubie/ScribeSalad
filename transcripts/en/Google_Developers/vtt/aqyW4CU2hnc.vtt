LOUIS GRAY: Good afternoon, this
is Louis Gray here with

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.890
Google Developers Live.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.760
I'm speaking with
Jonathan Barry,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.644
developer advocate on Google+.

00:00:07.644 --> 00:00:10.090
We're here to talk about
Google+ Hangout Apps.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.100
Now you're going to be speaking
next week at Google

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.210
IO 2012, talking about these
Hangout Apps, and I recently

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.920
saw you do a broadcast
on YouTube

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.760
previewing this session.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.060
So I wanted you to have an
opportunity to give us an

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.740
intro to Google+ Hangout Apps.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.420
What you guys are looking at,
and really tell us the state

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.990
of that platform today.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.420
JONATHAN BARRY: Great, yeah,
so thanks Louis.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.689
Thanks for having me.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.440
Hangout Apps have been in public
availability for about

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.480
three months.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.380
When we launched Google+ we
launched with Hangouts.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.230
And the first thing we saw was
people using Hangouts in

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.530
creative and interesting ways
that we never foresaw.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.570
And so immediately our first
reaction was we need to build

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.580
a platform for the platform.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.170
So we launched Google Developer
Preview for the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.190
Hangouts Apps.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.330
And ever since then, developers
in the community

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.310
have been building.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.930
And out the gate we
launched several

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.570
interesting Apps with partners.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.350
And I'll be talking more about
what we've been doing with

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.500
Hangout Apps, the platform,
and giving some

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.750
demos at Google IO.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.740
A few weeks ago we did a
recording about the 101 level,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.750
the introductory stuff,
to getting started

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.320
with Hangout Apps.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.840
It's actually really easy
to get started.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.780
That's sort of the takeaway
of that whole thing.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.720
And we have developers around
the world who are just jumping

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320
on and building really fun and
interesting Apps using that

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.370
technology.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.010
LOUIS GRAY: Now I've
gone ahead.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.480
I've been a user of Hangout
since they first came out.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.730
It's been fun to watch
those apps roll in--

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.970
from playing cards to drawing
silly little faces.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.640
I know we're going to
move beyond that.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.760
I know we had a lot of questions
come in from people

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.760
around the web.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.030
We put them in through
Moderator

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.690
as well as on Google+.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.600
I wanted to go through those
questions that have come

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.710
through and have
a conversation.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.160
So one of the questions that
came in from Scotland, they

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.310
were talking about the
opportunity for applications

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.240
to send anonymous users
to a Hangout.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.420
If an application authorizes
a user with a third party

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.810
service, like Twitter for
example, and wants to send

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.270
them to a Hangout without
the need to register.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.680
Is this possible?

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.290
Perhaps we could have different
options whether

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.220
they're able to create
or join.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.090
JONATHAN BARRY: That's an
interesting question.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.150
So in terms of what we foresee,
we really don't

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.200
comment or speculate on rumors
when it comes to features.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.940
But that's a great piece
of feedback.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.400
Google+ itself is about identity
and being who you

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.290
are, and sharing who you
are, on the web.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.660
So in the foreseeable future,
I think we're going to keep

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.470
with that model, where to take
advantage of the Google+

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.540
experience, you really need
a Google+ account.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.360
Now there's nothing to stop you
from having an application

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.660
with your own third party
identity system, and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.480
redirecting people to Hangouts
and have them log in.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.460
There's also a log in flow if
they're not logged in already.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.652
But that's really core to the
Google experience to take

00:02:46.652 --> 00:02:48.420
advantage of everything.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.430
LOUIS GRAY: What do you think
about options coming up,

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.790
possibly in the future, about
customizing the entry to an

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.040
application?

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.790
One of the developers was saying
what he wants to do is

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.340
present the users
with a button.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.920
And once authorized, they can
be sent directly to a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.460
configured Hangout.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.642
For example, not having
the Invite Landing and

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:05.930
Configuration screen.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.990
JONATHAN BARRY: So we have some
of that already today.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.300
It's called the Hangout
button.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.075
And it's basically an image,
a URL, which you

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:12.980
can put on your site.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.410
You can put it anywhere
on the web.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.290
That will launch a Hangout.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.470
And you can do two things
with that button.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.960
You can launch a brand new
Hangout, and just have it be a

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.490
new Hangout.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.320
So if you just want to have
users communicate.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.200
Or you can pass in a Hangout
to prepopulate.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.750
You can also pass in metadata
with that Hangout.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.700
So if you're on a sports team's
page, you can say I'm

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.950
on the blah football team and it
will actually load the app

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.950
with that configuration
information.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.210
LOUIS GRAY: Now one of the
questions that came in--

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.150
Google has a lot of different
services and Apps and APIs

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.750
that we've rolled out.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.930
So often people want
to know how they

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.540
interact with one another.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.330
So we know Google+ is new.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.500
Hangouts are a little bit
even newer than that.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.420
Especially with the API being
rolled out, people want to

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.460
know how is that going to
integrate with things like

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.790
Google Web Toolkit?

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.840
This is something a lot of
developers out there are using

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.000
and are excited about.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.840
How do you see these two kind
of technologies either

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.120
complementing each other
or working together?

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.450
JONATHAN BARRY: That's
a great question.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.970
If you watch the video that
I recorded the other week,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.790
Hangout Apps are just
JavaScript, HTML, CSS--

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.610
the power of the web in
tools you like to use.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.190
So if you built an application
using the Google Web Toolkit,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.300
there's nothing stopping
you from rendering that

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.660
application as a Hangout App.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.620
In fact, there's a developer
in Japan, Aki Miyazaki, who

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.810
built a wrapper for
the Hangouts API

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.710
using Google Web Toolkit.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.040
So definitely check that out
if you're interested.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.510
LOUIS GRAY: Now I'm
a big Android guy.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.270
You can tell.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.080
I've got the shirt on.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.160
I've got the Android
figurines.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.830
I've been using Android
probably since 2.1.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.510
I would've gotten there
earlier if I could.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.650
But a lot of people have
questions around the different

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.460
versions of Android, and what
that does to impact the type

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.800
of apps that we're building.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.330
So one of the questions
was around the

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.760
Google+ Hangout API.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.600
How can it be used
with Android?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.510
Is there any kind of difference
between say, Ice

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.200
Cream Sandwich, which is the
latest version, or pre Ice

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.660
Cream Sandwich devices?

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.156
JONATHAN BARRY: So first and
foremost, Hangout Apps don't

00:05:00.156 --> 00:05:01.460
run on mobile.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.180
So they're currently limited to
the browser-based Hangout

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.150
experience.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.320
And we've heard from a lot of
developers they would love to

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.630
build the similar types of web
based applications inside of

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.320
the mobile app.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.110
And that's just not on our
roadmap right now.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.210
We're definitely exploring
different possibilities around

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.490
that, but then the differences
between the different Android

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.790
versions become moot.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.170
LOUIS GRAY: That's definitely
something we look at.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.660
You talk about developing for
mobile, developing for the

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.070
browser, I know we have a lot of
folks to make sure we have

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.810
a great Google+ experience
on mobile.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.400
We see that improving
every day.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.640
And I can see, even with
Hangouts, it's becoming even

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.510
easier to join or start
Hangouts as that goes.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.220
I know a lot of people are
really hoping to see that

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.645
change, and find ways to get
Hangout APIs and Hangout Apps

00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:43.360
working on that screen.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.600
One of the thing I take a look
at is, when you're in a

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.930
Hangout you have all these
different options for

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.510
different apps.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.260
Are there ones that come to mind
that you see people are

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.880
really gravitating toward?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.800
How are you finding the type
of face to face experience

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.150
that's available on a Hangout
really making the application

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.770
that much stronger?

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.910
JONATHAN BARRY: So first I'd
like to touch about what makes

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.450
Hangouts really interesting and
fun and why we're seeing

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.010
such a spike in usage.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.310
It's a piece of technology that
helps you do something

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.720
really meaningful and
gets out of the way.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.300
Once you're in the video chat,
you no longer realize you're

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.210
chatting on a laptop
with a camera.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.580
But you're communicating with
a friend or stranger or

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.270
somebody who's really
interesting.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.430
And then Hangout Apps, the ones
that really excel, are

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.150
those ones that are not an
experience in and of

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.150
themselves but makes
the experience of

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.610
connecting even stronger.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.410
So our favorite App, and the one
we actually developed at

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.670
Google, is the Effects App.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.130
It started with a
simple mustache

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.450
for Movember in November.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.950
But now we've expanded to crazy
things like birthday

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.560
hats and NASA helmets
and snorkels.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.720
And so that's the type of
application that is not, in

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.680
and of itself, a destination.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.600
But it's part of
the experience.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.050
LOUIS GRAY: Right, and
one person was asking

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.880
about Native Client.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.720
Native Client, obviously, is a
place where people are looking

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.970
for development especially
when it hits the web.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.120
And Chrome's been talking
a lot about it.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.860
When is that planned to be
released for Hangouts?

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.230
JONATHAN BARRY: Similar to the
Android response, I would say.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.280
Right now the Hangouts rely on
the Google Talk plug-in which

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.100
most Google users already
are taking advantage of.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.530
So it just updates seamlessly.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.800
When it comes to porting that
over a native client, that

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.500
would be very interesting.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.240
And we think there's definitely

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.430
room to explore there.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.020
But right now the plug-in does
work, and as that native

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.380
client matures we'll
revisit that.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.750
LOUIS GRAY: What is it about
Hangouts, and Hangout Apps

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.410
specifically, that make you
excited as a developer

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.330
yourself and excited to speak to
developers about what they

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.300
can do with Hangouts?

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.530
What is it specifically?

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.920
As opposed to looking at other
places to spend their time and

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.990
put their code.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.390
JONATHAN BARRY: That's
a great question.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.860
Personally, I'm a
web developer.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.710
I love JavaScript.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.530
I love HTML.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.830
I love CSS.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.250
And I like building web apps,
especially games and

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.640
interactive utilities.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.610
The best part of Hangouts to me,
and what developers love

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.960
about it, is it's
just the web.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.700
It's in iFrame.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.150
It's your code that you can
host from anywhere.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.145
You can put in on our server,
so you can take advantage of

00:08:11.145 --> 00:08:11.960
our hosting.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.580
But you can use all the
tools that you're

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.800
really comfortable with.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.180
So that's the programming
languages for the backend

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.100
development like [INAUDIBLE],
like Ruby, like App Engine.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.590
All the databases you
like to use and the

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.100
IDs you love to build.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.370
So now you can build apps that
are really easy and really

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.920
leverage the power of the web.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.960
But the extra, and the cherry
on the cake, is the

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.030
power of real time.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.190
The video, the audio, component
and the APIs we

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.350
provide make for a rich
synchronous experience that

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.059
you can't find anywhere
else on the web.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.890
LOUIS GRAY: Talk about finding
things anywhere else, when I

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.530
look at Google one of the things
that's really cool

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.540
about this place is we
have a lot of users.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.020
And they're all over
the world.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.830
And when you look at supporting
all these different

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.400
users, with different
geographies, and different

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.270
languages, there are things
that come up like

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.330
localization.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.530
So there's some questions that
came up around whether you can

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.020
localize the terms of service,
the privacy policy, support

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.130
information.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.110
How much thought do we give,
when creating Hangout APIs or

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.210
even just the core Google+, if
you could speak to that in

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.060
terms of serving markets outside
of the standard North

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.070
America and Europe.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.800
JONATHAN BARRY: That's
a great question.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.070
It's actually very timely.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.570
This morning we launched the
ability to localize the title,

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.730
description, and icon for
your Hangout Apps.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.480
I'm pretty sure this question
relates to that.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.890
That's actually a pretty
good piece of feedback.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.550
Right now most people surface
the terms of service, privacy

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.070
policy, and support page within
the application itself.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.090
So you have control over that.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.790
We'll certainly look at how we
can introduce the same level

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.750
of localization support for
those built into the package.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.830
Hangouts themselves run in as
many countries as the Google+

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.400
can that we can legally
run it.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.910
And so that means if you're in
Sao Paulo and Austria, you

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.490
could have a high quality
Hangout together.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:56.910
Just as well as if you're
in San Francisco

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.470
and Mountain View.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.610
And that, to me, is
Google scale.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.720
An amazing technology that's
free for users.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.360
LOUIS GRAY: So if we could
leave with one thing.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.290
What is something that aspiring
developers should

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:12.360
know about Google+ that you
think most of them don't know?

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.730
JONATHAN BARRY: There's a lot
of stuff to talk about

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.810
Google+, but I would say that
there's a really strong

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.530
community around Google+.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:27.030
And that means for developers
talking to other developers.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.110
We're having our Google IO
conference just next week.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.060
6,000 developers from around
the world coming together

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.950
learning about new technologies,
but also

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.460
communicating with each other,
socializing, networking.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.970
And I find that there's a strong
developer community

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.030
within Google+.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.990
I get to learn about new
libraries, new technologies,

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.540
new tools to help me be
a better developer.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.430
So definitely check
out this growing

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.790
community within Google+.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.000
LOUIS GRAY: All right,
well I appreciate you

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.120
taking the time Jonathan.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.560
It really sounds like Hangout
Apps are taking off.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.690
We're just at the beginning,
and I'm looking forward to

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.790
what's next.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.990
And thanks for doing our Q &amp;A.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.810
JONATHAN BARRY: Thank
you Louis.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:01.510
LOUIS GRAY: See you
at the Google IO.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.760
JONATHAN BARRY: See
you at Google.
