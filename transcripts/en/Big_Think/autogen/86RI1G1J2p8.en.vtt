00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.190
Art, you've asked one of the most important
questions in modern physics.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.530
Is time real or is it an illusion?

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.380
Well, time is certainly real, but the question
is, what do we mean by the word time?

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.289
And it may surprise you that physicists don't
have a simple answer for that.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.700
One thing we are absolutely sure of is that
the rate of time does change.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.160
Time is not just simply a progression, like
a river that keeps flowing.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.210
It can change depending on how fast you're
moving through space.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.430
And this is Einstein's special theory of relativity.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.780
The idea is that the faster you go, the slower
time appears to be moving for you if other

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.060
observers look at you going by.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.330
So if you're on a spaceship going half the
speed of light, you don't perceive any change

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.330
yourself.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.450
You perceive time going ahead just as you
always have felt it, but if people look at

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:11.759
you in the spaceship going by, And not just
you moving, but the vibrations of your atoms.

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.890
Any way you can possibly measure time is slowed
down.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.810
As you go faster and faster and approach the
speed of light, your time slows down more

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.810
and more.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.590
And the amazing thing is that at the speed
of light, time does not progress at all.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.259
So this is something that has always kind
of freaked me out because there's light in

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.439
this room right now.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.249
That there's light bouncing off my body.

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:34.539
That's the way you can see me.

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.640
I can look up at the sky and see the Sun.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.659
Light does not experience time.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.179
It's something that actually exists outside
of time, and yet we still interact with it.

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.729
And I've never found the right way to think
about that.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.499
This effect is not just a theory.

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.969
This is incredibly well measured every single
day.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.170
We accelerate things in particle accelerators
to very close to the speed of light, and all

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.279
the processes in physics slow down as that
happens.

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:02.670
Applications to this, too.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.279
For example, the global positioning satellites
that allow you to take your location from

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:07.279
your smartphone.

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:10.060
Those satellites are going overhead very,
very fast.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.990
They're going at nearly 20,000 miles an hour.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.360
And it turns out that that's fast enough that
their time is slowed down.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.200
They're actually in a slightly different time
frame than we are.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720
And we have to account for that.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.430
We have to correct for that mathematically.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.330
Otherwise, you would not get the right location.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.490
So we know that time slows down.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.569
We observe this happening all around us.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.890
It was a really hard thing in modern physics
about 100 years ago for people to let go of

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.040
the idea that time just has a rate that it
flows-- that, in fact, it can flow at different

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.260
rates for different observers.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.620
Then there's the question of what is time
related to space?

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.379
And you may have heard that Einstein talked
about a concept called space-time.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.110
He didn't believe that space and time were
separate things.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.590
We certainly perceive them differently in
our human brains.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.019
We can move through space, but time always
seems to go just at one rate and in one direction.

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.120
But Einstein thought they were part of a fabric.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.920
They were woven together.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.569
And one of the ways he illustrated this was
that you have to adjust space and time so

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.980
they always kind of balance out.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.760
If I am not moving through space-- I'm sitting
here still in this chair-- then time just

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.010
seems to go forward at a natural rate.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.159
Time just flows.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.709
But if I start going faster and faster, my
time slows down.

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.430
So in a sense, I'm moving through space very
fast.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.400
So I can't move through time as fast as I
might have.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.430
The two balance each other, space-time.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.280
If you move through space very fast, time
begins to slow down, and they become the same

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.900
thing.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.190
And now something gets even stranger, and
that is that Einstein thought that the beginning

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.109
of the universe-- the big bang-- created all
of space and all of time at once in a big

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.010
whole something-- So every point in the past
and every point in the future are just as

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.439
real as the point of time you feel yourself
in right now.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.439
Einstein believed that literally.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.689
One of his best friends died, and he wrote
a letter to this person's wife, talking about

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.239
how his friend still exists.

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.989
Time is a landscape, and if you had the right
perspective on the universe, you would see

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.150
all of it laid out in front of you-- all past,
present, and future as a whole thing.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.470
And he said, your husband, my friend is just
over the next hill.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.870
He's still there.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.130
We can't see him where we are now, but we
are on this landscape with him and he still

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.480
exists just as much as he ever has.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.690
Einstein believed that you right now have
been dead for trillions of years, but you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.280
haven't been born yet.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.520
That everything that's happened to you, if
you could get the right perspective on the

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.920
universe, you could see all at once.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.160
So modern physics has required us to really
let go of the idea of time as something that

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.160
just flows.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.440
We can measure that it's changing around us
all over the place-- satellites, particle

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.980
accelerators, anything going fast-- and it
may be that space and time are the same thing

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.200
all wrapped up together
