00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.479
Just how did the Tyrannosaurus rex get from
oversized chicken to the colossal beast we

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:08.450
tend to see on the silver screen?

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.420
Well, we’re still digging for the answers.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.859
Outside the confines of Jurassic Park, real-life
scientists are always updating our ideas about

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.400
what dinosaurs may have looked like, and we’re
constantly being surprised by their findings.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.609
Like these brand new digital reconstructions
of what baby T. rex’s may have looked like,

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.449
giving us new insight into their life cycle.

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.719
And beyond our curiosity about their beautiful
exterior, related research has just revealed

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.190
that an early, ancestral species of T. rex
was actually tiny!

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.250
Like the size of a small deer!

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.810
Turns out, the iconic T. rex is an enigmatic
animal to understand.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.420
To get us a little more situated in this story
we talked with Mark Norell, who’s been working

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.690
on understanding the details of dinosaur life
for his whole career.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.920
He and his team have created digital reconstructions
of T. rex hatchlings, and guys—they’re

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.260
so cute.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.359
And covered in feathers!

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.250
Mark Norell: “T. rex is kind of important
because it's really an anomalous animal.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.070
There's nothing else really like it at all.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.640
And now that we're starting to get enough
specimens of it that we can actually take

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.520
and really understand quite a bit about things
like its growth, things like that ... Habits,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.520
maybe a little bit about diet.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.520
but it's certainly, I mean,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.130
Most dinosaur specimens we only have one specimen
of, or most dinosaur species.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.070
But certainly with T. rex, we have 46 pretty
well preserved specimens now.”

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.299
Until recently we didn’t have that much
info about how the T. rex became the T. rex.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.939
We knew they were a top end predator for about
15 million years up until their extinction

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.480
at the end of the Cretaceous period.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.740
But when we try to go backward, before their
mighty reign of terror began, there’s about

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.700
a 70 million year gap between giant T. rex
and a medium-sized, primitive T. rex ancestor

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.009
we’d been able to unearth from the Jurassic
period.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.939
There was just nothing in the fossil record
to indicate to us how, when, and how fast

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.920
T. rex went, in the words of one paleontologist,
‘from wallflower to prom king’.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.720
So the chances of becoming a fossil are very,
very, very, very, very small.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.319
Chances of being a well preserved fossil is
even much, much, much, much, smaller.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.410
So we're working with not only a poor record,
but a record which is flawed, also in the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.019
sense that small animals don't preserve as
large as big ones.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.319
However—new fossils just unearthed in Utah
are helping us put together the pieces.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.050
These specimens are now thought to be the
oldest Cretaceous tyrannosauroid remains ever

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.650
discovered in North America, and surprise!

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.750
They’re the much smaller and faster ancestor
of the huge, lumbering T. rex we know and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.750
love.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.400
This tiny ancestor of goliath is called Moros
intrepidus, which cheerfully translates to

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.349
“the harbinger of doom”.

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.330
It took this team 10 years of incredibly persistent
excavation to find this key organism, helping

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.470
us not only piece together T. rex lineage,
but also give us a sense of where they lived

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.159
and how they migrated through an ancient earth.

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.959
This update to the fossil record now tells
us that at some point, the T. rex must have

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.470
made the journey from Asia, the home the very
primitive tyrannasoid fossils we’d found

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.739
previously, to North America, where we’ve
found this new in-betweener.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.220
In addition to improving our understanding
of where the T. rex came from and how it evolved

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.500
over time, we’re also starting to revisit
how they grew up.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.860
What happens in between a baby T. rex hatching
and the full adult?

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.680
And WHY are its arms so tiny!?!

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.140
Mark: “I mean it grew to adult size in about
19 years, which is pretty remarkable..."

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.680
So that T. rex could grow to its immense size,
for a while it was growing over two kilograms

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.920
a day for quite a while during its lifetime.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.280
So that's surprising.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.080
As babies, the little stumpy T. rex arms were
more proportional to their body size, letting

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.870
them hold on to wriggling prey, like their
smaller tyrannosauroid ancestors.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.940
But as they had to pack on more and more weight
even faster as they rose to prominence, more

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.799
of that development went to the head and neck,
specially designed to brutally crush their

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.940
prey...leaving the arms just.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.940
Hangin’.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.079
The past ten years have been full of advancements
to the computational and scientific tools

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.040
paleontologists use to analyze fossilized
remains.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.130
Techniques like synchrotron radiation and
Raman spectroscopy represent non-invasive

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.800
imaging that let us see how the animals grew,
to be able to see and count the layers of

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.760
bone they put down every year.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.180
Mark: "So on a computation and technology
side really a lot of has changed.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.500
And it's changing really quickly now, just
as we speak."

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.981
Advancements in both excavation and analysis
are continuing for the T. rex niche of this

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:46.770
field and paleontology in general—we’re
starting to look at the fossil record in new

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.890
ways to help us gain a deeper understanding
of well, everything.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.170
From the origins of these species to what
they looked like, what they ate, how they

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.390
interacted with each other, even what the
ancient atmosphere was like ...there’s just

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.710
a wealth of information out there waiting
to be dug up and discovered to tell us more

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.220
about our world and understand how we got
to today.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.440
Might as well start with the T. rex, huh?

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.840
While we won’t be bringing dinosaurs truly
back to life any time soon, the American Museum

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.260
of Natural History is putting on quite the
show with their T. rex recreations so if you’re

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.230
in town you should check it out, or check
them out online at the link in the description.

is in the comments, and make sure you subscribe
