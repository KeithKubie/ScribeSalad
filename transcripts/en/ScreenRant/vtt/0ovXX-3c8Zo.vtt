00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.620
Despite accusations of formulaic storytelling,
moviemaking is not a perfect science.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.519
It’s an inherently human endeavor and as
a result, things go wrong.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.250
In the hustle and bustle of set-life, where
emotions run high, it’s inevitable that

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.550
someone will get hurt.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.220
And hey, if you like what you see, subscribe
to our channel, but in the meantime here are

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.820
10 Popular Actors Who Hurt Their Co-Stars.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.770
Idris Elba, Star Trek Beyond
Stage combat is not an exact science.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.820
But, as your mother probably used to say,
“it’s all fun and games until someone

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.820
loses an eye”.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.290
For Idris Elba and Chris Pine though, the
fun didn’t actually stop.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.440
While shooting a fight scene for Star Trek
Beyond, Elba clocked Pine for real, resulting

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.370
in a massive shiner overtop one of Pine’s
trademark baby-blues.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.250
The surprise meeting of fist and face didn’t
dampen anyone’s spirits though.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.400
The actors laughed off the accident pretty
much immediately, and the bruise was so impressive

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.370
it actually made its way into the movie.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.360
Which probably saved Pine some time in the
makeup chair.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.350
Dave Bautista, Spectre
To call Dave Bautista an “intimidating individual”

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350
would be a dramatic understatement.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.539
With years of experience in the WWE, his transition
from small screen brawler to big screen badass

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:15.749
is a natural one.

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:19.770
Fans are looking forward to seeing the actor
reprise his role as Drax in the upcoming Guardians

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.670
of the Galaxy sequel, but they might also
recognize him as Mr. Hinx from 2015’s Spectre.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.049
Bautista has plenty of experience flinging
giants around, and if Long Distance Human

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.600
Throwing was an olympic sport, he’d take
gold every time.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.270
Things on a movie set are pretty tightly controlled,
but in the middle of an intense fight scene

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.240
it’s easy to get caught up in the action.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.939
The actor threw Daniel Craig so hard that
he needed knee surgery and two weeks off.

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.490
It was a total accident, but 007 was probably
grateful for the time off.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.929
The Millennium Falcon, Star Wars - Episode
VII: The Force Awakens

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.439
Before you run to the comments section to
tell us that an object cannot be considered

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.090
an actor, we gently remind you that Wilson
the volleyball was the REAL star of Cast Away,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.049
Thomas the Tank Engine has been carrying his
own franchise for years, and Doc Brown &amp; Marty

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.880
McFly would be nothing without their sweet,
sweet DeLorean.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.390
One of the biggest celebrities to emerge from
Star Wars lore is Han Solo’s trusty ship,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.390
the Millennium Falcon.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.209
And big ol’ Falcon went a little haywire
during filming of the series’ 2015 installment

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.620
The Force Awakens.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.459
One of the doors fell on Harrison Ford while
filming and broke his leg.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:39.450
Obviously the ship is getting old, but apparently
it’s also getting a little crotchety too.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.640
Lawrence Tierney &amp; Quentin Tarantino, Reservoir
Dogs

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.030
Tarantino is a polarizing filmmaker.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.170
His movies are violent, profanity-laden, and
propped up by a series of pop culture monologues.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.330
Since Tarantino has been on the scene for
a couple of decades now, the director has

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.130
established his style and amassed a hardcore
fanbase in the process.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.560
But back when he was the new kid on the block,
Tarantino got more sass than he expected and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.000
ended up in a tussle with Hollywood royalty
Lawrence Tierney.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.260
Apparently the actor didn’t trust that Tarantino
knew how to make a movie, and the altercation

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.630
escalated into a full-on slugfest.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.900
This all happened on the first week of filming,
so not only did the two men not want to work

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:29.120
together anymore, they also didn’t have
to.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.040
Jennifer Lawrence, The Hunger Games franchise
Chuck Norris isn’t the only one roundhouse-kicking

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.171
his way through Hollywood anymore.

00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:39.370
A new player has entered the game, and her
name is Jennifer Lawrence.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.049
The actress learned how to do a bunch of cool
things in preparation for her role as Katniss

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.409
Everdeen, lead heroine in The Hunger Games.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.859
And while some clever editing and a pile of
money give the impression that her days were

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.549
action-packed, filming a movie is a whole
lot of “hurry up and wait”.

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.590
Almost nothing happens in one take— and
pyrotechnics don’t clean themselves up—

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.640
so Lawrence and actor Josh Hutcherson had
plenty of downtime to practice and goof around.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.109
It was during one of these sessions where
the actress’ roundhouse kicking connected

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.879
with her co-star’s temple, making him see
stars.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:11.359
If we had to get kicked in the face by anyone,
we’d pick Jennifer Lawrence too.

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.230
Dolph Lundgren, Rocky IV
Fake fighting is almost as hard as real fighting.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.310
The meticulous choreography can interrupt
the flow of an actors performance.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.140
Not to mention that when it’s done poorly,
it’s so, so obvious.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.670
When Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren
were filming their infamous showdown from

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.290
Rocky IV, both men quickly grew tired of faking
it.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.791
After a couple of takes, the two decided that
if the hits were going to look legit, they

00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:36.290
would have to be legit.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.820
Stallone may have been ready to rumble, but
his body wasn’t.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.170
And after taking a REALLY hard punch to the
chest, the actor’s heart swelled so much

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.970
that he had to spend over a week in the hospital
because of it.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.490
James Franco, Annapolis
There is no doubt that actor-turned-director-turned-student-turned

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.620
Oscar-host James Franco is a thespian through
and through.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.690
By this point, he’s attended like twenty
universities and has become more confident

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.500
in himself and his craft.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.620
And rightfully so.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.851
But while filming 2006’s Annapolis, the
actor acknowledges that he still had a lot

00:05:07.851 --> 00:05:08.851
to learn.

00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:13.550
Franco made himself an enemy in co-star Tyrese
when he insisted on punching him for real

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.010
during fight scenes and wouldn’t stop.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.810
Franco chalks it up to being inexperienced
and taking a stubbornly realistic approach

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.930
to his character.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:28.820
Tyrese chalks it up to Franco being an asshole.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.210
Quentin Tarantino, Inglorious Basterds
While it might be edited to make Christoph

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.710
Waltz look like the jerkiest-jerk who ever
roamed the earth, Quentin Tarantino is responsible

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.710
for this one.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.020
“But wait a minute!” we hear you cry,
“Tarantino isn’t in Inglorious Basterds!”

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.050
Well actually, we’re both right!

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.870
In the scene where Diane Kruger’s Bridget
Von Hammersmark is being choked to death,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.110
it doesn’t just look like she’s dying,
she actually is dying.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.930
And at the hands of her director.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.000
Tarantino’s face isn't in the movie, but
the hands around her neck are his.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.430
During an interview, he argued that the changes
happening in a human eyeball during death

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.580
can’t be faked, so he had to do it for real.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.090
We know Tarantino is old-school, but next
time maybe he could use a little CGI instead?

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.610
Jared Leto, Suicide Squad
First of all, let’s get one thing straight:

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.090
not all wounds are physical.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.940
So if the person playing the sadistic psychopathic
character in your movie is also a method actor,

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.740
things might get… intense.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.880
In preparation for his role as the Joker in
last summer’s Suicide Squad, Jared Leto

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.680
took himself to some dark places.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.160
As a result, he was arguably the most talked
about cast member during production.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.210
And probably had the least friends too.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.190
Leto sent some pretty nasty gifts to his cast-mates,
freaking out co-star Margot Robbie so much

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.050
that she was scared to even be near him.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.520
If you’ve seen the movie, you can understand
why that would have been a problem.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.460
Margot Robbie, The Legend of Tarzan
Let’s be real— “doin’ it” can be

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.880
awkward enough when there’s an absolute
minimum number of people involved.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.300
But throw in a camera, director, and crew?

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.390
Talk about nerve wracking.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.160
That’s why actors get paid the big bucks.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.550
Because in addition to heaps of potential
awkwardness, there’s also a chance that

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.030
the talent could get hurt.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.760
While filming the love scene between Margot
Robbie and co-star Alexander Skarsgard, that’s

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.760
exactly what happened.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.480
The Legend of Tarzan director David Yates
wanted the sequence to have an “animalistic”

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.260
feel, which makes total sense given the context.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.050
Robbie accidentally went a little too far
and ended up injuring her bed-mate.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.060
Good luck trying to explain that one to the
workers compensation board.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.940
