00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.980
In the West, philosophers write long non-fiction
books, often using incomprehensible words

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.880
and limit their involvement with the world
to lectures and committee meetings.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.190
But in the East, and especially in the Zen
tradition, philosophers write poems, rake

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.340
gravel, go on pilgrimages, practice archery,
write aphorisms on scrolls, chant and, in

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.200
the case of one of the very greatest Zen thinkers,
Sen no Rikyū, involve themselves in teaching

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.860
people how to drink tea in consoling and therapeutic
ways.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.660
Sen no Rikyū was born in 1522 in the wealthy
seaport of Sakai, near present day Osaka.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.250
Show map of this place.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.280
His father, Tanaka Yohyoue, was a warehouse
owner who worked in the fish trade and wished

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.900
his son to join him in business.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.700
But Rikyū turned away from commercial life
and went in search of wisdom and self-understanding

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.839
instead. He became fascinated by Zen Buddhism,
apprenticed himself to a few Masters and took

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.879
to a life of wandering the countryside, with
few possessions.

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.100
Zen Buddhism was founded by traveling monks,
who believed that people best could find spiritual

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.950
meaning not by thinking complex thoughts or
performing great deeds but by doing (often

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.270
very simple) things with intense thoughtfulness
and concentration. The wise Bodhidharma, for

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.329
example, is believed to have stared at a wall
for nine years with to improve his focus.

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.630
Rikyu chose to focus on something that was
a little more refreshing than staring at the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.670
wall: drinking tea. Today we remember him
for the contributions he made to the reform

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.979
and appreciation of the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.360
chanoyu (茶の湯) = Japanese tea ceremony.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.159
It literally means “hot water for tea.”
The Japanese had been drinking tea since the

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.670
9th century, the practice having been imported
from China by merchants and monks. The drink

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.340
was considered healthy as well as calming
and spiritual.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.359
But it was Rikyū’s achievement to put the
tea ceremony on a more rigorous and profound

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.939
philosophical footing.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.869
The Japan of his era had grown image-conscious
and money-focused. Rikyū promoted an alternative

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.429
set of values which he termed

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:54.640
wabi-sabi (侘寂)

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.479
a compound word combining wabi, or satisfaction
with simplicity and austerity, with sabi an

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.509
appreciation of the imperfect.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.630
Across fields ranging from architecture to
interior design, philosophy to literature,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.800
Rikyū awakened in the Japanese a taste for
the pared down and the authentic, for the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.660
undecorated and the humble.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.670
His particular focus was the tea ceremony,
which Rikyū believed to hold a superlative

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.930
potential to promote wabi-sabi.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.700
He made a number of changes to the rituals
and aesthetics of the ceremony. He began by

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.150
revolutionising the space in which the tea
ceremony was held. It had grown common for

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.770
wealthy people to build extremely elaborate
teahouses in prominent public places, where

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.670
they served as venues for worldly gatherings
and displays of status.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.180
Rikyū now argued that the teahouse should
be shrunk to a mere two metres square, that

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.320
it should be tucked away in secluded gardens

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.440
and that its door should be made deliberately
a little too small, so that all who came into

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.390
it, even the mightiest, would have to bow
and feel equal to others. The idea was to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.890
create a barrier between the teahouse and
the world outside.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.200
The very path to the teahouse was to pass
around trees and stones, to create a meander

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.560
that would help break ties with the ordinary
realm.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.650
Properly performed, a tea ceremony was meant
to promote what Rikyū termed

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.950
wa (和) = harmony

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.060
which would emerge as participants rediscovered
their connections to nature: in their garden

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.360
hut, smelling of unvarnished wood, moss and
tea leaves, they would be able to feel the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.500
wind and hear birds outside – and feel at
one with the non-human sphere.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.810
Then might come an emotion known as

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.370
kei (敬) = respect

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.260
the fruit of sitting in a confined space with
others, and being able to converse with them

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.180
free of the pressures and artifice of the
social world.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.070
A successful ceremony was to leave its participants
with a feeling of

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.500
jaku (寂) = tranquillity

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.090
sei (静) = purity

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.510
central concepts in Rikyū’s gentle, calming
philosophy.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.340
Rikyū’s prescriptions for the ceremony
extended to the instruments employed.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.090
He argued that tea ceremonies shouldn’t
rely on expensive or conventionally beautiful

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.790
cups or teapots. He liked worn bamboo tea
scoops that made a virtue of their age and

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.350
bamboo flower vases like this one, which he
carved himself:

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.910
Because in Zen philosophy, everything is impermanent,
imperfect and incomplete, objects that are

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.680
themselves marked by time and haphazard marks
can, Rikyū suggested, embody a distinct wisdom

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.980
and promote it in their users.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.960
It was one of Rikyū’s achievements to take
an act which in the West is one of the most

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.670
routine and unremarkable activities and imbue
it with a solemnity and depth of meaning akin

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.850
to a Catholic Mass.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.810
Every aspect of the tea ceremony, from the
patient boiling of the water to the measuring

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.940
out of green tea powder, was coherently related
to Zen’s philosophical tenets about the

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.290
importance of humility, the need to sympathise
with and respect nature, and the sense of

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.490
the importance of the transient nature of
existence.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.810
It’s open ended where this approach to everyday
life may go.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.240
It leaves open the possibility that many actions
and daily habits might, with sufficient creative

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.770
imagination, become similarly elevated, important
and rewarding in our lives. The point isn’t

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.820
so much that we should take part in tea ceremonies,
rather that we should make aspects of our

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.310
everyday spiritual lives more tangible by
allying certain materials and sensuous rituals.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.460
Rikyū reminds us that there is a latent sympathy
between big ideas about life and the little

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.900
everyday things, such as certain drinks, cups,
implements and smells.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.350
These are not cut off from the big themes;
they can make those themes more alive for

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.530
us. It is the task of philosophy not just
to formulate ideas, but also to work out mechanisms

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.610
by which they may stick more firmly and viscerally
in our minds.
