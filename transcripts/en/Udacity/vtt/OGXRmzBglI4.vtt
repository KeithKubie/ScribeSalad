I'm Mike Wells and
this is my bad interview experience.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.700
So during an interview one time,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.510
I was given 15 minutes to write
the computer side of tic tac toe.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.870
A function that would
play the computer side.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.570
Now I play tic tac toe
a lot with my kids.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.520
And we all know, if you get
three corners, you win the game.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.340
So that's what I approached it as, and
I'm standing at the white board and

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.210
I keep mumbling to myself just
get three corners and I win.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.080
I'm telling the interviewer if
I get three corners, I win.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.455
And I wasted fifteen minutes trying to
win the game of tic tac toe and, at

00:00:41.455 --> 00:00:45.335
the end, I didn't even have a function
that would play the game of tic tac toe.

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:46.075
It was horrible.

00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:46.915
It wouldn't even run.

00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:51.645
It would have been better for
me to just write a function that would

00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:54.085
put an X in the very
first available slot.

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:56.175
Instead, I'm too worried about
winning and winning and winning.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.660
I walked away from that, and

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.940
I had a friend who interviewed at
the same company, and I was like, dude,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.269
I had this question, and
I didn't do very well.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.350
And he laughed about it,
and he reassured me.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.940
He said, I bombed it as well the first
time and then we sat down and

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.400
worked through another solution
that not only played the game, but

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.460
also played it very well.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.490
So that was fun and I get to learn
a little bit from the process as well.
