really interesting it so is this a flat
 

01:14:43.239 --> 01:14:46.709
really interesting it so is this a flat
water yes I brought Stillwater's today I

01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719
water yes I brought Stillwater's today I
 

01:14:46.719 --> 01:14:49.290
water yes I brought Stillwater's today I
thought like today is still November

01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:49.300

TDS mm-hmm very very long because this

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:04.690
TDS mm-hmm very very long because this
 

01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:06.000
TDS mm-hmm very very long because this
water has never been touched on the

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:06.010
water has never been touched on the
 

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:08.189
water has never been touched on the
ground it's like rain water drips down

01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:08.199
ground it's like rain water drips down
 

01:15:08.199 --> 01:15:10.109

it goes right away on the ice glacier

01:15:10.109 --> 01:15:10.119
it goes right away on the ice glacier
 

01:15:10.119 --> 01:15:13.020
it goes right away on the ice glacier
and freezes up this waters around 15,000

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:13.030
and freezes up this waters around 15,000
 

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:15.270
and freezes up this waters around 15,000
years old what's in the bottle right

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280
years old what's in the bottle right
 

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.319

here and I see the picture right here so
 

01:15:19.329 --> 01:15:20.700
here and I see the picture right here so
they're harvesting these icebergs and

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:20.710
they're harvesting these icebergs and
 

01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:21.810
they're harvesting these icebergs and
all some people would say like are you

01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:21.820
all some people would say like are you
 

01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:24.030
all some people would say like are you
not smart and so you we all know like

01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.040
not smart and so you we all know like
 

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.410
not smart and so you we all know like
global warming and everything yeah oh

01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:25.420
global warming and everything yeah oh
 

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.270
global warming and everything yeah oh
you're like taking the ice box even my

01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280
you're like taking the ice box even my
 

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.979
you're like taking the ice box even my
waist yeah no these are ice packs were

01:15:28.979 --> 01:15:28.989
waist yeah no these are ice packs were
 

01:15:28.989 --> 01:15:30.839
waist yeah no these are ice packs were
breaking down like totally normal

01:15:30.839 --> 01:15:30.849
breaking down like totally normal
 

01:15:30.849 --> 01:15:33.030
breaking down like totally normal
they're starting to dilute then into the

01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040
they're starting to dilute then into the
 

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.560
they're starting to dilute then into the
North Sea and when they are deluded you

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:34.570
North Sea and when they are deluded you
 

01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:36.000
North Sea and when they are deluded you
cannot use that water anymore coat then

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:36.010
cannot use that water anymore coat then
 

01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:37.800
cannot use that water anymore coat then
it's like heavily salted yeah so they're

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:37.810
it's like heavily salted yeah so they're
 

01:15:37.810 --> 01:15:39.870
it's like heavily salted yeah so they're
picking up this huge icebergs and you

01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:39.880
picking up this huge icebergs and you
 

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.459
picking up this huge icebergs and you
can see like they're tonnes they have a

01:15:41.459 --> 01:15:41.469
can see like they're tonnes they have a
 

01:15:41.469 --> 01:15:43.050
can see like they're tonnes they have a
super-heavy they have our own vessel

01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:43.060
super-heavy they have our own vessel
 

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.430
super-heavy they have our own vessel
they're picking up these icebergs and

01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:44.440
they're picking up these icebergs and
 

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.709
they're picking up these icebergs and
then melting them down into this bottle

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719
then melting them down into this bottle
 

01:15:46.719 --> 01:15:48.660
then melting them down into this bottle
so it's something very cost intensive

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:48.670
so it's something very cost intensive
 

01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:51.479
so it's something very cost intensive
and they're fast intensive and also it's

01:15:51.479 --> 01:15:51.489
and they're fast intensive and also it's
 

01:15:51.489 --> 01:15:53.459
and they're fast intensive and also it's
not gonna be that they're not gonna make

01:15:53.459 --> 01:15:53.469
not gonna be that they're not gonna make
 

01:15:53.469 --> 01:15:56.189
not gonna be that they're not gonna make
million now and I think they did 10,000

01:15:56.189 --> 01:15:56.199
million now and I think they did 10,000
 

01:15:56.199 --> 01:15:57.359
million now and I think they did 10,000
bottles faster so that's why the price

01:15:57.359 --> 01:15:57.369
bottles faster so that's why the price
 

01:15:57.369 --> 01:15:58.589
bottles faster so that's why the price
point is gonna be elevated it's

01:15:58.589 --> 01:15:58.599
point is gonna be elevated it's
 

01:15:58.599 --> 01:16:01.859
point is gonna be elevated it's
something very very unique that's a

01:16:01.859 --> 01:16:01.869
something very very unique that's a
 

01:16:01.869 --> 01:16:04.560
something very very unique that's a
fascinating so it's a very fun

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:04.570
fascinating so it's a very fun
 

01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:07.740
fascinating so it's a very fun
interesting water to start your soap and

01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:07.750
interesting water to start your soap and
 

01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:11.339
interesting water to start your soap and
remember maybe oh my goodness and it's

01:16:11.339 --> 01:16:11.349
remember maybe oh my goodness and it's
 

01:16:11.349 --> 01:16:15.089
remember maybe oh my goodness and it's
gonna be as you mentioned a pretty low

01:16:15.089 --> 01:16:15.099
gonna be as you mentioned a pretty low
 

01:16:15.099 --> 01:16:17.729
gonna be as you mentioned a pretty low
yeah yeah but but it's still a distinct

01:16:17.729 --> 01:16:17.739
yeah yeah but but it's still a distinct
 

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:20.220
yeah yeah but but it's still a distinct
flavor or know it's interesting putts so

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:20.230
flavor or know it's interesting putts so
 

01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:21.899
flavor or know it's interesting putts so
I had three bottles already in tasting

01:16:21.899 --> 01:16:21.909
I had three bottles already in tasting
 

01:16:21.909 --> 01:16:23.310
I had three bottles already in tasting
and all three bottles tasted slightly

01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:23.320
and all three bottles tasted slightly
 

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.169
and all three bottles tasted slightly
different and that makes sense because

01:16:25.169 --> 01:16:25.179
different and that makes sense because
 

01:16:25.179 --> 01:16:26.819
different and that makes sense because
it's a mother it's a product of nature

01:16:26.819 --> 01:16:26.829
it's a mother it's a product of nature
 

01:16:26.829 --> 01:16:29.669
it's a mother it's a product of nature
again and all these icebergs they're

01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679
again and all these icebergs they're
 

01:16:29.679 --> 01:16:31.439
again and all these icebergs they're
floating into the sea so obviously all

01:16:31.439 --> 01:16:31.449
floating into the sea so obviously all
 

01:16:31.449 --> 01:16:33.750
floating into the sea so obviously all
these icebergs have a slightly different

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760
these icebergs have a slightly different
 

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.819
