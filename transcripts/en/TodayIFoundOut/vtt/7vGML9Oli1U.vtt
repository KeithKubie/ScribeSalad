00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.400
1) The Dissolving Tooth: There are numerous
urban legends involving Coca Cola. In fact,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.029
there are so many that these legends all now
have their own category known as “Colklore”.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.310
The most popular is that if you were to leave
a tooth in a cup of Coke overnight, by morning

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.150
the tooth would be completely dissolved. Like
most of the other legends involving the popular

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.739
drink this is totally untrue.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.980
2) Walt Disney is Cryogenically Frozen: This
is another one of those popular stories that

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.500
most of us have probably heard. It says that
Disney supposedly had his dead body frozen

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.570
in hopes that future technology could bring
him back to life. Unfortunately for all the

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.350
gossip magazines though, records show that
Disney was cremated in 1966.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.969
3) Sewer Gaters: This story tells the tale
of how several alligators were brought up

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.269
from Florida to be kept as pets in New York
City. After they got too big and violent they

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.590
escaped into the sewers where they now live
freely. Dating back to the 1930s and spread

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.119
by sensationalist newspapers the story is
completely untrue yet continues to be circulated

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.119
to this day.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.740
4) Mr. Rogers was a Navy SEAL: According to
this legend Mr. Rogers, the popular children’s

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.750
show host was once a Navy SEAL sniper in Vietnam
responsible for numerous deaths. It goes on

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.869
to say that the reason he always wears a sweater,
to cover up all of his tattoos. As you may

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.320
have guessed, Mr. Rogers was never a Navy
SEAL and he had no tattoos. In fact, he was

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.070
never even in the military, was a pacifist,
and an ordained Presbyterian minister.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.360
5) The Kidney Heist: Immortalized on TV and
the internet, this legend dates back to 1997

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.290
when an email was circulated warning people
of a crazy new crime wave catching on in big

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.630
cities. It usually involves a traveling business
man being bought drinks by a stranger only

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.329
to wake up in a tub covered in ice with a
phone next to him telling him to call 911.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.989
Covered in blood, he later learns that his
kidney has been removed by criminals who intend

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.550
to sell it on the black market. Although the
story almost sounds feasible with all the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.730
craziness you see on the nightly news, even
after the National Kidney Foundation asked

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.060
victims to contact them, no one has come forward
nor is there any documented instance of this

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.060
occurring.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.940
6) The Jedi Religion Form: This far reaching
hoax claims that if enough people fill out

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.560
“Jedi” as their religion on their census
forms, the U.S. government will have to make

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.170
it an official religion. At one point thousands
of people tried to do just that but to no

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.750
avail. Just because a large number of people
check something on a census form is not grounds

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.250
for introducing it as “official” anything.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.800
911-tourist-guy7) The 9/11 Tourist Guy: Shortly
after 9/11, a photo began to circulate showing

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.950
a tourist standing atop one of the World Trade
Centers with one of the airplanes in the background

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.849
of the shot about to strike the tower. The
accompanying story explained how the camera

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.459
was found in the wreckage but the tourist
remained missing. Aside from all of the very

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.129
inconsistent details in the picture, the story
already seemed completely improbable and several

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.650
people came forward claiming to be the prankster
responsible. It wasn’t until recently, however,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.569
that the real culprit was discovered in Hungary.
He has since apologized to the families for

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.170
making light of their situation.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.190
8) Poisonous Daddy Long Legs: There has been
a persistent rumor circulating for some time

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.069
that the daddy long legs spider is the most
poisonous in the world but cannot kill humans

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.230
because its fangs are too small. Where this
rumor started no one knows but one thing is

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.440
for sure, the daddy long legs is certainly
not the most poisonous spider in the world.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.349
If you’re going to be careful around spiders
we would advise keeping your eyes open for

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.939
the brown recluse or the funnel web spider.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:05.980
9) USA, Japan: Yes, there is a town in Japan
called Usa. No, the Japanese did not rename

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.030
it after World War II so that they could legitimately
stamp their exports with the phrase “Made

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.780
in USA”. The town itself was named after
the Usa Shrine, built in 725.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.290
10) Kennedy and the Jelly Doughnut: The legend
goes that Kennedy made a trip to Germany back

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.740
in the 60′s in an attempt to connect with
the German people. While giving a speech in

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.979
the capital he told the crowd, “Ich bin
ein Berliner” or “I am a Berliner”.

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.120
Apparently though, a “Berliner” is also
a type of German pastry. Since then numerous

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.840
stories have circulated claiming that he was
practically laughed off stage afterwards.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.750
The truth is, however, that that the crowd
understood him perfectly and nary a single

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.360
eyebrow was raised at the statement. You can
read more on why he said this statement completely

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.530
correctly here: John F. Kennedy’s Statement
“Ich Bin Ein Berliner” was Not Interpreted

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.870
as “I am a Jelly-Filled Doughnut”

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.940
11) The Good Samaritan: Circulating for years
this legend tells the story of a motorist

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.850
who stops on the side of the road to help
someone fix their flat tire. The person being

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.979
helped then asks the motorist for his address
to send a reward. Several weeks later the

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.870
motorist receives $10,000 in the mail. Over
the years this story has been attributed to

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.070
several celebrities, most recently Donald
Trump.
