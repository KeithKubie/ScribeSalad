GENE GURKOFF: I started
running in marathons

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.140
to raise money for
Parkinson's research,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.540
in honor of my grandfather.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.873
I always had this idea that
if I could get enough people

00:00:10.873 --> 00:00:12.500
together, then
collectively we would

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.830
have the clout of a
celebrity, and then companies

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.270
would want to sponsor us.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.410
Being on the Android platform
has enabled us to reach people

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.400
all over the world.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.010
They can help raise money
for our charity partners,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.220
and it's helped make our
movement a global one.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.540
IAN HAWKINS: It's really
cool to take your hobby

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.150
and put it into
your full-time job.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.130
Torque is an Android
app that allows

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.350
you to see all the
sensors on your vehicle

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.100
and to look at fault codes.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.880
From the way it's happened
in the Google Play Store,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.154
I've touched over a million
people with the app.

00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:43.820
The community's dragged
me along with it

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.210
and told me what they want.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.700
I've done that for them.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.660
I'm very grateful
for where I am now,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.060
and it's staggering
to see that something

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.390
I've written from
my garden shed is

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.827
liked by that many
people across the planet.

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.210
VICTORIA TROFIMOVA: We started
right after university.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.700
It was myself, my
husband, and his brother.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.000
Making games was
our childhood dream,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.840
and this is what
we wanted to do.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.580
Since we released "Cooking
Fever" on Android,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.640
it totally clicked.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.170
We realized that this
is the way to go,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.390
and this is the
platform of the future.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.180
We had millions of downloads
in the first moments.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.140
When we started, it
was just three of us.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.500
And now we're a company
of over 100 people,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.280
making games that we
decide we want to make.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.910
This has been a very
successful dream.
