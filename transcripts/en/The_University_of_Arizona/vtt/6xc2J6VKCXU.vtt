00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:13.581
How many years

00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:14.631
Have you been doing this?

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:15.290
Ten years.

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:17.352
The whole thing has been

00:00:17.352 --> 00:00:19.142
just incredibly gratifying.

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:24.632
Some time ago I said

00:00:24.632 --> 00:00:26.322
you know we give these scholarships

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:28.321
but I want to meet the students.

00:00:29.512 --> 00:00:30.611
The Brown scholarship

00:00:30.611 --> 00:00:32.464
has just been so impactful in

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:34.443
my education and overall

00:00:34.443 --> 00:00:35.493
in my life.

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:38.030
I think that me,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.202
as well as other students

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:40.962
with financial insecurity,

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:43.122
even little things like textbooks can be

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.661
make or break for students

00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:45.850
being able to be successful

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.901
in their classes.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.551
I'm a physiology major and

00:00:50.013 --> 00:00:52.300
minoring in Health and Human values

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.768
which is an honors college minor.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.891
And I hope to go to Medical School.

00:00:56.672 --> 00:00:58.282
After graduation I hope to

00:00:58.282 --> 00:00:59.614
pursue law school.

00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:01.372
This is a wonderful

00:01:01.372 --> 00:01:03.281
connection so that they get

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:05.731
to meet you and know what you

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:08.542
want to do and make the world

00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:09.452
a better place.

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:10.491
That's what its all about.

00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:11.320
Certainly.

00:01:12.702 --> 00:01:14.192
And the nicest things are the notes

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.852
that we get from some

00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:17.693
of these students who we have

00:01:17.693 --> 00:01:18.623
given scholarships to.

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:19.924
They will keep us up to date on

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:20.733
what they are doing.

00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:21.652
They may travel out of the country

00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:23.674
Arch will get notes and emails

00:01:23.674 --> 00:01:24.992
from so-and-so

00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:25.973
who is in some distant land

00:01:25.973 --> 00:01:28.164
and it's very very gratifying.

00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:30.041
So it's sort of like the gift that

00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:31.192
keeps on giving.

00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:31.772
Absolutely.

00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:33.551
You pay it forward as they say.

00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:36.091
I remember one year, a woman

00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:38.503
came up to Arch and me and said

00:01:38.503 --> 00:01:40.193
you know my daughter has been

00:01:40.193 --> 00:01:41.822
awarded a scholarship from your

00:01:41.822 --> 00:01:43.621
endowment fund. When I am able,

00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:45.173
I am going to do the same thing

00:01:45.174 --> 00:01:46.753
for other students at the U of A.

00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:49.082
Just the idea of our joy of giving

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.583
being passed on to someone else,

00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:52.592
through our actions, to me

00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:53.894
says the whole story.

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:58.641
One thing that I would suggest

00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:00.592
to anyone considering it is

00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:01.772
just do it!

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:04.131
We are very very appreciative

00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:05.972
of what you do for the University

00:02:05.972 --> 00:02:08.301
and I can't think of a better

00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:10.301
return on investment than

00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:11.672
investing in our students.

00:02:11.672 --> 00:02:12.600
Thank you so much

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.430
for that, its been really

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.899
impactful. I would just like to

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:15.640
say thank you again.
