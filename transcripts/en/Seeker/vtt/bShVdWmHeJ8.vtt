00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.660
Every 26 months, Mars and Earth are at their
closest distance,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.080
which is about 57 million kilometers apart.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.480
During this time, if an unmanned NASA spacecraft
were to leave Earth, traveling at 58,000 kilometers

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.589
per hour, it would take a little over 40 days
to get to the Red Planet.

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.580
Not bad, right?

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.380
Well, a quick trip would only be possible
if the spacecraft followed a direct path,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.309
undisturbed by the wrath of the solar system
and weight of life sustaining resources.

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.399
Unfortunately, space travel is far more complicated
than a straight line.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.800
So ideally, how long does it take to get to
Mars?

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.920
The solar system is constantly shifting, and
the orbital mechanics behind each of the planets

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.350
makes space travel really complex.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.230
Because Earth and Mars have elliptical orbits,
the distance between them varies considerably,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.329
and in order to send a spacecraft to Mars,
the planets have to line up just right.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.750
It takes Earth one year to orbit the Sun,
while it takes Mars about 1.9 years.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.120
So, every time Mars completes a single orbit,
Earth goes around the sun almost twice.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.820
Historically, for NASA, the best launch window
to Mars occurs

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.300
every 2 years and 2 months or 26 months.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.700
During this time, a spacecraft can utilize
what is considered the most energy efficient

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.740
path to Mars known as the Hohmann Transfer orbit.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.420
On this trajectory, the spacecraft follows an elliptical
orbit around the Sun

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.060
that intersects the orbit of Mars.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.860
It uses fuel to increase speed and velocity
to break free of Earth's gravity field.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.120
And the spacecraft uses more fuel to decelerate
in order to be captured into the Martian orbit.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.900
Then, it can ride Mars's orbital wave until
it's ready to touch down on the surface.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.100
While the Hohmann transfer is considered the
most efficient trajectory to get to Mars,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.880
the journey is still estimated to take roughly
260 days or eight to nine months with a manned

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.200
spacecraft powered by chemical propulsion,
so NASA and private companies are trying to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.690
develop more efficient propulsion systems
that can get humans to Mars faster than the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.140
chemical rockets used in the past.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.820
Specifically, a type of electric propulsion
system that propels a spacecraft by accelerating

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.470
a stream of electrically charged atoms, known as ions.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.440
And a nuclear thermal propulsion system that
uses low-enriched uranium as its power source.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.290
But even if we do engineer a faster way to
get to Mars, a round trip is still estimated

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.220
to take multiple months.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.540
And that means we also have to solve problems
of human health and resource requirements

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.160
during extended deep space missions.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.220
Clearly, time is just one of many obstacles
standing in the way of our Martian dreams.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.070
But still, NASA says it plans to send humans
to Mars in the 2030s.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.510
So do you think it's actually going to happen?
