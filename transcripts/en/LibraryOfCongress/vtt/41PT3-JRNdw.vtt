&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.613
&gt;&gt; Hi everybody, welcome to
the Mystery and Fiction Tent.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.706
My name is Maureen Corrigan
I'm a regular reviewer

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.620
for the Washington Post, and also
the book critic for NPR's Fresh Air.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.100
Thank you.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.500
[Applause] Thank you.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.046
The Washington Post has been
a sponsor of the book festival

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.120
since its inception 10 years ago.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.553
And all I can say is they promised
us it would be cooler today.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.286
[Laughter] And they lied.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.600
But your presence is a
testament to our collective love

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.370
and enthusiasm for good books.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.536
It's-- [Applause] Thank you.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.670


00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.323
It's my pleasure to introduce to
you today novelist Anchee Min.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.133
Anchee Min's books
explore the inner lives

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.670
of women whose work has
changed the perception

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.840
and in some cases the
history of modern China.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.583
I had the good fortune
to review Miss Min's book

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.086
"Becoming Madame Mao".

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.340
She's gone on to write books
about the last emperors

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.693
of China, book of the same name.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.476
And her latest book is
called "Pearl of China".

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.470
It's about the American writer
Pearl S. Buck who was born in China.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.486
So because it's hot,
without further ado,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.293
I will introduce to you Anchee Min.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.960
[ Applause ]

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.826
&gt;&gt; Thank you again, Maureen.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.693
I can't believe I am here.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.360
I'm alive, and I'm speaking English.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.740
&gt;&gt; So such a wonderful moment.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.003
It reminds me of the moment
that I landed in America 1984

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.810
of August 31st and I got
called at the custom.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.840
Because I didn't speak English
and-- they found out that, you know,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.513
I came here to study in college.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.206
I'm afraid to because,
you know, I went--

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.953
was accepted by the artist
of Chicago with my artworks

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.246
and they didn't know that I
didn't speak a word of English.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.506
And the custom, the officer
says, "So, welcome to America,"

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.560
and I gave my-- prepare the
answer say, "thank you".

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.470
[ Laughter ]

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.203
&gt;&gt; And he flipped my passport
and he start to say thing--

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.186
asked me something in my
ears I heard [inaudible].

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.723
And I say thank you.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.430
[ Laughter ]

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.760
&gt;&gt; After the third thank you,
he pointed at the back room.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.766
That's the deportation room.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.003
And I just broke down as I have
made it here as 27 years old

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.456
and came out of the labor camp.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.986
I know I don't deserve it
but please give me a chance

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.680
that I would learn English in 3
months if I don't, I deport myself.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.690
[ Laughter ]

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.690
[ Applause ]

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.956
&gt;&gt; So, I thank you America
for giving me a chance.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.023
I'm so glad of this.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.690
[ Applause ]

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.890
So, so much was given to me,
especially the American citizenship

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.796
and I feel that so
much is expected of me

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.450
and the best thing I could repay
the kindness of this country is

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.323
to provide what I know and I think
it's important for America to know

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.403
that the relationship
with America and China.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.796
And right now it so crucial to
our survival and understanding.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.706
So I started, I write Red Azalea was
my autobiography and that was easy

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.683
because it was about my life.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.083
And as a nobody, it's to
give you a little bit idea

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.430
about how our generation grow up
in China and the people like me

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.903
who rule China, especially
women that the unwanted.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.870
And today, we support half of
the sky [phonetic] in China.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.036
And then after Red
Azalea was Madame Mao.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.300
And this-- to make a long story--

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.833
story short, I got
picked up by Madame Mao

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.880
for her propaganda
film right after--

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.066
it was before Mao died in 1976.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.813
Madame Mao tries to
make it this public

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.373
in the film feature a
female praetorian image

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.973
and I was hoeing weeds
in the cotton field

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.533
in the labor camp East
China Sea and got picked.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.513
And I was brought to Shanghai
Film Studio to learn acting

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.843
to know I was a very lousy actress.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.880
But I was taught to write,
to drink water correctly the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.690
proletarian style.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.690
But then soon, before the film
was into production, Madame Mao--

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.150
Mao died and 2 months later
Madame Mao was arrested and put--

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.786
was sentenced to death and I was
considered a Madame Mao's trash.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.743
So, I stood no chance
in China and then for--

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.506
after 8 years of punishment,
I came to America.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.476
So, so between those 8
years I learned first hand,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.900
now I was on the stage when people
who was prosecuted by Madame Mao

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.193
in the jails they were
released to come

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.126
on to the stage tell the
story why they were punished

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.090
about Madame Mao and what they knew.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.290
So, I learned all these.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.890
I never dream that that would be
my first hand material to write

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.423
about Becoming Madame Mao.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.090
And after that was history
of the Qing Dynasty study

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:04.153
with Empress Orchid-- the
last empress of China.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.660
The woman who was a
girl from the poorest--

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.176
poorest village in China
Anhui became the ruler

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.216
of China for 50 years.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.553
And I feel that that to learn
about where China is going,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.980
we must to know where
China is coming from.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.276
So I was very pleased when
this book was nominated

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.076
for British book awards
reader's favorite pick.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.100
I get to sit with Harry
Potter's author J.K. Rowling

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.600
and I did not know
who J.K. Rowling was.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.463
And I was tossing this invitation in
the trash can and when my daughter,

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.636
she's here, be my co-presenter
and she says no,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.926
you are going to England.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.526
You're gonna get autograph for me.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.260
[ Laughter ]

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.260
[ Applause ]

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.993
&gt;&gt; So, J.K. Rowling
says, so you are here.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.896
I said, I am getting
autograph for my daughter.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:07.690
How old is she?

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.090
I said, 12 years old.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.090
I know how they like.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.823
So she wrote something very
special for me and I brought home--

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.023
I got the respect from my daughter.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.420
[ Laughter ]

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.820
&gt;&gt; And then Empress Orchid-- well,
I'm gonna talk about that later.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.953
I'm going to talk about
Pearl of China.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.460
The reason I wrote about this
because Chinese thought--

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.800
I realized that China start

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.383
to realize how nobody else gave
Chinese peasants a voice except it

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.126
is American author.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.463
The [inaudible] Chinese
still nobody taught her.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.723
But we did not know.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.373
I was ordered to denounce
Pearl Buck 1971.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.620
I was in Shanghai Middle
School, 14 years old.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.513
It was right before
Nixon's visit to China 1972.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.273
Madame Mao is giving this
campaign to convince the nation

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.060
that Pearl Buck was an
American culture imperialist,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
that she hates Chinese people.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.273
I wish that I was giving
a book the good to read

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.833
and so I know what I
was denouncing about.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.156
I was not given a chance.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:17.913
So, I asked a teacher
what I should do.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.913
The teacher says, "copy
the newspaper,"

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.396
so I copied the newspaper
and denounced her.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.743
And the next chance for me to
encounter the name Pearl S. Buck was

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.500
after I moved to America
and wrote Red Azalea.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.633
I was giving a talk at
the bookstore in Chicago.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.846
When the reader came up, she says,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.160
"Do you know the name
Pearl S. Buck?"

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.626
before I could explain
and this person says,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.093
"I just want to let you know
that Pearl S. Buck taught me

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.120
to love Chinese people,"
and I thought, "Really?"

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.456
And she says here is a
book, is my gift to you,

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.056
and that was The Good Earth.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.580
So, I finished the book on
the airplane from Chicago

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.523
to Los Angeles, I broke down.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.710
Because I never read anybody
including my favorite Chinese

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.883
authors who wrote about our
peasants the way Pearl Buck did,

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.283
with such admiration,
affection and humanity.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.766
So it was at that very moment
the idea the book Pearl

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.720
of China was born.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:34.840
I'm going to-- since at times
very present I'd asked my daughter

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.200
to read 30 second 1
minute paragraph from--

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.573
on the book, I intent
to talk about the story

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.486
about Pearl Buck's 40 years life
in China from the Chinese peasants.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.086
So it's a story about the whole
village town of Chin-kiang.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.323
Lauryann, please.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.690
[ Applause ]

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.690
&gt;&gt; Chapter one.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.823
Before I was Willow, I was Weed.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.350
My grandmother, NaiNai, insisted
that naming me Weed was better.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.480
She believed that the gods would
have a hard time making my life go

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.340
lower if I was already
at the bottom.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.656
Papa disagreed, "Men wants
marry flowers, not weeds."

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.120
They argued and finally settled
for Willow, which was considered

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.413
"gentle enough to weep
and tough enough

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.496
to be made into farming tools."

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:36.533
I always wondered what my mother
would have thought if she had lived.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.033
And now I'm going to read
you an excerpt from page 60.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.500


00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.750
Pearl and I walked
the outskirts of town

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.446
where someone was getting married.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.400
We joined the children who had
been invited to the wedding

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.293
to help inspire fertility.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.776
We were given nuts and seeds
to throw at the new couple.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.410
The groom was a young
peasant who was already drunk.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.016
He meant to thank the guests
but instead he threw up.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:12.010
The bride was dressed in a
bright red embroidered costume.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.943
Her face was covered
with a piece of silk.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:15.586
Pearl and I admired the costume

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:17.616
and the bride's glittering
hair ornament.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.556
When the band started the
wedding song, we joined in.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.610
Buddha sits on a lotus pad,
beautiful fingers orchid like.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.713
Sun goes down and moon comes up, may
your life be peaceful and tranquil.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.026
Mud walls and straw pillows, fruit
seeds and many sons, happiness

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.880
and longevity, may your life have
this bring and all its fair weather.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.380
Thank you.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.830
[ Applause ]

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.413
&gt;&gt; I choose-- I choose that
paragraph, that poem and the lyrics

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:53.866
of the opera, the peasant opera
because it's not picking uprising

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.156
for poor peasants and Lauryann
and I are gonna treat you

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.366
and entertain you at the end of my
presentation with that peasant opera

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.146
which is Pearl Buck's favorite.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.946
Then I went on and I went on
after Red Azalea and the books

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.876
and then also becoming Madame Mao.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.780
I was inspired that moment.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.346
You see, my grandmother had a
bound feet, so is Madame Mao.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.610
And Madame Mao is such
a character who--

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.093
who was early feminist who
tore up her foot binding cloth

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.246
to when you're too young
to marry Mao for 38 years

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.916
and become this monster,
the murderer for millions

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.326
of people during the
Cultural Revolution.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.193
And I was very interested in this,
this transformation of this woman.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.033
The moment I was really
inspired was that moment

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.556
when Madame Mao was putting from the
Chinese TV, when she was sentenced

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.550
to death and she shouted--
she says [foreign language].

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.580
I'm Mao's dog.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.380
Mao asks me to bite, I bit.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.986
She was so much in love with Mao
and she died willingly for love.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.573
Oh, I leave the rest to
you to read the book.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.796
Now, the next-- when was
this Empress Orchid Cixi.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.393
Again, see the Chinese women
are so [inaudible]-- so--

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:26.716
have such a strength
because of this, this--

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.970
being put like you have no way out
but being strong and save yourself.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.870
So this empress, who was one
of 3,000 women selected to go

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.366
to the forbidden city to be
the emperor's mating partner

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.660
but emperor never hardly get to
them and the woman between them 17,

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.700
18 years old fighting
and there's one woman

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.560
from the poorest village have the
best wits, had nothing to lose

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.036
and won the emperor's heart.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:03.206
And here I'm going to
read this paragraph

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.173
and how she bribed the Chief
Eunuch for her one night in bed

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:10.670
with the emperor and then what
pleases me the most and get

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.663
to play this evil character
Chief Eunuch Chief Shim

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.426
and Lauryann is gonna
play the Orchid.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.653
Could you please?

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.020
[ Pause ]

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.310
&gt;&gt; Lady Yehonala, you
needn't be so formal.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.406
As your slave, Shim does
not deserve such respect.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.166
I don't mean to criticize, but lady
Yehonala, you should be careful.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.136
You can get both of us in trouble.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.613
&gt;&gt; I am des-- sorry.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.840
I am desperate, Chief Shim.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.026
Please rise and have a seat.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.213
I have a humble gift for you.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.096
&gt;&gt; This is-- this is his
Majesty's engagement gift

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.786
to you, Lady Yehonala.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.853
It is an authenticated
piece, a pledge.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.946
If you don't know its
value, allow me to it.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.516
&gt;&gt; I am glad you recognized
its value.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:19.930
However, I would still
like you to have it.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.056
&gt;&gt; Why, Lady Yehonala?

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.590
Why?

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.123
&gt;&gt; I'd like to exchange
it for a favor.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:32.323
To tell you the truth, this
ruyi is the last thing I own.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.513
I want you to have it because I
understand the value of your help.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.046
&gt;&gt; Lady Yehonala, please.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.646
I cannot accept it.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.713
&gt;&gt; Rise, Chief Shim.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.380
&gt;&gt; I dare not!

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.380
&gt;&gt; I insist.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.780
&gt;&gt; But Lady Yehonala!

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.810
&gt;&gt; The ruyi will be more
valuable when I become the mother

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.750
of Emperor Hsien Feng's child.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.356
&gt;&gt; Yes, Lady Yehonala.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.316
&gt;&gt; Thank you for helping me.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.776
&gt;&gt; Which date, my lady,
would you like me

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.060
to schedule you with his majesty?

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.433
&gt;&gt; Does the date make a difference?

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.940
&gt;&gt; Big difference, my lady.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:16.216
You want to see his Majesty on
your most fertile days, don't you?

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.216
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.416
&gt;&gt; And the date is?

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.306
&gt;&gt; The fourteenth day
of the next full moon.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.193
&gt;&gt; Perfect, my lady.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.660
I will make the date, mark the
date in my book right away.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.246
If you don't hear from
me, we are set.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.193
You will be summoned

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.256
on the fourteenth day
of the next full moon.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.903
Until then, my lady.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.903
&gt;&gt; Wait. Chief Shim, please
bear with my questions.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:44.750
What if his Majesty wants to
see other ladies on that day?

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:50.790
How can you make him
want me instead?

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.790
&gt;&gt; Don't worry, my lady.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.040
I have a way to bend the
wind in the Forbidden City.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.376
&gt;&gt; And that is to say.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:02.166
&gt;&gt; And that is to say if Emperor
Hsien Feng expresses a desire

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.586
to see any other lady,
for example, Lady Li.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.453
I will say to him, "Your
Majesty, Lady Li is unclean."

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.193
&gt;&gt; What about Lady Mei?

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.060
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, your Majesty,
Lady Mei is unclean too.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.436
&gt;&gt; So, you have everyone have
their cycle except the one you want

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.863
to sleep with the Emperor?

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.530
&gt;&gt; Yes. I have succeeded many times.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.940
[ Laughter ]

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:36.940
[ Applause ]

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.720
Now, I'm gonna talk about-- a little
about how I-- I become an author.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.946
I was thrilled of course
with giving entrance to--

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.570
to America and spoke
no English and I tried

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.880
to survive and knowing nobody.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:06.883
So, I finally get the-- I started
learning English from Sesame Street

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.133
and public radio, and the
of course the library.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:15.150
And I learned to read the
classics-- classified ads.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.743
Since I didn't speak English and
I was really, really carefully

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:26.670
and one day I find a job, it was a
guinea pig for medical drug trials.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360
[ Laughter ]

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:30.470
&gt;&gt; And it says no, no
English skill necessary.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:37.450
I was thrilled, I went up there
and I say I'm here, I'm healthy,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.620
and I'm willing and I love-- I love
the opportunity, and they sure.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:48.183
They look at me and exam me and
they say now sign the contract.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.176
I say, I say, I don't read
it, I don't-- I just sign.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:56.343
They say, "No, you have to read and
you understand what you're signing."

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.083
And I lost a job.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.216
So, I-- but I was not discouraged.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:07.143
My second job was try to carry my
legs as far as my legs can carry me

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:14.850
to look for a Chinese waitressing
job in the-- in Chicago.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.733
So, I walked around on
Michigan Avenue and in downtown

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:25.323
but nobody wanted me and eventually
I got a job outside of Chicago

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.166
in Libertyville, a
Chinese restaurant.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.946
So, I was having three
jobs by now so I would--

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:42.143
would work from an afternoon 4
o'clock to 11 p.m., my waitressing.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.643
And the second job was
from after I got back,

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.046
well I guess starting 12
a.m. all the way to 3 p.m.--

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.826
3 a.m. I'm working on Chinese
brush painting women's underwear

00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.980
for 50 cents a piece.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.880
&gt;&gt; Oh, my time.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.680
Okay. So, my first-- and I
learned English, I was so happy

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.166
because that day I get to
communicate with the customer.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.233
I say, may I take your order.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.583
And he says, yes.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.560
I was thrilled.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.560
I love my boss although she--
she's like if I walk fast she--

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:21.420
she is behind me in the
Chinese restaurant she says,

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.426
the house is not on fire.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.360
So, I slow down with
6 plates, 6 trays--

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.566
the tray with 6 plates
and the boss says,

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.230
I didn't hire you to be a lazy bone.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:34.166
[Laughter] But I like
it because you see,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.560
she put every criticism
on the table.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:38.986
So you know what you are criticized
about and you can improve.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:42.426
In China I don't even get that.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:44.760
You've never know what
you did wrong.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:46.426
I didn't know what I did wrong.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.916
I just had this proletarian face,
all of a sudden became a trash.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.536
So I was-- enjoy life.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.843
And after that I was giving--
I wanted to promote myself.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.396
From waitressing I wanted-- my
dream was to be a secretary,

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.870
so I can get on the
phone speaking English.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.573
And my moment of fame would be,
"Hello, how can I help you?"

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.216
So-- and they told me that
I need to learn typing.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.350
So, I cannot afford
typewriter so I went

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.053
to the [inaudible] shoes next
door and I asked for an empty box

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.313
and I took the box and it
had-- went to the school,

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.873
had the school secretary mark the
letters, which finger goes to reach

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.560
and I practiced typing on my way
from Chicago Unistation [phonetic]

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.113
on the train to Libertyville.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:44.366
And then 2 months later, I went for
the typing test, ready, set, go.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.740
I scored negative 13.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:51.890
[ Laughter ]

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.556
&gt;&gt; So I didn't get there.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.106
But then I start to writing.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.963
I think I need to improve
my English in order to get--

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.740
be a secretary, and I
didn't have the money

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.486
so I was just waiting
at the elevator.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:09.763
When people goes up
I say, which floor?

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.076
If they say second
floor, I don't follow.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.143
If the person says, tenth
floor, eight floor I follow.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:16.710
And I say-- follow in
and say, can you tell me

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.643
if this is have been or
has been or had been?

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.303
So that's the manuscript
of Red Azalea.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:25.920
And my teacher at the school tell
me says, "You're such a lousy writer

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.800
but you have wonderful material."

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:32.773
So, that's how I started and
then I asked the teacher,

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.073
so can you recommend me a book
that's a wonderful author.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:39.490
And he recommend me his own book.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.290
[ Laughter ]

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.090
&gt;&gt; And I have to thank him.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:45.690
If he gave me Virginia Woolf's book,

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.956
I probably never would
have had the guts.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.693
So, to conclude my presentation,

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.203
I like to play a 3-minute
peasant opera

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.536
because this is Pearl
Buck's favorite.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.176
This is how I feel.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.406
Pearl Buck did not get to China
because Madame Mao rejected her visa

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.280
to China to accompany
President Nixon

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:12.846
and she would have been
standing in between Mao

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.953
and Nixon being the
picture of history.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.873
But Madame Mao wants that
spotlight for herself.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.860
And I learned from
Pearl Buck's daughter

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.560
that few days before her death,
she stood in her China window

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.616
at her home in Pennsylvania.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.683
She had this window that outside
it's like the Chinese view.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:36.340
And I know that myself,
you know, I--

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:38.793
Pearl Buck was living in China for
40 years, America for 40 years.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.096
And I was in China fro 27
years, here in 27 years.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:49.023
I understand that when you--
in a way, you know, uprooted

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.350
and that your roots, I think
we'll know Pearl Buck said

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.860
so many times my root
in China must die.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.173
It means so hard and I went to--

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:06.476
when I read the last paragraph on
Pearl Buck, Pearl of China, I--

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.793
because that was my
character, Willow's experience.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.640
I purposely left it undone
and to have visit the grave.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:13.443
When I saw Pearl Buck's
grave I just fall,

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.423
fall apart because on her
gravestone there was nothing

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.703
but sight into her Chinese name.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.480
So China was on her last thought.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:24.346
And her daughter says, few
days before she-- her death--

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.593
she lying on the window and looking

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.150
out in her bright red chinese
embroidered flower [inaudible].

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.280
So I feel that she didn't--

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.436
she missed China so much and
didn't get to enjoy that here.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:44.550
Me and my daughter come, come
to her home and bring the sound

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.463
of her childhood to her spirits.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:54.436
So that's why I'm standing to
you today and I want you to know

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.516
that the Chinese poor
people love the opera.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:57.960
This is what my grandmother told me.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.960
That because in the opera, we get
to escape the life we were living

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.980
and only through singing the opera
we get to be the hero and hero in--

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.046
and the only thing that bothers
me is that I personally have been

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:19.063
out of practice for so long
although it's in my blood.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:23.436
And my daughter, she is American
born and hardly try to get

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:24.640
into her Chinese and
she is into, you know,

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.326
American teenagers, American born.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.420
And now you-- she grow
up with this--

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.873
the iPod, you can never
communicate with her.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:36.506
And you know they--
you-- they don't--

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.733
yo, yo, yo, like that, right?

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.206
How do you do that?

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.206
How do you do that?

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.473
Get out up and do that.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:47.610
[Laughter] So I can't-- you
imagine, you know, it's so hard to--

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.603
you try to take the
Coca-Cola soda and the candy

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.266
out of American children.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.160
But anyway, I told her, I say,
you're gonna come here to perform

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:03.633
and you're gonna deliver
quality performance.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.246
[Laughter] And she say, what
last thing she wanted to do

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:08.923
to be an author because
it's so difficult.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.090
She will come and check me.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:13.623
I'm a [inaudible] when I'm writing.

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:16.233
In my isolation, she found that
2 weeks before I was writing

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.880
on this paragraph, 3 weeks
later on the same paragraph.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.766
She decided it was so
terrible that she takes--

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:28.403
she made herself to Stanford.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.883
This year she is a
freshman in Stanford and--

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:33.470

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.830
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:41.163
And study-- study medicine 'cause
I told her, you're gonna help me

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.206
to pay back to this country.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:44.740

[ Laughter ]

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:48.673
&gt;&gt; So she's excited to be a doctor.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.740
Come here, come here.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:52.673
Oh, she corrects me
all the time, English.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.080
You can tell your history
about-- I said don't hear me.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.533
My bone's already what?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
&gt;&gt; Brittle.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.686
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I say my bone is-- my bone
is already brutal, don't hit me.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.980
She said, brittle.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.780
[ Laughter ]

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.513
&gt;&gt; Anyway, I think her voice
is not good enough for the--

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.226
to present you the opera.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.086
However, I thought, what the heck.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.503
The American audience
wouldn't know the difference.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.600
&gt;&gt; So this piece, it's
called happily going home.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:26.323
It's about peasants, about
having fun building their--

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.783
their good life just being
and doing the peasant work.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.843
For example, this is like
a cultivate plant seed

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.493
and this is soil, and
this is they carry manure.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:43.983
So we're gonna do that.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.516
It's called happily going home.
