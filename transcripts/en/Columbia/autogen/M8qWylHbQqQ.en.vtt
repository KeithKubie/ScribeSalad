00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.140
Joshua Jordan: The Fabrication Lab at Columbia
architecture has been around since the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.210
1970s when it started as an entirely
student democratic experiment. So over

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.880
time we've come together and it's
something that is both sort of run in

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.810
the sense that students staff and work
in this space and keep it running along

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.100
with me in that we have a sort of an
overall sense and conversation among the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.180
faculty and the students about what this
place should be and what machines we should have

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.100
One of the big changes that
I've made here at this school is to kind

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.350
of rethink making at this school and
expand our fabrication lab to really

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.760
become a makerspace. This is a very
interesting moment where students and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.499
faculty are hybridizing what we call the
analog and the digital so it's not just

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:06.230
about fetishizing the digital and being
cutting-edge and having million-dollar

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.210
robots and doing research but really
bringing together old ways of thinking -

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.500
making and casting and and and using
wood and with the highest technology of

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.600
3D printing and and milling and so
there's a lot of kind of originality

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.520
that's coming out of that hybridizing.
The first day of classes I was really

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.009
interested in building a set of shelves
for our apartment and I think that

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.659
dialogue really got me feeling invested
in the space knowing that it was a place

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.619
that was open to anybody to pursue
creative projects whether it was related

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.350
to a studio or their classes and I think
what I loved so much about how the shop

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.969
has been evolving over the past couple
of years is that it's really been open

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.469
to embracing people's interests whenever
someone has a project that we don't have

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:03.560
a tool for will order the tool... it's been
expanding a lot from just being a general woodshop.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.620
One of the things that
we've tried to do here in the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.369
fabrication lab is be as
interdisciplinary as possible. We have at

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.620
least five different programs working
within the Graduate School here and one

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.920
of our big missions and sort of reboot
of the shop is to find a way for them

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.630
all to get as much mileage and sort of
innovation out of the space as possible.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.000
On the operational end what we've done
is reconfigure our sort of training and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.440
access technique to be as agnostic as
possible to levels of experience that

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.900
people have coming in. So we make our
training as teachable to historic

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.400
preservation as we do to urban design as
we do to architecture so everybody

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.270
learns the sort of same concepts in the
beginning and then they can sort of

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.500
perform together and materials in the
shop to the same level and then when

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.650
people see what each other are working
on that is not necessarily something

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.500
that they might normally work on there's
an instant conversation that just

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.900
proliferate and explodes as a student
you have all these resources especially

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.970
for the last two years I Josh really
makes this place very very reachable like

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.670
accessible to students and you can come
here like 24/7 and you can build

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.600
whatever you want here just with your
materials so they really make the like

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.280
prices super cheap, like if you want to
depend as where you need to spend a lot

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.200
more money. when we think of a more
creative and sustainable world for the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.740
future you know it's important that we
think where the materials come from and

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.720
how do we hybridize them and how we
think of reusing waste in original ways

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.610
and so it's much more than just kind of
fabrication is thinking through the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.700
lifecycle of materials and that really
starts in the makerspace
