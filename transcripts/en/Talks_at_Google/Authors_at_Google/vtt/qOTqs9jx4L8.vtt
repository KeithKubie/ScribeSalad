00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.040
ARUN VENKATARAMAN:
It is my pleasure

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.590
to have here with us today
Ravi Agrawal to discuss

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.960
his new book "India Connected--

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.140
How the Smartphone Revolution
is Transforming the World's

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.970
Largest Democracy."

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.520
Mr. Agrawal is currently
the managing editor

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.470
of "Foreign Policy" magazine.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.630
Before that, he spent more
than a decade with CNN,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.360
where he worked in New
York, London, and most

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.690
recently in New Delhi, where he
was the region's bureau chief.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.020
The book has received quite
a bit of praise already.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.420
Fareed Zakaria calls it
quite simply the best

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.160
book about India today.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.250
Nicholas Thompson, the editor
in chief of "Wired" magazine,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.890
says the story of
how India got wired

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.020
is one of the most important
in the world today,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.780
and you won't find a better
guide than Ravi Agrawal.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.390
That conversation couldn't
be more important for us

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.222
here at Google to
embrace robustly,

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:54.680
just given the fact
that we are one

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.350
of the key drivers of the
smartphone revolution.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.280
80% of the smartphones in
India are Android smartphones.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.879
So I don't think we can
be thoughtful enough

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.030
about ensuring that our
products and technologies

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.720
not only help build a more
technologically enabled India

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.010
but a better India.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.400
And to unpack, distill,
discuss that even further,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.414
I'll bring Ravi up on the stage.

00:01:19.414 --> 00:01:23.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.450
I want to start off with
the smartphone revolution.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.600
You talk about how, in
2000, 20 million Indians

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.400
were connected to the internet.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.450
In 2017, that number
was 465 million.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.100
And you projected, in 2025,
that that number is going

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.600
to be more than a billion.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.730
And you talk about the
ways in which that's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.490
similar to the advent
of the automobile

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.760
and the transformational impact
that it had here in the United

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.640
States from the
creation of suburbia,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.850
the interstate highway, to
where, very often, someone

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.150
got their first kiss,
long weekends, all sorts

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.190
of tremendous impacts.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.940
And you talk about how the
smartphone is doing the same

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.199
in India, which makes it
not simply an evolution,

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.030
as it's been here in the United
States, but a revolution.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.230
So I would love for you to
talk about how India got here

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.480
to this moment, where
is it right now,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.722
and where do you anticipate it's
going to be 10 years from now

00:02:20.722 --> 00:02:22.430
as a result of the
smartphone revolution.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.390
RAVI AGRAWAL: Sure.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.390
That's a great question.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.590
Thank you for having me.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.920
Thank you, all of
you, for attending.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.020
And really, it's very special
for me to come speak at Google.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.550
And as Arun said, Google's
playing such a huge role

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.210
in the growth of the internet
in India and, in fact,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.030
expanding the pie of
internet users in India.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.120
So to begin with,
your first point

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.200
about how India is going
through a smartphone revolution,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.870
the reason why I use the word
"revolution" in the book,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.870
and I don't use it
lightly, is to contrast it

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.750
with the way in
which the West has--

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.860
people in the West have
discovered the internet.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.430
So for most of you in
this room, my assumption

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.190
would be that sometime
in the late 1990s,

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.000
you had a PC and a
telephone landline,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.280
and then you got a dial-up
internet connection,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.470
and then evolved from there
to DSL, then cable, broadband,

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.170
and then you got your
routers, you had Wi-Fi.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.260
And then, eventually, you had
3G on a phone, 4G and a phone,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.410
and you are where you are today.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.100
In India, a very small slice
of Indians who are rich,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.030
privileged usually
urban, often male,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.740
had access to those things.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.370
Only 2% of Indians had
access to telephone landlines

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.750
in the year 2000.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.630
A similar percentage of
Indians had access to PCs.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.750
And that's why there were
only 20 million Indians

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.820
online in the year 2000.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.220
And the numbers then begin
to jump very rapidly.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.250
In 2010, there are hundreds
million Indians online.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.360
By 2015, there were 300
million Indians online.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.030
And now, we're crossing
half a billion,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.230
the projections are that it
will reach 800 million by 2025,

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.810
and then a billion
shortly thereafter.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.050
All of this growth is going
to come from smartphones.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.560
Why?

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.170
Because smartphones in
India are very cheap.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.030
They are easily accessible.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.140
They are, for most Indians,
not just a smartphone

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.790
as it is for you guys here.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.060
For most Indians, the smartphone
is their first camera.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.860
It is their first screen.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.320
It is also their first
Walkman and MP3 player.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.050
It is the first of many
things in one device.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.400
And that's why it's as
transformative as it is.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.710
For most Indians,
this is a gateway

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.100
to many forms of technology,
all of it in one go.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.490
You could be
illiterate in India,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.100
and you can still
speak to your phone.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.350
You know, the old
internet was mostly

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.670
for English speakers in India.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.130
The new internet
is for people who

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.340
speak a multitude
of Indian languages.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.800
And thanks to Google,
in part, those languages

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.850
are all now accessible
on the internet.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.160
There's a great analogy with
the car, which you brought up.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.900
And I like to compare
the moment that India

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.670
is going through right
now to the moment

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.920
that America went
through a century ago.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.310
So America invented the car.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.450
And with the car, you
created roads, and highways,

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.320
and the interstate system.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.790
And then with that, tens of
thousands of jobs were created.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.970
And America built suburbia
and the picket fence home.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.640
And with that, you
had the commute.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.260
And along the
commute, you needed

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.690
to create an infrastructure
so that infrastructure

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.350
was gas stations, and
multiplexes, and movie

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.940
theaters, and the drive-in
restaurant, and so much more--

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.300
than 7 Elevens.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.900
Think of all of those things
as a national infrastructure

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.240
across the country.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.240
And it wasn't just that.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.170
There was a cultural and
imaginative infrastructure

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.780
as well.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.490
I mean, for most
Americans, the car was

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.530
their first private property.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.390
It was literally a
tool of mobility.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.820
It was the vehicle in which
they injected their dreams

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.090
and their ambitions for
the baby boomer generation.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.620
In Hollywood, it was enshrined.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.460
I mean, think of the race, and
the chase, and the bank heist.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.220
Every Hollywood movie
of a certain era

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.080
was defined around the car.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.060
The car defined Americans.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.350
I mean, if you drove a
pickup truck, or a sedan,

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.350
or a hatchback, it kind
of explained who you were

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.240
and where you were headed.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.320
Take all of those things and
transpose it to India today.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.810
The smartphone
defines who you are.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.700
Are you an iPhone person?

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.630
And therefore, do you have
$1,200 to spend on a phone?

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.860
Likely not in India.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.870
Because, as we
know, Apple hasn't

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.080
been able to make serious
inroads into India.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.510
But the phone says a lot
more about who you are.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.910
And by the same
token, the phone is

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.900
creating an entire
infrastructure of payments,

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.070
of communication.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.870
It's building trust with
maps, with education,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.550
with various tools
that people are using.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.980
For all of those
reasons, for a country

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.380
that is as young as
India is, average age

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:21.160
27, average income less
than $2,000 a year.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.270
You take all of those things
together for a country that's

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.500
marching and on the rise,
and the thesis of my book

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.470
is that this one
device, this one tool,

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.162
will end up being incredibly
transformative for the country.

00:07:36.162 --> 00:07:37.620
ARUN VENKATARAMAN:
And I think, one

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.570
of those stories that
you start the book off

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.120
that really illustrates
that compellingly

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.170
is the story of Phoolwati,
who is a Google saathi,

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.600
and you can explain what it is.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.290
I have to admit.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.020
I fell a little bit in love with
Phoolwati reading about her.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.960
She's like, on her bicycle
going around rural Rajasthan

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.760
introducing the internet
for the first time

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.590
to women in these villages.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.340
I would love for you to
talk about how you first

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.650
like found her,
her story, and then

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.500
what kind of broader
lessons we can

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.760
draw about her example and
the penetration of India,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.010
not only for women, but
for rural communities.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.510
RAVI AGRAWAL: Sure.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.280
It's so great to talk
about Phoolwati here

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.600
because I'm coming full circle.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.620
I found Phoolwati through
Google, not the search engine

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.750
but literally through
people at Google who said,

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.180
you must take a look
at Google saathi,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.090
and you must look into
this story, and so I did.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.010
For those of you who
don't know, Google saathi

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.419
is a program at
Google where Google's

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.450
partnered with many
NGOs across the country.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.200
And it is giving--

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.220
first of all, its training rural
women how to use the internet.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.300
And then, it's arming them
with smartphones, and tablets,

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.320
and a bicycle to then go
out into other villages

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.900
and teach and train
other women how

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.330
to use the internet, how
to familiarize themselves

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.350
with the internet.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.530
Why is this important?

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:07.630
Well, you might remember, when
I was starting off, I said,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:12.350
the old internet in India
was urban, elite, and male.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.850
It was also English.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:21.330
And the reason why I say "male"
is that even in 2014, about 70%

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.140
of internet users
in India were male.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.140
30% were women.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:30.300
In villages, only 1 out of
10 internet users were women.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.410
And so the big gap was
rural women and women more

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.090
nationally.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.480
Google, obviously-- and
you guys work on this--

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.720
realized that this was
a great market to tap--

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.410
and not just for
economic reasons,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.900
but also for
humanitarian reasons.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.470
And so the saathies,
what they've

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.010
been doing is, in a
sort of, peer to peer

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.270
conversational way, have been
able to train other rural women

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.970
to use the internet And the
reason why this is important

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.890
again is that illiteracy is
rife in these parts of India.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.240
In Rajasthan, the state
in which I met Phoolwati,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.840
female literacy rates
are at about 50%,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.070
which means there are all these
women who cannot read or write

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.420
anything at all.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.550
And so the internet,
for them, was always

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.520
going to be a thing that they
could never dream of using,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.090
not on a PC, not on a phone,
not on a regular phone.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.730
And vice technology
changed all of that.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.870
Phoolwati-- and I begin
the book with her speaking

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.830
to some other
villages, and she says,

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.350
ask this thing, Google,
ask it something.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.960
And most of them don't
know what to ask.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.910
And then one woman says,
well, show us the Taj Mahal.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.880
And a video pops up.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.810
She says it in Hindi.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.850
She says, [SPEAKING HINDI]

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.560
And a video pops up.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.930
And they press play.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.800
And for the first time, they see
moving imagery of this monument

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.980
that they have all grown
up as knowing as the most

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.550
beautiful thing in India.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.240
And it was a very profound,
moving moment for me

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.410
as well to see that.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:15.240
And it gives you a sense
of how technology really

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.920
can break through so
many of the boundaries

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.670
that we've built in India, not
just gender, but also cost,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.890
and geography, and
language, and literacy.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.160
And Phoolwati was, if you
read the book-- was just

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.110
a great example of a woman who
was completely interminable

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.050
in spirit and was
able to venture out

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.140
into all these villages
and very enthusiastically

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:49.450
be set of an internet
evangelist or Google evangelist.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.360
And she was paid only a
very small amount of money

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.510
to do this but was doing it
mostly because she was really

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.640
excited about the project.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.860
For those of you
who've been to India,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.184
it's quite rare to see women
on bicycles wearing a full sari

00:12:03.184 --> 00:12:04.600
and heading out
into the villages.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.280
And you know, the saathies
are doing just that,

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.450
which is a real testament
to their enthusiasm

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.290
for the internet.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.660
ARUN VENKATARAMAN:
Yeah, what was

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.480
interesting about her case
is you talked about the fact

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.660
that she had a husband that was
very supportive of what she was

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.130
doing, which enabled
her to be such

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.930
an enthusiastic
kind of ambassador

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.520
for the saathi program.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.470
There's a quote in the
book where you talk--

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.600
you brought up
caste, where you talk

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.850
about how Karl
Marx, in the 1850s,

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.920
thought that the railroad
was going to get rid

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.299
of the caste system in India.

00:12:35.299 --> 00:12:37.090
And there have been
all sorts of technology

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.464
since then that have been,
like, this is the vanguard of,

00:12:39.464 --> 00:12:42.640
like, pushing against
some of these more

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.430
ancient social or
cultural systems.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.040
And those obviously failed.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.760
But you feel more bullish
about the smartphone?

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.740
What's different
about the smartphone

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.690
that you feel is going
to break through some

00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.220
of these more older kind
of patriarchal systems?

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.720
RAVI AGRAWAL: So
I am more bullish.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.010
There are still obstacles.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.620
For example, there are
entire villages in India

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.930
where the smartphone
is banned for women.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.450
And I go to one of these
villages in Gujarat.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.940
And the men I
spoke to there said

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.940
that women just can't use this.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.120
They're not smart enough.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.130
They don't have-- they're
not capable of dealing

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:24.934
with the internet.

00:13:24.934 --> 00:13:26.350
And, really, what
they were trying

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.580
to tell me without saying it in
as many words is that they were

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.150
frightened of what it would
mean to give women access

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.440
to the internet.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.740
They were frightened of what
it meant to give women freedom.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.530
They had built around--

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.600
in fact, entire
societies were built

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:50.930
around patriarchal systems where
women had very little agency.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.560
And so in a sense, one
of the greatest obstacles

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.450
to allowing the internet
to reach all Indians

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.700
is men, and mostly rural men.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.090
But that said, I
think the reason

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.100
why I am more bullish
about the phone

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:12.920
than any other technology is
that the phone is a catalyst,

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.060
and it's coming
at a moment when--

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.510
so first of all, it is cheap.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.500
It is accessible.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.770
It is aspirational.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:26.270
But it's coming along with
a range of other forces.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.820
There's a confluence
of events at play.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.150
And those events
are globalization;

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:36.410
cheap technology; the
creation of smartphones, which

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.070
let's face it, are
unprecedentedly compact,

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.490
and powerful, and able to
take all of these things

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:48.030
into one device, all of these
other devices into one device;

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:54.530
but also rising levels in
India; the ability for bigger

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.560
Indian companies to
take big decisions,

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.050
set up big
infrastructural projects.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.970
You may have heard of
Reliance Jio, which

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.270
is a company that, for the
first six months of its launch,

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.950
essentially made
data free in India.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.830
So if you look at all of
those things together,

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.480
we're at a moment, fairly
unprecedented in India's

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.010
history, where the smartphone
is just perfectly poised

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.980
to reach so many
people and to give them

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.450
all these different
things in one

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.330
go that were not going
to happen organically.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.420
PCs were not going to
reach a majority of Indians

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.500
organically.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.110
Cameras were not going to
reach a majority of Indians

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.980
organically.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.650
But you put it into one device,
you put all of these things

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.040
into one device at a
very low price point.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.100
Jio, for example, leases out--

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.190
it's a very basic phone, but
it's kind of a smartphone,

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.930
for $23.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.520
It's a three-year lease for $23.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.380
You can buy certain Chinese
and Indian-made phones

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.536
for somewhere
between 50 and $150.

00:15:57.536 --> 00:15:58.910
And at that price
point, when you

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.475
include all of these
things, it's irresistible.

00:16:01.475 --> 00:16:04.670
ARUN VENKATARAMAN:
One of the gaps

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.680
that you talk about the
smartphone being able to bridge

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.780
is the urban-rural gap but also
kind of the linguistic gap.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.700
To your point earlier,
the mobile phone

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.260
has primarily been--

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.690
or the smartphone
and PC before that

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.780
was primarily-- targeted the
English-speaking audience,

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.130
and that started to change.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.213
I think one of the stories
that really illustrates

00:16:24.213 --> 00:16:28.040
that is the story of Abdul,
who started this education app.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.110
Tell us about that.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.530
RAVI AGRAWAL: Sure.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.320
So I have a chapter
on education.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.100
And one of the people I
profiled in that chapter,

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.380
his name is Abdul Wahid.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:43.250
And he's a real sort of
fixer-upper of a character--

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.200
didn't go to an English
school growing up,

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.390
so he never really
spoke English well.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.530
And in India, to
succeed, speaking English

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.510
is a huge leg up.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:57.110
And so he started
using an app called

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.640
Hello English, which is one of
India's top educational apps.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.720
And the way Hello English
works is, as long as you speak

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.210
some other Indian
language, say Hindi,

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.369
and you can read the
English alphabet,

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:14.150
you're able to then play
these games that teach you

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.359
or help you improve your
conversational English.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.670
So Abdul Wahid was playing
this game every day,

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.430
sitting on the toilet seat,
sitting in traffic jams,

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.319
and he got better, and
better, and better.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:28.770
And he was ranked number one out
of millions of users worldwide.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.450
And so I found him and
sort of profiled him.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.800
And his story was amazing
because he, essentially,

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.750
became a confident man
and a confident teacher.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.600
He runs a coaching
Institute in Rajasthan

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.570
through not only Hello English,
this app, because he couldn't

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:54.620
afford was Rosetta Stone or
going to a school, but he also,

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:59.570
through YouTube and watching
videos of motivational speakers

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.570
and stuff like that, he
just was able to become

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.700
a very confident educator.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.700
And that struck me as you
know the kind of thing

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.300
that it's hard to
quantify nationally.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.720
Like, there is no metric
to look at those kinds

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.390
of intangible improvements
in people's lives.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:22.910
But also in that chapter, I
also looked at learning outcomes

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:23.960
for four children.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.240
Because I think, if
you look at the biggest

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.730
space for disruption
in India, it really

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.800
is early childhood education.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.360
And the reason is that India
has opened a lot of schools,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.999
but these schools don't always
train people in the right way.

00:18:38.999 --> 00:18:40.540
And they're all of
these studies that

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.290
show that learning
outcomes for children

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.470
was greatly reduced
after the age of 7, 8,

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:50.350
which meant that the reason
why they were dropping off

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.982
in math and literacy is because,
frankly, they couldn't read.

00:18:53.982 --> 00:18:55.190
They couldn't read and write.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.700
And so they weren't able
to progress further.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.290
And there's a lot
of research now--

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.810
and there are many NGOs that
are working in this space,

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.320
but the phone has really
come through as a tool that

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.000
could allow people to
improve their basic numeracy

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.570
and literacy at the lowest
levels, which would really

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.192
work at a mass way
to India's advantage.

00:19:16.192 --> 00:19:18.400
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: I want
to kind of take a step back

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.250
and think about some
of the macro trends

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.820
that have enabled a
lot of the evolutions

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.970
that you discuss in
the book, it strikes me

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.400
with the analogy
of the automobile,

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.120
that it required a robust
partnership between the state

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.370
and private companies
to get that right,

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:40.180
and the state knowing when to
lean in and when to lean back.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.680
At the end of the
book, you actually

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.520
do a really good
job of framing up

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.550
that narrative in the context
of mobile phones in India.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.370
There's like an Indian
American businessman

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.610
who has a conversation with
Rajiv Gandhi to kind of really

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.800
pave the way to bring
telephones to India,

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.130
which was a luxury as
late as the early 1980s.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.020
I would love for you to
talk about that evolution,

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.360
particularly with
an eye towards what

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.520
is the right way that
kind of private forces

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.150
and public institutions can
work together to really take

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.967
advantage and bring to
fruition the potential

00:20:15.967 --> 00:20:17.050
of these new technologies.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.910
RAVI AGRAWAL: Sure.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:23.510
You know, the telephony
in India has mostly

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.400
been a private sector story.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.710
So the public sector
story was what

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:32.330
you were describing of
the '60s, '70s, early '80s

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:36.170
of the state trying to get basic
telephone landlines to people.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.890
And that was something that
the state largely failed at.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.040
And one innovation that
really worked for the state

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.320
was when they opened
what was known

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.250
as these STD, ISD, PCO booths.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.670
And these were basically
telephone booths,

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:57.170
but they were manned by
shopkeepers or 7-Eleven mom

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.090
and pop store owners.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.810
They're basically
at marketplaces.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.200
And you would go in.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:10.190
And you could pay for a metered
call, local or international

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.600
as the case would be.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.420
And that allowed many
people to get access

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.810
to telephony in a way that
they wouldn't have otherwise.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.450
But in terms of
mobile telephony,

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:27.660
when the state first began to
sort of open up in that sense,

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.690
there were still many,
many restrictions

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:30.770
for the private sector.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:37.130
And it was through
sheer force of will

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.780
in the form of
the private sector

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:44.090
that 3G and 4G finally took
off in India, basically

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.190
through advertising
and offerings

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.430
from the private sector that
allowed it to reach Indians

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.300
in a mass way.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.200
And then the second wave
was through hardware-- so

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.130
the handsets and cheaper
smartphones, all of which

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.800
are led by the private
sector in India.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.440
I think the space we're at now
is, the government has largely

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.450
ceded a lot of the space
to the private sector.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.220
But I think where the government
could be very important

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.590
and where the private
sector could work closely

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:19.310
with the government
on is regulation

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.830
in terms of how to
regulate this market,

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.290
how to regulate the
entrance of new players,

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:28.500
how to regulate foreign
players versus Indian players.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.820
But then, the second thing
that is very important to me

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.010
and is really a large
part of the book

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.950
as well is to sort
of deal with some

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:41.240
of the adverse effects of
the smartphone boom in India.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:47.180
And those range from addictions,
to fake news, to pornography.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.930
And we can get into some
more detail on those topics.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:58.220
But just to use the analogy
with the car once again,

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.190
governments around the
world and the private sector

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:05.480
partnered on cars
with advertising,

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.860
basically, in terms of telling
people that the car is clearly

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.860
a tool for immense
good, but it is also

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.430
a web of mass destruction.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.550
So you need to not
drink and drive.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.420
You need to wear seat
belts when you're driving.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.240
And those were public
interest campaigns

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.820
that were very important,
I think, for societies

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.700
around the world.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.630
And I've begun to see
smartphones as something

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:34.460
quite similar to the car in
that respect, where smartphones

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.010
and technology can
also be immensely

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.950
destructive to societies,
especially a society

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:44.210
like India, which is still
so nascent and gullible in so

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:49.310
many ways, with superstitions
in various communities.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.960
And the notion of being able
to see this device as something

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:58.520
that has immense potential for
good but also for bad and what

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.410
to do with that and how to deal
with that is very important.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:05.180
And I think that's a space that
public and private can really

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.010
cooperate on.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.218
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: Yeah, I
think that's a great segue

00:24:08.218 --> 00:24:11.590
into what I'd love for us
to unpack a little bit more.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.550
The first part of
the book is very

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.950
much about the opportunities
of the smartphone revolution

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.950
in education, health
care, and empowering women

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:19.980
all across the country.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.680
I think the second part is
when you talk about some

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.450
of the potentially
negative consequences.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:30.620
And you talk about the
story of Sheikh Halim

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.780
and the lynching
that took place that

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:38.012
was more or less driven by
communication messaging apps.

00:24:38.012 --> 00:24:39.470
Talk to me a little
bit about that.

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:43.700
And this is really me putting my
Google News initiative hat on.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.820
The evolution of misinformation,
[INAUDIBLE],, synthetic media

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.580
misinformation, how do
you see that playing out

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.250
in India and the role
and responsibility

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:58.520
that you feel platforms should
take in addressing that?

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.860
RAVI AGRAWAL: Sure,
so many of you

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.440
have heard the stories
of lynchings that

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.030
have taken place in India--

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:08.540
Hindu-Muslim related,
violence, mob violence.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:12.650
And much of this tends to
stem from the proliferation

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:17.240
of fake news on messaging apps,
specifically WhatsApp, which

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.750
is very popular in India,
but also other messaging

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:21.950
apps in India.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.710
I hesitate to put
the blame squarely

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.220
at the place of messaging
apps because it is not as

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.710
if rumors didn't spread before.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.680
It is not as if there were
not lynchings and mob violence

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.330
before technology.

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.580
Technology has just
allowed for the spread

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.160
of these things
faster and quicker

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.700
than was possible before.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:48.320
What often happens is
that people in India

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:52.310
are often not equipped in the
same way to decipher and deal

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.400
with fake news as people
may be in the West.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.250
And think of it this way.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.170
I mean, when you all first
started using the internet,

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:03.530
let's say in the late '90s,
you had a Hotmail account,

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.421
and you would get a chain mail.

00:26:05.421 --> 00:26:06.920
And the chain mail
would say, if you

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.800
don't forward this to 15 people,
you'll be unlucky in love.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.136
And you're laughing there.

00:26:11.136 --> 00:26:13.010
I mean, many of you have
probably hit forward

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.470
and sent it to 15 people until
a friend or two says, hey,

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:17.180
this is stupid.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.110
Don't do that.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.400
And then, you don't do that.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.910
But remember when I was talking
about the West's evolution

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.530
versus India's revolution?

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.530
So you all have evolved
with the internet,

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.330
and you've evolved
with your mistakes.

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.370
And you've learned not to
make those mistakes over time.

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.300
So you are now more
discerning consumers

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.130
of the internet
and of fake news.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:42.560
And you're better able to judge
what is true, what is false,

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.720
what smells right, what
to forward, what not to.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.600
That's sort of the case in
India because, again, hundreds

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.900
of millions of people are
discovering the internet right

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.880
now on smartphones.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.960
And they haven't built the
same nose for fake news.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:03.690
Add to the fact that they
are not as privileged,

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.450
they don't have the same
levels of education.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.190
They don't have the same levels
of media literacy necessarily.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.970
And various societies
in India were quite

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.140
superstitious to begin with.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.530
So you take all of those
things together with the power

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:22.370
of social media to amplify
in a viral fashion,

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:26.100
and you have a cocktail
that's quite dangerous.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.160
It's a huge challenge
for, I think,

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.980
tech companies to figure out
but also society to figure out

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.690
and the government
to figure out.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.300
And as I was saying
earlier, I think

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.150
media literacy
would be something

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:41.780
that I think tech companies, if
they can play a part in helping

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.660
communities understand
the basics of how

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.810
to decipher what is news?

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:48.830
Who's funding it?

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:50.000
What's the date line?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.550
Is it written by a human being?

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.040
Is it from a wire service?

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.740
What is it?

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.260
And then, also, just the
basic pitfalls of what

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.030
happens when you
forward something basic,

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.890
how this can be exponential--

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.734
how to trust, how to verify.

00:28:03.734 --> 00:28:04.650
That's very important.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:06.210
It's a conversation
that has just

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.830
begun to take place in India.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.430
But as a journalist,
I can tell you

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.530
with elections around
the corner in India,

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.600
this is an issue
of grave concern.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.220
A lot of things could go wrong
before Indian society figures

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.220
out how to get it right.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.140
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: Yeah,
and as you well know,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.370
it's supposed to be
quite the challenge

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:24.453
here in the United States.

00:28:24.453 --> 00:28:25.852
So I imagine it's even--

00:28:25.852 --> 00:28:27.060
RAVI AGRAWAL: It's even more.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.768
ARUN VENKATARAMAN:
Even greater in India.

00:28:28.768 --> 00:28:31.560
On the same vein of like some
of the potential pitfalls

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.682
of the smartphone
revolution, one

00:28:33.682 --> 00:28:35.640
of the parts of one of
the chapters that really

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.380
kind of shocked me was
entirely news to me,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.680
concerns just broadly a
conversation on sexuality

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.040
and how it shows
up online, but you

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.270
talk about the advent of
very violent pornography

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:56.310
and how that's become readily
accessible to hundreds

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:59.220
of millions of people in India.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.400
And you don't necessarily draw
a direct causal relationship

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.360
between that and
the horrific crimes

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.170
that we've seen in the
last few years in India,

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.300
but you do kind of
allude to the fact

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.730
that there is something
there that's worth exploring.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.820
Based off of
exploring that story,

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.120
do you feel like tech
platforms have a responsibility

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.695
to curb or curtail
that sort of content?

00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:25.320
RAVI AGRAWAL: This
is a tough question.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.890
Because the last
thing I would ever

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:33.570
want to advocate is curtailing
or censoring content.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:37.290
And yet pornography is
one of those things where

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:41.040
you have to wonder, are
people properly sensitized

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:41.830
to deal with it?

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.860
And the reason why
I say this is, look,

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.560
growing up in the West is
so different from growing up

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.940
in a village in India.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.090
If you grew up here, you were
sensitized at a young age

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:52.810
to the human body.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:54.880
I mean, you go to the beach.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.180
If you're a young boy,
you see a woman's legs

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.300
at a very young age,
and you talk about sex,

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.770
you go to coed schools.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:05.370
You have a healthier
relationship with sexuality.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.070
If you are a young
boy in rural India,

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.950
you may have a very, very
different relationship

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:15.300
with the human body with
sexuality, with sex.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:20.370
Given that backdrop, if your
first experience of sexuality

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:24.750
is violent pornography
and add to that the fact

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.940
that this is not something
you can talk about

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.760
with your family, this is not
something you can talk about

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.120
at school, so you have no way of
deciphering it and interpreting

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.450
it, there are real
problems with that.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:39.090
And as a journalist, again,
when I was reporting in India,

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.700
one of the things that--

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.460
the worst stories that
I often had to cover

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:48.510
were very violent gang
rapes and other types

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.010
of rape across the country.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.740
And it was a deeply, deeply
disturbing thing to cover.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.430
And on the one hand, of course,
rape happens everywhere.

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.260
This is not unique to India.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.930
It's not unique to any country.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.020
But it did get me
wondering, is there

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.890
a connection between this
explosion in pornography,

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.970
this explosion in access to
pornography-- because, again,

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:15.760
if you were a teenager in
America 10 15 years ago,

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.710
you could hide a Playboy
Magazine under your mattress.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.630
For most Indians, that
was not an option.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.570
Privacy works very
differently in India.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.880
Access works very differently.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:33.450
Most Indians didn't grow up with
a TV and a VCR or a DVD player.

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.740
So the internet
changes everything.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.420
A private viewing device
changes everything.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.250
And I do wonder, quite
openly in the book,

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.980
whether there is a link
between pornography and rape,

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:50.760
whether there is a link between
porn and sexuality in India.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.940
And I don't have answers.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.356
I mean, this is
where I have to be

00:31:53.356 --> 00:31:55.650
honest in that a lot
of the data shows

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:59.560
that there may not be a link.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.650
But I closed that chapter
very much in two minds.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:08.010
And I think this is a
conversation and a debate

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:11.370
that I think needs to take
place more widely in India

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:13.249
in a very open fashion.

00:32:13.249 --> 00:32:14.790
And the reason why
I say this, again,

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:21.060
is that sex and sexuality
is not new to India.

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:25.080
If you go back 500
years, 1,000 years,

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.830
think, again, of the Kama Sutra
and think of temples in India

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:33.320
that really enshrine
sex and sexuality,

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.170
so notions of openness about
sex should not be new to India.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:41.550
But a notion of prudishness was
introduced into Indian society

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.440
through colonization.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:47.280
And it was more of
a Victorian import.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.320
Think of the blouse,
and the petticoat,

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.220
and so many things
that didn't even

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.080
exist in India before that.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.540
So the water's quite
muddied on this,

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.480
but I do think
it's an issue that

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.265
needs to be debated openly.

00:33:02.265 --> 00:33:05.250
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: I wanted
to pivot a little bit to kind

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.120
of the relationship between--

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.550
or the role of the state and
some of these technologies.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:13.380
You kind of talked
very compellingly

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.050
about the fact that
India is the world's

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:19.230
leader in digital blackouts
and, specifically, most of that

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:21.420
takes place in the
state of Kashmir.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.430
And then you also kind
of talked about some

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.890
of these very
digital-forward initiatives

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:29.820
like [INAUDIBLE] for example,
which sound incredible

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.040
in terms of their potential
if we can get it right,

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.720
but there have
been conversations

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.622
around data breach and
privacy leaks from that.

00:33:37.622 --> 00:33:40.080
It's the kind of theme that
percolates throughout the book.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.663
Like, this is an
incredible technology

00:33:41.663 --> 00:33:45.270
that we should-- that can do
all these incredible things.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.240
And it's really
addressing and solving

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.530
real problems for
a lot of people.

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:54.000
But we have to be
careful about the state's

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.900
role, and particularly trusting
state with data and privacy.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.640
Would it be great to get
your sense of, do you--

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.930
I mean, having
written the book now,

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.550
do you feel like
the state in India

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:12.690
is equipped to properly
manage and handle

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:16.530
this data in a way that
ensures that we get the better

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.065
end of the potential?

00:34:19.065 --> 00:34:21.070
RAVI AGRAWAL: I don't
know is the honest answer.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:23.790
I mean, what we do
know is that everyone

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.590
needs checks and balances,
including the state,

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.719
including big corporations.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:32.760
So for example, if you
haven't read this yet,

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.580
India has more
internet shutdowns

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.710
than any other country on earth.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:40.050
Syria and Iraq
are two and three.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:43.590
And what this means is
that, at any given moment,

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:46.139
the state can just
switch off the internet.

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:51.150
So it basically has the
biggest cellular providers

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.730
on speed dial, and it can
call them and say, all right,

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.610
in this particular area,
shut down the internet.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.190
This often happens in
Kashmir after encounters

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.900
with terrorists.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.870
And the reason, the
logic, is that, again,

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.000
to use the car analogy,
if there's a car crash

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.980
right outside here,
the police will likely

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.420
cordon off the street.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.900
And so digitally
speaking, if there

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:18.190
is a clash between the police
and militants in Kashmir,

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.550
the authorities would
shut off the internet so

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:25.320
that militants wouldn't
be able to send out

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:29.860
imagery on social media, or seek
help, or anything like that.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:34.840
Now on the one hand, there's
a clear use for this.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.010
But on the other hand,
there is immense misuse,

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.520
especially if it isn't
properly codified.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.380
Under what circumstances
is the government

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.420
allowed to impose a shutdown.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.960
Who makes the decision?

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.780
Is there any accountability?

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.760
Is there any recourse if
a wrong decision was made?

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.810
And then, linked to all
of that is, over time--

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.900
so the state of
Kashmir, for example, it

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.290
lost hundreds of millions
of dollars in lost business,

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:04.410
and this is according
to a study by Brookings,

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.750
because the internet was
shut down for months.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:11.820
So those are clear
examples of the state.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.200
You can call it overreaching.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.140
You can call it taking
a draconian approach

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.860
to dealing with the problem.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.840
But again, for all the
good that the internet

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.490
and the proliferation
of smartphones

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.310
can do in a place
like India, there

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.160
is so much gray area
and so much of sort

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.430
of new areas of regulation
that haven't really

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.340
been covered or discussed
in the public space.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.340
And internet shutdowns
is chief among them.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.875
Aadhaar is a very interesting
topic in and of itself.

00:36:41.875 --> 00:36:43.500
For those of you who
don't know, that's

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.880
the biometric ID system in
India that has now signed up--

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.940
I think it's about
1.2 billion people.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:55.950
It's a system that basically
allows people to say, I am me.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:59.070
So it's an ID card
with fingerprints

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.620
and retinal scans included.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:07.080
And this is part of a very
polarized debate in India.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:10.140
There are people who will
say that this could have

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.700
immense positive impacts
in terms of people

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.210
being able to have an ID
to open bank accounts,

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.420
to get cell phone lines, to get
subsidies from the government,

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.180
so on and so forth.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.370
But there are many who
will also tell you,

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:31.280
critics who will say that this
could be misused by the state.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.600
There could be leakages.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.340
There could be hacks.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.930
You can't change
your fingerprints.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.090
So once you lose
them to someone else,

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.460
you're in trouble,
so on and so forth.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.170
I tend to fall
somewhere between--

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.810
in the middle of that
debate, where I think

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:48.870
you can't deny that there is
immense potential to this.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.650
And I think the government,
on the other hand,

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:54.620
needs to address the critics
and openly acknowledge

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.860
that there have been leaks.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.390
And this, again, is where
the private sector could

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:02.990
help in terms of how
to plug those leaks,

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:05.030
how to have better
security, and how

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:08.120
to be more upfront about
where things stand, better

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.060
communication all around, which
I think the private sector has

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.470
immense experience with.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.960
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: One of the
striking chapters is on a topic

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.637
that folks who followed
Indian politics

00:38:19.637 --> 00:38:21.220
over the last couple
of years would be

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.092
well aware of demonetization.

00:38:23.092 --> 00:38:25.300
What's interesting about
that particular chapter was,

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.660
you kind of followed the story
of this auto-rickshaw driver

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.210
and kind of his journey through
dealing with the aftermath

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:32.730
of modernization.

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:35.530
There's a line around, you
wondered whether or not

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.930
he'd ever be able to learn
how to use a smartphone

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:42.400
and really be able to
join in this increasingly

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.110
digital economy.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:48.490
What responsibility do you think
society and tech companies have

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:50.590
for those who, in the
short term, or maybe

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.300
medium term, maybe
even long term,

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.240
are being left behind
by this increasing

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.206
wave of digitization?

00:38:57.206 --> 00:39:00.040
RAVI AGRAWAL: So you can
contrast Phoolwati's story

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.790
with the story of Sarvesh who
is an auto-rickshaw driver I

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.280
met in Delhi and followed
around for two years now.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:11.860
And he knows deep down that he
just cannot use a smartphone.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.410
He can't bring himself
to use a smartphone,

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:18.310
doesn't understand it, is very
intimidated by technology,

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:22.250
can't even afford
it to begin with.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:26.290
And the reason why
that even came up is,

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.970
during demonetization,
which, for those of you who

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:32.320
don't know, was a moment where
the government recalled the two

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.530
highest currency denomination
notes from the market,

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:40.450
which was 86% of all cash,
and replaced it with two other

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:44.170
notes, the reason being that
they wanted A to get rid

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.150
of so-called "black
money" in the system,

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.940
which is money that hasn't--

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.670
on which income tax
hasn't been paid, and B,

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:55.180
to move India towards
digital payments.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.730
But in that chaotic
moment, which

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.280
most economists worth
their salt have decried

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.630
as a horrendous stupid
decision which has cost India

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:09.070
as much as 2% of its GDP,
but in that chaotic moment,

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.170
many people suffered
for their livelihoods,

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.450
including Sarvesh, this
auto-rickshaw driver,

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:18.300
because all of his rides
were paid for in cash.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.080
And because people
didn't have cash,

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.494
he wasn't making any money.

00:40:21.494 --> 00:40:22.660
So he was really struggling.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:26.050
And in that moment when I
was interviewing him for CNN,

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:29.290
I asked him, well, hey,
why don't you use Uber?

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:31.600
Why don't you sign
up for Ola, which

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.947
is Uber's Indian
equivalent and competitor.

00:40:34.947 --> 00:40:36.280
And that's where it all came up.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.880
He just was very
intimidated by technology,

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.430
didn't have a
smartphone, and felt

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:45.220
like this was just not for him.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.730
And I contrast that story
with Phoolwati's because it's

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:52.780
one thing for us to think
of technology as, you know,

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.390
if you just build it
and people will come,

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.210
that's not necessarily
going to happen, especially

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:01.730
in places like India, where
there is so many barriers.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:04.930
And think of not just people
like Sarveshh who are young--

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.390
I mean, he's in his 20s--

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.850
and should really
be able to learn.

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:12.350
Think of older people in India.

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.730
India has about
250 million people

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:18.160
who are over the age of 55, 60.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:22.160
And for those people,
technology is very intimidating.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.612
It's very hard to just
be given a smartphone

00:41:24.612 --> 00:41:27.070
and then learn how to use it,
and learn how to communicate,

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.900
and learn how to use apps.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.980
So that space was very important
for me to explore as well.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:37.330
Because it's sort of a
counterpoint to the narrative

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:40.130
that tech is necessarily
going to transform India.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.270
And as much as tech
will transform India,

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.210
I think India will
also transform tech.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:49.750
I think India has
all these unique ways

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:50.950
of dealing with tech.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:54.550
Indians are still much
more comfortable with cash

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.890
than they are with
digital payments.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:00.190
Indians prefer dual Sim phones
over a single Sim phones

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:03.340
because they like to switch
between service providers.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:06.340
Indians prefer prepaid
cellular contracts

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:10.207
instead of postpaid because
they don't trust large companies

00:42:10.207 --> 00:42:11.290
to give them good service.

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:13.270
Not only that, large
companies don't

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:16.920
trust them to pay up on time so
they prefer prepaid options as

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.420
well.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.320
So for all of those
reasons, India

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:26.170
is just a unique market
and a very large market

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:30.340
that I think is going
to evolve and change

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.545
in its own very special ways.

00:42:32.545 --> 00:42:35.020
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: And my
last question before we

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.070
open it up for Q&amp;A,
so given that, given

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:43.000
how unique India is and the
realities that we've unpacked

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.670
here so far, let's say,
hypothetically, you

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.720
are a product manager
overseeing Android

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.380
or you're in charge of
building out products

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.844
for the next billion
users in India, what

00:42:55.844 --> 00:42:57.760
are some of the things
that you'd keep in mind

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.330
or that you would feel
are considerations

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:05.104
that would be front and
center in how you approached

00:43:05.104 --> 00:43:07.270
rolling out those products
and the sorts of products

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:08.600
that you built?

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.340
RAVI AGRAWAL: That's
a great question.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:15.190
I'm sure Google is doing
all of these things already.

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:17.110
If I was a product
manager, I would

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:19.960
bring on board people like
Sarvesh and Phoolwati.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.990
I would bring on board
people who are not literate,

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:26.770
people who have never used
any technology before,

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:31.420
and see what kinds of
problems they're encountering.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:35.620
The English market in India
is already very well served.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.850
It's the Indian
language market--

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:40.640
Hindi, Bengali, Tamil,
Telugu, so on and so forth

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.670
that is still underserved.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:46.210
And I would explore
how those users engage

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.190
with the internet,
what they need,

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:54.250
what they're struggling with,
and then links to all of that,

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:58.250
I would really focus on digital
literacy and media literacy.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.180
I think there is--

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.120
with the great power that
companies like Google

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.800
have in places like India
comes a responsibility,

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.310
I believe, to help
people navigate

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:14.440
things that could
do immense good

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.440
but can do immense harm as well.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:22.660
And so stepping in where the
state has failed to help people

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:27.490
understand to learn how
to engage with news,

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:32.560
to learn what is right,
what is wrong, to verify,

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:41.650
to build that inner sense
of that aptitude of being

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:44.830
able to gauge what is
real and what is fake.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:48.320
That will be one of the great
challenges for Indian society.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.744
And if I was able to do
that as a product manager,

00:44:52.744 --> 00:44:54.160
I think that's one
of the things I

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.500
would spend a lot of
time thinking about.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.370
And I think whoever is able to
fix that in the private sector

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:04.630
would have done an immense,
immense service to a place

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:08.500
like India because India
doesn't have to repeat

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.230
the mistakes of the West.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:14.710
India's path could be
different through technology.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:18.420
And we all talk about
the word "leapfrog."

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.380
And India will
leapfrog in many ways.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.030
It will leapfrog credit cards.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.570
It will leapfrog so
many different things

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:28.030
that the West has
evolved through.

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:31.090
But leapfrog isn't
necessarily a good thing.

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:33.730
You can leapfrog to
a bad place as well.

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.800
That's where, I think,
the private sector

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:40.330
can really help with and sort of
speed up that learning process

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:43.930
and not assume that that
learning process is already

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.452
in place.

00:45:45.452 --> 00:45:48.700
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: So we'll open
it up for audience questions.

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:53.400
There are two mics, just
one there and one there.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.672
Folks will start queuing up.

00:45:56.672 --> 00:45:58.130
AUDIENCE: First of
all, thank you--

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:01.100
very, very interesting talk.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:04.520
I think throughout this talk,
mostly or even completely,

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:09.560
we've contrasted India with the
West, with the United States,

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.430
specifically.

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:17.270
And there are some ways where
we share similar problems.

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:19.250
One obvious thing
that we did talk about

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:22.550
was sexual content online.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:24.440
I think even in
the United States,

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.570
the availability of
problematic content online

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:29.980
far outpaces the availability
of good sexual education

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.670
in most of this country,
just as an example.

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:36.110
So I am wondering
what lessons have

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:38.240
you learned from your
exploration of how

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:42.320
India got connected that might
apply to the United States

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.300
as well?

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.920
RAVI AGRAWAL: Wow, so
the other way around.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.747
Wow, that's a great question.

00:46:49.747 --> 00:46:52.080
I think because India has
discovered all of these things

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:56.910
later, it is sort of learning
from the West's mistakes

00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:58.390
as it goes along.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:05.880
But in terms of lessons from
India, one takeaway, I think,

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:12.070
would be that cultures
use technology in ways

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.230
that are very unique to them.

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:20.840
And I think, especially
for investors here,

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.260
you know, anyone who's dealing
with products that are global,

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.750
I think it's very
important to see

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:29.990
each culture, each
community, each country

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:35.430
as having very unique ways
of dealing with technology.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:42.380
And so for example, when
I was talking about cash,

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:46.700
India's what I like to call
a very low trust society.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:50.120
And that's because Indians
almost always just assume

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.550
that anything that could
go wrong in the system

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:53.900
will go wrong.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.760
Indians don't show up
for meetings on time

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.510
because they don't
expect the other person

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:59.090
to show up on time.

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:01.220
Indians like to pay
for things in cash

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.590
because they think
something could go wrong

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.870
with a credit card.

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:09.710
So cash on delivery is a
very big thing in India.

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:12.260
Amazon's a big competitor
in India, Flipkart,

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:16.700
began as a company that was
delivering books to people,

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.590
and then those customers
would pay for it

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.500
in cash at their doorsteps.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.510
And the reason why
I'm explaining this

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:32.050
as a lesson for America
is that each market

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:33.580
will develop in its
own way and will

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:37.000
have its own sort of unique
relationship with how

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.265
technology develops and
how it should be used.

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.790
That said, I wish
I could tell you

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:49.290
that India, for all of its
great connections with faith

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:50.730
and religion-- you
know, India was

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.410
the birthplace for religions.

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:54.330
It was the birthplace of yoga.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:56.940
I wish I could tell you
that Indians have a better

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.166
relationship with screens.

00:48:59.166 --> 00:48:59.790
And they don't.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.690
As a screen addiction is a
problem here in the West,

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.760
it is becoming so in India.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:13.920
And so in that sense, India
really has no lessons to offer.

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.760
And the solution to that problem
will have to be a global one.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.264
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:20.264 --> 00:49:23.320
AUDIENCE: Hi, Ravi, thanks
for joining us and sharing

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:24.060
your thoughts.

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:27.410
I wanted you to go a
little bit more into--

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:29.890
that you briefly mentioned
regulation and regulation

00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:33.370
of technology and the foreign
was this Indian company

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:34.390
dynamic.

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:36.947
And I've seen many
stories recently

00:49:36.947 --> 00:49:38.530
about the government
wanting to change

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:41.780
how things are and the status
quo, things like localization

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:42.830
and stuff like that.

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:44.530
So I just wanted to
hear your thoughts

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:47.077
on how things look right
now and what you think

00:49:47.077 --> 00:49:48.160
will happen in the future?

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.320
Like, is India going
to become another China

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.510
in terms of foreign
companies not being

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:55.252
able to play on the same level?

00:49:55.252 --> 00:49:56.710
RAVI AGRAWAL: I
mean, I don't think

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:59.110
India can become
another China, and I

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:02.910
don't think even the
government wants to do that.

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:05.560
China is just such a different
market to begin with.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:09.790
Their internet is almost
like one language.

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.520
They have apps that
are, as you all know,

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.220
an entire ecosystem
in and of itself.

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.710
India's evolution with the
internet has been so different.

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:21.370
Number one, India has more than
200 million English language

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:24.070
users.

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:27.520
Right from the start, Western
companies were allowed in

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:31.640
and became the leaders
of the Indian internet,

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.230
Google being first among them,
but also Amazon, and Uber,

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:38.740
and so many other companies
that made it big in India

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:40.000
quite early.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.770
I think what you're
seeing now more

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:47.560
recently in terms of regulation
is India and this government's

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.000
reaction to Western
companies having

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.800
such a large slice of the pie.

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:59.020
And so for example, in
the e-commerce space,

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:02.350
you know if the Indian
government is restricting

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:04.780
the amount that
Western companies can

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.330
own in a company or
the amount of business

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:09.280
that they can do
in a certain space,

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.760
I think they're doing that
primarily just to protect

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.250
local companies from being
able to survive and stay

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:17.000
in the game.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:22.420
I don't think it will ever rise
to the levels of either China

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:26.605
or even the protectionism that
we saw in India in the '80s.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:33.070
I think one of the things
you must see about India

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:38.530
is that every politician,
every regulator

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:43.420
looks to 1991 as the year in
which the Indian economy really

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:46.735
opened up and benefited
from opening up.

00:51:46.735 --> 00:51:50.290
I just cannot see India
going back on that.

00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:54.640
I cannot see even this
government stepping back

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.430
on that front.

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:58.090
I think they realize
that opening up

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:00.700
is where their strength lies.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.580
I think they also realize
that the market isn't static.

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.560
It's growing so
fast that there's

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.506
enough space for everyone.

00:52:10.218 --> 00:52:11.570
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:14.057
I remain largely
ignorant of India

00:52:14.057 --> 00:52:15.640
short of some stories
from [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.130
about his personal
travels before this talk.

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:21.010
And I'm very interested in--
you mentioned the way that India

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:23.440
will change technology.

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.310
Is there infrastructure in place
for either developers in India

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:31.990
or phone makers in India to
really learn at scale how

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:34.600
to build better
technology for those

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.790
that are often
overlooked in the West--

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:39.670
poor people, beyond just
the cost of phone and sort

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:42.130
of reducing access to
entry, actually building

00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:45.940
technology that serves at the
app level or one layer further,

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:49.432
some of those more rural and
often separated populations?

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:50.640
RAVI AGRAWAL: Yeah, there is.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.950
That's a great question.

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:54.550
I think most of it is led
by the private sector again.

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:03.610
So coming back to education,
I talk about an Indian company

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:05.740
in my chapter on education.

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:08.380
It's called EkStep,
which means one step.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:12.910
And they have
developed, essentially--

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:16.420
they like to think of
themselves as, for example,

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.420
the Uber of primary
education, where they've

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:22.660
created a platform where
other developers can

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:26.590
jump in and create multilingual
content for primary schoolers

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:30.620
or primary school teachers to be
able to use for their students.

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:37.240
And it really is a great example
of Indian tech developers

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:39.370
using their technologies.

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:41.860
And this was
inspired by Aadhaar.

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:44.620
So it's sort of an
OpenStack kind of system

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:49.090
that allows other companies to
create other things around it.

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:51.130
Think of Aadhaar
itself, the biometric

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:53.500
ID system, which is Indian.

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.630
It's indigenous.

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:59.140
It's Indian run,
Indian engineers.

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.090
And this was the
government's initiative,

00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:05.230
but it was led by a private
sector techie, Nandan Nilekani,

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:07.300
for those of you
who don't know him,

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:09.730
who found co-founded Infosys--

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:13.150
but again, the basic
logic being that you

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:16.780
can harness Indian
strengths and Indian workers

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:20.350
to create these open platform
systems that could then

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:22.990
plug into other aspects.

00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:24.800
It could plug into
the banking sector.

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:28.430
It can plug-in to the
government subsidy schemes

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:29.900
and so on and so forth.

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:33.280
So I think that space is
where most of the innovation

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:39.430
is taking place, more than
any other space, I would say.

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:42.460
You know, if you look at
other spaces like search,

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:45.280
or messaging, I would
argue that the most

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.520
innovation is taking place in
the West or maybe in China.

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.853
And India's development on
that front is more derivative.

00:54:51.853 --> 00:54:54.900
AUDIENCE: My question was
more towards the future.

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.980
So if you look at
India right now,

00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:59.514
as the country is still
not fully industrialized.

00:54:59.514 --> 00:55:00.930
A large fraction
of the population

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:07.610
is living in rural villages.

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.870
[INAUDIBLE] talking about
it in the next decade

00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:13.930
or two how, say, artificial
intelligence will

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:15.350
take your jobs.

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:17.510
And I also assumed
that maybe instead

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:19.810
of driving
auto-rickshaw could be

00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:22.420
as profitable as a self-driving
car for a company that

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:23.740
wants to make it.

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:27.054
So do you have any
thoughts about how

00:55:27.054 --> 00:55:29.595
a country like India that is so
behind in terms of technology

00:55:29.595 --> 00:55:33.050
and in terms of
industrialization

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:35.700
would be affected, say,
20 years down the line.

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.920
RAVI AGRAWAL: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.900
And I try to deal with this
a little bit in the book.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.490
So there are two
things going on.

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:47.600
On the one hand, the
rise of smartphones

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.060
will lead in the
immediate future,

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:52.410
I think, to immense
job creation.

00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:55.250
So if you think of the
e-commerce market, which

00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:59.900
is going to grow leaps
and bounds in India,

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.850
the kinds of jobs
that you create

00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:04.460
with the e-commerce
market are ideally

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:06.650
suited to the Indian
labor profile.

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:09.020
So you've got delivery jobs.

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.790
You've got packing
jobs, warehousing jobs.

00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:13.550
Those are exactly
the kinds of jobs

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:19.010
that rural Indian men mostly
are exactly primed for.

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:21.431
They don't need more education.

00:56:21.431 --> 00:56:23.430
Those are the kinds of
jobs they're looking for.

00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:27.870
They're relatively well-paid
for what they're looking for.

00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:29.660
So there are enough
studies out there

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:32.210
that show that
those kinds of jobs

00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:35.510
will create tens
of millions of jobs

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:38.850
over the next 10, 15 years.

00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:41.000
That's sort of the
shorter-term perspective.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.310
And then there are
many other stories of--

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:46.550
like, there's an Indian
version of LinkedIn

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:47.780
for blue-collar workers.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:51.350
It's called "BabaJob," which
is then bought over by Quikr.

00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:52.790
And basically, it
sort of connects

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:56.600
people who are seeking
a certain type of job

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.000
to that particular
type of employer.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.800
You know, if you're a Domino's
Pizza in India, for example,

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:07.100
you are looking
for a delivery man,

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:11.110
the standards for selecting a
delivery man are pretty low.

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:12.920
Like, if you show up
for the job interview,

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.384
you're going to get the job.

00:57:14.384 --> 00:57:16.550
So the real challenge there
is connecting the secret

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:17.810
to the employer.

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:21.240
And technology will fix
a lot of those issues.

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.680
So in the short term, I think
there's an immense benefit.

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.470
The longer term is where
the troubles come around

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:31.940
as these giant
warehouses get automated,

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:37.280
as deliveries get automated,
as cars get automated.

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.830
The thing is, it's
hard for me to imagine

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:42.830
those things happening in
India the way I can imagine

00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:44.165
them happening in the West.

00:57:44.165 --> 00:57:49.160
See, it's one thing to
imagine a drone delivering

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.360
a package to this giant
house in Pasadena,

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.760
where it just drops it off
in the garden, delivery done.

00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:59.480
But can you imagine the
same drone delivering

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.870
the same product to
a slum in Mumbai,

00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:06.680
where you're trying to
hover over this tiny shack,

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:09.110
and there are, like, 200
children playing around there,

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:11.720
and then one of them
grabs the package,

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.330
someone else grabs the drone.

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:17.840
That's the end of the
model right there.

00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:21.350
It's hard also to
imagine you know

00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:26.480
the algorithm that would work
for automated driving in India.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.890
I used to drive in India.

00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:30.390
And you're navigating
not just roads and cars,

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:34.700
but you're navigating people,
and cows, and other animals.

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:39.050
And it's hard to imagine
automation really

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:42.860
working in these tiny,
narrow lanes, where

00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:47.300
it takes immense ingenuity
to scream, and shout,

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.780
and corral support for
your car to get out.

00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:54.470
So on the one hand, I think
when these things eventually

00:58:54.470 --> 00:59:01.250
get automated in India, we
will see immense job losses.

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:05.150
I just-- I can't bring myself
around to seeing that moment.

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:06.016
I can't imagine it.

00:59:06.016 --> 00:59:07.640
I don't know if you
guys can at Google,

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:09.641
but India's a very
different market.

00:59:09.641 --> 00:59:12.140
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: Yeah, and
it speaks to our responsibility

00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:14.840
to kind of be thoughtful about
some of those consequences

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:16.990
before they really manifest.

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:18.230
Our lost audience question.

00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:20.270
AUDIENCE: Hey,
thanks for coming.

00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:21.140
I have a question.

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:25.430
You mentioned a couple of times
about the biometric ID system,

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:28.970
but you also mentioned that
India is a low-trust society.

00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:31.820
Has there been any
worry or discussion

00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:35.150
about adopting some of what the
Chinese government is doing,

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:36.552
using the biometric system?

00:59:36.552 --> 00:59:37.760
RAVI AGRAWAL: There has been.

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.130
I think the debate has
been restricted mostly

00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:46.670
to more elite policy
circles amongst journalists

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:48.510
and civil society.

00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:52.490
And I don't imagine that, out
of the 1.2 billion people who've

00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:54.140
signed up--

00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.930
I would imagine the vast
majority haven't really

00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:58.850
thought too much about privacy.

00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:01.670
And you have to think, again,
of where they're coming from.

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:03.230
Most have come
from a place where

01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:05.750
they had no form of ID--
no driver's license,

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:10.850
certainly no passport, no way
of getting access to government

01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:12.750
subsidies or products.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:15.010
So this was a big
leap, and it was

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.000
a useful leap for many people.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.470
And despite being a
low-trust society,

01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:22.280
it's very telling that
they were able to invest

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.550
so much trust in the government
in the hope of something

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:28.160
better.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.010
And that speaks to the potential
for technology in India

01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:35.460
and how much hope people have
for what technology could do

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.420
and how it could
better their lives.

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:39.690
But as I was saying
earlier, there

01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:41.600
are many, many things
that could go wrong.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.790
And that is a debate
that needs to be had.

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:47.280
It is something
that the government

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.070
needs to be more open about.

01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:52.530
There certainly have
been massive leaks.

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:56.717
And fessing up to them nice
and early and being transparent

01:00:56.717 --> 01:00:58.050
would serve the government well.

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:00.300
I mean, everything has leaks.

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.010
It's owning up to
them and dealing

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:06.310
with them that eventually will
win people's trust, I think.

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:08.274
So that's a longer
journey for India.

01:01:08.274 --> 01:01:08.940
Sorry, go ahead.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
just to clarify,

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.125
so overall, it's been very
beneficial, and the risks are--

01:01:14.125 --> 01:01:16.125
like, what are the more
immediate risks if not--

01:01:16.125 --> 01:01:17.208
RAVI AGRAWAL: For Aadhaar?

01:01:17.208 --> 01:01:18.366
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:01:18.366 --> 01:01:22.320
RAVI AGRAWAL: I think
the immediate risks are

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:28.320
A, large-scale leaks;
B, the information

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.240
from those leaks being
harnessed in ways that

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.890
are particularly insidious.

01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:38.260
So it could be voter fraud.

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.250
It could be impersonation.

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:44.740
It could be opening
fake accounts.

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:46.530
There's a range
of things that one

01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:52.710
could see happening based
on leaked biometric IDs.

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:57.030
All of that said, one
advantage of this system

01:01:57.030 --> 01:02:01.250
is that A, it is a
government controlling

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:06.740
it, not a company; and B, it
is data that is fairly dumb.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.080
I mean, it is your
ID, but it doesn't

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.310
have your browsing history.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:13.460
It doesn't have
your preferences.

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:16.850
It's hard to sell that
to an ad firm and see--

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:21.560
it's not of immense value
to someone else in the way

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:26.967
that other leaks that we've seen
from other companies could be--

01:02:26.967 --> 01:02:28.550
Facebook's leaks,
for example, through

01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:31.160
came Cambridge Analytica.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.220
So in that sense, I think
the potential for Aadhaar

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:39.050
to be dangerous is less
so than other leaks

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:43.340
that we now know about
from the private sector.

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:49.160
All of that said, one
shouldn't dismiss what

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.480
could go wrong with Aadhaar.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.620
And I think, again,
it's a conversation that

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:57.996
needs to be had more openly
and robustly in India.

01:02:57.996 --> 01:02:59.995
ARUN VENKATARAMAN: Thank
you all for being here.

01:02:59.995 --> 01:03:01.328
RAVI AGRAWAL: Thank you so much.

01:03:01.328 --> 01:03:04.640
[APPLAUSE]
