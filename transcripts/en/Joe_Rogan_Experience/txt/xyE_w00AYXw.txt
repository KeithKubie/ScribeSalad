Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hello

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       Amy. Hello. The Leopard theme. You have leopard jackets today. You have a leopard top. Is this just a coincidental or is there something to this? Well, I'm a little bit white trash and I want every, no, I don't know. I I liked, I liked married with children. Pulled us up. You don't have to. I'm a little bit, uh, and I'm trying to get comfortable. Are you comfortable? I don't know. You seem comfortable. [inaudible] fine. I'm with the king anyway. Okay, so leopard, Leopard. I like Mary the children. I don't know. I always peg Bundy. Well, I was gonna go for Kelly, but thank you. I like dumb and slutty and a no. I do have my friend who started pegging her boyfriend and my phone has peg Bundy. Whoa. What's her name? She started pegging her boyfriend. She got a new boyfriend. His, I think he's gay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       Honestly, I don't sure. Listen, if you get pegged, I'm not saying you're gay for sure. But this guy, this guy, this guy I think is gay. And what does she think? They broke up. She thinks he's getting out when Jesus Christ broke up. Why did they break up? He was emotionally unavailable because he's gay. Wow. I think he's looking for something with a deck. So what was there other signs with him that he might be, I dunno. I think that he just was not he, maybe he's just an emotionally unavailable guy, but he seemed to have a lot of issues around wanting to get Dixonus. So it seems like maybe he needs to try maybe a less plastic one. Yeah, we probably use already trying it. Don't you think? Maybe. I mean, I don't think he just, why would you waste your time with a rubber Dick Strap to a woman if you could just go get maybe Jesus.

Speaker 2:          00:01:49       Jesus made some Christian stuff like, oh yeah, I don't, yeah, maybe it's like internalized homophobia or probably, or maybe he's just like transitionary like maybe two years now. He will look back and go, God, I used to make girls fuck me in the ass. I'm was such a dickhead. Why did I do that? I should have just come out. Yeah. Or maybe he likes the feminine aspects of a woman and the rock hard cock part of a dude. There's a lot of people that liked that. He needs it to get, there needs to be like a, well, I guess that's what a, he needs a Hermaphrodite as well. Whitney Cummings was telling me that those sex robots, you know, you saw her specialist administrates robot. There's, they're really popular where they have a woman's body in a dick. Those ones are really popular. All right. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:02:35       All right. You get to live here, you get to live here. You just, you just want everything inside, outside. Give it to me. I had a guy call into my podcast about his wife won't peg him enough and he's a cock, but she won't. Yeah. But she like, she liked me. She like makes love to him while she pegs him and he wants to be just destroyed. You know, Jesus Christ. He, he's a cock. He or she won't fuck black guys, so he's just, he's like, I'm like, I feel like for what you want, you should be very grateful. You have as a woman, that's pretty down, but there's always more. So I'm wondering if he just wants more or if this is the ultimate same with, but just that's how it is with people. If you go back to the early days of porn, it was basically just pizza delivery man and sorority girls and sex and everybody had a bush. But then you look at today, everyone's gagging and slapping and choking and spit and not choking on pubes in his body. There was none of that back then. Now it's like standard, you know? It's like everything keeps getting pushed. Boundaries keep getting pushed. Everyone's getting the fish. Poor Aziz. It's fuck cause he's watched the war, the wrong porn disease. Oh, you got in trouble? Yeah. What a disaster.

Speaker 2:          00:03:51       Have you seen a special, I haven't watched it yet. I watched a clip and it shot so bad. It's like you see him and then you see people behind him in the backstage area milling around and he's on a seat. It's so dumb. It's like there's, there's doors open in the back and then people walking behind the doors. It's like some odd artistic choice to try to be like, it doesn't matter that I'm up here. Yeah. Like it's no big deal. Life still goes on even though I'm up here, which means you were thinking that life doesn't go on and you wanted to show people that life goes on too. That's deep. You are, you are insecure about how narcissistic you are and then you tried to fight it. Well, I was thinking it was the director's choice or was the director who was the director?

Speaker 2:          00:04:36       Was it Spike Jones? Yeah. I think he tried to do something crafty, which you know, is kind of interesting in any other format. I mean, it'd be interesting if it was a conversation, it was just a, you know, two people talking and they're in a public square and you see people milling around behind them. That's not distracting. But with stand up, the more things you have to think about other than what the person's saying, the more it's gonna take away from what the person saying. Yeah. It does feel weird to just, I mean, you know, I go onto the leopard print jacket sometimes, but I like to dig myself a little hole, but the leper print jack is just cool. It's just funny. It's not distracting. It's just here she is. I like a, you know, I have my toy store. I don't know if you've been around for any of those sets, but it's late at night.

Speaker 2:          00:05:18       You got to wake him up. You gotta wake him up near Shore. Just a plastic sword from the toy store. I spent a lot of time with props. I, I have fake blood on me most times. I don't know when there's going to, I'm going to be inspired to take a funny picture to make a Prat Fall, fall. Did you see the pratfalls that we did? Me and Steven Randolph, one of the door guys at the comedy store one was this, they posted on the comedy store thing. We did. We challenged each other to, to three pratfalls. It's so embarrassing. Listen, after Brody died, I was like, I'm going all out. I'm experimenting. I'm having as much fun as I can. You know, obviously it's about jokes, but sometimes you gotta really just, you got to just have your time up there. The Brody one was hard on everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:06:01       I was the one making any sense. That was one that it just like felt like swallowing a dry rock. Yeah. A cow. Like how has that car gone? It just feel he was just such a big presence. And then it's sad to, I don't want to talk too much about Ios gone here cause I know that's what everyone does. But um, I did in one and when I did trip on Iowasca it was right after that. And it helped me a lot with that cause I kept thinking about how sad it was that he couldn't feel us, like hugging us. Him, we loved him. Brody was loved. Like we loved that man. He was our brother, you know? And that was the sad part.

Speaker 3:          00:06:37       Well, I mean I just feel like there's no way any of us could ever understand what's in anybody else's brain. You know? I don't know what's in yours. You don't know what's in mind. It's like we, we assume that there's a similar thing happening inside our head is other people's heads. And I think that's wildly incorrect. And I think some people are just in pain all the time and there's not much you can do as a friend to, to help them, you know? I mean, I felt the same way about Bordain when Bordain died. Uh, it was just a how to, I don't get it. I just don't understand how someone who's so loved, you know, he has this amazing job, his a beautiful daughter. I mean, he has this life that's extraordinary and very interesting and deep and he gets to meet these fascinating people and travel, travel the world and expose people to all of these incredible artists and culinary artists. And yet still didn't, couldn't take it, didn't want to be here for whatever reason.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       And I just think about it, it's like, so they're, they're okay. You know, they're off wherever we go or whatever happens. They've transcended, came back, they're floating around somewhere. But it's like, selfishly, I'm like, I want more Brody like, course I want him back course. And it's, you know, and then you see people, they just fade. You know, like each year goes by and they just, which is going to happen to all of us. So, but you know, luckily he had a lot of catch phrases, a lot of stuff online or in the back of the store. Oh, I love, I kiss it every time I walk by it. I'm not touching it anymore. Yeah, I lick it. I give it my herpes. I don't have herpes yet. Joe Rogan audience. It's okay. And honestly if you have it, it's fine. What am I going to have a vaccination must have on already they've got to almost shirt.

Speaker 2:          00:08:24       What do you think? Conspiracy theorists? Yes. Yes. Cause he already sparked up when we talked about the aliens thing with, did he bring up Ohio? No, I left it all out. But he got his eyes. There's just something, there's a spark. They have conspiracy that they have a little spark in their eye. When he perked up, he keeled his asshole a little bit. When I brought it up, it was really funny. Like those. The last question I asked him was about UFO, just kind of almost as a joke, but just as a goodbye, you know, like keep it silly. That's all I'm reading. It's in fucking hundreds of articles. It's all Bernie Sanders says he will tell the world about aliens if he becomes president. That's the thing that they took out of that. Well, it's smart of him. It feels like Trump's straws. It's like smart.

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       If Bernie had said, if Bernie had brought it up, I would've been like, that is a brilliant tactic. But don't you think that people that believe in aliens are already going to vote for or that are the most hung up on it? No. No. You don't think they're the same? No, no, no. I think they, they very wildly conspiracy theorists or left wing right wing and the alien one is different than any other one. And I think there's a lot more people that are, um, that are alien lovers that cross both sides. I think it's just one of those things where you, there's guys that fuck alien done. That's the only, that's the only anchors you're holding out to pastor Manhattan. Yeah. Do People claim that? I bet you they do. For sure. Do you know this? People really in the big foot sexually, there's like all these novels written about a big foot tall Armenian.

Speaker 2:          00:10:00       No, no, no, no. Just that hard to ever go to Glendale. Everywhere I go to the Galleria, there's this big foot. This is a very localized reference. There's big foot, you it, big foot or eyes. You get big foot erotica. Yeah, I mean it's like really common. What if he had a small deck? Like you always hear about the really tall guys with the tiny decks and when I say care about them, you hear about them. Get this seduced by big foot. Ooh, look at, come for bigfoot Virginia Wade. Big Flood by Lolita young. Wait a minute. Narrated. I mean this is an audio book. [inaudible] you know what they say? The bigger the big foot, the bigger the air in the bones. What does that, I like a guy with very deck, you know, like you like to listen. People say they don't like too much heroin balls.

Speaker 2:          00:10:50       I say get her all the way under the shaft. Look at this boffing big foot. What is happening? I thought, I feel like I liked it. Her name's Ann L. Gay bigfoot. Look at this last row and I'll probe is gay bigfoot. Keep smoking after we fucked. What the fuck? Mouthful of Sasquatch. I [inaudible]. I've met that man. There was like one of the door guys at the comedy store. That's one of the tour guys. I got fired. This is a whole genre of erotica. There's a bunch of women that write these books. This Virginia Wade lady is a, she's apparently very prolific with her big foot erotica. She writes quite a few of these. How many does she have? That was 13 at least 13 come from big foot. Come for bigfoot. Number 13 she just makes shit up. Then there I was walking the dog and the dog had a heart attack.

Speaker 2:          00:11:41       The next thing, big foot stick is in my mouth. How about I have a good pun, Harry and the Hummer sons. Henderson Hen. Don't say Harry on the thinking out loud and then just sounding it out. I can't read ever. Leave me alone. What'd you expect me to come on? And Boone's fucking smart. So there's at least 13 books. I Bet Virginia Wade lives in a fucking giant match and drives around in a rolls like the l Ron Hubbard. Probably a dude. No, it's a, but I get to, I bet it's a, would that big foot five baby come for big foot baby. What does that say? That one home for big foot five baby. What does it say baby? See that Seymour right hand side all the way. The right all the way to the right all the way to the right up above it. There you go. Bam.

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       What does that fuck is that? Maybe they have a big foot baby. It looks like a come inside or one. So she's got, let's find out. Google, Google, Virginia. Wade's big. Is that her right there? She looks normal. It might've been. Was that a photo of her and go with the goddess? Go back. It was a different book. They're talking about. Okay. The ball for big foot. Does that hurt? Is that Virginia Wade doesn't normal looking lady and it might not be her. Oh, Amazon Poles buffed by big foot romance novels from shelves. What? Why are they censoring bigfoot porn yet? That might've been her. Okay. Why don't, why didn't anyone tell me about these literary treasures? Oh my God. I thought for a second. The long but interesting read was about the book. This is a long but interesting read. Why are they pulling it? Why are they pulling this stay at home mother from Colorado?

Speaker 2:          00:13:15       Of course she is no real riding experience. No, of course not. You don't even have to be good. I mean she spent all day waxing her nipples. She couldn't get to come to terms with their hairy body and then she realized all she needed was to find her match. She says, I get this crazy idea for a story. So she sat down and wrote the entire book in an hour. Bella does no fucking, there's no second draft. That's what I love to hear by my, from my authors. You wrote this all in one draft. She said just 12,000 words in a matter of weeks. She's been considered trying to sell it to mainstream publisher instead. She went directly to Amazon's kindle direct publishing, an online platform for self publishing. 70% royalty rate for authors. I think she sold a fuck load. I had to go viral. Here's the line from it if you want, right?

Speaker 2:          00:14:04       I don't think he's monogamous, but let's bigfoot na. So big click on that big foot insider, monster porn, Amazon crackdown link. So let's find out what the fuck is going on here. Why would they crack down on that? Ooh, ad blocker. You son of a bitch. It was the tens dude. So hot author, Virginia Wade's fiction debut falls, a group of women who embark on a week long camping trip to mount hood national forest. They are in the shadow of Oregon's highest mountains. They're, they're kidnapped and sexually assaulted. Posteriors woodland creature. What the hell is that thing? Ass One protagonist. That's some good writing. It's fucking big foot. His Shelley, he's real. For fuck's sake, har filled her eyes with a huge sea dash dash dash. I'm saying that says cock corn in the book. His feet are fucked up with decidedly un-PC title, like come for big foot culm.

Speaker 2:          00:14:57       Of course, it's just the first of 16 fiction ebooks. Wade, a pen name has written about the legendary, but sometimes best, sometimes known as Sasquatch, each legendary beast. Each detailing a series of graphic and often violent sexual encounters between the apelike creature in a female lovers. Okay, wait, wait. Has made an exceptional living writing these stories. Wow. Okay, but why did they take them down? That's reminds me of my friend from middle school. His boyfriend who is Sicilian. He was just so hairy and he looked, it's been downloaded more than a hundred thousand times. Holy Shit. That's five bucks. That means she made $500,000 for the flipper. Why?

Speaker 2:          00:15:42       Well, she made 70% of it. At least I bet you the other books didn't take as long either. Wow. During her best months, she's netting 30,000 or more in a month. Writing big foot jerk off books. Wow. Taken by pirates. Oh, she re she branched off into other genres. It's all just getting fucked, taken by pirates, seduced by the dark Lord. It's like getting fucked by demons and pirates and hilarious. I'm getting traumatized. A traumatic thing is coming up for me right now. That's weird. Do you want to hear it? But my mom wrote romance novels when I was shut the fuck. Yeah. They were never published. No, I didn't read them. They were never published, so it was really just a fuck journal.

Speaker 2:          00:16:28       You read your mom's fucked journal. I didn't read it, but she had romance novels around and I would definitely knew I was really good at skimming to the sex scenes. I knew how to flip through, flip my being to, so your mom wrote, she was a part of this thing called romance writers of America, and she actually won awards and then she never followed through. So she could have published the book and probably had success. And then she had a hole. It was like a whole suspense romance. Salinas revenge was what it was called. She was Lena like the saying no, but that's really funny. She came back and she said to fuck bigfoot. No, she fucks. The girl killed her. Mixed read it. She's dead. I like that lady, that little Weirdo. I mean I don't like her because she killed her, but she was, she's like a real weird, I mean the girl killed, see, obsessed.

Speaker 2:          00:17:15       Like she, you know, she reminds me of, she reminds me of, and I definitely don't like her, but she, um, she reminds me of the little woman from um, okay. Can't remember what's it called? The uh, David Lynch that show which one? Twin peaks. Which ones when they're a little lady in it. I don't remember twin peaks very well, but there was a little lady in [inaudible] imagine the day, but I just remember usually from the TV movie with Jennifer Lopez in it. She plays Celine. She played Selena. That was her big break. She was a fly girl and then she got super hot and that big ass was exposed to us and Selena outfits. That's interesting. Why they go killer. She was their assistant, right? Yeah, she was just such a big fan. I think she was just obsessed with her. So she killed her cause she was a big fan.

Speaker 2:          00:18:06       People are just fucking crazy. That doesn't make sense. It's probably hated her because she made her wash her laundry and shit. She was our assistant or I think she was the head of her fan club assistance. Get Weird with people. Did you ever hear the David Spade story? His assistant tasered them and fucking tied him one of going to jail? Yeah. I guess. Was it a girl or a guy? Was he trying to fuck him? I don't think so. I think he just hated him. Oh my God. I feel like spade would be a nice employer, but maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe is now it's good taste. Wow, I didn't know that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. See if he can find that store spades at some shit at me. Got Catfish. He's here. He gets fished. He got catfish by, he told it on the norm. McDonald Cho who catfished him.

Speaker 2:          00:18:52       Someone catfish him. He thought he had met this model and Twitter. Oh. And then he saw them out on real life and was like, hey Twitter. And she's like, what are you telling them? And they say something. Oh that's so embarrassing. Who did spades? Coolest shit. There goes David spades assistant pleads guilty to assault. Make that larger police. Oh my God. David pay spades. Former assistant pleaded guilty. Stop to assaulting the comedian with a stun gun and agreed to seek counseling for drug and psychological problems. Beverly Hill Superior Court Judge Elden Fox also sentenced David Warren. Skippy Malloy on Thursday to five years probation. That's it. Two nights straight, at least named skippy ordered him to stay at least a hundred yards away from spade and performed 480 hours of community service. If somebody tased me, I want more than community service cause that's a threat and they tied you up and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:19:44       How did it say? Wait a minute. It says David Spade 36 oozes in the 20s shut the fuck at the beginning of our call it, oh my God, he tied him up. How did, I wonder how the story ended. How did he get out of it? She just really good with the untying. Not, did the guy get tired of fucking them and get shocked. G says he was angry in a psychotic state due to cocaine. The morning of the attack. I'm Tom Town. I mean, I've done coke before. I don't think I've been like, let me tie up my boss and Taser him. Never done coke with David spade. You're right around him. Maybe he's, you know, telling you to take the dog out and you're like, I can't do this. I can't hyper. So the Co said the Costar, the NBC said, come just shoot me. The new movie Joe Dirt said at the time that Malloy a 30 year old aspiring actor was a friend who is obviously mentally troubled right now. Wow. And I'm more shocked by Joe Dirt as a new movie. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       we're digging back in 2001 we are digging back. Wow. Fuck. That seems like a long time ago. But you know, it doesn't seem like a long time ago. 2009 you say 2009 like, oh that just happen. Nope. 10 years. A decade. Like 1960 to 1970 it seems like forever. 70 to 80 seemed like forever. 80 to 90 seems like forever, but 2009 to 2019 for whatever fucking reason seems real close. Yeah. And it's not, it's not, it's hot. Whole years

Speaker 4:          00:21:20       style. We'll show you that too. Cause I was, I was born in 83. I'm 36 and uh, the kid, the, the younger kids right now are dressing like I dressed in high school. Like it's cycled back around there in my styles.

Speaker 3:          00:21:35       Yeah. But that's then like not 2009 to 2019. Is there a difference in style? Yeah. This is coming from someone that's Zeros.

Speaker 4:          00:21:42       Yeah, there is, what is it? It's okay. From 2009, um, I would say 2009 was maybe when they had started having this one. I have to remember where I was in life. I just moved to New York. People were wearing, I dunno, I'd lived in Santa Fe and I was drinking a lot. So I definitely, I quit drinking in 2009 I was still never been assigned comedy then. Santa Fe's was supposed to be a weird place. That's where I met Tate Fletcher. Hallo? Caveman coffee. I met Tej in a, in Santa Fe. He used to come in with a bunch of sober dudes after meeting. I don't know if I'm supposed to say this, but whatever. He's pretty open about it. But I mean it was the truth. They were so annoying. I was like a drunk. I was wasted at this cowboy bar. To wear a cowboy outfit. You have to, you have to do, that's your uniform.

Speaker 4:          00:22:31       Really. Being a wagers is not humiliating enough. You will also have to dress. Just have a John Deere hat on. No, you have to wear it. You had to wear a cowboy hat and you had to have a shirt that had yolks on it. Oh, if you worked there, if you worked there and not when you went in. Yeah, that would be crazy. That would be crazy. But so table come in with a bunch of people and they just wouldn't order outcome. I mean it was just like low sales, high maintenance. I was like, who is this fucking guy? So big and ridiculous. And then I was talking to him. I hadn't quit drinking. I didn't quit drinking til I moved out of Santa Fe. But I told him I want to do comedy and he made them turn the Karaoke night into a comedy show for me.

Speaker 4:          00:23:04       Yeah. And I got [inaudible] first time you ever went. Oh yeah. Wow. Did you have put things prepared? Yeah, I just, yeah. And then yeah. And then, and then I moved to New York to do comedy and I was, I crashed my mode. I had a little scooter, a Yamaha Zuma and I crashed it cause I would drive drunk all the time. I was my happy place. Like to this day I really was honestly that feeling, I'm like driving wasted on a scooter was the wind blowing the air. Cause you're not wearing a helmet. You think about them,

Speaker 3:          00:23:33       you don't really think you can kill anybody else. So it's not that bad. A drive drunk.

Speaker 4:          00:23:38       Yeah. But you can, you can get in the way of someone else or do anything. I fucked myself up so bad. I woke up, just had blacked out completely. My face was split open. I had road rash all over my tests. This was father's Day, 2008 you don't remember falling? I don't, didn't all I remembered. I just remembered like little pieces. I remembered that someone helped me. I woke up, I was living at my friend's house. I woke up at the house. He was staying at his girlfriend's house. So I was there alone, but my chin was split open. I've been wearing a dress and it looked like I, my throat had been slit. Like there was just blood all the way down it, road rash all over my tits, all over this side of my arms, my knees. Like I just was fucked up, just face, split open.

Speaker 4:          00:24:18       I just, I went, I peeled out and like just went chin first and everything. And then I remembered that someone who didn't, a girl that didn't like me had helped me. That's all I could remember. It was someone who usually hated me, helped me. Wow. And then, so I went out, I went to the hospital, I called my roommate, he came back, um, I went to the hospital. They gave, I got nine stitches and I was still wasted and I was still so hammered and the doctor kept going, were you drinking? And I kept going just between us. And he's like, yeah. And I went, nope. They're like, I'm not gonna fucking jail. You motherfucker. I was like, no, I just crashed my scooter. It's crazy. He didn't know that I didn't wake up to drink through the pain. So, um, so then I got the stitches and I was friends with all the cops in Santa Fe cause I was an alcoholic.

Speaker 4:          00:25:00       So that's a really good plan. You gotta befriend them so they don't arrest you. And uh, they had told me if they had caught me cause I ended up finding my scooter on the side of the road. My friend drove me around. So I found out where I had peeled out and there was like a bunch of loose gravel. So I just peeled out on the gravel and the cops said that they would have arrested me for an Agora aggravated DUI because I hurt myself. I'd injured myself. That's what an aggravated DUI, that's what they said back then. I mean I was still wasted when they said that. That's worse if you hurt yourself. Yeah. Cause I had to go to the hospital and stuff. You would think you got a little punishment in there. Yeah. So then I didn't learn the lesson. I went out drinking that night with the stitches in my face and I had, my line was I would carry neosporin around and ask guys if they wanted to rub neosporin on my titties.

Speaker 4:          00:25:47       Like almost lost a nipple. I mean it got so close. Yeah. I looked crazy, but I was drunk. So I was like, whew, fun girl. Yet they still call me fun girl, Andy behind my back. And I thought they were, I thought it was like a cool, I didn't realize they're making fun of all cheese. So anyway, uh, so then I went out that night and I saw this guy with a puppy and I started playing with the puppy and I was like, oh your puppy, so cute. And he goes, do not remember me. And I'm like, I've never met you before. He goes, last night I helped you, you crashed your scooter. And I was like, Oh fuck. And he's like, I ride a motorcycle. So I didn't want to call the cops or anything cause I know you would've gotten in trouble. And there was like, who helped me?

Speaker 4:          00:26:22       And he's like some girl. So then my friend called me, he's like, my boss told me. So it was my friend's boss from this hotel that used to get wasted at, he was the bartender. So she hated me because I would just go get hammered at their nice establishment. Do you look back on those days with any fondness because you're sober? No, you're all, I'm clean. Yeah, I mean I think I have a wealth of stories. I was a juvenile delinquent and I had so many childhood traumas and abuses and weird things that happen. I was running for my life in Jersey City when I was 15 from like a fake modeling agent who was like a six foot eight drag queen named Mahogany running for my life, trying to hide so long. I just have a lot of stories and not a story. You can brush what happened.

Speaker 4:          00:27:04       You were 15 so I was, I had gone to Mahogany yet, so I had gone to John Robert Powers Modeling School, one of those like fake modeling schools and it's you pay like 200 bucks and they make look a compilation headshot. Yeah. You like go, they give you classes and modeling. Like that's a thing. It's like you either like are weirdly weird looking alien, hot and tall and skinny or not. Yeah. Or you're not. I mean I maybe could have done commercials or something. I was cute, but I, I also had very low self esteem. It was just such a weird, it was such a weird thing to be doing. So, um, and I had been a Tom boy up until that point. So we go, I go to this modeling thing and then we went to paid more money to go to like a modeling convention and then they had actual modeling agencies and then they had just random people that I get paid to be there.

Speaker 4:          00:27:54       So mahogany was one of them. And my mom's like super liberal and so she likes anything that's like a little on the fringe that she could brag about it or book club or whatever. If that sounds like I'm angry, I'm not angry. Forgiven. But um, so they ended up, they were like, we want to take your daughter for two weeks and we'll send her out on auditions and stuff over spring break. And we have this nice place in Jersey. Teen. Yeah. Your mom let Mahogany take you for so many more stories. Joe. Jesus fucking Christ. Yeah, no, there was, my mother did not have anything bad happened to her when she was growing up. She was adopted by a very nice family and she went to a nice boarding school and stuff and nothing happened to her. And she read the newspaper. She didn't read the newspaper.

Speaker 4:          00:28:41       I don't think much. So she, it just, she didn't, she wasn't aware. So anyway, so then, okay, so I was, I went to this place in Jersey City and Jersey City. I don't know how it is now, but it was fucking crazy back then. It's still fucked. It was fucking crazy. So we were in this one little condo and it was Mahogany and then there was like some other people that were there. None of us were really that, I mean I probably was like the hottest, but I was pretty raw. I mean, I don't know. I think I was cute. I don't think I was like, uh, I don't think I was a model and I, I don't think that was my future. Maybe I could've done something, but I'm, the only person that I had really bonded with was this 23 year old Guy Chris, who was this black guy from, I dunno where he was from, but he was really cool.

Speaker 4:          00:29:30       He was really nice and he was a little creepy. Like he would say things like if I was your age, but he never was trying to fuck me or anything, but he kind of was protecting me and at some point Mahogany got mad. There was, it was fake. Like I would just, he would make me go buy him weed on the corner and stuff and it's just a fake thing. My parents paid like $1,500 to send me to this thing and he would, I think he sent me out to be a, I had to go into New York by myself on the train at 15 wearing the sluttiest clothes ever to this thing to, and then he would tell me, pretend you're lie and say you're 21 to be an extra on like sex in the city and stuff. It just wasn't real. There was nothing real about, it was a total scam.

Speaker 4:          00:30:09       So I was starting to catch onto that and I was supposed to be there for maybe 10 days, I think. And they'd, these next door neighbors, shorty, this little Puerto Rican lady, she was away. I smoked blunts with her. But um, so this guy, Chris was kind of protected me and he would go into the city with me and then all of a sudden mahogany didn't like how close we were. So he separated us and he said, you can't see each other anymore. And I was like, well, I don't feel safe if I can't talk to this guy. Just would rather go home. I want to call my parents. I don't think this is real. This seems like bullshit and a scam. And he was like, you can't talk to your parents. And he locked the door and took the phone away from him. So I packed all my shit up and I threw it out the window and I yelled down to shorty.

Speaker 4:          00:30:46       I was like, Yo, I'm going to run. So grabbed my shit. And then the guy, one of the other kids that was staying at the modeling place knew the situation. So he went down and bumped into the door, unlocked it without him noticing and distracted him. And I just jetted out of the fucking house and he started chasing me. I was like screaming. I was like, call the cops, help me, help me. And I was wearing a tube top. My like 15 year old titties. I had nipple rings were like hanging out. I mean, I looked like a prostitute. The cops ended up coming and they thought I was a prostitute. Mahogany got me. At one point I was hiding under cars for my life. Like I thought I was going to get killed. I was like screaming. People were just watering their plants. Like what the fuck on the Lakers cars?

Speaker 4:          00:31:22       Yeah. Cause he was chasing me. So I was trying to hide and he finally got me was like, get in the hat like you're ruining my scam pretty much. And then he scratched my arm, but that's all. And then the cops came and arrested. Both of us thought he was my pimp. I thought I was a prostitute. I come from like a, like a [inaudible] when you came home? Um, well they came to the cops and then the cops told them that they should arrest my parents. They were like, we should. And I think they just were in denial about it or whatever for a day at least. Yeah. They didn't. And then more stuff happened after that. They'd made more mistakes. Yeah. But it's okay. We all make mistakes. I love my family. They're good now. But I also look at all these things. No, I really like have had to do a lot of work on it because to forgive them.

Speaker 4:          00:32:07       Yeah. Because, well I blame myself for all of it, for most of it, which was my defense mechanism. Like the stuff I had some stuff happened with a teacher in high school to him right after that. Actually it was about six months after that happened and uh, you know, was a therapy session. I don't want to do a therapy session. I don't want to do that. But anyway, you had asked me about am I happy about these things? And so I'm coming to it. But the point that I'm coming to is I am happy with them. I'm so happy with like where my life is now that I can't be mad about any of these other things. Do you know what I mean? Like they're, they're

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       like exciting and now they're funny cause I didn't get heard. That's what I'm saying. Like looking back on the fucking hilarious. Yeah, there's some crazy shit. There's some romance to it if you're [inaudible] I flashed a chain gang once on my motor scooter and then it didn't start and I had to like put my shirt down and keep bogging it. Like it's hilarious. I did crazy shit and I came out like genuinely I feel good, you know, I'm happy with my life. So it's good. Thank you for getting that. Getting me off of that path. But well it's just everyone that I know that's funny is fucked up and had something go wrong. Just that's how, and it's like how you get through it and then your insight into it on the other end you persevere and then you don't blame people. You don't let go around being mad at the world.

Speaker 2:          00:33:24       I think it's, it's easier to be, um, I don't know. It's just some of the most hilarious people did blame people. Yeah. Cause that's Kennison Kennison was always, you know, screaming about his ex wives. Yeah, no, that's true. That's funny too. I just, for my own personal sanity cannot run around angry at everyone. Well you don't need to be, I mean it's not necessary. And especially now that you're sober, which obviously [inaudible] had never got, he uh, was friends with them? No, no, never. No, never met him. Saw Him, saw him live a few times once, uh, once at work. Once when I was working I was working at a great woods, um, center for the performing arts and it's like a amphitheater in Mansfield doing sun fall kicks. No security. Oh cool. Yeah. And I got to see Cosby there, Rodney Dangerfield cause see a few people. Did you want to do comedy yet?

Speaker 2:          00:34:20       Um, I was 19. I probably had thought about it a little bit. You know, maybe, maybe it had been in my head like slightly, but I didn't really start thinking about it until I was like 20. And you feel embarrassed when you had that thought at first of doing comedy? No, but I did feel like it was preposterous. I did feel like, um, look, it's such a difficult way to make it. Like I remember my girlfriend when I was 21, her dad was mocking this idea that I was going to be a comedian. Like I remember him saying, well, you know, the odds were not in your favor. No, they're not in anybody's favor. But I remembered that's what he was saying. You know that like who makes it, how many people make it as a kid and even if you do make and how much money do you make?

Speaker 2:          00:35:08       He was a doctor. That's so funny. He was really angry. Like he just felt like I was a waste of his daughter. It's really funny cause he's still alive. Let's get him on the podcast. It's probably not, you know, doctors don't live that long. A lot of them died. That was so, it was sad when he died. I was like, I trusted you. Well there's a great book called dead doctors don't lie, but this guy, Joel Wallach and what a lot of it has to do with nutrition and it's about mineral deficiencies and vitamin deficiencies and doctors who abuse drugs. And I'm essentially

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       talking about how people rely on doctors for advice about health, when in reality doctors are good at very specific things. Like if you're a podiatrist, you're good at fixing feet. If you're a, you know, an orthopedic surgeon, you're good at knees and shoulders and shit, but you probably don't know a fuck load about nutrition and you really don't understand like the mechanisms of the body's absorptions of nutrients and minerals and vitamins. And one of the things that I've learned from doing this podcast is to understand that even like when I, the cursory understanding of it that I have, you have to go through fucking hours and hours and hours of reading and watching documentaries and listening to experts and I still have to go back over and over and over it again. So I've talked to doctors before and they'd been like super dismissive about even taking vitamins and I get angry at them.

Speaker 3:          00:36:23       I'm like, well, I think all you need is a balanced diet. I'm like, well, you're retarded. Like what are you talking about? That's it. And by that way, I don't mean someone with downs syndrome that is a retarded way in slow down. You are your, you have a diminished capacity for advancement. You are slowing down the reality of the progress of nutritional science. This is a stupid thing you're doing right now and giving me bad advice. You really don't know what the fuck you're talking about. I get angry. I'm like, why would you say that? Like this is dumb. Don't tell me that there's no benefit to taking vitamins when there's a fucking ass load of studies. There's data and science and it's all proven. [inaudible] spent thousands of hours researching this stuff and trying to figure out what the fuck is good for you and what's not good for you and some Chubby asshole with a fucking skinny fat body is telling me that all you need is a balanced diet.

Speaker 3:          00:37:13       I'm like, bitch, what's your diet? You ain't got a balanced diet that they're just doing that because they don't get money out of there, out of the vitamins. No, no. They don't have. It's not feel like reading up on the new stuff, but they haven't. They haven't decided to pursue it. That's all it is. I mean, and if they did pursue it, they'd realize it's a fucking bottomless pit of information from essential fatty acids to different kinds of proteins and absorption of plant based proteins versus animal based proteins. What's the benefit of grass fed beef over regular B? It's a fucking endless stream of, yeah, I mean if you follow someone like Dr Rhonda Patrick, you realize really quickly that she is in the heart of this shit 24 hours a day, seven days a week and she's still learning things net. It never ends. It never ends.

Speaker 3:          00:37:54       I mean we, we, and also it varies. What's good for you is not necessarily good for me. Your Diet might not be as effective as my Diomede elk cause that bad. That's good. That's good for everybody. It is alk all day. Turn you into a fucking savage. I'll give you this fucking elk. Give you some, I got it. I got some waiting for fanny pack and some Goddamn alk. That's what kind of a cooking set up do you have at your place? I just have just a stove with frying pan, like cast iron frying pan. I do. I have to know how to cook. You could cook. I'm all right. Decent. Okay. I'm decent. I'll hook you up with some elk sausage. We'll start with that. I'll give you a recipe how to cook it correctly. Do you have a thermometer? Um, I'm really into, I'm really into, um, big foot porn. Can you not say

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       elk sausage in front of me? Yeah. Um, I don't have a meat thermometer. No. Well that's good for elk sausage. It's fine. And you'll, you'll get a sense of when it's going to leave. You want want line me? Y, Y, y n cause I didn't get to a quick, when you're talking about choke sausage, Bro, I'm sorry I'm insulting or no, it's just big foot dick elk sausage. I don't know why I wouldn't draw those two. I wouldn't pull those together. Why you wouldn't, yeah. Why W why would I not have one of them as a undulate? The other one is a legendary primate. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:39:09       You're ever really getting stuck in semantics here. Listen, you're the one who cracked the joke. Let me just make some fucking jokes. I just got accused of doing a therapy session and now I'm telling jokes, I'm feeling triggered. Are you feeling judged? No. No, but I'm, I'm not feeling judged, but everybody that I know that has had those wild drunken days, it has come out on the other sides. There's something like nostalgic about it. Like you look back and you go, Huh, I made it through that. Have you been to an AA meeting? You can't. It's like the good old times and AA or I always felt like people were either telling these stories that were so insane. I was like, I'm not an alcoholic. Or they were like, I was like, let's put Shit, you know, get outta here. You don't even cool enough to be here.

Speaker 2:          00:39:54       Like celebrity rehab. Right. Did you ever watch that show? One of the best parts about it was Eric Roberts. Julia Roberts brothers has been a bunch of movies. He, uh, was there for weed addiction. Yeah. And everybody else was having the fucking d dts or on the floor in the fetal position shaking. He's reading the paper [inaudible] Shit. Cause on a treadmill, it's so ridiculous. Like some people, you know their stories are a joke. I did quit smoking weed and it did make things a lot easier, like laundry, just little things. I was like, oh that was maybe making things. I would always smoke weed before I cleaned my apartment and I was like seven years to get my apartment. Glenn. Yeah, it can get distracting. It doesn't, it does not affect me. Well yeah. Well when I do things like if I want to clean my office, I just have like a thing, like this is what we're doing now.

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       And I had her all, even listening to music is not good. I find that I used to listen to podcasts while I clean my office, but then I find that I would be like pausing and listening to a particular part and then I'd want to rewind it. I'm like, Oh, I'm fucking with myself here. I'm distracting myself. And then that's a weird defense mechanism too. Cause I do that all the time too. I'm always multitasking and I always have to be doing three things at once. It's like why? Cause it's gonna make me, I'm gonna slow down so much. I might have to like deal with them. Yeah. So like writing to like sometimes I write listening to music, but most of the time it's better without music. With lyrics. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes lyrics and sometimes foreign music I like foreign music is, I don't know what they're saying.

Speaker 2:          00:41:20       What kind Brazilian. Oh. Like a lot of Brazilian music. I look a lot of Spanish music, Bollywood or what? I listen to some of that dollar men day. Do you know dollar Bandanas? No, you don't. No dollar now. Oh he's amazing. It's really cool. I just listened to, I listened to a lot of Elton John. That's what I'm into right now. That's why I like to wear all my crazy things too. Like to Elton John. That shit put you some dollar Mindy here. Play it on my phone. She didn't. We get banned 100%. 100%. Why it's gotten before. Even if we have, cause you can't, how do you spell his name? D a. There it is. Dollar Mindy. Um, what does this say? The song is not currently available in your country or region. Oh my God, I love it. And now I'm really into it and I want that shit. What is that? Oh, here it goes. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:42:15       we can't hear. We can't hear. We can't hear. We can't hear. That's actually a woman getting fucked by big firm. The Guy Yelling. Yes. Wow. Okay. Welcome to the wonderful world of the Internet. Um, anyway, I like dollar Mindy. It sounds cool, but this is named dollar d a. H. Hold on. I would like to better if it was like the [inaudible] l. E r m e. H. N. D. I, but I think he got arrested for human trafficking. But can you still like his work? That's a problem. Like I was at a Dave Chappelle and I did some shows the other day, DJ and the DJ was playing all this, uh, Michael Jackson music and uh, he is so good. Yeah, he's great. Go. He's a fucking pedophile. Allegedly. Most likely. Yeah, pretty. Probably. Definitely did something wrong. Yeah. Even though it's still fucking great. Yeah. But also he's dead. Yeah. So what if you don't listen to his music, you're punishing?

Speaker 2:          00:43:19       What are you punishing? Okay. The man's dead bright. But even if he wasn't dead, like if Ted Bundy had some great poetry, would you want to read it? Would you enjoy it? Um, no. I don't create it. Probably not. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I really don't know what Michael Jackson did. I don't know. And I don't think anybody does other than the snow. He did it too, but there's a lot of fucking weirdness to it for sure. Yeah. Hands with little boys. And I know it's really uncomfortable, just like inappropriate boundaries. And that's enough to like Molesta Kit. Honestly, just having that inappropriate listen blurred thing between kids and grownups. That's not good. Yeah. You hold hands with your nieces and nephews and that makes sense. Your children, that makes sense. But if you're a 55 year old man and you're holding hands with 11 year old boy in Dubai, yeah, that's where I gotta get. I gotta get suspicious. I got a question whether I'm going to enjoy this song that I'm enjoying right now. I want to be. It's done. It's done. It's done. It's so good. I was listening to the music. I was like, God damn, this guy was amazing. Yeah. So except there's no way he wasn't molested. I mean, it doesn't, he seem so molested. Well, um, in the interest of being beaten a fucking dead horse.

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       I have talked about this many times in the podcast where I think that he was a cast trato, which is someone who was castrated when he was very young to preserve his high pitched voice. Then his doctor, the same doctor that killed him, came out later. This is long after I'd predicted this and said that he was chemically castrated to preserve his voice. So he, he confirmed what I was saying. Now whether this doctor's telling the truth is castration. Are you not able to get a boner? I don't believe so. Um, oh my God. So he maybe was him less than them, but he was just, he could have been just being weird with them. I don't know who, maybe didn't do anything with them. Maybe he just wanted to be a child. Maybe his childhood was stripped from him because he was famous from the time he was five fucking years old and his father did something to definitely was a weird life.

Speaker 3:          00:45:18       According to the doctor, his d, His father did did something to him, like chemical castration is what they do. That pedophiles, they'll do it to pedophiles so that they can never get erections. And it basically stops your body's production of testosterone and kills your testes. And they do it with some, some chemical injection. And apparently according to the doctor, that's what they did to Michael Jackson, which you think about his voice. It makes sense because his voice was insane. It was so high pitched. And if you listen to like ca Strados, those a, there's, there's only a few recordings of actual Chris throttles. But it was a common practice. Not Common. Most everybody did it, but it was a practice that was done to young boys to preserve their high pitched voice where they're at fucking cast rate and what a word, horrible cause strata. But they did it. I mean, people would let their children get their balls chopped off, can sing good, and they would, you know, it'd be very valuable too. How long ago was that? Well, there's a recording, so the recording, I don't think they had recordings until like the late 18 hundreds I don't believe when there was a lot of dance dancing last one 1922 1922 is the last Castrato recording. And how old was that dude? So he's probably born in the 18 hundreds or something died in that same year. So that's, but it's, he died. Never nothing but always. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:50       Have you ever heard the voice of an angel and the, we can't play that either, right? No. You should listen to it though. We'll, I'll play it upsetting. It's upsetting. It is upsetting. It's haunting. Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can enjoy that. Yeah. I played it for a friend of mine the other night and he was like, what? And I was like, look, you got to listen to this. And I played, he's like, is that fucking real? And he's like, it sounds like like someone who like did something to somebody and you're like, oh, maybe people show jerk off to it to like an honor of the man was 63 when he died in 1922 he was born in 1958 and those recordings, 1851 and 1902 to 1904 so that makes them forties he was in his forties when you say Lord knows you said 1958 you mean he was born

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       in 1858 and 58 when he was born, I'm sorry. Yeah. And died in 1922 wow. Yeah, that's the whole thing's dark. The look you gave me during my circle jerk idea was [inaudible] we'll look, I'll you, you gave me a come on bitch circle jerk for the, I was saying it to [inaudible] he couldn't come. Look, you're projecting. Listen, I know this is uncomfortable for you and you're nervous to be here, but I'm your friend and I love you and I want you to be happy. I'm not looking at trip. Come up the king. You know I love you. I know. I love you too. Thank you so much for having me. I really do appreciate it. I am trying to be chill. It's just like a cool weirded out by this, by being here. I'm not weirded out. I'm trying to be in the moment. I like to be funny impulsively like it's my impulse to always like tell jokes and stuff and this is a more like chill, less jokey.

Speaker 4:          00:48:22       You could be jokey now there's pressure to be joking. You're overthinking this shit. Too much overthinking anything. I'm being chill in normal. Everyone. Two Cups of coffee, cups of coffee. One's calling me a con. What is a one of them? One of them is cave man. What's the other one? This is caveman and this is a cunt mug. I got it from my dad and I got one for myself to got it for your dad. He has a joke. Well, my dad and I, it also looks like it says aunt. We one time, uh, we went to, we were at the post office. My Dad's very funny. He reminds me of caddy. Daddy actually the, Oh, really? Held down against thing. By the way, that fucking thing is hilarious that you guys are doing. It's fun. Yeah. We recorded one and then, uh, it just wasn't funny.

Speaker 4:          00:49:08       It wasn't, we'd have to rethink it. Don't want to put out, we don't want to disappoint with Capitol one. You did do the one you did put it out was hilarious. Yeah, that was fun. Yeah. He's so funny. He's hilarious. But, um, so my dad and I were at the post office and mailing something out and I was taking a while to mail something out and just were just jokingly antagonistic. You know, my dad's like, come on. I was like, Dad, leave me alone. I'm not done. You know, we're just joking with each other. Right. And this old woman who's been observing, she goes to leave and then she just pivots before she leaves and turns around. She goes, she goes, you know what young lady, you're a real itch, itch, itch. And my dad goes, I think he mean an end, which is fucking one of our best stories.

Speaker 4:          00:49:50       My Daddy's funny. So she doesn't realize, you're just joking around. She didn't get, we were just joking. She was like, Oh, you're being sewn. And it's like, did you tell her, Hey, this is my dad. We're just joking around. My Dad said she's an aunt and we laughed. So I think she got up. Yeah. Well she was leaving when he said, yeah, we just worked with like crying. And the fact that someone really needs to stump you and put you in your place. Yeah. It's just so silly, but it's like she was old. What does she know? Ah, I'm sure. I'm just going to try really hard to not be one of those old people. What do you think you're going to be like as an old lady? I'm going to peak. I'm excited. Well, I'm trying really hard to, I'm trying really hard to be in the moment and appreciate each new age and not get anything in my face or anything like that.

Speaker 4:          00:50:31       And just sitting in your face while, you know, except come shots obviously. No, I'm in like a, you know? Oh you, I don't, yeah, I'll try not to do anything too crazy. It's just, it's fighting an inevitable thing. And I think it's a gift to age. You know, we get to be different every day. My mom was a, she worked at, uh, this organization called Gray Panthers, which can cause for old people, old people that like to fuck. I mean, I'm sure they like to fuck. But Maggie Kuhn, Maggie coon was the woman's name, which I know there's a little bit of a parallel between gray panthers, Black Panthers, her last name is [inaudible], but it was spelled differently. Um, but so she was this, it was in Philadelphia and she was, uh, she liked [inaudible] was 90, maybe 89, but we used to hang out with her all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:51:17       And she had dated, famously dated like a 40 year old, I think in her eighties or something hollow. So I think she was fucking pegging him. She might've been pegging him. I don't know if she could peg at that point. She had a lot of hats and a lot of cats down. He could peg. Oh, he can peg himself. Remember Elizabeth Taylor? It was like she married a series of gay guys before she died. Oh yeah. Yeah. That happens really pretty old ladies that you know, they just want a man to tell them they're beautiful. I've been just showered with compliments by gay men. Yeah. I think they go through menopause too and they probably give up on the idea of sex. They just want pretty men around them. Yeah. I mean not that her gays were that pretty. I've had prettier gays. I've definitely been the law. I've been the last post for a couple guys.

Speaker 4:          00:52:02       The last post before gay. Yeah. Where I'm like, and then one guy had got married and shit. I was sure he was. I sure I was sure it was his last. Listen, just because you got married doesn't mean he's not good. Yeah, that's a good point. I know. Did he guys would read gay men would reach out to him. They would try to touch him and he's always wearing a suit. We lived in Santa Fe. I'm like, where am I going to suit? Like slap their hands. I'm like, not until he comes out here. I knew. I mean I was like, there's no way. He used to always want to have like threesomes with other guys. Like there was always, I remember we invited my one friend and we were just drinking so much. We call it a, we called Jack Daniels o j so we didn't feel weird and more like past the OJ, we're just like fucking shit faced all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:52:39       Shuggie [inaudible] went to this college, what? My college and I'm going out of business, just this little school in Santa Fe just hammered. And uh, my friend who I worked at a restaurant with a guy friend, he wanted to hug, hook up with me and he's like sweet. So he like hops into bed with us and then he leaves the next day. He's like, he kept looking me in the eye and he kept looking at me. He kept trying to make eye contact with me. So he was bone in you and you, your boyfriend was like, I don't know if he ended up owning me. I think he would just, he hopped in the hopped out pretty quick. What does that mean? Cause he got freaked out cause he kept looking at him. I don't know if it actually, I mean we were in full black lights at that point.

Speaker 4:          00:53:16       I don't remember. I really feel like I'm five years younger than I am because I just blacked out five years. You should write about those days. I don't know. This book, there were so many. I have so many crazy stories and it's funny because I always thought everyone else had them. I really thought everyone else had this crate. I'm like, you didn't steal cars when you were little. Like you didn't do all these things that never happened to you. Have you thought about writing a book? Yeah, but that'd be, it's also a great glide comedy writing act. Yeah, I know. I want to tell these stories on stage to the more flashing. The changing was, I mean there's just been so many. I drew some pictures I draw too, so I've been drawn in a while, but I drew like a coloring book once that I never followed through with, but it was a lesson from a Chubby alcoholic and it was just different, like true scenes from my drinking days.

Speaker 4:          00:54:02       Just fucking crazy. This shit I did. So how did you stop? I will tell you, that actually brings me back to Tate. So I moved to New York. I wanted to do standup so bad. I'd just done that one thing at the cowgirl in Santa Fe and I liked it. I really, I was nervous and I don't remember. I'm sure it was like all abortion jokes. I don't really remember. But then I do remember my first set after that. Um, I remember all the beginning ones. So the first one was when I got to New York, I moved to New York to do standup. I crashed my scooter, so I wanted to move to la. I had met people out in La and I thought that was where I wanted to go. But because I kept drinking and driving, I was like, oh, I have a drinking and driving problem.

Speaker 4:          00:54:39       I have to go somewhere where I can't drive. So I moved to New York, thank God, because I think I really, I think it helped me really push and get really strong before I came out here. So I moved to New York. I wanted to do standup. I was just drinking, I was partying. I have so many friends I just met on benders, like random shit. I was just doing insane things, day drinking, just way more drunk than everyone else. My, I left my drinking buddies in Santa Fe and everyone else was kind of like, what are you up to? So I was staying on my friend's couch and I wanted to do stand up. And so finally she was like, look, um, let's just go to an open mic. I'll go with you. And I was like, all right. So I got all my jokes ready. We go to an open Mike.

Speaker 4:          00:55:18       Um, I go up, I dropped my setlist and then I completely black out. I'm so nervous. I'm like in this basement at this place called cake shop. Um, my friend Caper lamp was the host of it or was she the host yet? I don't know. Anyway, I got up on stage and completely bombed. Just started yelling at everyone. I just started yelling at all of these comics like, fuck you. He pieces a shit. Like I don't know what happened. And then I sat down at the bar and I'd already quit Jaeger. Jaeger was the first thing I quit. So I was sitting at the bar and some guy came up, this comic who I did not like or think was funny or want anything to do with, and he kept buying me drinks. He was buying me shots of Yeager and I was like, look man, I'm like struggling with drinking.

Speaker 4:          00:55:58       I really like, I can't really say no to a drink, but please stop buying them from me. And he just kept buying them like I just was, you know, I wasn't going to stop. And so he kept buying them. And then so then I ended up waking up on his air mattress. Is that for my first [inaudible], waking up his air mattress fully clothed. That didn't fuck him or anything. Just like trap somewhere in Bushwick. It was snowing. I was like, where am I? What am I doing? I looked around his apartment. I'm like, all I want to do is be a comedian. I was so sure that's what I wanted to do. I was spending all this time drinking, getting fucked out. Second set. This was my second. Yeah. This was what I had moved to New York was my first one in New York. What made you so sure that you wanted to be a comedian?

Speaker 4:          00:56:35       I just never wanted to do anything else. And when I think, but you only had one set at a karaoke bar and then the second set where you screamed and told everybody to fuck off. What was it that made you think that you could do it? Um, I just, I don't know. I just never wanted to do anything else. I just didn't have another, there was no other plan. I had been a special ed teacher. I had done a Gogo dance. I'd worked at the bars, I'd done all that stuff. I just never, I just always, I just felt like if I could do it, I could do it. I mean, I guess it's that little bit of that delusion and that, but I just, I never, but I knew that I wouldn't be able to do, I knew there were obstacles in my way and I knew that drinking was one of them.

Speaker 4:          00:57:10       I had talked to a comic before, uh, that sat at the open mic and he had said, just try not to, his advice to me was try not to hook up with the, with the guys that open my ex because you're gonna get a reputation when you're just trying to be respected. So he had said that to me. I think it was great advice because it's also, there is no time for that. This was my whole hustle also. What are the odds that person's going to fall through a few fall through and become a comic? What are the odds that they are? Yeah, you might get hitched up to some fucking loser. Yeah. You definitely don't want to get hit shot. But it also was, I needed to put all my energy. I was in an m s barely in a place now to be in a relationship. So it's like, this was 11 years ago.

Speaker 4:          00:57:45       So I, um, I, I, when I woke up on that guys air mattress, I was like, fuck. Like I already broke the thing that I wanted to do and I was already, you know, from all my, like weird sexual assault stuff when I was younger. I just didn't have a good relationship with sex. Drinking, didn't help with it, you know, everything was just out of control and all, and I had this thing now this like precious thing that I want so bad. So, you know, crashing my scooter, almost dying all that shit. Nah, it wasn't enough, but stand up really was, that's what I wanted. So I went to my friend's house and I called Tate, I just called [inaudible]. I was like, I got to, I just want to do this and I want to quit drinking. And so he told me to go to meetings and just cha try it out.

Speaker 4:          00:58:30       Do you remember your first meeting? Yeah, I went to one, I think it was the lower east side and the guy sharing was talking about, he's like, I always knew I had a problem because I, I, when I was two, I took all of the Tylenol and I was like, what are you talking about? Any kid with a childproof thing is just gonna eat the pills. I remember kind of judging him and being like, whatever. But it was good to have that community then because I needed to detach myself from like the partiers and all that lifestyle. So I did go to, I did 1998 at a meeting every day for 90 days and then I never went back. Some people actually learn how to do stand up from those meetings. There was a gun, I mean, not a bomb. There was a guy named Dave Fitzgerald who was a really funny comedian back in Boston and um, he learned how to do stand up from making hilarious stories out of his drunk days cause he, he was a fucking raging alcohol. The same thing, just quit and then started

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       doing, stand up and literally learned how to do a family meeting. Cause he would tell these crazy stories about being blacked out, drunk and fucked up and being at gun fights, you know, high speed chases and all this nuts had alcohol to shed. Crazy stuff goes down. Yeah. But those guys, many of them learn how to do stand up. You're standing up in front of an audience. I was brought up Quaker too, so our church was, you stand up and speak and everyone just sits there in silence and watches it. Yeah. What's that like? Which one's Quaker? That's the oats box. [inaudible] box. Everyone's like gets a confused with Amish, which has nothing to do with Amish. The difference. It's just a very chill Christianity. So it's, those are the pilgrims. The fist. Quakers. No, I don't think they were. They were, um, when do Quakers and start, I don't ask sophists.

Speaker 2:          01:00:04       They're, they're pacifists. They believe that God's in the form of an inner light that's in everyone and everything. So why would you fight? I mean I agree with that just from hallucinogen and shit too. But, um, it's something I struggle with. Like I have to look back at, you know, childhood predators and I'm like, can I, I have to forgive these people because they are from the same light. I guess. What is the, what's the wacky thing Quakers? Quakers are, well, it's just very, it's just, you sit in silence. So the churches, there's two types. There's programmed and unprogrammed I was unprogrammed, which is the super chill one. There's no bible talk. There's no preacher. There's nothing. You just sit in benches facing each other. My meeting house had these old creaky explain. What are you talking about? So it's like a, it's a meeting house that you meet up with the onset on Sundays.

Speaker 2:          01:00:47       Yeah. You look down at your hands, you don't really look at each other, but you, you sit, there's facing benches and then there's, you know, benches here. So you are kind of all looking at it. You're facing each other. And what do you do? You sit in silence and then if you feel moved to speak, it's supposed to be God speaking to you, but if you just feel moved to speak at all, you just stand up and you say whatever you want. Wow. And so you don't reading scripture. I mean, some people, every once in a while someone would do that. Growing up, I went to a Quaker school too, and we were little kids. We used to have to sit in silence for like 45 minutes, which was impossible. It's such bad 80 dude. It was insane. I would wear shirts that had like things on it.

Speaker 2:          01:01:21       I could play with. Like I had a shirt with a phone and it had like a cord and I would just wear it and I would set alarms and set on my alarm so it wouldn't go off. I just had to be doing stuff. It was crazy. You're just so little and you're just sitting there. So bored. Little incense, so bored, you know? And what's the first thing they do? They try to medicate them because they're so bored. Well, I got medicated to Ritalin and stuff. Oh No. But when I was older, I don't feel like it affected me. They put me on antidepressants a little bit, but I was pretty good at being like, I don't want to do these things. Don't feel like it affected you to be why stolen. But I didn't take it for that long. How long did it take it for? I Dunno. I don't think I took it for that. Allie Makowski Duh. She was talking about it last night. I love her. Love her too. She was telling us about how that same shit happened to her when she was kid. Yeah. Bouncing off the walls and the Medicaid you, yeah. It's so, it is interesting cause it is. I can only imagine what it's like to be a parent. You just, there's all this information coming at you and you're

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       dealing with your own shit. And a lot of people didn't go through their healing process or anything to, it's, it must be so hard to be a parent. It's just gotta be crazy. I think about it. I never wanted to have a kid until I did some hallucinogens and then I was like, maybe I want to have a kid. You'd be a great mom. Yeah, I think I would, but I'm just dealing with all my heel. I'm dealing with all my, I just want to make sure I'm not in a place. I was very angry in the past and it's something that I work on a lot. I just wouldn't want to redo patterns and stuff like that. But I do think because I've had, I had such traumatic stuff, I think I would be, I think I could protect my kids in a good way.

Speaker 4:          01:02:53       And Quakers are allowed to medicate their kids. It's part of the doctrine. Yeah, you can, there's no dye. I mean it's pretty loose. It's like you can do whatever you want. There was one guy that wore his like Jewish stuff to a meeting. Uh, well I went to meeting after the election. I want a little bit. I was like, maybe I want to go back to the church. The Quaker church. Yeah. I just feel doesn't 16 yeah. Cause I just was, it just triggered a lot of things in me and, and uh, I went real crazy for a second. I just had a lot of trauma that I wasn't dealing when Trump won. It wasn't, this is embarrassing. Okay. I was hanging out with a lot of, anyway, what happened? I just got really like, I got really mad. I don't know, I got really mad.

Speaker 4:          01:03:29       I just wasn't, I wasn't um, dealing with stuff and it just kind of pushed all this stuff forward for me. And also, what do you mean? But just like some sexual assault stuff just came up. Like I think a lot of people that were angry and were marching around and stuff were, had some personal triggers that had happened for them because of like the grab them by the Pussy and then you read it and then I read up on it and it's not what it seems. And I don't know, I just, I, you know, there was a lot of hysteria and it just trigger, it just triggered a lot of my shit. But I'm glad it did because it helped me get through a lot of stuff. And I definitely, I think have a different view on those things now. And I, you know, I was running around so mad at who I'm like, who am I mad at?

Speaker 4:          01:04:16       I did a lot of, like, when it first happened, I was like, fuck man, I did that for about three months. Thank God I got out of that. But really angry and just projecting and pissed and all this stuff. And it's like, there's a few, there's a few men, I'm at it right. There's a few, I'm certainly not mad at men, but there are a few from your past. Yeah. You know, and that was something I had to deal with and I had to learn to compartmentalize that and not make it this broad thing. I hate when people do that. So upsetting the drinking days, the drinking days, and from my childhood, you know, I had, I had some fucked up, shit happened. But you know, it, it's, you can't, it's just important to, for me to not blame a large group of people that have nothing to do with my trauma. And it's also when I get triggered, what I needed to learn was that's my responsibility to handle my trigger. And I can't just be running around like this, like unsheathed sword. I mean, I can, I'm going to cut everyone around me. You're the thing that people do when they blame everyone that's part of that group. You know, it's so common and it's so, you remember, uh, there

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       was a real problem a few months back where Liam Neeson, uh, was talking about one of his friends that had gotten something that happened where, uh, a black, I had done something murdered. One of his friends are raped, one of his friends, something awful. I think it was great. And so he would go out at night with a bat looking for a black guy to start trouble. And he talked about, and everybody was furious at him and he's saying, look, look, I didn't do anything and I was in a terrible state of mind. I'm just being honest about this. I'm not proud of this. It was one of the most embarrassing and darkest moments of my life, but I did it right. And not letting people express those things and talk about it and say a wet cause. I am embarrassed that I got so man hideous. I mean it's, you know, there's a couple of podcasts I did where I was like, fuck man.

Speaker 2:          01:06:04       You know, and I, that hurts people. I hurt people by saying that. Well, I mean it's still whatever. No, but people have lashed out at me for stuff like that, but it's like I don't fucking, I don't have the capacity to hate an entire group of people. And I certainly, like I have brothers, I have my dad. I don't, don't use any of this. Sometimes you say things and that's not really what you mean. Yeah. And then expressing anger of course. And then I think right now what's going on? And I've checked out of a lot of stuff. I don't pay attention to a lot of things anymore cause it was just like the news you mean? Yeah. It's just like not, it's not real. I don't read Twitter. I don't, I just don't do it. It's like I got to focus on what I can do and how I can feel good and how I can, I just want to make people laugh, have a good time, make people feel good.

Speaker 2:          01:06:46       I want to feel good. It's like I can't do that if I'm in this constant state of taking in all this information that's just pushing my buttons, pushing my buttons. Well, yeah, some of it's not going to be, but someone certainly is. And you, if you're not controlling the, like you have a mental diet too. And that's something that people don't think of all the time. You know? I don't remember who, who described it that way, but it's the best way of describing it. You have a physical diet and if you have a poor physical diet, your body's sick. But if you have a poor mental diet, your mind is sick. Yeah, you're taking a nonsense all the time and fights. You know, I had Bernie Sanders on yesterday and that guy who was running for something, my dad. Yeah, a little bit cool. Um, and uh, I briefly looked into the comments of uh, one of the posts and so many fucking people are so God damn toxic.

Speaker 2:          01:07:37       Yup. They're just battling it out left and right and misrepresenting his position and misrep someone was calling me and all right. White supremacists. White nationalists. Like what in the fuck. That's so high scent. I am at tee shirt. So this has, someone said that I had someone, what is this storm front or something like that? What does that white supremacist page storm in front of something they said I had the founder of Stormfront and my potluck. The fuck are you talking about? You're just making it up properly? No proud of those guys. I had Gavin McGiven Gavin who is the founder of the proud boys. I had him on before, but I had him on before. There was a proud boys. I didn't

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       even know what the fuck. Why can't you talk to him? I asked him about it and I was critical. I was criticizing him. I was like, you can't just claim you're going to have violence with people. It's so fucking dumb. And then all the proud boys, shit that happened with violence came far after that. But people were like blaming me for having him on. I don't even know what the fuck it is. He's the Co founder of Vice. That's what I knew. It just, it's also interesting. Don't you want to hear the other side? Like don't want to hear everyone's opinions and everyone's thoughts when you want to try to understand and come to a common ground. Don't you want to realize like I'm not religious really or anything, but it's like we are all God's children. Like there's missing this whole thing. It's this fight against each other.

Speaker 3:          01:08:55       Yes. But no. Okay. The problem is there's a lot of these people that do go on shows and try to reinvent themselves disingenuous way, and they try to whitewash what they're doing and whitewash their past. And to that point, I mean the idea is that you're helping them recruit people. Before he was on my podcast though there was no record, there was no people for him to recruit to is that people need to understand like he wasn't, there was nothing like I had a mom because he was this guy who was funny and he used to do a lot of interesting videos. He fucked up when he started that group and he fucked up when he was calling for violence and telling people to choke a bitch and punch people and grab these people. And he was doing it in response to the violence that Antifa was, was pushing on right-wing people that would have these meetings and they would show up.

Speaker 3:          01:09:45       Yeah. Doing like this all clown mirror back at them. It's all crazy area was all poorly thought out. But the idea that that makes you a white nationalist cause you talk to, you talk to them. Yeah. It's so fucking stupid. But it's like this is the world we live in and everything's so polarized. It's like your left or right. You're black or white, you're one or zero. It's like there's no gray area with the August freeze. You and the one moment that you said the thing and then there's no before or after, there's no growth, there's nothing. It's like, yeah, fucking out. Yeah. They just look for this quote trap and just that's it. You said that you said that. I'm like no Mike, I clarified, I expanded, I took it back. I revisited it like there's a lot of things that people do when you talk or you just, you know, you say things like, you say things like you don't even know what the fuck you're going to say when you're saying it and then you go, that doesn't make sense.

Speaker 3:          01:10:36       Then you re re clarify and when you're talking a long foreign conversation and like this in a podcast and someone wants to take a snippet out of it and I just decided that's who you are. It's nuts. It doesn't make any sense. And it's, this is the world we're living in today. Everybody wants to paint everyone as toxic. Yeah. Everyone that you want to paint. So many people, I should say, want to paint people as being a problem or a negative thing, and it's like this is the Twitter world where 20% of the people make 80% of the posts. So many of them are fucking losers and just also it's such a, you're giving all of your power out to outward. You're not paying attention to yourself, blaming others. You're

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       trying to change the world around you. You're trying to create a safe space through other people. Yeah. It's like, do you know unhappy? You're going to be in your life if you're expecting other people to come cower to all of your demands and do all of your stuff. Everyone's dealing with their own fucking,

Speaker 3:          01:11:27       they're not trying to be happy. Part of it. What's, what they're trying to do is somehow or another score points and rack up was, you know, and, and distract themselves from their own life by focusing on these external issues that they think are critical and super important. And some of them are obviously running for president. Whoever's going to be presidents, very important issue. And most of the time, like 95% of time I avoid comments, but for whatever reason I just found myself flipping through it because I wanted to see what the people think about Bernie. Yeah. I'm like, oh, what a mistake. You can't look, you can't love. It seems worse though. It seems like every time I check if I, if I don't check Twitter for four months and then I check it, it's like Whoa, it was, things accelerated this much. Or people are so angry at so many different things and just they, they paint people in such character caricature like AOC and the, she is a woman who I don't think they're, I don't think I've ever seen anybody work. So people work so hard to mischaracterize her or paint her in a horrible light. And I'm like, look, she says things that I don't agree with. Why is everyone so fucking angry? Like what is this?

Speaker 4:          01:12:37       Well people were put all their thing on things, on, you know, and those are the, they have these beliefs. And like definitely when I was in my whole like, you know, when I was extra angry and feeling, you know, you, you have this whole system around you and you, you know, you can't hear the other side and you have to like, yes, everyone has to be a villain in that are they? They're either with you or against you. And I dunno, it's just to me is just unhealthy. I had to tap out, I stopped paying attention to a lot of stuff and I don't know if that makes me ignorant. I just got to live a happy life.

Speaker 3:          01:13:07       No, I don't think it does make you angry. I don't think it's an effective way to communicate. I think it's a really piss, poor way to communicate. And I think it, it fosters rage more than anything. Yeah. There's something about being able to talk to people where you don't have social cues, you don't have empathy, you're not looking at them and people say the meanest, nasty shit each other and it's insulting people. And dunking on people is more important than actual,

Speaker 4:          01:13:30       well, it's attention to, so it's, you know, they're maybe trying to impress their other buddies that are on there. They're trying to get those extra little likes right there. Like the, the main point would be they want to get your attention. Holy Shit, they got Joe Rogan's attention. That's so cool. You know, they just want to feel alive or whatever. And that's, you know, people have their own processes. I tried to not take anything personally. It's like you don't know me if you don't like me. Like that's weird. You don't know me. You shouldn't really have that much of an opinion. It's like not finding your validation. You can't find the good stuff or the bad stuff in the comments. You can't, what's, if you're looking at the comments for good things, it's just as bad as looking for bad things.

Speaker 3:          01:14:05       Yeah. I mean, some people think it's a good idea to gauge like whether or not the conversation was effective or not. You could have done something better than navigate it more efficiently or more. Um, more entertaining for the, make it more entertaining for the people that are listening, looking for the constructive criticism. Yeah. I mean there can be some of that from some people. The problem is you're trying to manage all this data at scale, right. You're dealing with thousands and thousands of humans that are charming in and a lot of them are deeply unhappy. Yeah. A lot of people that are commenting on things that are just really frustrated with their lives. Like imagine if someone saw or listened to you when you were like, fuck man. [inaudible] and they're like, oh, that's who she is. Exactly. Then you see, they see you on here laughing and being silly. Like, wait a minute. Who is this bitch? Yeah. Like that doesn't make any sense. That's not the same person. Yeah. Well, you're not the same person. You're not the same person who you were six months ago.

Speaker 4:          01:14:59       I know we grow in. Yeah, I would fully, yeah, I hope so. I mean, I do. I tried to do a lot of work on myself. Um, I stopped watching, watching this was huge for me. I was watching a lot of true crime. Oh Jesus. I was watching like dateline, stuff like that. All these things and I mean that is fucking toxic. People are obsessed with it. They're obsessed with it. And I just started to realize, I know a friend of mine had, there was one about her sister and once I saw that and I just realized like this is not good. This is finding entertainment out of these really real things that have happened to people in this pain and I have had fucked up. Things happen. I've had friends have fucked up, things happen. I've seen these things. I don't need to bring awareness to this. I know that. And I'm not a women get into those true crime shows. It's like traumatic and everything, but it's not, it's, it's real. These are real things that happened. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:15:48       But is it because you want to know that that's out there so you can prepare yourself or so you can be aware like what is, what is the appeal cause a apparently c f find out this is true, but I remember reading this, that true crime shows sort of skew in their demographics, um, more female than male. Like the more females are into true crime shows than male.

Speaker 4:          01:16:10       Yeah, I dunno. I just, I think it's like a beginning, middle and end to a story. Like there's a whole plot line and then they catch the person and the way the editing is, and they don't have the interviews and well, for a lot, a lot of the episodes they will, sometimes they catch them before they kill them and that's disappointing. But, um, it's just very

Speaker 3:          01:16:28       young women are the biggest true crime buffs. And here's why. If you're even remotely interested in true crime story O in true crime, boy [inaudible] have the last couple of years been good to you. First there was the mega hit podcast serial, which launched October, 2014, several months later, the HB HBO re released the Genx six episode documentary, Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, captivating. Um, as captivating as the programs were for the general public, one group in particular has become particularly enthusiastic about the genre. Young women. Hmm.

Speaker 4:          01:17:03       It's weird and a lot of the victims are young women. It's like, well, I don't know what it is. Hmm. I don't know what sort of,

Speaker 3:          01:17:09       we'll get it. According to Dr. Howard Foreman, a forensic psychiatrist at Montefiore Medical Center, the trend is rooted in empathy. By the time you get to adulthood, women are able to empathize with a greater degree than men. On average. Foreman tells tech inside of this may lead to true crime being more interesting to women than men, simply because if you empathize more with the victim, it may be more relevant to you and more gripping.

Speaker 4:          01:17:36       Hmm. And then if you empathize with the murderer or you're in some trouble. Yeah. Like, Oh, you did a good job. It just was too, I don't know. It just got so dark and weird and yeah, I had a guy in my, when I was living with my ex boyfriend in this hood, in this a apartment building, there was this really weird kid who was so overly familiar and just really weird with me and I felt, I really felt threatened by him. I felt really uncomfortable with him. I told the landlord, you know, my boyfriend was traveling a lot for work and stuff, so I was alone a lot. I had a bat, he was like maybe 18. And he was young written by, he just was weird. He was off Asperger's. He very weird, like very, just the way he looked at me was weird.

Speaker 4:          01:18:19       He overly complimented me in an inappropriate way. I would set up boundaries. He would keep coming. He tried to, I was bringing my laundry up to my apartment and, um, my boyfriend was out of town and he, the kid lived at on a different floor than me. And he goes, Oh, let me take your laundry. I go, no, no. And he goes, Oh, let me take it. I go, no, I'm, I don't need your help. Very clear. And then he, the door opens to the elevator. He tries to take my laundry. I go, no. And then I get off the elevator and I start walking and he starts following me and I go, you don't live on this floor. And he goes, oh, sometimes I get off here and walk up. I go, no you don't. You're not supposed to be on this floor. And then I pretended to go into someone else's apartment cause I couldn't let him know where I lived. And then he left. So that's when I called Tate again and he sat me up with Scott Epstein, a 10th planet. And that's when I'd been started doing Jujitsu. Cause I'm like, nobody's fucking with me anymore. There's no, I can not control my surroundings. I cannot control that. All I can do is control my ability.

Speaker 3:          01:19:16       Same building, Ma. Jesus Christ. Yeah. That's the thing that women have to deal with. And I have experienced it to a far lesser degree with creepy dudes who want to follow me in hotels.

Speaker 4:          01:19:26       Oh yeah, you have. I've seen people. People are so weird with you. Yeah, it's weird. They want to follow you in hotels though. Yeah. Look, guys follow me into the elevator and want to come to my room like, hey, yeah, they want to watch you jerk off. I'll do me. Please leave me alone. Once I'm near them. They just to stay close people. People come up to you and they're so, I'm excited. This is their moment. They're, they're shivering. They're shaking. I watch it all the time. It's, I told you I want to do a reaction or they just should have our faces. Your friends faces when people are approaching you, we're just all like, oh my God. I mean they do it on a, a smaller scale with other people too, but I'm hitting you really have it there. Unfolding a paper.

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       They've always got something they need to share with you. Like this is their big chance to tell you whatever the thing is that they need to tell you. I mean, it is really their moment. You're a part of people's biggest moment of their life all day long. The biggest one is when they have a business pitch, the most frustrated Sienna. And I'm like, listen, we are not going into business together. How do you know if you don't hear it? Cause I don't have time to do what I'm doing already. And I have a friend party selling fanny packs. I can't do more super busy with fanny pack business higher primate.com so they brought your fanny pack. I died when you told me you sell at Vandy packs out so funny. Every month I have to keep restocking. I'm really king, I don't even get it. I sell a lot of fucking fanny packs. They sell like crazy but they're really high quality. I was living out of my car when you told me that. It's a company called roots from Canada. They make them super high quality leather and I just get them to print it with the high higher primate logo on them. But you know how I found out about this company and they're excellent fanny packs that involve anal sex. No dice clay. Oh my God guys. Clay. How to say, John. And I said, where did you get that glorious fanny baggers? Like, oh, you like it. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:21:17       and uh, he showed it to me and I said, this is fucking excellent. It's roots. There's nothing in there, but you know, they're showing good. His keys. Chapstick. Yeah, it's a CVD. Chopstick. [inaudible] that's the only one I fuck with. I took some before I came, so I didn't freak the fuck out. Just to help you. Oh, there's something in here. Okay. So rich show yourself ranch. I was living in my car next to parking next to one of your cars. That's it right there. See that roots fanny pack? That's where I learned about it. Oh my God. Got The fucking beautiful fanny pack. What makes yours yours? Well, I bought it from the roots company. I had them produce them for me and it's hard to see because it's Kinda, this is an older one. That's why I've had this one for a few years. But there's the higher primate logo that's in Boston.

Speaker 2:          01:22:01       The M can you get one that says Annie Fanny? No, but you can make it gel. Bring it somewhere. [inaudible] some money, some money to make my fanny bag glitter on it. It's a, yeah, she'd do it like a craft thing. Like that'd be fun. Should we have a cra? Yeah, we'll do a little craft show that's not hard to puffy paints. Just do it with glue. You paint it with glue and then you sprinkles, you know, a glitter all over it. The glue will stick to Glidden. Very glittery. Yeah. There you go. I don't think so. I try very hard though, Dude. That's a good look for you. I'm trying to Elton John and I watched this video of Elton John Live all the time at, what are you showing me, Jamie guys? The trend of wearing them on up here. Those people are cowards. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. They are cowards. They don't want to wear it as a fanny pack. So they wear it over their shoulder because they're cowards and if a hot girl comes, it doesn't like fanny packs. They can throw their elbow into it and pretend they're injured. No, that's not what they're doing. So sling. They're doing it because they don't want, they want

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       the functionality of a fanny pack, but they don't want the social stigma. They're counting,

Speaker 4:          01:23:10       well, it's a new, yeah, it's like the Jaden Smith. Jaden, I don't know. It's like he would wear that wedding. It's the younger, this is the younger generation. They're re they've taken our fanny packs and they've made them into something else.

Speaker 3:          01:23:20       Non-Binary maybe. What is it saying at the bottom of that picture with any pack and see through Iridescent Zip. Okay. Fuck.

Speaker 4:          01:23:31       Don't have a see-through bag, by the way. Nobody wants to see your tampons. Hers maybe. I don't know. You never know what these young boys, these days, they're very woke. Whoa, they're so polite. But there's all these women that want to get choked by bigfoot. So

Speaker 3:          01:23:47       I was reading this thing about Yale and that Yale put tampons in the men's room because they said, not everyone who menstruates is a woman. And I'm like, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:23:57       yes they are. I thought maybe they worked for diarrhea. Yes. Everyone who bends straight is a woman. Scientifically, we're getting [inaudible] women right now. Can you tell them wacky? Yeah, it is. It is a weird thing that's happening. Oh my, Oh, anyone. Whatever they want. It's just a weird, yeah, I will too. I have no problem. I wa I would, I would love to make you happy. It's as long as it doesn't, it's so wacky. We'll Chappelle said that thing on his special where he said, uh, um, to what degree do I have to partake in your self esteem?

Speaker 3:          01:24:31       Right. That's a good way of looking at it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's, but it's not just that, it's, it's an enforcement. There's like an authoritarian enforcement of certain language and certain ways of communicating with people. You know, there is a Goddamn hilarious thing that Tim Poole posted up of a communist meeting where this woman is calling everyone comrades and this guy is like, it could everyone please stop moving because could you guys please stop moving because I have severe ADHD and all this moving is really distracting me. And the woman goes, all right, thank you comrade. Duly noted. And then the guy goes, please, can you stop using gendered language? When you say that, in my view it's very offensive and like it is woke.

Speaker 4:          01:25:19       God, this is what I was saying before about how it's like if you're expecting the world to accommodate to you, like your safe spaces inside yourself, you fall, it's inside you. You don't have control of the outside world. This is people trying to control the language of everyone around them and then saying it's unsafe. If they don't follow your new vocabulary, that's an unfair thing to find it and you're unfulfilled.

Speaker 3:          01:25:40       I'm looking an Asian lady and he said, this can't be real. I'm going to find it. It's like two days ago he put it me, Sam Harris reminded me of it as we were fucking howling laughing about it. It's just done. It's like parody. It's like the onion is not ridiculous enough. Like these people are more ridiculous than the most ridiculous parody. Like you can even mock it,

Speaker 4:          01:26:02       but do you think that it is them trying to see

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       what they can get away with? Yes. They're a little kid. How far can I go? They're playing, make believe they're there. I'm, I'm a chicken. You know, I'm someone who is, someone said this to me, I can't remember what it was, but that all of the words, the keywords that people are using now like triggered safe spaces, they're autistic terms, they're terms that people use with autistic children here. This play this.

Speaker 5:          01:26:27       If we want to defeat capitalism, we are going to need a party that will organize working people to fight for the demands that we want and to win socialism. Thank you so much. Great.

Speaker 6:          01:26:37       Yeah, it's quite a privilege. Quick credit, personal privilege guys. First of all, James Jackson's Sacramento, he him. I just want to say, can we please keep the chatter to a minimum? I'm one of the people who's very, very prone to sensory overload. There's a lot of whispering and chatter going on. It's making it very difficult for me to focus. I know it's, we're all fresh and ready to go by. Can we please just keep the chatter to a minimum? It's affecting my ability to focus. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          01:27:01       Thank you, comrade. What is this? Okay. Is there a speaker against name, Chapter Pronouns? Point of personal privilege? Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:27:08       Please do not use gendered language to, to address everyone. Okay, what did you a red headed monster. Where is he? Right in the lower right hand corner with the Halter top whatever tank top thing. See that? That would the redhead red hair crazy right here. That's the one that jumped up. That's the he him. She her red. So he's wearing that red. So when he gets his period, do not use gendered language. This is, this is where we're at. We're at, we're in nonsense land and people are acting like this is normal. You're a bunch of babies. What are you give a fuck if someone says, guys, who cares? The Bible said about saying girls say girls, I could be there. Say Girls, I don't care. This is your, you're crazy. Please do not use gendered language. What? How does that change anything? And by the way, you can, if you can't deal with a bunch of people moving around and distract and making noises and shit, just stop.

Speaker 2:          01:28:05       Get the fuck out of there. You guys force everybody else to deal with your fucking weak mind. Go home. Just watch this on youtube. Eat a steak, do some squats, steak, eat some elk, get your fucking life in Norfolk. Pipsqueak go fuck a Goddamn bigfoot. Go right a big foot fuck book and make millions. What is this seminar about? About being an asshole? Communism. Socialism. So it's like playing on this thing to where it's like, I want people to feel good. I was a special ed teacher. I've done all these things. Special Ed kids wouldn't have been talking like this, asking for all these things and thought this is what the with these kids are calling socialism, right? Like this is what I mean. Everyone has to be like super, super sensitive and aware of every single fucking thing they do. And every single fucking thing that everybody around them does.

Speaker 2:          01:28:51       Everybody seems to comply. And it makes you a victim too because it's impossible for that to happen. So no one's ever going to comply to everything you say. There's always going to be one person, even if they don't even, they want to. Maybe they were listening to something else and they didn't know that that's what they were supposed to do or whatever. So then there's always going to be, you're always gonna be a victim of something. Someone's always said the wrong thing. They've always done the wrong thing. And all of your worth is from something outside of yourself and you now don't have to deal with your own. It ramps up. What used to be acceptable year ago now is unacceptable. A year from now, it'll be something else. After a while, you won't even be able to say colored. You're going to have to say the C-word, right?

Speaker 2:          01:29:27       Yeah. You have to say you can't say people of Color, which is PSE. Just that people of color. That is a weird one. Yeah. Like the NCAA or um, NAACP, brother National Association for the advancement of Colored People, which is bananas. Like you can't say that. You can't even say that anymore. It's like so dumb. It's a jewelry thing. And also people, I feel like if people stopped having attachment towards you could stop having them mean anything. Like they wouldn't hurt you. While the winter news talked about that in the 60s it was one of his bits in the 60s he would, he would call people by a bunch of ethnic slurs and then say, you know, the problem with not saying these words is that if you say these words enough time, they lose all their meaning and there's not going to hurt some feelings. I'm paraphrasing, but this is the opposite and you know what?

Speaker 2:          01:30:15       This is nothing. They turn him into a woman and Ms. May is a, Oh they rerouted that. They rebooted him. I've watched a little bit. I think it's good. I haven't watched 'em but it is Marshall that Mrs Maizel has him. Yeah, she's the mother audition for that. And then when I saw her tits in the front, I'm like my tits audition for her. Ted's, that's like amazing show, you know. But in the first scene she showed her tits. I was like, all right, thank you. Thank you for getting me that audition. I don't understand what you're saying. She showed her tits in the first scene and I didn't realize that that was going to be in the scene. They didn't make me go topless or whatever, but I was honored to have been in the same audition pool is, oh, okay. This is Rachel Brosnahan juice. Sheila's great.

Speaker 2:          01:30:59       She looks great. She's got it. She's a great actress. She is hilarious. But I was talking to a male comic. It was really funny and he was like, ah, I don't like that fucking show. Because there was no woman like that back then. Yeah. There was no superman either, man. Like with the [inaudible] talk about there's no walking dead. Rick didn't kill any zombies. Guess what? It's all fake. Yeah, he's a really freak you out. There was a woman comic like they're about comedy. So funny show about comedy. You should be excited that there's a show about standup comedy in the 1950s and sixties it's fucking great. Like so what do you care if they made up a woman? Like why? Well, they're not getting represented. The white men. It's not even that. It's like, it's like a historical thing. Yeah, it would. [inaudible] was bothering him historically.

Speaker 2:          01:31:44       They are, they are intersecting with real things that happened, so I can see where that's a little annoying. I don't wanna bring up Elton John Again, but I did see rocket man in it. It is. It was weird when they were not, if there are things that happened in your, why do you say bring up Elton John Again? Yeah. You just didn't even bring him up earlier. I've just been talking about him the whole time. Did she know, I listen to Elton John a lot. Did you? Yeah, I watched this one live video of him a lot. I don't think you said they were, it did. Did you? Yeah, I forgot. That's okay. I can only be expected to be listened to 20% of the time. What was wrong with rocket mare? Well, it's just, he didn't write the lyrics, which they said, but then the whole movie was like trying to force these life events into the lyrics.

Speaker 2:          01:32:26       So it was like, but he didn't write it so he didn't write it. So it just wasn't, it didn't feel real. I would have rather have heard more shit about when he married that woman and stuff. You know, married a woman. Yeah. He married a woman. Whoa. Yeah. How frustrated was she? She must've been a really horny, just sliding around in there. Just probably didn't know. She's probably rich, but I think, I think probably maybe it was just a beard situation. She knows. But also it's got gotta be a lot of those pos long drives. I want to believe that they can be straight. You know? That's why they buy the Whitney Cummings Dick Doll. But that's where like that all pray the gay away stuff is, Oh yeah. You ever heard of those? Pray the gay away camps guys are sitting around holding men with boners.

Speaker 2:          01:33:08       They really get hard ons holding you and telling you you're not gay. Yeah. What the fuck's going on back down? It's fucking crazy. It's like, it's so wild to not be like, just lean into what you are, your happiness, your joy and yeah, but think about yourself. You were raised a Quaker would've. If you raise some wildly, you've been told that [inaudible], you know anybody who does that is Satan worshiper and you're going to go burn in hell and you live with all this guilt and sin feeling like that. Shame that you're rotten or whatever. I mean, I definitely have my own shame and I know probably everyone carries some with them. I can't imagine on that scale. That sucks. That is probably one of the biggest ones. If you're raised Christian though, if you're raised like serious Christian, especially fundamental, it's one of the worst sins to lay with another man and just dealing with it.

Speaker 2:          01:33:58       The deck that they must get at those camps. I mean they must just be pounding each other out. They probably come so quick cause you can't believe they're actually, they're just like, and then they have that comradery in the fact that they both are trying to not be this thing. Oh my God, I'm getting horny just talking about it. Honestly, I have a new genre. It's not big foot. We have to, we have to work through this. I mean, I'm not getting, you're not gay, even though we're just fucked. I know. Just crying in each other's gay arms. What a sneaky trick. If you believe in God that God did, God said, listen, you cannot have sex with men, but you're gonna want and you're nothing really gonna want it. They're going to want that all day. You're going to see them all. Your mostly assholes all day more than food.

Speaker 2:          01:34:39       You want them more than water and you just want to Duke and bought, do deck bought, ah, firemen and fo Indians and cowboys, and then a band's going to come out and they're all going to play. It's each part and you're going to have to try knock some damn, and then you can't even go to the YMC anymore. I mean, if you really believe in Jesus and you really believe that you shouldn't be gay, but you are a gay, what a dirty trick God is. It must be terrible. I just feel like there's nothing more dangerous than we're oppressed. That's gotta be aware of cancer, not just homosexuality, but repressing any sort of feelings like that. It's gotta be what cancer is. Will repress sexualities. Always strange. Like when I was in high school, there was always these girls from Catholic school and girls from Catholic school that went to all girls, Catholic schools with the biggest homes, county.

Speaker 2:          01:35:33       They couldn't wait to get some deck because it was so forbidden. It was a forbidden fruit. They just would get so excited and they couldn't believe it was real. Just fighting off these hormones. It just has such a terrible trick to play on a young person to tell them that their body is dirty and awful and that these thoughts that are just prevalent, omnipresent in their mind or their wicked ways of the devil and that which you resist persists. You know? You're just thinking about that fucking bud hole all day. Fucking suck in a deck, fat, juicy hog. He just can't have it. Yeah, I mean it's terrible. It's really bad. You guys. Also, if you're out there, listen, let's just say, let's God, let God give you a hall pass. Go fucking asshole. Go fucking asshole. Go second. Just move to boys town and realize like you're going to be fine.

Speaker 2:          01:36:24       There's a group of them, they get together and they have a great old time. There's a parade. They're so happy if you go down that street [inaudible] so happy free. They don't even, their shoulders are exposed like there's just a tank tops everywhere. Just hair shaved. Anything you want. Just every time. I love going. I feel invisible. It's amazing your level. I could just walk, I could walk bottomless and they would just, I've talked to gay guys or they get mad that straight guys are and straight girls are going to gay clubs now to hang out that it's like a weird thing. Talk to Martindale. Well, I could see where you'd be like, Hey, this was like our place to fuck and now you're here. Like you're wearing glitter. Yeah. Get the fuck away. Rainbows. Member Demitri Martin had that joke about where he's like, um, gays just get, I can't, I'm paraphrasing, but gays just get rainbows.

Speaker 2:          01:37:19       That's not fair. You just get fractured light, like greedy, greedy gaze. I mean this is what, back in the day when you could say stuff like that, that was pretty similar about that they w there was because of duck dynasty, one of the guys from duck dynasty was given, I don't get it, I don't understand why g and my bit was like, listen, you should shut the fuck up or the game people will take over Cammo the same way they took the rainbow. That's so funny. They own the rainbow. The rainbow used to be leprechauns used to be lucky charms guy who now is gay people to the point where if I came on stage with a fucking rainbow tee shirt on and people would be like, I know I knew it. We've been waiting for this moment. Fucking knew it. But um, the idea was that if a, like what all the gay cop guys would have to do is start every gay porn in a duck blind.

Speaker 2:          01:38:05       Oh my God. Every gay porn would start with that. So they're wearing cammo and the duck hunting and then someone would come in, a black eye would come in and go, somebody [inaudible] make me home. That like duck whistle thing. Oh my God. My friend worked on my friend Mike, who I stayed with worked on duck dynasty. So he knows all those guys. And what'd he say? That seemed like a trip or the bud fucking all the time when no one, I don't think so. But you know, it is funny when you take just a family and then you make them stars and then you know the cross between reality and yeah, all that stuff. And then they go crazy and then they all of a sudden they're on their own and they get interviewed and then they say something really crazy. Trinity Man. Hello? Not, yeah, some TMZ guy puts a camera in their face. Yeah. Are they still doing that show? I don't think so. How could they stop? It seems like it was just printing money. Yeah. I wonder, I mean maybe they are. I know my friend doesn't work for them anymore, but yeah, you ain't still doing duck dynasty.

Speaker 7:          01:39:02       I don't think so.

Speaker 2:          01:39:05       Yeah, I don't, I give him the credit for duck dynasty whether he wants it or not. I don't know how that show final episode, March 29th, 2017 how does that show end ever? It feels like a smart producer should step in and go, hey guys, it's been a couple of years. I'm on a lot of wacky stories. Falls asleep with a cigarette in their mouth. I don't know. It's gone. Yeah. All that Cammo gone. It's just, it's weird. I mean if you watch that show it's like there's nothing compelling about it at all. But it was an enormous hit. Yeah. Just a bunch of people doing duck stuff. There is something about reality TV that where you're just like, it's so thoughtless. You just don't have, you're just being taken on this dumb dumb ride. There's like this. It's just there's nothing happening. It's like, all right. Yeah. Next thing you know you're watching people dissect a storage container.

Speaker 2:          01:39:58       Yeah. But you know what I'd really like is survivor. That one. I still like survivors still like survivor I think is the number one reality show cause it's making people, it's taking away all of their comforts and they still have to communicate with each other like games with each other. They have to, they're starving. They have to do these physical, it's still, you're watching people be like tested and put, what season is that on? Oh my God, it's, there's so many seasons. Like season 1 million. I've seen all of them. It's so good. I don't, I don't pay attention to them fully so I can rewatch them at some point. I've watched them a couple of times. That show was on before fear factor. So I, we started fear factor in 2001 so that show was probably on in 2019 years later. It's in the thirties now. 30 seasons or something. 33rd yeah. Yeah. I'm embarrassed. I don't know cause that's how much it was still a hit. Yeah. It's amazing. Listen, people either are on to or they're not yet.

Speaker 3:          01:40:53       Well, they've actually done 38 episodes or seasons somehow it says, but this is the 30th. Yeah, they do several a year now. Is it still Jeff probe?

Speaker 2:          01:41:01       It's still Jeff probes. He's still the host. It's still under the radar. Like Jeff probes. Just like catch those checks and stays home. Yeah, but here's the deal. I've seen him driving around. He had his little summer for Dora. He was riding in his Prius. I was like drugs ics. This was like three years ago. I saw him driving around stockpile and all the cheese. Yeah. Maybe he's rich dad. Poor Dad. No, I mean he must have all his money just stocked away. He's driving around in a Prius. He's the, he's, I love the show. Maybe no good. They could take this away from him at any moment. Somebody replaced him. Would you notice this part of the show? I think people would be upset. There'd would be upset. What would be upset? I think people would be very upset. I think they'd be extra upset.

Speaker 2:          01:41:44       But if Adam Carolla took a spot, um, they would get canceled. People be like Trump now, is he a Trump supporter? I think so. I think so, but I don't know for listen, I don't know for sure. I don't want to call anyone anything. I think he's conservative. I think he is a Trump supporter though. Some people get conservative when they start making money though. I listen, I everyone has the right to be whatever the fuck they are. Or you think? I think so. What about Nazis? They have the more of a right. A third, right? I don't think that's right. Something that's a different word.

Speaker 3:          01:42:19       What does that even mean? What does Third Reich? I don't know. I don't even literally don't. I mean I've know what the Third Reich is, but I don't even know what it means to you. Guess. I've literally have no idea what that means. I know it means the Nazis, right? There's like, but what does it mean in German? But isn't that a funny thing? Like that's like Third Reich is like everyone knows not that, but no one knows what the fuck that means. Atomology yeah, you with the big words. I know a few. What does it mean third regime or empire or third realm? Huh. So the third version of the Nazi party was the holy Roman Empire, which lasted until 1806. The second would be 1871 to 1918 and this was the third. Interesting. So they were just, they were considering themselves to be the third rulers of the world, like the Romans. Interesting. Yeah. What a mess in the past. The thing is that that was not that long.

Speaker 2:          01:43:15       It was not that long ago. It was not that long ago at all.

Speaker 3:          01:43:18       If you're see the video of Hitler tweaking at the 1936 Olympics tweak like speed, he was on serious speed. We were um, um, with Brian Moses, Brian Moses was saying that Hitler was into bull semen and I was like, what? He's like, yeah. And then we found out that Taurine, which is in a red bull actually is from bull semen. That's why like red bull do this. That's Hitler tweaking. Oh my God, look at him. Go straight up tweaking at the Olympics. So he was on all kinds of crazy speed. And then we read

Speaker 2:          01:43:51       this thing about how he was like incredibly fatigued and almost dying. And He, um, got injected with testosterone and cocaine and [inaudible] and then went in and talked Mussolini out of leaving the war. Cause Mussolini wanted to get the fuck out of World War II. And Hitler went and just talked at him for five hours, just raw. They were all coked up and oxycodone doubt bull come dripping down his throat. Oh my God. How did he get, how did he extract the bull? Come, I don't know. But bull semen apparently has this taurine stuff in it and they extract taurine from some other method to make the torrents and the guys at the gay pride, the gay away camp to that's there to take your job from the tap. They're extracting his dick. You deserve all that. Well, do you remember, I was thinking about that horse and zoo, the documentary.

Speaker 2:          01:44:48       That documentary is amazing. That video of the, Whoa, I'm so trying and the part that I'm traumatized by is not the fucking part. Okay. And do you remember this scene? Okay. So he gets up on the bucket, right. And then you know, they need like several people to grab this giant Horse Cock and put in his ass. And then the horse rams them only once and then he goes, this is the part that got me. Yes. He looks back and he goes, did he come like he was so concerned if the horse came, I was like, oh my God. Yeah. And the guy made a noise like noise where you're dying because you fought. He was, he died so soon after. And then his friend goes too much. Too much. Like did you get too much worse? Got Too much. Of course. Like, and he did.

Speaker 2:          01:45:30       He died. If you look at the math, the size of a Horse, Dick, oh, I have a body cavity. It's like, where's it going? Yeah. What's getting out of the way to make room for that Dick? Oh boy. They dropped him off at the, at the hospital. They rolled him out. He was bleeding. He bled out. He had bled out from his asshole. And that's how it happened. I don't think he did. You don't think he was like, maybe this was where the hell did you. If the horse had come, do you think you would have been worth it? He would've thought it was worth it, but do you know that this whole thing, they had hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage of him getting fucked by donkeys and horses and a bunch of other people that these people had met online and the zoophilia right is the, the medical terminology for someone who is sexually attracted to farm animals and so or animals period.

Speaker 2:          01:46:17       And so these people all met online in some chat room and then decided to get together in Washington state where it was still legal to fuck animals. There's like only a few states where it's okay. So funny that you had, there has to be a law. Yeah. There has to be a lot of tape. So happy. That's not what you're into. I'm just like, I just wake up so grateful and blessed. I go, thank God. Right. Could you imagine if that was your, your oh trick God, thank you. You can't control that, right? If he gets something like some people are in the feet, some people are in the getting fucked with hours. I was segwaying into feet, huh? Yes. People are in the fee. Have you heard? I've heard they're in the fee. I can't believe it. Well, I was reading up on it that it's the part of the brain that handles your genitals and your feet are right next to their adjacent. So sometimes the why they think that the wires get crossed because, and the guy that studied it was a guy who studied a phantom limb syndrome and he was so he was falling when these people's brains where they would feel that they still had a foot or whatever and some guys would get horny, it would get their brain. So it was just like crossed, Huh? We get horny thinking of their own, not foot.

Speaker 2:          01:47:26       It's hilarious how you pixelate your feet and all those pictures, how they get started. They just, people were, they started a Wiki fee account for me. I just didn't know my feet were a thing. I just didn't know. I thought I was just walking around and you know, in slides didn't know I was walking around him as well. Just have been bottomless. I may as well have just been wearing like Pajama bottoms with the ass flap backwards open. Just put, I mean, my little feet pussy is just walking around. So then, um, once people, I noticed the Wiki feed thing and then people were damning me all the time to see my feet and I just was like, you don't get this was pixelated them [inaudible] Whitney shares dms with us sometimes. So it's funny. Group chat, I'm in with the Nick Swardson Bristolian Whitney and she'll post pictures of her dms.

Speaker 2:          01:48:11       It's like, what in the fuck? Yeah, they're wild. I do a thing on my podcast and on my live stream some times where I sage my pussy at the end of the night. So I get sage and I just, yeah, I just to break the, the negative Dick Cores that were sent to me, the unwanted Dick Cords from all these dudes, I'm like, Yo, put your Dick cords away. Right. But you know, people are pervs. What are you going to do? I just make fun of them, but it's more guys that are pervs and girls that are pervs with stuff like feet and stat. I think they're a thing that girls are into. That's kind of gross. The money. It's so gross. But that makes sense. Like money can keep you like your job. Some people are into like the money fat guy. Some people are into, I don't know, people are into all different things but, but not in the same way.

Speaker 2:          01:48:57       Like not the same. You're right. It's not the same. Some guys are in effect girls too, but there's a big difference between that and feet. Men are just very gross. You're gross, but it's biologically your dicks or just your just ruled beer. Dick's are just dragging you through the world and it's just gotta be acknowledged. We can't pretend this isn't a thing just dragging you. It's just, that's not, we're like breastfeeding and shit. We're thinking about other shit. In the archery, there's a term called front of center, meaning, um, how much weight is in the front of the Arrow had th determines like how much penetration the Arrow will have on an animal. I'm getting so horny. This is so weird. What are you talking about? It's like the same thing with dicks. It's like dicks or like your front of center. It's like, yeah, no they're just, I I like, I feel like you guys should be like holding yourselves back to the doorways cause your dicks are pulling you through things and it makes life a lot easier when you just realized that.

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       But I think he, it's like I just have only grown up a girl so I just didn't, you know, I knew obviously cause I've had a lot of sexual attention even very young. But it's, it's just like your decks are thing, they're fucking things and the 7 billion people and stuff because it's not necessarily because women are that horny. Right? It's just dudes are trying so hard to fuck. And now these compelled, I mean this is an evolutionary thing and it used to be really hard to stay alive. Yeah. Not that long ago. Now it's really easy and we're kind of left with the burden of this shift. Yeah. We haven't, our brains and our biology hasn't really caught up to the fact that we don't need to have as many people as we used to. We used to, you know, used to have a 50% mortality rate amongst children.

Speaker 2:          01:50:38       It was very difficult to survive. And I think that's also was just in China too. You're seeing more shifting with, um, you know, like, like those, those guys in that video, these Beta guys, the one guy calling out for people to stop being distracting and the other one calling out for people to stop using gendered language. Like, well, who are they? Well, they wouldn't survive if there was a, you know, the Roman army was invading, they would have never made, I wonder who's fucking them? Nobody. Nobody. Maybe they're just men that aren't driven by that, you know? No, that's not true. That's just as good as they can get. They'd just be jeans, circumstances and stuff are a mess. It's a mess. They're a mess. This is just weird. How much on survival, how much of our like cave man shit is still there and how much of this survival stuff like I've been doing listening to a lot of therapy podcasts, just one called the adult chair to this woman Michelle Chalfont and she's just, it's all about dealing like with your inner child and then I'll and all of your instincts.

Speaker 2:          01:51:37       She has like the adolescent chair and the adult chair and your adolescent chair is all of your ego and your emotions and your fight, fight or flight, like all of that. The stuff that you do, the procrastination, whatever is your problem, like why is that happening? There's something that's coming from either your child chair or something from your childhood or things like socially when you have social anxiety and panic attacks and stuff, so much of it could be just back from in the days if you were ex-communicated from your tribe, like you would die if you weren't a part of the club, you would fucking die. Whitney Cummings that that's the reason why people are afraid of public speaking is that when you were speaking in front of a group, you were trying to save your life. You were trying to plead your case for the most part, unless you were the leader of the tribe. Most of the people were just trying to say, please, I didn't know and don't kill me. Is that how you feel walking around me? And they know, but some people they comedy started. People were like, no, they're still full king. No. You know how I feel walking around. I feel like they don't, it's like they don't have anybody, but here's the way to put, when you

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       are listening to someone all the time and then that person's in your ear, the person becomes like a weird part of your life and then you meet them and you're like, whoa, this is crazy that you're right here. I've experienced that. When I first met Anthony Bordain, I was weirded out. I was like, I can't believe you're right here. This is so weird. I see on, and I've gotten used to that over time, but still it's strange when I meet famous people. Yeah. You know when I meet and it's even weirder when I made famous people and they know me, I'm like, yeah, okay, yeah. The way we can famous people together. Like hi,

Speaker 2:          01:53:17       I know. Yeah, I've seen that before at fucking one, two famous people just see it. And then you're just already, you're already in this weird club of famous people. It's strange. Automatically a famous people club. Well it's, it's

Speaker 3:          01:53:30       not a normal state and it's not, I mean, and people that are, that enjoy the podcast and becomes a part of their life and maybe it benefits them and maybe they start getting motivated and cleaning up their life and start being healthier and exercising and eating better and it, and then, then it becomes just like almost like a religion kind of thing. But because it becomes a thing that you think of, you know, in terms of like how to benefit your life, how to live in a positive way. You think about the things that you learned on the podcast? Almost like you would look at a religious doctrine. You look at the, the teachings of Christ, you know, you look at the teachings of Moses or you look at like, Oh, what Rhonda Patrick said was dance. Oh well you know what Graham Hunt Hancock was talking about that like in their head you're like a hired coach, both of them.

Speaker 3:          01:54:15       And there's certainly a bit of that. And it's also represents my own quest to try to figure out my own life and to do it publicly and explain what I've learned and how I failed and have what I've gotten better at. It helps other people when you hear that cause you go, Oh okay, I'm not alone. Like, cause people think that if like your life is in order right now, that has always been like that. So I think it really helps people to hear like, oh I used to be a fucking loser. And I did. And I used to be scared to talk to bank Keller tellers. And it was true. I used to be weirded out socially. I was very strange.

Speaker 2:          01:54:49       How can they hear your voice over the Cha Ching, Cha Ching, Cha Ching to chin. Cause you're rich. So rich. You're my richest friends probably. I'm guessing. Probably. I can't imagine who's richer. Well someday you'll be rich too. I can't wait. We'll laugh. You have laughed at me before. Will you get those same kind of glasses but surround them with diamonds? Yeah, I want to get jewels. I can see those. How long do you think it's going to take to surround them with diamonds? Yeah, just ordered them. You don't even think about it because you're too busy doing other things. I'm so busy, so busy. I'm culturally appropriating with those hoop earrings cause I don't think that's [inaudible]. Have you heard my jug about that? Know about how I got accused of cultural appropriation for wearing these hoops. Hilarious. Because uh, but she was Jew. My, my best friend, she's black.

Speaker 2:          01:55:36       But I did, I did a slide them off her neck. She's African. I do want to be a part of her tribe. That's the joke. That is the craziest shit when they stretch that neck out with those things. I know, I'm like, this is when you can get mad at the Jenners for cultural probe is when they've had the lip plate [inaudible] you know what I mean? When they come with the stretched out thing. Yeah. It's just a cultural preparations. A weird, I don't know. I think we should all be dressing like, I think it's cool that we all should be, I think people should be dry. I mean you shouldn't be like disrespecting people's culture and stuff, but I don't know what, it just seems like a, what we're calling culture appropriation. Today's people looking for a reason to complain. Yeah. Cultural appropriation is one of the reasons why cities are so interesting because we share each other's food. We share each other's clothes and listen to each other's music and you know where each other's jewelry. It's nonsense. And you know what's interesting is like how many people from America are upset about things, but then when people from China or Japan find out that we're wearing a Chinese, like Japanese [inaudible], they're so pissed. No, they like it.

Speaker 2:          01:56:41       I feel like there's been times where I've just done stuff online, you know, I'll have a beer or whatever, and then someone else starts doing it and you don't, you get mad at that. Well, that's different. Not as, it's not a joke. I mean, just like a thing I'm doing that's different because then you feel like someone's copying you, you know, summarize at a time. But then some people, some people get mad like, oh, I'm doing a podcast. No, he's doing a podcast copied me. Like, Hey, fuck face. You don't own podcast. That's where a dick, I have a podcast. It's called Asian experience. That's fine. I've literally had that conversation with people where they were like, ma'am, but now he's doing a podcast. I'm like, what are you talking about? Stupid. There's 600,000 Fox to do with you just focus on aim your Arabic, like handle your own life.

Speaker 2:          01:57:26       It's, it's so, but your own shit. I have lived as a victim for many years. It's, there is a benefit to it because you're always fed it. You know? If you are looking at the world that you're a victim, you will be given everything you need and please don't stop using gender. Actually, you're going to be so, everyone's going to be disappointing you. Everyone's going to be upsetting you or you can just accept some fucking responsibility and it feels so good. It feels good. It does feel good. Yeah. I mean it feels good to be calm and to, to just be at peace and you know there's a lot of work involved in that. You've got to fucking, you got to meditate. You got to iron out your own stuff. You got to exercise. It's a progress. Work in progress. Yes. We all are. I'm fucking trying man.

Speaker 2:          01:58:08       I'm fucking trying. I've wrapped this up. If anybody wants to see you, you are at the comedy store on a regular basis.
