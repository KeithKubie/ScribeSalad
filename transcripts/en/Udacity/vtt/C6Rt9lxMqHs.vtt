00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.475
&gt;&gt; My name is Tim Wong. I work at NVIDIA in the Automotive Group.

00:00:09.474 --> 00:00:11.299
I handle technical marketing.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.635
So you may know NVIDIA as a gaming company,

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.724
but we are so much more than that.

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.064
We are heavily into artificial intelligence,

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:20.765
virtual reality and self-driving cars,

00:00:20.765 --> 00:00:22.880
which is why we're here today to talk about.

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:27.289
You and I both drive with just our eyes and for better or worse,

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.704
humans are terrible at paying attention,

00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:31.699
whereas the car is always paying attention.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.759
It can look all the way around it and that's where deep learning comes in.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:38.929
I can basically train a car to understand whether it's lanes,

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:41.674
whether it's pedestrians, whether it's a moose or a deer.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.934
I can train all these different things.

00:00:43.935 --> 00:00:46.760
And the more objects I can classify,

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:49.835
I actually don't increase the reaction time of the network.

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:53.005
You can understand all these things in the world around you.

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:56.390
You can make your car essentially intelligent and basically keep

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.140
the occupants safe and have the car drive autonomously.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.320
What the Udacity Nanodegree program does is it raises

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.322
that capability of the engineers coming into NVIDIA,

00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:09.230
that now, I know they know about deep learning,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.560
they know about traditional CV and they can hit the ground running very quickly.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.355
This whole autonomous vehicle industry is a very exciting industry.

00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:18.829
There's just so much to be discovered,

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.280
so much to understand and to us

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.525
deep learning and GPUs is essentially how you're going to do it.

00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:30.237
&gt;&gt; My name is Jennifer Griffin and I am the director of university recruiting at NVIDIA.

00:01:30.237 --> 00:01:34.280
So we're really looking for several things in the students that we choose to interview.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.980
I would say the most important thing that we're looking for is passion.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.350
You have to be passionate about the industry,

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.214
you have to be passionate about the more macro industry of

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:44.299
artificial intelligence and machine learning and

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.879
self-driving cars and what that can bring to the world.

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:50.030
Showing passion, showing that you really understand the technology,

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.000
where it could go, that all makes you a great candidate.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.049
Once you're here, those interviews are usually pretty technical.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.230
And so what that means is that you'll actually be standing at a whiteboard

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.844
with a marker coding or doing something that is technical.

00:02:03.844 --> 00:02:07.295
Not necessarily if you can get from A to B, but how you get there.

00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:08.629
Even if you don't get the answer right,

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.909
we want to see your thought process for how to get there and that's way

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.715
more valuable to us than your final answer.

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:17.319
&gt;&gt; It seems like every week there are a couple of autonomous vehicle announcements.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.189
So being up on current events is a very big thing.

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.719
Showing that you know the industry,

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.169
you know the current trends is always very important,

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.339
always helpful in an interview.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.331
&gt;&gt; Our internship programs are real world projects,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.114
they are 12 weeks long and they're determined ahead of time what the project's

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:36.230
going to be and there's performance management and guidance built in along the way.

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.409
I think the most important thing to know about the internship program is that it

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.889
is our most strategic pipeline to new college grad hiring.

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.649
So anyone who comes in as an intern is

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.159
automatically considered for a full time role once they graduate.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.629
You need to bring your authentic self to work here and that's the only way it works here.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.465
This is work-life integration that we're doing here.

00:02:56.465 --> 00:02:59.064
So I bring everything about me to work every day,

00:02:59.064 --> 00:03:03.199
including the fact that I'm a woman and I feel appreciated for that here

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:07.674
and I feel like I'm definitely supported here in terms of all the facets of my life.

00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:09.439
We are so incredibly open to

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.914
diverse skill sets and diverse paths to get to the skill set.

00:03:12.914 --> 00:03:16.025
We're hiring people, we're not hiring pedigrees.

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:19.760
We absolutely focus on what the individual will

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:23.524
bring to the table and to the team and what we can do for the individual as well.

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:25.370
There's tons of camaraderie,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.469
there's lots of fun,

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.689
there's a ton of hard work.

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.038
I feel like I am holding on to the tail end of a rocket ship,

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:36.299
and I didn't even know what a rocket ship it was going to be when I joined.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.080
I look every day at the news coming out of NVIDIA and my mind is absolutely blown.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.225
&gt;&gt; Autonomous vehicles improve quality of life and that's to me what makes it exciting,

00:03:47.224 --> 00:03:48.919
and that I'm a part of this.

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.974
I'm a part of making something that's useful for society,

00:03:51.974 --> 00:03:56.460
solves a fundamental problem and improves people's lives.
