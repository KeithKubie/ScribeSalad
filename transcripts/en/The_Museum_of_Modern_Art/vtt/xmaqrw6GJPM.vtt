00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.720
I'm Tracey Panek, historian at Levi Strauss
&amp; Company.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.940
Welcome to the archives.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.500
This is the place where the world's best collection
of vintage Levi's are kept including the oldest

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.040
pair of blue jeans in the world, 501s.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.620
And I'm about to show you three unique pairs
of 501s.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.720
This piece that I'm going to show you...well,
it goes back to the 19th century.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.680
The woman who found and donated this piece
came to the archives several years ago.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.660
This woman who grew up in the 1940s in Southern
California, her name was Barbara.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.940
She went camping one weekend in the desert.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.060
She and her friends, they were teenagers,
they wanted to explore, they were being adventuresome.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.860
And they were near a mine, so they went in
as far as they could go and then, they stopped.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.840
She noticed the opening to a room.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.240
She went into the room and inside the room,
she found this piece.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.300
She picked out what she said was the best
of the bunch.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.700
There was a whole pile of Levi's that were
in there.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.040
You can see on the back side that she needed
to do a little patching.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.740
We know it's a 19th century pair of blue jeans
501s because there's just a single pocket

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.220
on the back side.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.940
It's one of the most important elements in
helping us to date this.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.440
She brought them home, wore them to high school
for a couple of years and then she noticed

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.320
something interesting on the inside pocket.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.000
This top symbol, which you may recognize...

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.560
We now use it on the patch of our 501s.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560
It's a two-horse.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.880
It symbolized the strength of the pants.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.100
They were so strong that you could put a pair
of our 501s in between two horses and you

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.480
couldn't tear them apart because they were
that strong.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:05.720
And then underneath that trademark are the
words: For over 17 years, our celebrated double-x

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.280
blue denim copper riveted overalls have been
before the public.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.980
This is a pair of them.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.920
And when Barbara read these words, she knew
she was looking at a very early pair of Levi's

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.420
blue jeans.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:27.420
You'll see some stains on here that look like
they might be paint, but they are most likely

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.140
drips of wax.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.580
In a place like Calico, when the mine was
open, a lot of the mine workers would have

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.440
been working without electricity.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.280
They may have used a band around their head
with a little wax candle and then the candle

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.680
wax would drip down.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.480
And that's likely what you're looking at.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.280
The front side of our 501 blue jeans has a
button fly.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.980
That's what we had at the beginning and we
continue to use it on our 501s today.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.960
The copper rivets that helped strengthen these
pants are here as well.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.420
There's also our tiny little pocket.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.920
It was used to hold a watch, so we call it
the watch pocket.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.100
Nowadays most people will put coins or something
small in there.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.340
No belt loops, that's why you had the cinch
on the back.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.080
But there were buttons.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.300
These two here, and on this side, and that's
so that you could add suspenders.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.980
They're one of the gems that we have in the
archives that give us a sense for the kind

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.440
of people who wore this blue jean.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.180
Not just the original wearers but in this
particular case, somebody who wore them after

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.460
the miners.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.560
So this interesting lifecycle that the Calico
pant takes on.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.720
In 1938, we received an interesting letter
that came here to Levi Strauss &amp; Company from

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.080
a Levi's fan and wearer who lived here in
the San Francisco Bay area.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.980
In his handwritten letter he explains that
in the back of his car he always keeps a pair

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.160
of Levi's jeans, so that if he's stranded
somewhere, he can dress in them, use them

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.980
if he needs to change a tire.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.980
He was driving one day and he noticed a friend
who was at the side of the road stranded and

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.200
he decided to stop and help him.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.360
He only had two small bits of rope in the
back of his car, but he also had a pair of

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.880
Levi's 501s.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.280
And so he took the 501s, he fashioned the
rope onto them, and he used the Levi's to

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.120
tow the car.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.740
So look at the fade of these.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.540
These were clearly a pair of 501s that had
been used over and over again.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.180
You can see what the original blue color looks
like.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.220
So clearly they were not only used, but they
were worn repeatedly.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.460
Maybe even washed because they are pretty
faded.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.900
They have what we saw in the other pants.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.040
They've got a cinch, but these ones have been
cut off.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.320
And you'll notice something that's different
about these.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.320
Belt loops.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.180
Belt loops is something we introduced on our
501s in 1922 for the first time.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.480
He said he only had two little bits of rope
in the back of his car.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.360
Here they are.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.080
And he used them to tow.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.520
He said he had had the pants for 9 years before
that.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.120
We call this the Commodore.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.900
It dates from about 1944, World War II.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.420
It was found near a mining area in Southwestern
Colorado.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.180
You'll see this interesting shadow on the
front side and you'll see that same interesting

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.300
shadow on the back side.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:50.260
And that is likely the shadow of a pair of
chaps that were worn over the pants and that

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.920
would have been typical perhaps of somebody
who was working with fire.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.300
Maybe a blacksmith who needed that extra protection
of the leather on top.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.480
The little watch pocket that's here on the
right side does not have rivets.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.240
Rivets were removed during the war by the
company as a measure to save metal and other

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.880
materials during the war.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.580
The other element that was removed was the
copper rivet at the base of the button fly.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.320
It was also a way to save on metal, but there
had also been complaints by some of our customers

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.200
that if you got down near a fire, it would
heat up in a very sensitive area.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.640
It actually happened to one of our executives
in the Haas Family and so the rivet was removed

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.880
and it never came back.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.740
Anything in a 500 series was the best quality
that you could get.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:49.100
Originally in some of the early invoices that
we would see you would have handwritten out,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.400
"patented blue denim overalls."

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.720
It took a long time to write out.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:07:02.280
By 1890, we changed to an inventory system
where we used simply three numbers, 501, that

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.340
identified this product.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.240
We've remained consistent in our use of it.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:14.540
Being able to know the context, to understand
the concept and ideas behind how a piece was

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.560
created, how it was worn, helps to inform
what the new pieces are going to be like and

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:26.600
always be rooted in the foundation and the
the stories and the products that we came

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.380
from originally.
