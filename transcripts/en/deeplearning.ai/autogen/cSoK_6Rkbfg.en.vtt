in the last video you saw how sampling a
 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.160
in the last video you saw how sampling a
random over the range of hyper

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170
random over the range of hyper
 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.320
random over the range of hyper
parameters can allow you to search over

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
parameters can allow you to search over
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.940
parameters can allow you to search over
the states of hyper parameters more

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
the states of hyper parameters more
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.129
the states of hyper parameters more
efficiently but it turns out that

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139
efficiently but it turns out that
 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.810
efficiently but it turns out that
sampling at random

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820
sampling at random
 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.150
sampling at random
doesn't mean something uniformly at

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160
doesn't mean something uniformly at
 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.340

want to show you how to do that let's

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800
want to show you how to do that let's
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.349
want to show you how to do that let's
say that you're trying to choose the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359
say that you're trying to choose the
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.529
say that you're trying to choose the
number of hidden units n L for a given

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539
number of hidden units n L for a given
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.330
number of hidden units n L for a given
layer l and let's say that you think a

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340
layer l and let's say that you think a
 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.729
layer l and let's say that you think a
good range of values is somewhere from

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
good range of values is somewhere from
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.639
good range of values is somewhere from
50 to 100 in that case if you look at

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
50 to 100 in that case if you look at
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.450
50 to 100 in that case if you look at
the number line from 50 to 100 maybe

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
the number line from 50 to 100 maybe
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.900
the number line from 50 to 100 maybe
picking some number of values at random

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910
picking some number of values at random
 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.760
picking some number of values at random
within this number line there's a pretty

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
within this number line there's a pretty
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.470
within this number line there's a pretty
reasonable way to search for this to

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
reasonable way to search for this to
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.049
reasonable way to search for this to
grow high parameter or if you're trying

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
grow high parameter or if you're trying
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.360
grow high parameter or if you're trying
to decide on the number of layers in

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
to decide on the number of layers in
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.580
to decide on the number of layers in
your network you're calling that capital

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
your network you're calling that capital
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590
your network you're calling that capital
L maybe you think the total number of

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
L maybe you think the total number of
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.170
L maybe you think the total number of
layers should be somewhere between 2 to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
layers should be somewhere between 2 to
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.539
layers should be somewhere between 2 to
4 then something uniformly random amount

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549
4 then something uniformly random amount
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.179
4 then something uniformly random amount
2 3 &amp; 4 might be reasonable or you've

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
2 3 &amp; 4 might be reasonable or you've
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.560
2 3 &amp; 4 might be reasonable or you've
been using a grid search where you

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
been using a grid search where you
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.880
been using a grid search where you
explicitly evaluate the values 2 3 &amp; 4

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890
explicitly evaluate the values 2 3 &amp; 4
 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.490
explicitly evaluate the values 2 3 &amp; 4
might be reasonable so these were couple

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
might be reasonable so these were couple
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.620
might be reasonable so these were couple
examples were at something at uniformly

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
examples were at something at uniformly
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.080
examples were at something at uniformly
random over their range of contemplating

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
random over their range of contemplating
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.450
random over their range of contemplating
might be a reasonable thing to do but

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
might be a reasonable thing to do but
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.130
might be a reasonable thing to do but
this is not true for all hyper

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
this is not true for all hyper
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.969
this is not true for all hyper
parameters let's look at another example

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979
parameters let's look at another example
 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.530
parameters let's look at another example
say you're searching for the hyper

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
say you're searching for the hyper
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.080
say you're searching for the hyper
parameter alpha the learning rate and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
parameter alpha the learning rate and
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.460
parameter alpha the learning rate and
let's say that you suspect 0.0001 might

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
let's say that you suspect 0.0001 might
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.800
let's say that you suspect 0.0001 might
be on the low end or maybe it could be

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
be on the low end or maybe it could be
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.039
be on the low end or maybe it could be
on as high as 1 now if you draw the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
on as high as 1 now if you draw the
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.330
on as high as 1 now if you draw the
number line from 0.0001 to 1 and sample

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
number line from 0.0001 to 1 and sample
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.899
number line from 0.0001 to 1 and sample
values of random uniformly random over

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
values of random uniformly random over
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.200
values of random uniformly random over
this number line or you know about 90%

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
this number line or you know about 90%
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.179
this number line or you know about 90%
of the values you sample will be between

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
of the values you sample will be between
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.039
of the values you sample will be between
0.1 and 1 so you're using 90% of easels

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049
0.1 and 1 so you're using 90% of easels
 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.380
0.1 and 1 so you're using 90% of easels
is to search between 0.1 and one and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
is to search between 0.1 and one and
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.809
is to search between 0.1 and one and
only 10% of the resources to search

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
only 10% of the resources to search
 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.160
only 10% of the resources to search
between 0.01 and 0.1 so that doesn't

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
between 0.01 and 0.1 so that doesn't
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.780
between 0.01 and 0.1 so that doesn't
seem right

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790
seem right
 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.030
seem right
instead it seems more reasonable to

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040
instead it seems more reasonable to
 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.160
instead it seems more reasonable to
search for high preferences on the log

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
search for high preferences on the log
 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.170
search for high preferences on the log
scale when instead of using a linear

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180
scale when instead of using a linear
 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.509
scale when instead of using a linear
scale you have zero point zero zero zero

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519
scale you have zero point zero zero zero
 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.479
scale you have zero point zero zero zero
one zero and then zero point zero zero

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489
one zero and then zero point zero zero
 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.050
one zero and then zero point zero zero
one zero point zero one zero point one

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060
one zero point zero one zero point one
 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.479
one zero point zero one zero point one
and then one and you instead sample

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489
and then one and you instead sample
 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.740
and then one and you instead sample
uniformly at random on this type of

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750
uniformly at random on this type of
 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.979
uniformly at random on this type of
logarithmic scale now you have more

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989
logarithmic scale now you have more
 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.440
logarithmic scale now you have more

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.649
0.0001 and point zero one and between

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659
0.01 and 0.001 and so on so in Python
 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.899
0.01 and 0.001 and so on so in Python
the way you implement this is let R

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909
the way you implement this is let R
 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.780
the way you implement this is let R
equals negative four times MP dot random

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790
equals negative four times MP dot random
 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.470
equals negative four times MP dot random
dot band and then a randomly chosen

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480
dot band and then a randomly chosen
 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.860
dot band and then a randomly chosen
value of alpha would be alpha equals 10

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870
value of alpha would be alpha equals 10
 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.250
value of alpha would be alpha equals 10
to the power of r so after this first

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260
to the power of r so after this first
 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.490
to the power of r so after this first
line R will be a random number between

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500
line R will be a random number between
 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.869
line R will be a random number between
minus 4 and 0 and so alpha here would be

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879
minus 4 and 0 and so alpha here would be
 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.780
minus 4 and 0 and so alpha here would be
between 10 to the minus 4 and 10 to the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790
between 10 to the minus 4 and 10 to the
 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.900
between 10 to the minus 4 and 10 to the
0 so 10 to the minus 4 is this left

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910
0 so 10 to the minus 4 is this left
 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.699
0 so 10 to the minus 4 is this left
things as 10 to minus 4 and 1 is 10 to

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709
things as 10 to minus 4 and 1 is 10 to
 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.400
things as 10 to minus 4 and 1 is 10 to
the 0 in a more general case they become

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410
the 0 in a more general case they become
 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.400
the 0 in a more general case they become
a sample between tenth of a - 10 to the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410
a sample between tenth of a - 10 to the
 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.229
a sample between tenth of a - 10 to the
B on the log scale and in this example

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239
B on the log scale and in this example
 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.170
B on the log scale and in this example
this is 10 to the a and you can figure

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180
this is 10 to the a and you can figure
 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.720
this is 10 to the a and you can figure
out what a is by taking the log base 10

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730
out what a is by taking the log base 10
 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.900
out what a is by taking the log base 10
of 0.0001 we're going to tell you a is

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910
of 0.0001 we're going to tell you a is
 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.080
of 0.0001 we're going to tell you a is
negative 4 and this value on the right

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090
negative 4 and this value on the right
 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.849
negative 4 and this value on the right
this is 10 to the B and you can figure

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859
this is 10 to the B and you can figure
 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.819
this is 10 to the B and you can figure
out what B is by taking log base 10 of 1

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829
out what B is by taking log base 10 of 1
 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.509
out what B is by taking log base 10 of 1
which tells you B is equal to 0 so what

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519
which tells you B is equal to 0 so what
 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.390
which tells you B is equal to 0 so what
you do is then sample are uniformly

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400
you do is then sample are uniformly
 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.199
you do is then sample are uniformly
random between a and B so in this case R

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209
random between a and B so in this case R
 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.319
random between a and B so in this case R
would be C minus 4 and 0 and you can set

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329
would be C minus 4 and 0 and you can set
 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.330
would be C minus 4 and 0 and you can set
alpha on your randomly sample Hydra

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340
alpha on your randomly sample Hydra
 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.110
alpha on your randomly sample Hydra
parameter value as 10 to the arm okay so

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120
parameter value as 10 to the arm okay so
 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.789
parameter value as 10 to the arm okay so
just to recap to solve on the log scale

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799
just to recap to solve on the log scale
 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.670
just to recap to solve on the log scale
you take the low value take long to

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680
you take the low value take long to
 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.949
you take the low value take long to
figure out what is a take the high value

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959
figure out what is a take the high value
 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.320
figure out what is a take the high value
take a lot to figure out what is B

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330
take a lot to figure out what is B
 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.809
take a lot to figure out what is B
so you're now John the sample from 10 to

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:25.819
so you're now John the sample from 10 to
 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:28.360
so you're now John the sample from 10 to
the a2 tends to be on a log scale so you

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370
the a2 tends to be on a log scale so you
 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.080
the a2 tends to be on a log scale so you
set are uniformly random between a and B

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090
set are uniformly random between a and B
 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.300
set are uniformly random between a and B
and then you set the hyper parameter to

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310
and then you set the hyper parameter to
 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.369
and then you set the hyper parameter to
be 10 to the R so that's how you

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:36.379
be 10 to the R so that's how you
 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.950
be 10 to the R so that's how you

something the hyper parameter beta use

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129
something the hyper parameter beta use
 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.189

that beta should be somewhere between

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159
that beta should be somewhere between
 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.180

99.999 so a better way to think about

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289
99.999 so a better way to think about
 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.559

this is that we want to explore the

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:35.569
this is that we want to explore the
 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.800
this is that we want to explore the
range of values of 1 minus beta which is

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810
range of values of 1 minus beta which is
 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.629
range of values of 1 minus beta which is
going to now range from zero point one

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639
going to now range from zero point one
 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.290
going to now range from zero point one
to zero point zero zero one and so we'll

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300
to zero point zero zero one and so we'll
 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.249
to zero point zero zero one and so we'll
sample the team beta taking values from

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259
sample the team beta taking values from
 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.010
sample the team beta taking values from
zero point one so maybe zero point one

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020
zero point one so maybe zero point one
 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.850
zero point one so maybe zero point one
since 0.001 so using the method we have

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860

faded out on the previous slide this is

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349
faded out on the previous slide this is
 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:59.980
faded out on the previous slide this is
10 to the minus 1 this is 10 to the

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990
10 to the minus 1 this is 10 to the
 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.070
10 to the minus 1 this is 10 to the
minus 3 notice on the previous slide we

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080
minus 3 notice on the previous slide we
 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.860
minus 3 notice on the previous slide we
have the small value on the left and the

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870
have the small value on the left and the
 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.420
have the small value on the left and the
large value on the right but here we

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430
large value on the right but here we
 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.029
large value on the right but here we
have a reverse with the large value on

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039
have a reverse with the large value on
 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.619
have a reverse with the large value on
the left and a small value on the right

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629
the left and a small value on the right
 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.830
the left and a small value on the right
so what you do is you sample are

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840
so what you do is you sample are
 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.219
so what you do is you sample are
uniformly random from negative 3 to

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229
uniformly random from negative 3 to
 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.129
uniformly random from negative 3 to
negative 1 and you set 1 minus beta

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139
negative 1 and you set 1 minus beta
 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.040
negative 1 and you set 1 minus beta
equals 10 to the R and so beta equals 1

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050
equals 10 to the R and so beta equals 1
 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.439
equals 10 to the R and so beta equals 1
minus 10 to the R and this becomes a

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449
minus 10 to the R and this becomes a
 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.540
minus 10 to the R and this becomes a
your randomly sampled value of your

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550
your randomly sampled value of your
 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.100
your randomly sampled value of your
hyper parameter chosen on the

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110
hyper parameter chosen on the
 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.830
hyper parameter chosen on the
appropriate

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840
appropriate
 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.740
appropriate
and hopefully this make sense in that

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750
and hopefully this make sense in that
 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.050
and hopefully this make sense in that
this way you spend as much resources

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060
this way you spend as much resources
 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:42.610
this way you spend as much resources
