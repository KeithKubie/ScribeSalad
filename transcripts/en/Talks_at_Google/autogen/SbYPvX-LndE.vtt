JAMES MOREHEAD:
All right, I'm very

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.380
excited for my fourth
Talks at Google to welcome

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.180
Kari Byron, best
known of course,

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.350
for the Discovery Channel
show "MythBusters,"

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.680
but she's done many,
many things since.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.640
For over a decade, she's
been a strong presence

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.330
in the world of reality-based
science television.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.130
She's hosted "Thrill Factor,"
"Head Rush," "Pumpkin Chunkin,"

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.280
"Large, Dangerous Rocket
Ships," LDRS, super cool.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.660
She spent a lifetime acquiring
odd skills and interests.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.660
After graduating
college as an artist,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.220
she traveled the world, decided
to settle in San Francisco

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.730
to pursue a career
as a sculptor.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.540
Which is amazing.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.770
But ended up discovering
that handling poop,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.390
eating bugs, wiring explosives,
and scraping chicken guts

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.660
off the ceiling was
a real dream job.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.136
Perfect resume for Google.

00:00:49.136 --> 00:00:51.854
All right, I'm very excited
to welcome Kari to Google.

00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:52.604
KARI BYRON: Hello.

00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:54.512
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:58.440
Well, thanks for
bringing me out here.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.420
I'm from the Bay Area.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.710
So for me, I've
watched Google grow.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.099
I mean, I came here
with Jamie for a photo

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.620
shoot you guys had when
it was like an open floor

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.790
with some cubicles.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.620
And I was so impressed
because you had a candy wall.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.574
You have grown a lot.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:16.252
AUDIENCE: Candy
wall is [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:16.960
KARI BYRON: Yeah.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.570
JAMES MOREHEAD:
So before we talk

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.861
about everything you've been
up to since "MythBusters,"

00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.490
I have to ask, is your
job as insanely fun

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.130
as it appears, or are you
just some terrific actor?

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.237
KARI BYRON: Well, I'm
definitely not a terrific actor.

00:01:29.237 --> 00:01:30.820
And if you look at
early "MythBusters"

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.800
you can tell how nervous
and awkward and bad

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.960
I am at talking.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.330
It is really, really obvious.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.040
My job is actually
very, very fun.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.600
That is one thing that we
always had is "MythBusters"

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.060
was one of the few shows
that was on reality

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.370
that was actual reality.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.790
When we were hurt we were hurt.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.330
When we were happy
we were happy.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.550
And you know, we were doing some
really fun, interesting stuff.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.725
And when it was boring,
they would just edit it out.

00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:57.600
JAMES MOREHEAD: And even
with all the set up,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.480
with all the shows you've done
there's a lot of stuff that

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.063
gets filmed and done and they're
not filmed behind the scenes.

00:02:02.063 --> 00:02:03.101
Is that stuff still fun?

00:02:03.101 --> 00:02:05.350
Or is there any part of it
that's kind of like a drag?

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.390
When you hear actors
talk about the hours

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.400
of waiting in the trailer and
the drudgery of making a film.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.060
Was it all fun?

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.090
KARI BYRON: Well,
we were all friends.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.190
And we actually had chemistry.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.780
So before we all had Angry Birds
so that everybody would ignore

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.350
each other, we had
these really fun games

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.360
that we would do when say
there was some sort of safety

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.880
protocol.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.770
Like the bomb squad had a full
hour that they had to wait

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.040
and we were stuck in a bunker.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.570
We would come up
with old timey games

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.190
like throw the rock at the can.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.440
And we would have
so much fun trying

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.900
to see who could hit the can.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.530
Like we always had fun,
even when some of the things

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.800
kind of dragged on.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.990
We all had very similar
senses of humor,

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.322
which slowly got lower
and darker because that's

00:02:51.322 --> 00:02:53.280
what happens when you
get familiar with people.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.730
And we all just kept each
other very much in stitches.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.790
JAMES MOREHEAD: Cool.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.200
You went on to college
for film and sculpture.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.790
You're most well known for your
science-centered programming.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.430
How has your
background as an artist

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.260
influenced how you
communicate science?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.930
KARI BYRON: Well, you know,
I come from a long line

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.030
of sciencey and arty people.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.190
And I feel like they
are in the same vein.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.910
It's all about
fostering a curiosity.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.310
With art you're taking
an idea and you're

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.350
trying to explore it
in a visual way that

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.090
helps you come to some
sort of conclusion

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.410
or feeling about that question.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.930
And science is the same thing.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.540
It's just exploring
your curiosity.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.650
The difference is I feel
like over time, science

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.940
became very sort of--
when I was growing up,

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.460
almost like clinical.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.690
Where it was identifying
the parts of a cell.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.590
Whereas when it really gets
fun is the way we did it

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.050
on "MythBusters" is where
you get really dirty

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.900
and you get your hands on it and
you do it the way you do art.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.410
You know, you're
throwing a pot, you're

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.894
getting your hands in the goo.

00:03:55.894 --> 00:03:58.310
JAMES MOREHEAD: So that kind
of builds into this question.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.527
There's a perception among
some that science is not

00:04:00.527 --> 00:04:01.360
a creative endeavor.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.811
That creative people
pursue the arts.

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.310
What have you learned
about science,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.500
especially past what
you get in high school,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.270
about the creativity
of scientists

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.655
and those that pursue science?

00:04:12.655 --> 00:04:15.030
KARI BYRON: Well, I think it's
pretty obvious in the tech

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.230
community, you guys
have figured it out,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.880
that a great diversity
actually comes

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.010
to a better space in
solving any sort of problem.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.420
So when you bring an artist
into a scientific field or vice

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.550
versa, you come up with
the most beautiful things.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.060
Look at kinetic sculptures,
when you take science

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.690
and apply it to art and you make
these incredible moving pieces.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.120
I think it works the same way.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.960
You just have a
different approach.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.830
And over the years, I've
learned that art and science are

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.064
pretty much in the same vein.

00:04:46.064 --> 00:04:47.230
JAMES MOREHEAD: Intermeshed.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.520
You've also emceed
some amazing events

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.020
showcasing student scientists
from the White House Science

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.040
Fair to the VEX World
Championships in Disney World.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.740
Super cool.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.090
What have you learned
from the students

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.430
that you've met over the years?

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.820
KARI BYRON: Never
underestimate young people.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.820
Because they are so much
more sophisticated than I

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.590
was as a kid.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.157
And when you talk
to a 12-year-old

00:05:09.157 --> 00:05:10.990
you talk to them like
they're a 35-year-old.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.050
I've learned so much from
them and their experiences.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.740
Because everyone at
that age is so honest

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.770
and will tell you
exactly what's happening.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.577
And they're so creative and
the world's just so open.

00:05:24.577 --> 00:05:26.660
And it's just such a
beautiful way to approach it.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.480
And I think sometimes
as we get older,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.020
we lose that need
to be fascinated.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.520
JAMES MOREHEAD:
Well I can tell you,

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.456
we have thousands of
interns every summer,

00:05:34.456 --> 00:05:36.330
a few are probably in
the audience right now.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.210
And it's amazing
what interns can

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.200
accomplish before they've even
finished their college degree.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.949
Very true.

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.490
So a lot has been written about
how you visited "MythBusters"

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.770
and never left.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.727
For students that have
no idea what they're

00:05:49.727 --> 00:05:51.810
planning to do with their
lives when they grow up,

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.080
what have you learned
about making the most

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.262
of unexpected opportunities?

00:05:56.262 --> 00:05:57.720
KARI BYRON: Well,
I feel like I was

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.050
almost too young when I went to
college to truly appreciate it.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.760
I mean, that might
be pretty universal.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.240
But I don't think that I
was the kind of person that

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.940
took advantage of it the
way I probably would now.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.200
For me, when I was
traveling that's

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.860
where I really learned
how to say why not

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.200
and to go for opportunities.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.490
Because I was traveling
alone around the world.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.502
I had a friend to
start with, but then we

00:06:22.502 --> 00:06:23.460
went our separate ways.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.260
And it was just the sort of
thing where you just have to,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.940
even if it's scary,
you have to try it.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.800
And I feel like that is what
led me into "MythBusters"

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.440
to start with.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.084
Because I tried advertising
and I was bored.

00:06:38.084 --> 00:06:39.750
And I tried all these
different careers.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.300
And I just couldn't find myself.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.980
And I came to "MythBusters"
in my late 20s.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.020
But I was ready to
just work for free.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.940
I was like, you know,
I will be an intern.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.790
Because I want to do
sculpture and special effects

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.730
seems like an easy
fit, because you guys

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.000
get paid to do sculptures.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.880
How did I know it was a
dying art at the time?

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.380
The practical effects were just
crumbling beneath the crushing

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.490
computer industry.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.230
But I really, really
wanted to learn how

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.170
to have an interesting life.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.360
And so I thought if I
just do it for free,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.490
sooner or later I will
prove myself worthy

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.532
and maybe they'll pay me.

00:07:14.532 --> 00:07:16.948
JAMES MOREHEAD: Now you had a
long run with "MythBusters."

00:07:16.948 --> 00:07:19.240
Was there ever a point where
you wavered or it got old?

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.781
Or did you just manage to have
this incredible long run where

00:07:21.781 --> 00:07:22.930
it was fun the whole time?

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.170
KARI BYRON: I mean, it
changed along the way.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.220
It was its peak fun when we
had the least amount of cooks

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.410
in the kitchen where we were
just allowed to run with it

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.230
and kind of do what we wanted.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.645
Whenever anybody tried
to mess with the formula

00:07:37.645 --> 00:07:39.520
and tried to figure out
what makes it popular

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.930
and do more of that, that
was always a little hard.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.490
Like for a while, they kept
trying to make us fight.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.950
You know, like all of those
chopper shows were so popular.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.832
So they would take me
aside, this was back

00:07:52.832 --> 00:07:53.790
when Scottie was there.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.165
They'd take me
aside and be like,

00:07:55.165 --> 00:07:57.082
you hear what Scottie
said about what you did?

00:07:57.082 --> 00:07:58.748
You know what she
said about your build?

00:07:58.748 --> 00:08:00.210
And then she'd
take Scottie aside

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.170
and be like, oh, this is what
Kari just said about you.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.586
And they'd try to
get us to fight.

00:08:03.586 --> 00:08:05.540
And I'd be like oh,
you're probably right.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.440
Your way is better.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.907
And they're like no, no, no.

00:08:09.907 --> 00:08:11.750
Never works.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.250
We weren't falling for it.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.187
We like each other.

00:08:14.187 --> 00:08:16.020
JAMES MOREHEAD: So
you've already brought up

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.740
that diversity is so
important, combining sciences

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.140
and technology and genders.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.990
So specifically about
getting more women

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.260
to pursue STEM, which is a huge
priority at Google and we've

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.253
got a long way to go, we've
been very public about that.

00:08:26.253 --> 00:08:27.670
It's a persistent challenge.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.330
What have you learned about
inspiring kids, especially

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.210
girls, to ignore
those stereotypes

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.570
or look beyond them?

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.111
KARI BYRON: I mean, I feel like
we've made a lot of progress.

00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:39.642
I mean, not too
distant past I would

00:08:39.642 --> 00:08:41.600
have been chaining myself
to other women trying

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.900
to get the right to vote.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.030
And then my mom's generation
was burning their bras

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.080
trying to get me
to go to college.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.190
And now we're here.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.000
I don't remember
seeing a lot of women

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.855
in dynamic scientific
positions on TV.

00:08:53.855 --> 00:08:55.980
If they were on a doctor
show, they were the nurse.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.630
They were never the scientist.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.880
They were never the smart one.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.770
And now every TV
show you look at you

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.980
see actual women represented
in smart scientific fields.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.970
And maybe by the
time my daughter

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.740
is a grown up
superhero women won't

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.990
have to fight in high heels.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.310
Like I feel like
progress is being made.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.260
I know that when I-- I don't
know if I am an expert in this

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:19.980
at all.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.930
I do know that the
girls I talked to

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.280
at the White House Science
Fair seemed like they were.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.740
They had it down.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.550
I asked them what
got you into it?

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.390
And they all had these
great stories of triumph

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.120
to get to where they were.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.707
But mostly, supportive parents,
especially a supportive dad

00:09:37.707 --> 00:09:38.915
was really, really important.

00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:43.480
Having role models they
could look at like people

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.520
like Ellen Stofan from
NASA, seeing women

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.690
like that succeeding
was really important.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.240
Seeing themselves reflected in
the media was very important.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.500
But also mostly it was being
able to find like minds.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.320
You may be the only girl in the
math club at your small school.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.440
But there's another only girl
in Minnesota in the math club.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.610
And if you guys can
get online, which

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.580
is the beauty of the internet,
you can actually connect.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.130
You can feel that support.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.910
And maybe you can
help each other stay.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.100
Because I feel like people
get interested in things

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.320
but fall away when
its hard or when

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.760
they feel like an outsider.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.530
And if you're the only girl you
might feel like an outsider.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.240
So you gotta network
and help each other out.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.820
We, as women, also
have a tendency

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.089
to compete and tear
each other down,

00:10:30.089 --> 00:10:31.380
and we've been raised that way.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.340
Where as I think
we're trying very hard

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.600
to start being supportive.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.360
I think every time I
meet a woman trying

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.900
to get into my industry,
people are always

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.150
trying to pit me against them.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.020
Like ah, she's trying
to be like you.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.510
Or her show's not as good.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.520
I'm like a woman on
TV, are you kidding?

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.420
I'm going to call her and
if we can help each other,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.520
this will be great.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.630
I wouldn't be where I am
without people like Debbie

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.960
Myers from the Science Channel.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.090
She's like, let's do a
show that inspires girls.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.230
Let's do it.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.360
She helps me out, and I'll help
her out any time she needs it.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.450
JAMES MOREHEAD: Cool.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.770
You've always struck me, we
were talking before about being

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.830
an accidental celebrity.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.209
By that I mean you
didn't do theater.

00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:12.750
I tried to Google it and then
I asked, no theater, no theater

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.370
background.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.367
You weren't deciding
to be a star.

00:11:15.367 --> 00:11:17.450
You know, and so you were
an accidental celebrity.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.130
You gained celebrity
status by doing something

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.440
you were passionate about.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.044
How different is real world
Kari from the brand Kari,

00:11:24.044 --> 00:11:25.210
and is there any difference?

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.460
And do you even
think about that?

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.690
KARI BYRON: TV Kari
wears a lot wear makeup,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.925
my clothes are generally
tighter on TV, I think.

00:11:33.925 --> 00:11:36.300
Or maybe that's just cause of
moving parts for machinery,

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.480
I don't want to get hurt.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.034
I wear a lot less dresses on TV.

00:11:40.034 --> 00:11:40.700
That's about it.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.825
JAMES MOREHEAD: But other
than that, the Kari Byron

00:11:42.825 --> 00:11:45.080
we see on "MythBusters"
and "Pumpkin Chunkin," that

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.082
is, you feel you're
able to be who you are?

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:47.790
KARI BYRON: Yeah.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.960
I mean, when we
started "MythBusters"

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.950
it's not like you have
an audience like this,

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.200
which would have been
incredibly intimidating.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.560
You have a camera crew
that you're friends with,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.520
and it's almost like
making a home movie.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.480
And so it just slowly
became part of what I did.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.720
And I don't live in the
Hollywood structure as well,

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.700
so I don't do red carpets
and that kind of fun stuff,

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.610
except for maybe
like once a year I

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.210
get invited to something
special and I'll go down to LA.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.410
So I think that maybe
that would have fed

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.372
me more of the celebritiness.

00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:20.830
JAMES MOREHEAD:
Now, "MythBusters,"

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.560
I think you were on the
red carpet for the Emmys.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.120
"MythBusters" never did win it.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.036
Get nominated a ton,
did it ever win?

00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:26.660
KARI BYRON: No.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.451
JAMES MOREHEAD: All
right, if "MythBusters"

00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:29.640
won an Emmy, total crime.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.660
What would be your
acceptance speech?

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.200
KARI BYRON: Oh, they wouldn't
let me give that speech.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.866
JAMES MOREHEAD: Pretend
that they would.

00:12:34.866 --> 00:12:38.020
KARI BYRON: It's a small
amount of time, I talk so much.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.690
Adam, would totally take that.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:40.100
JAMES MOREHEAD:
You'd get the music.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:40.600
That's it.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.570
The best speeches get the music.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.450
All right, so the internet does
not have a great track record

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.460
when it comes to the
online treatment of woman.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.596
How has your experience
been with the online world?

00:12:50.596 --> 00:12:53.010
KARI BYRON: At first I
had to get a thicker skin.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.460
Because we had message boards
that we were encouraged

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.754
to be very interactive
with our audience,

00:12:57.754 --> 00:12:59.420
because that was what
made "MythBusters"

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.800
different is that our
audience was part of us.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.670
And you know, I got my
feelings hurt really

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.060
easily when people would--
I remember somebody called

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.470
me a bubble head and I cried.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.358
I mean, it's just a silly
insult, but it was just,

00:13:14.358 --> 00:13:15.320
it was a little tough.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.780
But I grew a really thick skin.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.510
And I just don't
read that stuff.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.240
And I kind of laugh at it now.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.420
You just don't engage.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.100
And you definitely
don't Google your name

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:31.255
with the words "feet" or "butt"
or you and any male costar.

00:13:35.477 --> 00:13:37.310
JAMES MOREHEAD: So in
a more positive light,

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.665
you've been on David
Letterman's Show.

00:13:39.665 --> 00:13:41.040
That was a while
back, Google it.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.330
It's cool.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:41.860
KARI BYRON: That
my first interview.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.380
JAMES MOREHEAD:
That was very early.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.640
KARI BYRON: I was so nervous.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.310
JAMES MOREHEAD: I could
tell you were amped up.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.590
KARI BYRON: I was playing
with my dress the whole time,

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.160
my feet were sweating.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.900
JAMES MOREHEAD: You've
hosted science fairs,

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.580
as I mentioned, at
the White House.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.480
Many cool events.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.280
What is the coolest door
that's been opened because

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.444
of getting some celebrity.

00:13:56.444 --> 00:13:58.110
KARI BYRON: Oh, my
god, the White House.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.650
I mean, I got invited to
host the White House Science

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.050
Fair because there was an
emphasis on women and girls.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.530
And I was so humbled
by the experience.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.260
It was so incredible.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.680
I got to do this panel with
some really incredible women

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.885
and some girls that had
made it to the science fair

00:14:14.885 --> 00:14:16.010
and hear all their stories.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:17.720
And we just got to
sit around and talk.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.020
And I walked away from
there just in awe.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.800
And then the president
said my name out loud.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.100
My mom and dad could
hear, which was amazing.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.740
And then they ushered me
off to a little secret room

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.940
with [INAUDIBLE] and
all these fancy people.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.230
And then the president comes
over and gives me a hug.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.370
I was like what?

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.827
This is so crazy.

00:14:40.827 --> 00:14:43.160
And then at one point I had
to go look for the bathroom.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.630
They just let me walk
around the White House.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.880
Like I was just walking
around looking for a bathroom.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.810
Like kind of looking for
some like monogrammed M&amp;M's

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.930
or something to steal, but I
didn't But then like John Kerry

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.690
just walks past me on his phone.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:57.200
I'm like oh!

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.480
How did I get here?

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.590
JAMES MOREHEAD: That's
pretty hard to top.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.842
Yeah, I would have to agree.

00:15:04.842 --> 00:15:06.300
So on "MythBusters"
and "Head Rush"

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.130
you've had a chance to recreate
and test some cool science.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.105
What is the most
unexpected result,

00:15:11.105 --> 00:15:13.990
if you can choose just one
that surprised you and was

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.510
not what you were planning for?

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.410
KARI BYRON: There's so
many different ones,

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.790
and I've talked
about them a lot.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.380
Like bull in a China shop.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.070
I couldn't believe
bulls were graceful.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.490
I couldn't believe elephants
were actually afraid of mice.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.350
I couldn't believe that an
ancient Chinese system using

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:34.190
drums buried in the ground
actually would trigger,

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.050
you could hear somebody
tunneling from far away

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.820
from this old ancient system.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.199
But the most
surprising I had was--

00:15:42.199 --> 00:15:43.740
I don't think I ever
talked about it.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.030
But on "Head Rush" I
had a science advisor

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:54.170
that had this experiment for
me where it was heating water

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.300
in sort of an Erlenmeyer.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.930
And then he told me
to put a lid on it.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.310
And I was like, I feel like
that's a pressure vessel,

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.254
but you know what,
you're the science guy.

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:06.072
And then my gut kept telling
me, this is a bad idea.

00:16:06.072 --> 00:16:07.280
This is a really bad idea is.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.740
He's like no, no, no, no, no.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.906
I've done this before, I've
done it a million times.

00:16:10.906 --> 00:16:13.100
I'm like OK, he's the
scientist, what do I know?

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.372
So I made this experiment.

00:16:15.372 --> 00:16:17.080
And I put my head down
close because they

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.750
wanted to get a shot, and then
I stood up and it exploded.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:26.680
And it burned across my stomach
so that the skin fell off.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.110
And I have like kind
of a scar the shape

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.290
of a wolf, which
is kind of cool.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:36.290
But it was a really
important moment for me.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.960
Because it shook me,
because I feel like there's

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.190
this psychology that you think
if the camera is rolling,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.030
you can't get hurt.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.440
If the camera is rolling,
nothing can go wrong.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.260
And I also, I
didn't trust my gut.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.940
And I only got hurt in a
really uncomfortable way right

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.800
before you have
to go on vacation

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.870
to a Hawaiian island That sucked
because the skin was coming

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.370
off.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:05.339
But it was a small price
to pay for a new awareness

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:09.569
where I could realize OK, you've
got to actually stay safe.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.880
Even if the cameras are
rolling, trust your gut.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.000
And just because somebody
has the credentials,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.805
doesn't mean they're right.

00:17:15.805 --> 00:17:18.430
JAMES MOREHEAD: So I'm going to
ask you a couple more questions

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.794
then open it up to the
Googlers, so start thinking.

00:17:20.794 --> 00:17:24.172
Ask good questions.

00:17:24.172 --> 00:17:26.060
So on "Pumpkin
Chunkin" and "LDRS"

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.805
you've had the chance to meet
some really interesting people.

00:17:28.805 --> 00:17:31.180
And if you're not familiar
with "Pumpkin Chunkin," that's

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.450
this event where you hurl a
pumpkin really, really far.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.050
Crazy.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.990
KARI BYRON: By any
mechanical means possible.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.980
So we're talking catapults,
trebuchets, air cannons.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.720
It just, it can't
be like rockets.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.839
And they've gone over
a mile, a pumpkin.

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:52.130
JAMES MOREHEAD: And then on
"Large and Dangerous Rocket

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.302
Ships," people take
pretty much anything

00:17:54.302 --> 00:17:56.260
and turn it into these
ridiculous rocket ships,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.070
and also have rockets
go super high.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.180
So when you've met these--
both really cool shows,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.220
check them out.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.470
What have you learned
about the people

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.522
behind these crazy,
insane stunts,

00:18:06.522 --> 00:18:08.980
now that you've had a chance
to talk to them and meet them?

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.530
What makes them tick?

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.060
KARI BYRON: I mean, I have
a great respect for anybody

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.910
who follows a passion,
especially weird passions.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.250
And the fact that these
guerrilla engineers are just

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.510
sitting in their garage
and this is their hobby

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.390
to create a huge
trebuchet to lob

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.650
a pumpkin and their
whole year is dedicated

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.280
to that, it's so much fun.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.040
Because they're the
good kind of crazy.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.670
They're using science
and engineering

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.820
in a wild and cool way.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.810
And they turn it
into a family event.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.420
Like everybody
brings their kids.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.940
And kids get into
the physics of it.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.350
And it's some of that
unintentional learning

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.940
that I always love.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.140
Where it's the cheese
on the broccoli,

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.240
it makes it taste good.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.972
What, I learned something?

00:18:55.972 --> 00:18:57.930
JAMES MOREHEAD: And on
your most recent project

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.270
with the Travel Channel,
"Thrill Factor," also very cool.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.330
Looks like a blast.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.480
How did you convince Tory
to vomit and pass out

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.730
on a stunt plane to show
the effects of G-Force?

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:08.490
KARI BYRON: I mean,
I didn't really

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.865
tell him to vomit and pass it.

00:19:09.865 --> 00:19:11.350
That's wasn't like me.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.380
JAMES MOREHEAD: It's
fantastic, watch it.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.588
KARI BYRON: Well, Tory and
I are really good friends.

00:19:15.588 --> 00:19:17.010
And we do a lot
of shows together,

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:21.640
because we're complete
and total opposites.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.860
Its really fun.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.370
And he was the one that
brought the stunt planes to us,

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.500
because he met a rich guy
that had stunt planes.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.280
And he's like let's go out
there to Vegas and do this.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.270
And I was a little dubious
because it seems crazy.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.090
But Tory has a
certain kind of charm

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:40.875
where it's sort of
like his men friends--

00:19:40.875 --> 00:19:43.280
you know men get where
they love each other,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.600
but they want to
torture each other?

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.350
So we go up in the
planes and he actually

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.750
has a really great
resistance to G-LOC,

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.080
and he gets to the
point of fighter pilot

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.250
before he passes out.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.550
And I think that made the
pilot sort of challenged.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:01.140
He's like oh, you
haven't passed out yet?

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.870
We're going to
make you pass out.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.101
And then after I watched
Tory pass out, tumble.

00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:08.850
They basically just
turned off the engines

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.320
and let the plane tumble.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.090
And it was insane.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.150
And I look over and like
oh my god, that's awful.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.271
How did he do that?

00:20:16.271 --> 00:20:17.770
He's like oh, you
want to do it now?

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.080
It's like no, no.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.940
Turned off the
plane, it tumbled.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.890
Mind you, none of
this made it to air.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.180
I've suffered for nothing.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:30.280
Tumbled into the plane
and then just puked.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.960
And then as I'm getting off
the plane with my puke bag

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.850
and the Travel Channel
crew is down there

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.870
they're like, all
right, so how was that?

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.820
I'm like [GAGGING].

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.230
We both had to sit-in
a dark room for an hour

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.490
before they could do
interviews and stuff with us.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.340
And we had wanted to get the
plane part out of the way,

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.330
so we didn't do any of
the preliminary stuff

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.020
just yet like walking in.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.250
And so I had to get
the puke out of my hair

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.040
and get the mascara
out from under my eyes

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.022
so I could pretend like
it hadn't happened yet.

00:21:02.022 --> 00:21:03.980
JAMES MOREHEAD: So one
final question, then I'm

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.590
going to hand it
off to the audience.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.550
So if you could have a cameo
in one of the following,

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.060
which would you choose
and why-- "Star Wars,"

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:17.880
"Star Trek", "Game of
Thrones," or "Sharknado

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.400
KARI BYRON: Now if it was
based entirely on fashion,

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.920
the dresses and the outfits
they wear "Game of Thrones"

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.164
is awesome.

00:21:24.164 --> 00:21:25.580
But the women don't
fare too well.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.580
It's a little violent.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:32.130
So I mean, I would
clearly pick "Star Wars"

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.890
because like Leia is--
I won't spoil the news.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.510
They're leaders, they're
warriors, and they're equals,

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.560
and they get to fly cool planes.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.060
JAMES MOREHEAD: How has that
movie-- because we were talking

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.240
about this already-- how
has that movie affected

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.040
your daughter?

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.880
What impact did Rey have?

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.380
KARI BYRON: I have
a seven-year-old.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.350
So when we went to see
the movie she had no idea.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.580
She hadn't watched any
of the "Star Wars."

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.480
And we went with my nephew
who was five and so excited.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.860
And we went to the theater
and she's like oh yeah,

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.370
this will be cool.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:07.270
And then when it turned out
that Rey appeared and she

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.640
was the main character my
daughter yelled in the back

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.700
"she's a girl!"

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.310
Every body is laughing.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.850
After that, she went home,
she made a wrapping paper

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:17.890
lightsaber.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:22.610
And she just actually threw
away all her princesses.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.017
Don't tell Disney.

00:22:24.017 --> 00:22:25.100
We didn't throw them away.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.016
We took all of our
princesses and we gave them

00:22:27.016 --> 00:22:28.140
to a younger cousin.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.015
And it was all
about "Star Wars."

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:30.890
JAMES MOREHEAD: Cool.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:31.350
That's cool.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.808
Same thing happened
to my daughter.

00:22:32.808 --> 00:22:33.630
So very cool.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.710
All right, so I
have a helper here

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.190
with a microphone and the
Dory, if there are any Dory.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.830
There are some.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.925
All right I will-- just
go in audience first

00:22:41.925 --> 00:22:43.300
and I will look
through the Dory.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.860
The Dory, by the way, is
our internal mechanism

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.030
for people watching on live
stream to ask questions.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.700
So I will look through those
for those on the live stream.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.260
KARI BYRON: OK.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.050
JAMES MOREHEAD: All
right, so we'll go

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:51.930
to an audience question first.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:52.590
Yes?

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.570
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Erica.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.260
I actually have three
daughters, seven, 10, and 12.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:02.990
And also very similar to
you, engineering, arts sort

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.180
of by whole life I've
kind of been in there,

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.540
so I understand the desire.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.270
I wanted to know
if you have heard

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.250
of what's called SheHeroes,
because I think that modeling

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.950
is sort of a really key
thing for our daughters.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.690
And so there's a
program called SheHeroes

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.870
where people like you
and regular people

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.640
do little video
clips and give models

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.510
to young kids, young girls,
for like being cool and being

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:30.215
cool in science.

00:23:30.215 --> 00:23:31.090
I was curious if you.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:31.920
KARI BYRON: I
hadn't heard of it,

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.919
but I will definitely
put that on my looksies.

00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:34.710
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:35.870
KARI BYRON: I'll Google it.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:38.850
AUDIENCE: Google it,
like having you involved

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.570
in that would be awesome.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:41.070
SheHeroes.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.600
KARI BYRON: Is that
something you do?

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.641
AUDIENCE: I am friends
with somebody who does it,

00:23:44.641 --> 00:23:47.010
so if you want the connection
I'm happy to set you up.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:47.520
JAMES MOREHEAD: All right.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.686
AUDIENCE: But it is a very
cool program for anybody.

00:23:49.686 --> 00:23:52.890
JAMES MOREHEAD: We've had
our first question and plug.

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.730
I'm going to the Dory.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.870
So what's the
coolest skill you've

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.791
learned on "MythBusters" that
you've used outside the show?

00:24:00.791 --> 00:24:03.647
KARI BYRON: Oh,
should I say this?

00:24:03.647 --> 00:24:05.730
JAMES MOREHEAD: Now wait,
as soon as someone says,

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:06.480
should I say this?

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.280
The answer, of course,
we need to hear it.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.940
KARI BYRON: Well, as
I love to do artwork.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.660
I used to really
love the impressions

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.230
that black powder would make
after you exploded them.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:23.395
So I do some black
powder painting now

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:25.270
at an undisclosed location
that is completely

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:28.124
safe and completely legal.

00:24:28.124 --> 00:24:31.190
And it's really,
it's a fun medium

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.230
to work with when you
know how to do it safely.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.906
And I learned how
to do it safely.

00:24:34.906 --> 00:24:36.530
And I learned that
you can get anything

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:41.339
on the internet from China
for your artistic passions.

00:24:41.339 --> 00:24:43.130
JAMES MOREHEAD: So I
have to build on that.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.670
Because the explosions in
"MythBusters" in slow-mo

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.930
are phenomenal.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.580
What is your favorite
all time explosion.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.810
KARI BYRON: Oh, that's easy.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.660
Because people always ask me
about my favorite explosions.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.420
And you know, there's that
pushing power of AN/FO,

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.120
and then C4 is sort of
like a dirty quick one.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.490
But like I love, it might
actually be an ignition.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:10.160
But when we shot guns
at a propane tank

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.650
it made this gorgeous billowing
fiery probably not great

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:19.530
for the environment cloud that
in slow motion kind of rolled

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:20.760
and it was just beautiful.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.390
That and coffee creamer
also an ignition.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.450
When coffee creamer, we
exploded it into the air

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.350
and lit it with
a flare also just

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.220
like a fuel based kind of
Hollywood style explosion.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.070
The kind of thing
that you actually

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.900
expect to see as an explosion.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:36.940
JAMES MOREHEAD: Cool.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.210
Audience?

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.080
Yes?

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.760
AUDIENCE: I'm curious what your
favorite myth was that either

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.510
never actually made it to
air or never got selected

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.570
to even be done at all.

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.765
KARI BYRON: We definitely
had a couple that

00:25:49.765 --> 00:25:52.140
didn't make it to air either
because they were ridiculous

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.098
or we couldn't do them.

00:25:53.098 --> 00:25:56.570
We tried to do this one called
squash weightlifter, where

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.950
the idea was that one of those
giant pumpkins from Monterey

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.630
had the capacity
to lift a car if it

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:06.361
grew underneath it, because
it had that kind of strength.

00:26:06.361 --> 00:26:08.120
But turns out all of
us have black thumbs

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.370
and we couldn't grow anything.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.190
And we had this
like garden set up.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.870
We tried it twice, three times.

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:16.010
We had this garden set up
with the best hydroponics,

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.470
because San Francisco.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.060
And its like crazy
grow-light disco den.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.520
We had the seeds from
some champion pumpkins.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.720
And we couldn't get
anything bigger then this.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.730
And we tried and tried.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.620
But it was really fun because
we had that crazy garden.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.770
And I enjoyed the-- it
was a little zen going out

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:36.320
there and trying to garden.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.090
But I guess the environment
just wasn't supporting it.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.170
AUDIENCE: So recently
Google has been

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.690
doing things like Deep Dream and
Magenta with some basic forays

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.140
into AI creating art and music.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.660
What would be some
combinations of science and art

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.090
that are just completely
side sci-fi that you would

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.550
like to see become reality?

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:02.650
KARI BYRON: I would like my own
slave robot android, for sure

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.930
that could light the explosions
in my black powder painting

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.670
closer than I could.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.610
That is a very complex
question, I like it.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.160
Have you ever seen, I think
they're called wind beasts?

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.326
JAMES MOREHEAD: Windibeasts?

00:27:16.326 --> 00:27:19.130
KARI BYRON: Wind beasts,
those giant kinetic sculptures

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:22.180
that move in the wind.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.410
That's my favorite kinetic
application of science to art.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.700
I thought that was so beautiful.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.290
AI scares me though.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:33.000
JAMES MOREHEAD: These
aren't real people.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.750
KARI BYRON: I mean,
wouldn't be surprised.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.105
JAMES MOREHEAD:
We're actually, we're

00:27:36.105 --> 00:27:37.200
testing the advancement of AI.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.990
KARI BYRON: I'm the beta
tester on the scary AI?

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.240
JAMES MOREHEAD: Yes.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:39.800
We're going to go back--

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.110
KARI BYRON: They all
look like regular people.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:42.260
JAMES MOREHEAD: Well, we're
going to analyze the laughs

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.718
and make sure they were laughing
at the appropriately part.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.680
AUDIENCE: So are
there any scenes

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.040
from "MythBusters" that were
like edited out that you really

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.650
wish could have made it to air?

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.100
KARI BYRON: Oh, I
mean there's so many.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.700
But I could tell you a
super embarrassing one

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.330
that was kind of funny.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:05.350
There was a point where
we were out in the desert.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.630
And tensions were high, it
was hot, people were fighting.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:13.390
It got really sort
of just very tense.

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:17.330
And so I walked up into the
middle of a tense conversation

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.255
and just walked up to Grant
and went, put my finger.

00:28:20.255 --> 00:28:23.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:26.170
And they laughed
very hard as I--

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.220
you know that means
you toot, right?

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:28.925
OK.

00:28:28.925 --> 00:28:31.950
Well, I just felt like I
couldn't figure out anything

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:32.790
to make this better.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:37.130
I was like nothing
better than a girl fart.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:41.300
Girl farts are funnier
than dog farts.

00:28:44.722 --> 00:28:47.732
JAMES MOREHEAD: I'm not
sure how to go after that.

00:28:47.732 --> 00:28:50.010
So I'm not going to
pivot off the question.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:51.950
So off the Dory,
what advice-- we'll

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:53.158
take a couple more questions.

00:28:53.158 --> 00:28:55.734
What advice would you give to
a young aspiring scientists,

00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:57.400
but I'm going to
modify it a little bit,

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.790
a young aspiring
female scientist.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.440
KARI BYRON: Find a mentor
and find an internship.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.640
Find someone doing what
you want to be doing.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.900
Because likely, they
will help you out.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.930
And people love talking
about themselves.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:14.190
I've been doing it for
like half an hour now.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.680
You can usually get
in good with somebody,

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.170
and they're likely
to help you out.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:20.250
And everybody loves an intern.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:20.972
They work hard.

00:29:20.972 --> 00:29:22.430
They're trying to
prove themselves.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:23.970
And they are cheap or free.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.249
So you can get your
foot in the door,

00:29:26.249 --> 00:29:27.790
you can get some
experience, find out

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.600
if it's what you
really want to do.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.870
And I mean, that's how I
started on "MythBusters"

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:36.170
is just a lot of
exploiting of free labor.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.740
AUDIENCE: So you started
with the sculpture

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.685
and now you've mentioned
like black powder

00:29:40.685 --> 00:29:44.580
stuff, the kinetic art, is
sculpture still-- now TV, film,

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.740
et cetera-- is sculpture
still your favorite

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.490
or do you have a new
favorite type of art?

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.040
KARI BYRON: No,
I love sculpture.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:54.611
I think in 3-D. Like I'm a much
better sculptor than someone

00:29:54.611 --> 00:29:55.110
who draws.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:58.700
If I have an idea of something,
how I want it to look at I

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.270
can make it clay better
than I can draw it.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.190
So for me, it's very calming.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.000
And I'm a bit of a multi-tasker.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.540
So I will do sculptures while I
listen to podcasts or watch TV

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.807
or try to have meetings
when they are on not Skype,

00:30:14.807 --> 00:30:15.890
because they can see that.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.530
And I still make a lot of them.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.670
And I use them as a
terrifying parental learning

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.160
tools for my daughter.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.220
I make these things called
Manners Monsters or Behavior

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.710
Beasties to break her of habits.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.340
Such as for a while she wasn't,
when she was much smaller,

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.397
she had a tendency not
to flush the toilet.

00:30:33.397 --> 00:30:35.980
So we made a poop monster that
looked like it was crawling out

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.605
of the toilet, that I said
if it stays in there too long

00:30:38.605 --> 00:30:41.340
it comes to life.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:45.070
We had booger monsters that
you know, eat the boogers

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.920
in your nose.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.150
And if you go in there
and steal their food

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.562
they're going to crawl out
your nose and look for food.

00:30:50.562 --> 00:30:52.520
They might crawl in your
ear and eat your brain

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.860
and you'll never learn to read.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.000
So we make the little--
I have monsters

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.070
for almost every bad behavior.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.410
So I've got a ton of them now.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:01.890
And they're creepy
and little kind

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.350
of Tim Burtony looking things.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.089
They cured her of
nail biting real fast.

00:31:07.089 --> 00:31:09.380
JAMES MOREHEAD: All right,
who would back a Kickstarter

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.482
campaign for a poop monster?

00:31:12.482 --> 00:31:14.440
KARI BYRON: It's about
terrifying your children

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.240
into good behaviors.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.940
JAMES MOREHEAD: We're
going to take one more Dory

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.440
and one more live question and
then we have time for a short

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.220
meet and great.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.928
So I'm going to modify
this a little bit.

00:31:23.928 --> 00:31:25.530
So what's the most
dangerous thing

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.720
not that you did on the
show, but that you didn't

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.830
do on the show
because you finally

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.800
figured out, this would probably
be too dangerous to film?

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.010
KARI BYRON: Anything
Tory ever suggest ever.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.965
End

00:31:37.965 --> 00:31:39.590
JAMES MOREHEAD: All
right, that's good.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.040
We'll bring Tory
in for a follow up

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.498
and that will be
the lead question.

00:31:42.498 --> 00:31:45.086
All right, we had one
more to the microphone.

00:31:45.086 --> 00:31:46.460
AUDIENCE: Back to
the art side, I

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.030
do follow your
black powder work,

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:50.200
tried to dabble a
little bit in it myself

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.700
and caused a little bit more
fiery explosions probably

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.090
in not a safe manner as you.

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:59.190
But for the art side,
you've done a lot advocation

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:01.660
for technology, engineering,
and all of that.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.810
How do you feel companies
like this, like we

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.010
have a maker space here.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.150
It's called the Garage.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.690
And do you try to advocate
that artistic side

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:13.460
towards a lot of those
ends too, those tech sides?

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.430
Because I feel like
sometimes that's

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.820
lost when there's a lot
of science and engineering

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.270
and all that, you
might lose some

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:24.040
of that ingenuity or the fun
of art that comes with it.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.540
Is that something
that you often see

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.390
or is there anything
that advocating-wise

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:28.500
that you do on it?

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.499
KARI BYRON: Well, I love
living in the Bay Area,

00:32:30.499 --> 00:32:34.590
because we are clearly a
strange bubble of people.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.090
Here it's not STEM, it's STEAM.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.400
We put the Art in the STEM.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.830
Because I mean, mathematicians
are artists and scientists

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:42.420
are artists.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.480
And I think that the maker
movement is incredible.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.660
And I love how DIY and sort
of the whole sort of Etsy

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.980
generation is kind of bringing
it back to an arty form.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.320
And the Maker Faire is
getting bigger every year.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.240
And it's so cool to
see people applying

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.080
all of their different
brains into something

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.610
even that's ridiculous
but beautiful and cool.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.280
I love the maker movement.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.580
JAMES MOREHEAD: Well, I want to
thank you for an awesome visit

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.190
to Google.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.950
KARI BYRON: Oh my
god, thank you.

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:16.090
JAMES MOREHEAD: It
was totally fun.

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:17.440
KARI BYRON: This
has has been fun.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:17.720
JAMES MOREHEAD: Just
[? so you know ?]

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.730
that we fed Kari.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.470
She didn't have to pay
for the food, shocker.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:24.582
Took her on her tour, and
it was really exciting

00:33:24.582 --> 00:33:25.540
to have you here today.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.160
Thank you very much.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.980
And good luck with-- I know the
things you can't talk about,

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.670
but Kari has some
cool stuff coming.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.040
I'll leave it at that.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.220
KARI BYRON: Are we talking
about our new show?

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.980
This week we make
an announcement.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.830
So me, Tory, and Grant
are back together

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.250
in another nerdy endeavor.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.600
Thanks.
