00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.520
What you’re looking at right now is an optical
illusion.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.460
While I’m talking, focus on the center,
and think about how easy it is to fool your

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.460
eyes and your brain.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.460
 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.670
 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.450
Hello easily tricked simpletons, Jules here
for Dnews.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.210
Before we begin, I’d just like you to know
that your eyes are lying to you.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.210
Right now.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.550
Sight is simply a perception of reality which
we assume to be true because practically,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.609
it works.

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.010
But what you think you’re seeing is actually
reflected light waves, flipped upside down,

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.940
reversed, then converted into electrical impulses,
reinterpreted and finally projected as visual

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.940
consciousness.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.700
This whole process takes a little less than
a tenth-of-a-second.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.230
Now, that tenth of a second delay is way too
long.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.020
If you’re an early ancestor hunting fish
and your fishing spear is off by a tenth of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.680
a second, you’ll probably miss.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.850
So to bridge the gap, and to make all of its
processing duties easier, your brain makes

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.350
predictions about where things in your field
of vision will be, and sometimes it just makes

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.100
things up all on its own.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.660
That’s where optical illusions come in.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.930
Optical illusions are basically hacking your
eye-to-brain connection by predicting where

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.460
your brain is likely to screw up and send
you false information.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.280
There are effectively three types of optical
illusions: literal, physiological, and cognitive.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.610
A literal illusion is the simplest, and can
be demonstrated in this drawing by American

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.729
illustrator Charles Allan Gilbert called All
is Vanity.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.720
At first glance, the image appears to be of
a skull, but as your eyes adjust to the details,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.570
it is in fact a woman sitting at her vanity
mirror.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.940
There are no skulls in the image whatsoever,
but nearly all viewers see a skull.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.940
Why?

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.600
Well, as I said earlier, your brain does everything
it can to bridge the tenth-of-a-second delay,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.790
and one of these methods is by filling in
details based on pattern recognition.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.680
In this instance, the image in front of you
has enough “skull-like” patterns that

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.920
your brain initially reads it as a skull,
which saves it the energy of processing every

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.030
shape and color and angle.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.200
Literal illusions work by approximating a
different object or setting closely enough

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.869
to fool your brain for a moment before all
the details settle in.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.479
The next type is a little trickier, and is
called a physiological illusion.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.650
Take a look at this grid and try to count
the grey dots at the intersections.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.650
What’s that?

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.220
They keep disappearing?

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.220
Gotcha!

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.370
But this illusion, which was discovered by
Ludimar Hermann in 1870 and is thus called

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.110
the “Hermann grid”, is not based on your
brain’s mistakes, but the limitations of

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.110
your retina.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.080
Specifically, it is believed to be based on
something called “lateral inhibition”.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.319
See, light-receiving neurons in your eye -- photoreceptors
-- are arranged in rows.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.160
When one of them is stimulated by light, the
surrounding neurons are inhibited and respond

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.320
less strongly.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.440
Your eye does this to filter out a lot of
light noise, keeping the most dominant neurons

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.709
brightly lit and creating contrast with less
dominant light sources.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.819
In the Hermann grid, at the intersections,
your receptors are flooded with white light

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.230
from four sides.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.069
This creates a lot of lateral inhibition,
and the receptors in those areas respond less

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.370
strongly, making the intersection appear darker.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.850
But, if you look directly at any one intersection,
the grey disappears.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.989
This is because the center of your vision
has a significantly higher concentration of

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.700
photoreceptors and creates a clearer picture
than anywhere else in your eye.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.150
And finally, there are cognitive illusions.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.560
These are, in my opinion, the coolest, because
they take place far away from either your

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.920
eye or the purely visual processing center
of your brain.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.040
These illusions happen in your understanding
of the image itself and your existing knowledge

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.160
of the world.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.549
Look at this famous staircase, known as the
Penrose stairs, which directly influenced

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.260
famous optical illusion maker, MC Escher.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.659
The trick with both Penrose and Escher is
that the image is physically consistent with

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.680
how a staircase works, but practically impossible.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.290
You’d be going down or up forever.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.290
According to the father and son team which
created the staircase, "each part of the structure

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.790
is acceptable as representing a flight of
steps but the connexions are such that the

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.659
picture, as a whole, is inconsistent."

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.950
The image doesn’t make any sense while having
no actual flaws.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.739
Your brain doesn’t know what to do with
the conflicting information, and so it accepts

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.640
a totally paradoxical image.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.640
Gottem!

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.430
Ultimately, your brain and eyes take a lot
of shortcuts for efficiency, but at the expense

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.759
of accuracy.

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:22.150
And by the way, although these are the most
prevalent theories we have right now, almost

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.610
all of these explanations for optical illusions
have been challenged.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.990
The reality is, we’re not great at figuring
out why our eyes and brains are so screwed

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.990
up.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.020
So the next time you see something crazy,
it’s more likely that it’s your own faulty

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:47.080
processing system, and not a total collapse
of the universe and its functions.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:05:07.230
What are your favorite optical illusions?
