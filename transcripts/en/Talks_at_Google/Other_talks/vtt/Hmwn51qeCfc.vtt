00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:04.310
DAVID EHRLICH: I know that this
is not necessarily a true

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.400
story, but it is based on your
personal experiences working

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.310
at a short term home.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.860
Can you talk a little
bit about when--

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.550
what about your experience
there you

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.590
really wanted to convey?

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.710
And when in the process--

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.130
was it as soon as you left the
job there that you knew you

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.676
needed to make a movie
about this?

00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:24.990
DUSTIN CRETTON: No, when I was
working there, I wasn't really

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.770
able to think beyond that day
and trying to survive that

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.810
day, and trying to survive that
week, trying to get over

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.030
the fact that I was constantly
terrified and constantly

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.990
wanting to quit.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:43.190
But over the course of those
two years, it was a very

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.900
impacting experience for me.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.160
And it stuck with me all the
way through college, or

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.470
through my masters
program in film.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.120
And so it was about three years
later when I had the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.660
assignment of doing
a thesis film.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.760
I went back through my old
journals that I'd written

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.870
during my time when I
was working there.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.300
And I think enough time had
passed at that point that I

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.320
was able to organize some of
those thoughts into a story,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.210
which was a short
film initially.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.460
That was my thesis.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.945
And then later, that transformed
in the feature.

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.750
DAVID EHRLICH: When you went
to transform the short, did

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.630
you just knock it all over
and start from scratch?

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.360
Or did you organically build
it from there with similar

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.740
characters?

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.090
DUSTIN CRETTON: I had to knock
it over because I initially

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.570
tried to expand it from the
short film and use all the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.390
same characters.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.850
But it just felt boring.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.680
I felt like I was re-doing the
same thing, and not sure it

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.140
was initially meant to be
turned into a feature.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.190
So as soon as I changed the main
character from a male to

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.310
a female protagonist,
everything--

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.430
the whole world changed.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.548
Cool socks, by the way.

00:02:07.548 --> 00:02:09.580
DAVID EHRLICH: Oh, geez.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.970
I don't think that I remembered
that I was going to

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.860
be doing anything in public
today when I put these on.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.970
DUSTIN CRETTON: I love
those socks.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.210
DAVID EHRLICH: So now, a
question for Miss Larson.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.340
I think it's sort of an obvious
question, but one well

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.660
worth asking because the
performances are so--

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.730
there's an intimacy that's
fostered between you and the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.490
other characters and it seems
so lived in the entire

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.070
performance.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.550
And so I guess I'm just
wondering what sort of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.420
preparation you did, who you
may have spoken with

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.180
beforehand to really get
into that world?

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.880
BRIE LARSON: Yeah, there's a
few different aspects that

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.400
needed to be understood
and explored

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.130
before we started shooting.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.740
One is all of the subtext that's
throughout the film,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.910
which is a lot fueled
by her past.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.120
So I had to think about that,
create that, which involved

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.460
also sitting down with John.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.050
And we went to dinner.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.600
And Dustin gave us these little
conversation starters

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.200
that got us talking about our
childhoods, and fears of being

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.310
a parent, and then specifics
about our relationship.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.600
And then, the other aspect
of it was her job.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.250
And I shadowed at a facility,
as well as just openly spoke

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.230
with some people that have
Grace's job, and then sat down

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.920
with each one of the kids and
talked with them a little bit

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.730
about what information I would
know about them to understand

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.140
better how Grace would relate
with them, how she would--

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.030
what her expectations were of
each one of them, and their

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.380
sensitivities.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.340
And all of those combined, and
then Norwegian black metal to

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.650
be able to listen to before
starting each scene kind of

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.700
informed the whole thing.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.470
DAVID EHRLICH: New age,
is that what you said?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.850
BRIE LARSON: No, Norwegian
black metal.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.040
DAVID EHRLICH: Ah, I see.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.960
Ah, that makes sense.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.070
New age would also make sense.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.890
JOHN GALLAGHER: New
age would be cool.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.410
DAVID EHRLICH: And a question
for both of the actors here.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.690
There's such a performative
quality about the job, as it's

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.860
required, not as actors but
to work as counselors.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.820
Here, I think as it's seen very
clearly in the movie,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.250
have to put on masks to
go to work every day.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.280
And Rami's character is without
the mask, hasn't built

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.560
that mask for himself yet.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.120
And so as actors, was that
something that helped you get

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.260
into the role, understanding
what that's like to always

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.520
feel like you're performing?

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.550
DUSTIN CRETTON: What a
great observation.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.320
DAVID EHRLICH: It's the socks.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.730
JOHN GALLAGHER: I think for my
character, that is almost

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.620
maybe slightly more obvious
because he uses humor as a

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.470
kind of tactic, a way to
distract and deflect and

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.700
comfort the kids in a way that
I think was fascinating.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.560
Because it's the idea of how
can you be a really good

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.040
friend to these kids, but also
stay a disciplinarian and stay

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.620
trustworthy?

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.640
And there's something about
coming to their level and

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.900
goofing around with them and
joking around with them that

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.220
disarms them in a way.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.160
But then also, when the tables
turn, you then have their

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.030
trust in a way.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.010
So that when it comes time to
crack the whip a little bit,

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.010
if you need to raise your voice
or restrain someone

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.640
that's freaking out, you're
able to do that little

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.900
balancing act.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.330
That was something that I
shadowed at the same facility

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.950
that Brie did.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.210
And that was something that I
saw was very prevalent there

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.760
was keeping things light.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.790
Not in a way that's
disrespectful, but just kind

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.440
of joking and keeping a light
air throughout the day to try

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.870
and just get through
the day without

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.560
any tantrums or anything.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.730
DUSTIN CRETTON: I think it's
really cool that you bring

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.730
that up because I was
just talking about

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.600
this earlier today.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:01.756
One of my supervisors was a
female who, when I talked to

00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:04.360
her or hung out with her outside
of the walls of that

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.000
place, she had a very
small frame.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.620
And her voice was very quiet.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.700
She was some kind of
shy personality.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.370
And when she went through the
gates to be a supervisor for

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:27.540
this place, I could literally
see her stand outside and take

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.820
a breath and put on this thing,
this personality, this

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.540
somewhat fictional-- but
it is a part of her.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.870
But she puts on this armor.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:45.270
And when she would walk into
that place, she was a bad ass.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.630
And the kids respected her.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.630
She respected them.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:53.540
And she was a really incredible
supervisor and a

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.445
wonderful person to work for.

00:06:55.445 --> 00:06:57.990
So that was a cool
observation.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.690
DAVID EHRLICH: Yeah, especially
in context of

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.010
Grace's character and
that badass-ness.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.590
After a long summer of
superheroes, it's nice to see

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.880
something a little bit more
relatable in that vein.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.070
BRIE LARSON: The
real superhero.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.950
DAVID EHRLICH: Exactly.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.960
And to that end, were
there any points--

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.750
because there's a certain social
responsibility that you

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.260
guys may have felt while making
this that you wanted to

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.600
represent these kids in a way
that was honest and accurate,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.160
and maybe help people in their
situations realize that family

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.740
is a fluid idea, and that
there's always a

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.060
chance to have one.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.540
And I wonder, was there any
point in crafting the drama

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.530
and attending to the needs of
every scene that you felt that

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.230
what you wanted to do as
a writer or as an actor

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.470
interfered with a greater
responsibility to telling this

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.200
accurately?

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.160
DUSTIN CRETTON: All these
interesting questions!

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.760
BRIE LARSON: I think it wasn't
necessarily specifically about

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.510
the social issue of it.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.620
But any time I've found that I'm
playing a character, and

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.260
especially someone that you
spend a lot of time with, like

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.670
I had to with Grace, and you're
playing somebody who's

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.350
really struggling, you so badly
at a certain point want

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:13.770
to be above them and help them
and do what I would want her

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.340
to do, but not what
she actually does.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.200
And it becomes painful as the
vessel of her to continue to

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.040
throw yourself into a situation
knowing that it's

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.260
going to be painful, knowing
that it's counterproductive to

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.830
what is actually
good for them.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.600
Because you care about
them and love them.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.410
And there's been many
times where--

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.559
not during this film, but
another film in particular--

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.950
where I remember arguing for
a very long time with the

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.270
director about the ending.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.580
Like, my character's final scene
and the outcome of it,

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.929
and I argued for a long time.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.120
And he finally said, you
have to let this go.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.730
This has nothing
to do with you.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.850
You can't do what she wants.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.440
You can't do what you
want for her.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.060
It has to be what she wants.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:52.900
I was like, aw!

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.400
It's hard because you were
playing somebody.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.360
And you're inside them.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.280
But then, you also have this
weird perspective of being

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.880
almost outside of my body and
away from this character.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.010
And it's so important.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:11.420
And it's a strange balance to
play to just allow it to be

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.926
what she's going to be doing.

00:09:14.926 --> 00:09:18.490
DAVID EHRLICH: Mr. Gallagher,
not to type cast you as a nice

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.050
guy, but I think certainly the
rules I've seen you in

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.710
recently have genuinely been
decent human beings, which is

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:29.070
rare as defined in movies.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.570
Is there a unique challenge to
playing someone who is just

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.890
fundamentally decent, who
is not dealing with more

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.260
dramatic--?

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.210
JOHN GALLAGHER: Yeah, I think
the challenge is to make sure

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.090
that that stays believable.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.310
Because I think it's hard to
convince an audience that

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.420
there are saints in the
world nowadays.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.740
It's like tough.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.430
And especially in a small,
intimate movie that very much

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.140
is about real people, it
can be very easy to be

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.540
like, aw, come on.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.450
He would have left the
relationship by now.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.980
He would have been
out of there.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.375
Or I don't know if people
are thinking that.

00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:05.400
BRIE LARSON: They're like,
he's a pain in the ass.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:05.770
Get him--!

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.622
JOHN GALLAGHER: Oh my god, I
can't believe he's so patient!

00:10:07.622 --> 00:10:10.930
BRIE LARSON: He should be
running for the hills!

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.600
JOHN GALLAGHER: Because at a
certain point, I think that

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.880
can start to almost become
unrealistic in a way.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.600
But Dustin took care of that
challenge for me by the

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.570
beautiful reveal in the last
half of the film that you

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:28.220
actually see that this person
is a grown up product of the

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.670
foster care system working
for someone.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.520
And so you see why
that character is

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.480
selfless in that way.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.920
Because he almost did not have
a family, and is with this

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.890
person that he knows
needs one.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.040
And he wants to provide that.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:47.230
And so that, in this case, made
it kind of easy to live

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.100
inside that.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.220
And it just feels
good to be nice.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.270
And I wish I was as selfless
and good as the

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.210
character in the film.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:11:01.150
But Dustin created such a nice
atmosphere on set, and working

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:05.110
with those kids, it was not a
problem being nice to them

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.030
because they're just the best.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.710
DAVID EHRLICH: And the last time
I spoke with Dustin, we

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.290
talked a little bit about how
Rami's character, Nate, was

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.800
sort of his proxy.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.990
And I'm wondering, for you
guys, how much you saw of

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:24.780
Dustin in that character, if
Nate's innocence or whatnot,

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.230
if his sense of humor was--

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:32.120
how close it cleaved
to your director?

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.895
BRIE LARSON: I see a little bit
of Dustin in everybody in

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:42.360
it, just the tone of it and the
dry sense of humor and the

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.910
subtlety of it.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:48.220
And the thing that I personally
just gained from

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.880
working with him was the
ability to be, and it's

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.820
something that I don't--

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.550
maybe people do say this
to you all the time.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.010
And don't get a big
head about it.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:00.580
But he's not trying
to prove anything.

00:12:03.225 --> 00:12:07.240
He's very easy to be around,
and very nonjudgmental.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.290
And I think the film is unbiased
and nonjudgmental.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.310
DAVID EHRLICH: And I guess I'll
ask one more question

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.300
before we open it
up to the floor.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.860
But there are some great bike
riding scenes in this movie.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.630
And I think there's a long
tradition in the cinema of

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.520
bikes in movies.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.600
But you are one of the great
bike riding actresses, I

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.610
think, proven in this film?

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:29.657
BRIE LARSON: Would you
agree with it?

00:12:29.657 --> 00:12:31.485
I would think not.

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:33.320
I think there's some bike
riding that got cut out

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.720
because I wasn't very
good at it.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.950
DUSTIN CRETTON: There were a few
that got cut out because

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.450
Brie wasn't very
good at going--

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.765
she was really good
at going downhill.

00:12:41.765 --> 00:12:42.820
BRIE LARSON: I wasn't good
at going uphill.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.750
But we found out later--

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.000
DUSTIN CRETTON: But
it was a bad bike.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.240
BRIE LARSON: Yeah, it
was on a bad gear.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.620
DUSTIN CRETTON: Always
blame the bike.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.340
It was a bad bike.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.150
BRIE LARSON: I'm pretty
in shape.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.630
There's no--

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.790
I can ride a bike!

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.380
DUSTIN CRETTON: That's
not what I'm saying.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.980
I think the seat was too low, so
then your knees were coming

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.920
up too high.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.290
DAVID EHRLICH: But still,
it's very expressive.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.790
I'm in your character's head
when you're on that bike.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.020
So well done.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:05.725
BRIE LARSON: Thanks!

00:13:05.725 --> 00:13:08.715
DAVID EHRLICH: So does anyone
have any questions?

00:13:08.715 --> 00:13:10.200
Yes, sir?

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.314
AUDIENCE: So I have
a question about--

00:13:12.314 --> 00:13:14.160
I guess my question
has two parts.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.550
One, what was the casting
process like for the kids?

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.954
And then two, what
was the rehearsal

00:13:17.954 --> 00:13:21.980
process like for everybody?

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.745
DUSTIN CRETTON: Do I need
to repeat the question?

00:13:27.285 --> 00:13:29.990
So the question was about the
casting process for the kids,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.190
and then the rehearsal process
for everybody.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:39.650
The casting process for the kids
was fairly traditional in

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:47.040
that I sat in a room and
stressed out and freaked out

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.410
for three weeks thinking
how impossible this

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.390
task is going to be.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.850
Because it was impossible.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:01.120
It was very difficult to find
what we needed in the short

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.840
period of time that we had.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:09.310
And by some miracle, in every
occasion on every single

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:15.650
character at some point,
somebody came in and did

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.520
something in that performance
that made me forget I had

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.480
written those lines, and made me
forget even that I was in a

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.405
little room watching
an audition.

00:14:28.405 --> 00:14:31.760
And they moved me, made
me laugh, made me cry.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:39.380
And there was always just one
miracle that walked in.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.100
Kaitlyn Dever came in, and when
she left I was just--

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.520
I didn't even say bye, it was
a little awkward, because I

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.550
was just crying.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:51.040
And her scene was also a
very emotional scene.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.290
So we were both crying.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.090
And then she just said, OK!

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.550
And then she said, OK, bye!

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.010
And she left.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.140
And a version of that happened
with everybody.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.940
And thank goodness that their
schedules worked out.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.400
Because there was no option
two for any character.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.360
So that's how the casting
process went.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:19.230
The rehearsal process was less
about rehearsing scenes and

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.090
more about really getting to
know each other and build

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:22.920
relationships.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.410
And we had one day.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.520
And so we all got together.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.490
And we had some food.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.740
And then, we sat around
in a circle.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:39.650
And I had my friend Kevin who
works at a place very similar

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:47.270
to this and has been doing it
for I think 15 years or so, he

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:52.140
came up and everyone was able
to ask him questions.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.065
All the kids were able to tell
him about the characters they

00:15:55.065 --> 00:15:57.300
were playing, and then explain
their back story.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:04.160
And then he related to them
other stories that they could

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.190
pull from of real kids that he
knew and stories that he knew.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:14.610
And then, John, we did our first
attempt at playing that

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:19.550
game big booty, which was
horrible, but really fun.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:27.880
And I think what it did was
allowed all of our kids, it

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:33.830
allowed them to see John and
Brie be silly, and allowed

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:39.980
them to see that it's OK to be
silly, which is huge for this

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.010
film, and huge for I think
creating this environment that

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.530
is very safe and free.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:51.660
So thank goodness for all those
things somehow lining up

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:57.240
in this small project with a
very short window of prep.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.320
DAVID EHRLICH: A question that
I have to ask on behalf of

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.820
everyone I've spoken
to about the film.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.750
Did you work at short
term number 12?

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.569
Or did you just like the
alliteration for the title?

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.710
Very important.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.079
DUSTIN CRETTON: It's actually
not necessarily the name of

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.920
the place that I worked at.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:23.849
But there was a short term 12 at
the place that I worked at.

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:28.280
And there are short term
12's at other places.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.200
It's fairly common.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.300
There are short term facilities,
long term

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.670
facilities within
each group home.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.760
And the number refers
to the level of care

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.160
that the kids need.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.680
And so 14 is the highest--

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.900
in the system that I am familiar
with, 14 was the

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.090
highest, and 12 was the next
level down, and it keeps going

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.420
down from there.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.100
So there's also a long term 12,
and a long term 14, and a

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.340
short term 14.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.960
DAVID EHRLICH: I was also
wondering if you could talk a

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.080
little bit about the music.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.350
In the movie, there's a
beautiful soundtrack.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.270
And it sneaks up on you because
it's not especially

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:10.532
intrusive, but I think walking
away from the movie, you hear

00:18:10.532 --> 00:18:12.450
it resonating in your head,
or at least I did.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.960
So I'm curious as to how that
became part of the process,

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.160
how closely you worked
with the musician.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.855
And when you were writing the
scripts, or when you were on

00:18:21.855 --> 00:18:24.190
set, if you knew exactly
what tones you wanted

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.370
the score to have?

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:31.560
DUSTIN CRETTON: Joel P. West is
a friend of mine who I was

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.590
actually a fan of his music
before we became friends and

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:36.720
started working together.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:44.280
And so he's just a wonderful
person to create stuff with.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.840
And he came on set.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.920
He didn't really start composing
until we began

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.910
editing, but he did come on set
a couple of times to feel

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:59.480
what it was like to be in the
room while we were shooting

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.020
some of these more
intimate scenes.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:10.870
And I think he took that sense
of quiet back with him.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:17.630
And the idea of having a score
trickle in as opposed to slap

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.020
you in the face was
something that we

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.440
wanted from the beginning.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.700
And Joel, I think, just his
instincts are just he writes

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.360
really beautiful things that
I love listening to.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.280
And I would love to put on
in my car and just--

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.140
his music has always been,
whether it's his band, The

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.430
Tree Ring that he plays in, or
scores that he's done with me,

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:46.450
his music has always put
pictures into my brain.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:53.530
And so it's a really nice thing
to add into the movie.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.040
DAVID EHRLICH: Do you still
listen to it independently?

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.560
Do you put on the vinyl?

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.890
DUSTIN CRETTON: Yeah, I do.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.020
There's no vinyl yet.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.300
But the soundtrack actually I
think is being released next

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.230
Tuesday or something.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:08.060
You can find it on iTunes and
pre-order it and listen to

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.090
some of the tracks.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:10.460
It's really beautiful.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.300
DAVID EHRLICH: And have
you screened the

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.340
film for any kids?

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.666
I don't know what the
circumstances would be like,

00:20:18.666 --> 00:20:22.230
but for more direct feedback?

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.690
DUSTIN CRETTON: You mean
kids in the system?

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:24.240
DAVID EHRLICH: Sure.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:30.480
DUSTIN CRETTON: Yeah, we have
not taken the film to an

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.400
actual foster care facility
just because

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.630
it's a rated R movie.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:42.720
But I've had on a number of
occasions at festivals, the

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.220
second festival we played at,
I had a kid come up to me.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.270
He was 20.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:51.660
And he said he was aged out of
the system two years earlier.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:56.120
And he had been living in a
facility really similar to

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.020
this one his whole
teenage life.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:04.180
And when he said that,
I was like, oh, crap.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:10.100
Here comes the "you suck at
making movies" comments.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.690
And he was just very thankful.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:19.510
And he said he came in ready
to hate the movie.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:26.470
And thank god that he was very
moved and touched and thankful

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:34.470
that we had done something
that at least represents

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.880
enough of his experience
that he was able to

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.110
identify with the movie.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.320
So that was very
special for me.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.940
DAVID EHRLICH: Well, I think
that's all the time we have.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.200
But thank you guys so
much for coming and

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.070
talking about the film.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.450
It's great.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:48.356
BRIE LARSON: Thank you.

00:21:48.356 --> 00:21:49.330
JOHN GALLAGHER: Thank you.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:50.035
DAVID EHRLICH: It'll
be out next Friday.

00:21:50.035 --> 00:21:52.060
So tell your friends,
go see it again.
