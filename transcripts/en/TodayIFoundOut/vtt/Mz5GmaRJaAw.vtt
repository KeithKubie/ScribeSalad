00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.840
Depending on whom you ask, bimbo can be an
insult or just a description.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.300
Usually implying a lack of intelligence, and
often combined with physical attractiveness

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.010
and promiscuity, today bimbo is often used
to describe someone who isn’t that bright,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.110
and gets by on her (or his) looks (or wealth).

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.170
And this meaning isn’t too far away from
the word’s origins.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.100
The Oxford English Dictionary credits the
November issue of The American Magazine (page

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.180
69) as the first to put bimbo into print with
the line: “Nothing but the most heroic measures

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.100
will save the poor bimbo.”

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.010
Originally referring to a foolish or inconsequential
man, and in particular in a contemptuous way,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.980
bimbo was derived from the Italian word bambino
(baby), and it retained this meaning through

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.980
the early part of the 20th century, as seen
in P.G.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.780
Wodehouse’s Bill the Conqueror (1924) where
he referred to an entitled doofus as “the

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.780
bimbo Pyke.”

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.220
At this same time, bimbo was also applied
to women.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.449
In 1920, Irving Berlin published a song by
Grant Clarke (words) and Walter Donaldson

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.409
(music) titled My Little Bimbo Down on the
Bamboo Isle.

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.909
Although not explicit, this use of bimbo incorporates
the connotations of attractiveness and sexual

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.619
promiscuity, as the illustrated cover of the
sheet music depicts a carefree, pretty, dancing

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.299
woman making eyes with a leering young sailor.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.210
It was also being used to describe a voluptuous
woman in 1920, as shown in Irving Zeiman’s

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.030
The American Burlesque Show: “This Dix bimbo
is a dangerous woman . . . a sassy girl with

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.289
. . . more than a figure – a physique.”

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.979
Jack Conway of Vanity Fair is reputed to have
popularized the word with the connotation

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.130
of an unintelligent but sexually attractive
woman in the late 1920s, and by 1937, it was

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.459
being paired with blond hair, such as in Detective
Fiction Weekly’s: “We found Durken and

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.239
French LaSeur, seated at a table . . .with
a pair of blond bimboes beside them.”

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:56.209
Going in and out of fashion for several decades,
bimbo had a resurgence in the late 1980s,

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:01.309
with 1987 being dubbed “The Year of the
Bimbo” as a series of scandals that year

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:05.789
all prominently featured beautiful young women
right at the center of the controversies.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.929
Although likely not a bimbo, just pretty,
Fawn Hall, secretary to the man at the heart

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.370
of the Iran-Contra Affair, Lt. Col. Oliver
North, rose to prominence when she was called

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.700
to testify to Congress over document shredding.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.050
Tall, shapely and beautiful, with a mane of
blonde hair, while many assumed Ms. Hall was

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.299
Colonel North’s bimbo, there has never been
any evidence she was anything more than an

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.299
employee.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.719
Not stupid, but perhaps meeting some of the
criteria of a bimbo was Donna Rice.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:37.050
In 1987, popular Senator Gary Hart was the
leading contender for the Democratic nomination

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.730
for President when rumors that he was having
an extra-marital affair (a truly scandalous

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.060
accusation then) began to surface.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.239
When questioned about them, Senator Hart actually
challenged the media to put him under surveillance,

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.120
they did, and they discovered Ms. Rice.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.180
Blond and beautiful, Ms. Rice was observed
by two Miami Herald reporters leaving Mr.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.040
Hart’s townhome in Washington, D.C. (presumably
Mrs. Hart was not in the nation’s capital

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.040
at the time).

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.040
Although the two denied an affair, at about
this time, a photograph of Donna Rice, showing

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.470
a lot of leg and sitting on Senator Hart’s
lap, on a yacht called (and I’m not making

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.989
this up) Monkey Business was published.

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.980
Hart’s campaign was (excuse the pun) sunk;
he withdrew from the race, Massachusetts Governor

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.689
Michael Dukakis got the nomination, and he
lost to George H.W. Bush in the 1988 election.

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:28.079
Donna Rice refused most media offers, including
to do an interview with Playboy, but did become

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.540
the face of No Excuses jeans for awhile.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.420
Hands-down the bimbo-iest of the scandals
of 1987, however, was the stir created around

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.420
the PTL Club.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.799
Short for “praise the lord,” PTL was a
hugely popular Christian television show led

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.139
by evangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker.

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:50.019
Tammy Faye was a remarkable character with
dyed hair, a “baby-talk” voice and more

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.220
eye makeup than a roomful of Kardashians;
as such, she easily met the basic qualifications

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.220
of a bimbo.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.010
Her husband, the preacher, Jim, was also a
bimbo but for a different reason.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.560
Revealed in 1987, Jim and another man were
accused of drugging and raping a 21-year-old

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.099
church secretary, Jessica Hahn, in 1980.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.610
Although the resulting scandal ruined Jim’s
career, he proclaimed his innocence of any

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.620
crime, but eventually admitted he had a consensual
sexual relationship with the young lady.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.090
Of all the bimbos that year, Jessica Hahn
appears to have best met most of the criteria.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.340
Well-endowed with a voluptuous figure, big
80’s hair and lots of makeup, Jessica capitalized

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.380
on her scandal by building a career centered
around her sexuality, which included posing

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.110
in Playboy, appearing in Sam Kinison’s video
for “Wild Thing” and becoming a frequent

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.740
guest on The Howard Stern Show.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.490
Perfectly capturing the bimbos dilemma, Ms.
Hahn is quoted as saying, “people will always

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.650
consider me a cartoon character, a bimbo.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:05:10.610
They will never give me credit,” but that
“the scandal happened and I made the best

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.900
of it.”
