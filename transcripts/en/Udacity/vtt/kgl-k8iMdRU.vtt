00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.280
So personally, I would say no, this
is not a good way to reason over it.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.730
We talked about in the previous portion
of the lesson that Metacognition

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.176
uses the same strategies
that it reasons over.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.890
It reasons over case based reasoning.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.480
It reasons over means and analysis.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.190
It reasons over problem reduction.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.940
But it also uses case based reasoning,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.030
problem reduction, means and analysis
and the others to do that reasoning.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.970
So it really doesn't need an additional
layer, it's already equipped with

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.080
the ability to reason over case based
reasoning in the other methods, so

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.740
it can just reason over itself.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.890
&gt;&gt; This is really cool, so agents don't
need multiple levels of Metacognition

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.250
because Metacognition reasons
over itself recursively.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.310
In fact, current theories of
Metacognition all talk about

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.260
this kind of two layer system between
Deliberation and Metacognition.
