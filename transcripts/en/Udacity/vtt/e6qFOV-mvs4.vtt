00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.020
Here's a picture of what the visitor pattern looks like, there of

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.060
course is a client class, which is going to lead the operations to be applied.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.820
And then two categories of other classes.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.640
One is a category having to do with the data structure itself and

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.710
the other is a category of classes having to do with the visitors.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.870
As far as the data structure is concerned,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.590
there will be some kind of abstract element and then

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.180
concrete elements corresponding to the different parts of the data structure.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.170
The abstract element provides an abstract method called

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.500
accept with an argument visitor.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.840
That is, as you are navigating through the data structure and

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.600
you want to apply the operations you send the visitor,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.440
as an object, to each of the elements you come to.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.330
And it must accept that visitor, and

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.160
essentially call back to the visitor to perform the operations.
