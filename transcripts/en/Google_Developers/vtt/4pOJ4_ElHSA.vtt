00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.230
As a developer, I
enjoy writing code,

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.520
and I love building apps that
people are excited to use.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.720
One thing I do know is
that creating a great user

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.460
experience when building apps
can be really, really hard.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.723
Now with constant mobile
devices and the Google Cast

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:24.590
set of technologies,
we've done lots

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.920
of user testing to refine
a simple experience

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.290
for your users.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.540
If you follow our guidelines
when integrating cast

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.250
into your application, you'll
insure a great end user

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.670
experience that feels
familiar to your users.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.990
At the core of Cast is
using existing technology

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.300
to control things.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.510
We realized that people's
phones or their tablets

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.750
make a fantastic remote control.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.540
They have a supercomputer
in the hands

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.780
and they know how to use it.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.640
So we modeled Cast around
using the phone or tablet

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.140
as a remote for
your entertainment

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.100
system or your shared
living room experience.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.640
The beauty of these is that
it's familiar to people.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.880
People already know
how to use the phone,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.720
so people find it easy
to use because it's

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.830
consistent and obvious.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.519
It also makes it a
personal experience

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.900
since your users can
cast their own playlist

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.180
from their own device to their
shared entertainment system.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.940
Your life as a
developer can be easier

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.460
and more successful by taking
advantage of our guidance.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.520
For example, we provide guidance
on how to modify your existing

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.390
applications to enable a
familiar Cast experience,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.634
whether it's running on a phone
or tablet, or even a laptop.

00:01:25.634 --> 00:01:27.050
Your apps need to
deal with things

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.330
like where to place the
Cast icon, the chooser

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.110
to pick Cast devices
on the network,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.320
the states of the
icons, and so on.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.210
We have clear guidance as part
of our documentation and design

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.667
checklist here.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:40.000
Developers also need to take
care of the receiver, which

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.550
runs on the Cast device
connected to your TV or audio

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.424
system.

00:01:43.424 --> 00:01:44.840
The UI guidance
for that helps you

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.070
enable a personal streamlined
experience with ease.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.090
Across the whole
connected Cast experience,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.120
the UX guidance
provides consistency

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.310
and keeps the user in control.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.910
Like for example, you use you
could be looking at the phone

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.390
or at the TV, but
you don't know which.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.880
So our UX guidelines make sure
that wherever your user is

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.290
looking, they see proper
information that guides them

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.080
in what they're supposed to do.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.009
This gives them a consistent UI
and makes things really simple.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.480
Also, when you're
in a living room,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.350
it's like the 10
foot experience.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.470
The screen is over there.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.335
It's 10 feet away,
and you're over here

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:17.670
with the remote control.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.260
So it's really important that
your user has full control,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.930
because that's a really
powerful device, whether it's

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.240
connected to an 80 inch TV
or a 2000 watt sound system.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.454
Cast is also shared experience.

00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:31.120
Since multiple people
can be interacting

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.020
with the Cast device
us at the same time,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.780
we designed this so that
anyone can add to the queue,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.160
share a playlist, join
the game from their phone,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.500
or control anything
that's playing.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.660
For a more detailed look
at our UX guidelines,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.090
watch our short videos
on icon placement,

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.270
controlling volume, and
dealing with connections,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.780
or follow these links
to our UX documentation.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.090
The best practices are
important and we really

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.320
thought them through.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.010
It makes your life
easier and your app

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.120
will do better if you just
follow these guidelines.
