00:00:09.396 --> 00:00:11.596
&gt;&gt;Marilyn: Please give a warm
Neil Cummins Hawks welcome

00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:12.556
to Mr. Michael Pritchard.

00:00:12.556 --> 00:00:14.126
&gt;&gt;Michael: Oh, thank you, Marilyn.

00:00:14.436 --> 00:00:18.706
Oh, you're awesome, I love you.

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:24.576
[applause] How many of you know
a boy or girl here at school

00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:28.476
who gets picked on and
left out and never included

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:32.146
and laughed at all the time?

00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:38.566
Raise your hands high, High,
Look around the room please.

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:43.586
Hands down, this is
not how we want to live

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:44.916
or how we want to treat each other.

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:48.456
This is not how we want to be.

00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:51.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Michael Pritchard
is a commanding presence,

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.356
even in an auditorium full

00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:55.946
of normally noisy students,
teachers, and parents.

00:00:56.516 --> 00:00:58.781
&gt;&gt;Michael: [car sound effect]

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:01.546
&gt;&gt;Students: [laughter]

00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:06.266
&gt;&gt;Narrator: He served as a medic
in Vietnam, and has won awards

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:10.346
as both a stand-up comic and a
probation officer in San Francisco.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:11.916
&gt;&gt;Michael: I love it
when babies walk.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:12.236
They go-- [laughter]

00:01:13.096 --> 00:01:17.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Over the years, he and
his wife have helped raise more

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:22.666
than 100 children, including three
of their own, adding a wealth

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.136
of material to the comedy
routines he has performed

00:01:25.136 --> 00:01:26.876
in nightclubs and on TV.

00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:30.156
&gt;&gt;Michael: My little boy comes in at
like three o'clock in the morning.

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:36.276
"Dad, I don't get any mail."

00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:41.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And whether
he's making them laugh.

00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:46.136
&gt;&gt;Michael: [laughs]
You are so stupid.

00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:48.736
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Or making them shout.

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:49.126
&gt;&gt;Michael: The good you do--

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.716
&gt;&gt;Students: The good you do--

00:01:50.716 --> 00:01:54.076
&gt;&gt;Michael: Will come back to you.

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:56.776
&gt;&gt;Students: Will come back to you.

00:01:56.776 --> 00:01:58.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: His message
is always the same.

00:01:58.106 --> 00:02:00.946
&gt;&gt;Michael: And no matter
what we teach your brains,

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:04.836
love is more important
than knowledge.

00:02:06.136 --> 00:02:09.036
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Pritchard spends most
of his time these days traveling

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:13.376
around the country, taping PBS
specials as he talks to and listens

00:02:13.376 --> 00:02:16.826
to young people to find out what
they are thinking and feeling.

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:20.566
&gt;&gt;Marilyn: At one point,
Michael asks kids to come forward

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:25.006
and share how they've been hurt,
or maybe to apologize to others.

00:02:25.036 --> 00:02:27.816
And when he asked them
to do that, I thought,

00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:29.346
"They're not going to do this.

00:02:29.346 --> 00:02:31.586
I mean, in front of all these kids,
they're not going to come forward."

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:37.706
I have to tell you, I was amazed at
how free they were to come forward

00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:41.686
and really share their experience in
a way that I truly did not expect.

00:02:42.356 --> 00:02:45.396
&gt;&gt;Student: When I first moved here
a year ago, no one really wanted

00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:48.426
to play with me and all the
fifth graders called me names.

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:50.476
&gt;&gt;Michael: What was it
doing to your heart?

00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:52.386
&gt;&gt;Student: It just made
me feel really bad.

00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:55.876
&gt;&gt;Michael: And what I try to
teach the kids is that we have

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.726
to be more real about our emotions.

00:02:57.786 --> 00:03:01.636
And back to the time of
Macbeth, Shakespeare said,

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:03.536
"Always give sorrow words.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.586
Grief that doesn't speak whispers

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:07.856
to the over-fraught heart
and bids it to break."

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.166
&gt;&gt;Student: My main
thing that's gotten me

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:12.416
through all this is empathy.

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:17.736
I-- when the-- I was being bullied,
I tried to feel how they were feeling

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:21.596
and that's why they were--
and why they were bullying me.

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:25.306
&gt;&gt;Michael: And what did it do for
you to put yourself in their shoes

00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:27.976
and know that they were hurting
you because they were hurting?

00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:33.756
&gt;&gt;Student: They-- I could feel
their hurt really deep down,

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:35.926
and I wanted to help.

00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:38.256
&gt;&gt;Michael: When I was a
kid, I guess I learned

00:03:38.256 --> 00:03:42.706
that the most powerful gift I could
do for my friends was to help them

00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:45.726
with their emotions, to be
there and listen to them talk.

00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:48.676
&gt;&gt;Chloe: Well, last year,
when I was in my other school,

00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:53.186
people used to call me
names because I was anemic.

00:03:53.836 --> 00:03:55.066
&gt;&gt;Michael: And what was
it doing to your heart

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:56.346
when they were saying that, Chloe?

00:03:56.826 --> 00:04:03.196
&gt;&gt;Chloe: It was putting my heart
and my mom's heart really bad.

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:04.116
It hurt.

00:04:04.696 --> 00:04:07.876
&gt;&gt;Michael: We get sick if we
try to hold all the pain in.

00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:12.616
And then the unaddressed grief turns
to anger, and the anger to rage.

00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:16.496
And it has two directions, out to the
community or inwards towards the self

00:04:16.496 --> 00:04:17.876
and self-destructiveness.

00:04:18.126 --> 00:04:19.246
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm really shy right here.

00:04:19.336 --> 00:04:21.626
&gt;&gt;Michael: You can do it.

00:04:21.626 --> 00:04:26.626
&gt;&gt;Student: My friend was really
hurt because they called him fat.

00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:34.126
And I didn't want that to happen,
because it wasn't [inaudible].

00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:37.056
&gt;&gt;Michael: Was it fair
to him or fair to you?

00:04:37.936 --> 00:04:38.446
&gt;&gt;Students: No.

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:41.826
&gt;&gt;Michael: How should
we treat each other?

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:42.326
&gt;&gt;Student: Very well.

00:04:42.326 --> 00:04:47.236
Because if we treat each other
really bad, we won't like get along

00:04:47.836 --> 00:04:53.026
or be friends or like
be part of a big family.

00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:55.566
&gt;&gt;Michael: You know what?

00:04:55.736 --> 00:04:59.876
You go home and you tell your mom--
look at me, you have corazon, amigo.

00:05:00.056 --> 00:05:00.676
Yo te amo.

00:05:00.956 --> 00:05:01.216
I love you.

00:05:01.216 --> 00:05:01.636
&gt;&gt;Student: Gracias.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:02.246
&gt;&gt;Michael: All right.

00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:03.066
Por nada. Okay.

00:05:03.356 --> 00:05:04.136
A big round of applause.

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:08.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After the assembly,
Pritchard shared lunch with members

00:05:08.486 --> 00:05:11.346
of the school student
council to reinforce some

00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:13.086
of the lessons they had just learned.

00:05:14.196 --> 00:05:16.976
&gt;&gt;Michael: Why do you think
sometimes kids choose to be bullies,

00:05:17.226 --> 00:05:19.606
and how can we help them
choose not to be bullies?

00:05:20.216 --> 00:05:21.956
&gt;&gt;Student: Kind of walk
up to them and say,

00:05:22.306 --> 00:05:23.556
"could you please stop that?"

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:23.956
&gt;&gt;Michael: Yeah.

00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:25.006
Why is it--

00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:27.846
&gt;&gt;Marilyn: Creating an environment
in which kids feel comfortable,

00:05:27.846 --> 00:05:29.086
in which they are productive,

00:05:29.086 --> 00:05:33.646
in which they treat one another
well, is not a one-shot thing.

00:05:34.286 --> 00:05:35.406
&gt;&gt;Michael: What is his tactic?

00:05:35.746 --> 00:05:36.606
Fear?

00:05:36.716 --> 00:05:36.836
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:40.166
He's scared, so he takes
it out on other people.

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:40.526
&gt;&gt;Michael: Right.

00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:44.286
&gt;&gt;Marilyn: So our responsibility
as adults that work with kids is

00:05:44.326 --> 00:05:45.986
to reiterate that lesson.

00:05:45.986 --> 00:05:48.006
To keep it focused in their minds

00:05:48.356 --> 00:05:51.136
so that it isn't something
that's easily forgotten.

00:05:51.196 --> 00:05:53.646
And it's been my experience
it takes three to five years

00:05:53.646 --> 00:05:56.656
to really change a school
culture to the point

00:05:56.656 --> 00:06:00.256
where that is the expected norm
and where kids will uphold it.

00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:01.736
And it's a learning process.

00:06:01.976 --> 00:06:04.226
&gt;&gt;Student: It shouldn't be a world of
hate, it should be a world of love.

00:06:04.446 --> 00:06:04.766
&gt;&gt;Michael: Yeah.

00:06:05.106 --> 00:06:08.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While students at
elementary schools are generally open

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:09.436
to discussing their feelings,

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:12.106
students at most high
schools are not.

00:06:12.106 --> 00:06:13.226
&gt;&gt;Michael: -- helping
us know that life is

00:06:13.226 --> 00:06:14.946
about the choices that we make.

00:06:15.506 --> 00:06:17.826
And we care about you.

00:06:18.436 --> 00:06:21.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Castlemont High
School in Oakland, California,

00:06:21.626 --> 00:06:24.536
two students were wounded in
a drive-by shooting in front

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:26.166
of the auditorium last year.

00:06:26.356 --> 00:06:29.926
And the initial reception
for Pritchard here was icy.

00:06:30.436 --> 00:06:31.156
&gt;&gt;Michael: You're ugly.

00:06:32.146 --> 00:06:33.646
No, I mean for real, ugly.

00:06:33.646 --> 00:06:37.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: He began
the program with some

00:06:37.006 --> 00:06:39.396
of the same jokes he used
on the fourth graders.

00:06:39.396 --> 00:06:42.446
&gt;&gt;Michael: You look like you fell out
of the ugly tree and hit every limb

00:06:42.446 --> 00:06:44.686
on the way down [laughter]

00:06:44.686 --> 00:06:46.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But his
material soon changed tone.

00:06:46.586 --> 00:06:50.106
&gt;&gt;Michael: Little kid at
West Paducah, Kentucky,

00:06:50.106 --> 00:06:53.606
had never fired a gun before, but
he had an eight-round capacity

00:06:53.606 --> 00:06:56.986
and he played a lot of
point-and-shoot video games.

00:06:57.246 --> 00:07:00.386
He hit five of his
classmates in the head.

00:07:01.376 --> 00:07:03.256
We're talking to your hearts today.

00:07:04.396 --> 00:07:05.046
&gt;&gt;Student: Why?

00:07:06.506 --> 00:07:08.666
&gt;&gt;Michael: Well, I'll
tell you why I'm here.

00:07:09.156 --> 00:07:12.346
Because I have two young African
American youngsters that grew

00:07:12.346 --> 00:07:14.476
up with me and my family
and I love them,

00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:16.116
and I'm worried about their lives.

00:07:16.956 --> 00:07:18.016
You don't know that about me.

00:07:18.016 --> 00:07:19.226
You don't know anything about me.

00:07:19.426 --> 00:07:21.416
I'm just the big fat
guy telling you jokes.

00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:27.166
But listen, I'm just telling you,
this isn't anger, this is love.

00:07:28.096 --> 00:07:30.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: When it came
time for students to talk,

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.336
the first volunteers were greeted

00:07:32.336 --> 00:07:35.056
with a mixture of laughter
and taunts.

00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:36.246
&gt;&gt;Students: [inaudible]

00:07:36.246 --> 00:07:39.366
&gt;&gt;Student: Hey, I'm going
to just keep it real.

00:07:39.586 --> 00:07:39.796
&gt;&gt;Michael: Shh.

00:07:39.796 --> 00:07:43.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But one by one,
other students found the courage

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:45.476
to speak from their hearts.

00:07:45.476 --> 00:07:49.166
&gt;&gt;Student: I love my mom, but
my mom got serious problems.

00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:50.476
I'm like, serious, right?

00:07:50.756 --> 00:07:52.416
I actually took from my mama.

00:07:52.456 --> 00:07:54.726
I took 300 dollars from my mama
just so she couldn't smoke.

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:55.636
You feel me?

00:07:55.826 --> 00:07:59.086
By me doing it, I mean, it hurt
her, because she wanted to smoke,

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:01.666
but it hurt be because I didn't
want her to smoke, feel me?

00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:04.486
So I'm trying to help her, but
I'm hurting her at the same time.

00:08:04.786 --> 00:08:06.926
&gt;&gt;Student: Everybody's talking
about, "Yeah I'm fixing to go home

00:08:06.926 --> 00:08:08.176
and eat this and eat that."

00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:12.216
I was fixing to go home and look
at the TV because it ain't nothing

00:08:12.216 --> 00:08:14.956
in my refrigerator but
some ice cubes and water.

00:08:15.906 --> 00:08:17.826
That don't feel right at all.

00:08:18.076 --> 00:08:21.466
And see, people think that's
funny because it sounds funny.

00:08:21.786 --> 00:08:25.296
But when you got to walk and step
in them shoes, it ain't funny.

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:28.606
And it ain't cool, because I
got a seven year old brother.

00:08:28.606 --> 00:08:31.546
I got a seven year old brother.

00:08:31.946 --> 00:08:34.236
Little boys like to eat.

00:08:34.356 --> 00:08:36.176
They like to eat, because
they're hungry.

00:08:37.496 --> 00:08:40.196
&gt;&gt;Student: Seeing as how dudes
call girls like rippers and renders

00:08:40.476 --> 00:08:42.116
and bitches and stuff like that.

00:08:42.116 --> 00:08:43.066
&gt;&gt;Michael: Listen please.

00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:44.966
&gt;&gt;Student: It opened my
mind not to judge girls,

00:08:44.966 --> 00:08:45.996
because they're going through stuff.

00:08:46.066 --> 00:08:49.706
I learned like one out of every three
girls has been sexually assaulted.

00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:51.106
And that's all I'm saying.

00:08:51.646 --> 00:08:54.376
&gt;&gt;Michael: They always say,
"Oh, nobody will get up,"

00:08:54.376 --> 00:08:56.326
and the parents-- and this
tells you I think in a lot

00:08:56.326 --> 00:09:00.716
of ways how disconnected
parents and teachers can be

00:09:00.716 --> 00:09:01.876
from the courage of children.

00:09:02.186 --> 00:09:04.106
&gt;&gt;Student: You all might
think my life is perfect.

00:09:04.946 --> 00:09:09.196
I have both of my parents,
sisters, or whatever.

00:09:09.306 --> 00:09:14.706
And I'm talking to all of you all
dudes out there that have some kind

00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:19.296
of addiction, because
my dad has an addiction.

00:09:19.606 --> 00:09:26.646
I've always had to live with a father
that would get his paycheck Friday,

00:09:27.656 --> 00:09:32.866
go into a bar, and not come
back until three in the morning

00:09:32.866 --> 00:09:35.396
or not even come back Friday night.

00:09:36.536 --> 00:09:38.806
And waiting up for him.

00:09:39.196 --> 00:09:40.326
&gt;&gt;Michael: What has it
done to your heart, hon?

00:09:40.476 --> 00:09:43.796
&gt;&gt;Student: It hurts, because
I love him, and I don't want

00:09:44.026 --> 00:09:47.356
to feel all this-- all this-- all
these negative feelings towards him.

00:09:47.356 --> 00:09:50.226
Because I love him, but at the
same time, I hate him so much

00:09:50.286 --> 00:09:51.776
for what he has done to my mom.

00:09:52.006 --> 00:09:55.226
He wasn't there for her, and
he barely was there for me.

00:09:56.256 --> 00:09:57.186
But I'm going to be somebody.

00:09:57.186 --> 00:09:58.686
I'm going to be what
my sister wanted to be,

00:09:58.686 --> 00:10:00.246
I'm going to accomplish her dream.

00:10:00.616 --> 00:10:05.986
&gt;&gt;Michael: That strength of character
to get up and stand up for yourself

00:10:05.986 --> 00:10:09.566
and others and to help others
try and be more compassionate,

00:10:09.566 --> 00:10:13.296
if we can tap into that as a
resource for the world, this apathy,

00:10:13.886 --> 00:10:17.346
this neglect, this
indifference is going to end.

00:10:17.756 --> 00:10:19.936
And that's the beginning of peace.

00:10:19.936 --> 00:10:21.366
&gt;&gt;Michael: Shh, Listen please.

00:10:21.366 --> 00:10:25.966
&gt;&gt;Student: I just wanted to
apologize to two young ladies--

00:10:26.106 --> 00:10:27.276
