00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.260
We've learned that Swift gives us two
ways to create objects, structs and

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.310
classes.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.900
As a developer, you'll have to decide
when to use one over the other.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.740
Now you have what you need to
make an informed decision.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.970
We'll see you in the next session.
