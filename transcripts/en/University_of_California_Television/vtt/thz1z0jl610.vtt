00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:31.320
- [Male] We are the paradoxical ape.
Bipedal, naked, large brained, long the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.120
master of fire, tools and language but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:48.670
Aware that death is inevitable yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.100
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.100
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:11.310
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here. An exploration made possible

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.270
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.340
- [Veerabhadran] We heard from Jeff
Severinghaus about the greenhouse effect

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.030
of carbon dioxide and Venus. And that
brought me fond memories, when 45 years

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.120
ago I got started in this field by taking
the quantum mechanics of the carbon

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.240
dioxide molecule and tried to figure out
how it maintains the climate of Venus and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.670
Mars. So how did I go from quantum
mechanics to talk about the topic which is

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.870
totally foreign to me in pursuit of the
common good. So I have to walk you through

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.430
how my science led me into the villages of
India and Kenya and finally found myself

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.640
face to face with Pope Francis last year.
And that's what gave me this idea of the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:14.420
pursuit of the common good. So let me
start with a 30 second lesson on climate

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.500
and climate change. The fundamental energy
source for the planet is sunlight,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.010
considered solar energy. Not all of
that is absorbed by the planet. The

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.830
intervening clouds, and ice sheets and
surface bounces some of these back.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.190
Somewhat 70% is absorbed by the planet.
That heats the planet and it gives off

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.650
this energy in the infrared wavelengths.
We call it heat radiation, infrared

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.170
radiation. But not all of that can escape
to space. The intervening atmosphere,

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.580
particularly water vapor and carbon
dioxide acts like a blanket and traps this

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:02.020
heat. In fact, the blanket is a good
analog if not a metaphor. The blanket

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.430
keeps you warm on a cold winter night not
because it gives off any heat. It traps

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.640
your body heat. That's exactly how this
gases trap the planet's infrared heat.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.170
Which is what we call the greenhouse
effect. Nature gave us a thick blanket,

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.740
literally, how thick the blanket wall is.
So without that the planet would be so

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.880
frozen beyond anything we have seen in the
ice ages which Jeff showed us. So now,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.470
what we've been doing is adding to that
blanket making the blanket thicker. So the

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:43.120
first of this we have about it, carbon
dioxide. And that was worked out more than

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.760
100 years ago by Svante Arrhenius the
famous chemist. He did some of the most

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.710
definitive calculations in 1896. I know
this paper very well because the Swedish

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.150
Academy at the 100th anniversary invited
me to write a detailed critique of this.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.280
So for nearly 80 years after the
publication of this paper, we thought

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.760
carbon dioxide was the only molecule
causing the greenhouse effect. In fact,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.520
many talks today focus on the CO2. After I
finished graduate school, I stumbled on

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.610
this totally shocking and surprising
discovery given for myself that we were

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.210
releasing other compounds. Particularly
the chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs. And my work

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.390
showed, taking again the study from the
quantum mechanics of the CFC molecule,

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.830
addition of one molecule of CFC has the
same greenhouse effect as adding 10,000 to

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.570
15,000 molecules of carbon dioxide. This
is mind you purely synthetic gas used as

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.360
refrigerants and propellants. But the CFCs
are also involved in damaging the ozone

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:58.200
layer. So the Montreal Protocol in 1980s
phased out, banned the use of chemicals

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.940
after the discovery of the Antarctic ozone
hole. Just in the last five years, my work

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:11.950
was recognized and the Economist called
the Montreal Protocol as the best climate

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:18.910
mitigation strategy. Because my work had
shown if we had not banned CFCs, the CFC

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.990
alone would have caused a half a degree
warming so far. Okay. So now let me go to

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.390
the real gorilla on the table which is
carbon dioxide. You know the theory is

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.250
being attacked. So the key thing is to
remember any theory is judged by its

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:39.570
predictions. So in 1980, I teamed up with
the famous meteorologist Roland Madden. We

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:47.000
took the observed climate fluctuations so
called noise and said when will we detect

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.490
the signal: carbon dioxide warming. So we
predicted if Arrhenius' theory was right,

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:00.250
we should see the warming by year 2000. As
you have seen, it's after the 1990 to 2000

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:05.670
period where I've shown the shade where
the warming rose above the background

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:11.120
noise. In fact thousands of scientists
said finally we are seeing the human

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.910
induced warming. So there, a forecast
turned out to be okay. So for the last

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.880
30-35 years, I've used a variety of
instruments. The one I've shown, the left

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.290
hand side is the satellite which I helped
to design that with three other scientists

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.500
at NASA. We were looking at the regulation
of the heat flow in and out of planet by

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:40.310
the atmosphere. More recently, we
developed this unmanned aircraft to look

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:45.080
at how the heating from man-made
pollutants is really warming the planet.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:51.150
So let me walk you through. What we did
was, using this to track each of the

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:58.310
predictions by models and theories. And
see are they coming true. So the first

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:04.030
thing, we went after is what's called the
water vapour feedback. Remember, I think

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:09.590
Jeff showed several talks about the warmer
atmosphere holds more moisture. But water

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.690
vapour is the most powerful greenhouse
gas. So we determined the greenhouse

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:20.490
effect directly simply by estimating the
infra radiation coming from the ocean.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:25.810
It's basically given by the Planck's
black-body law. When we were measuring the

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.940
heat escaping to the top of the
atmosphere, and differenced the two,

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.650
looked at the thickness of this blanket,
what you see here in the tropics is that

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:41.070
the blanket is thickest. Our unit for
measuring the thickness is watts of energy

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:46.750
trapped. So why is so much greenhouse
effect happening in the tropics? It's warm

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.160
and humid. Water vapor greenhouse effect.
But we're not satisfied with that. We

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.560
wanted to see as the planet warms would
the greenhouse water vapour increase. So

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.910
on the right hand side you see, we're not
gonna go through step by step, every year

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:07.300
the planners does a spectacular
experiment. It's the entire planet when

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:14.170
you average it's hottest during August and
coldest during February. Remember August

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:18.210
is winter in the Southern Hemisphere. So
when the temperature increases, we found

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:23.611
with the satellite the greenhouse effect
increased exactly as predicted by models.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:29.110
And then you ask why did that increase?
That's the last bottom panel. It's because

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.780
the water vapor increased as the planet
temperature increased. So why is water

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.320
vapor increasing? It's basic
thermodynamics. The vapor pressure of

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.830
moisture above a body of water increases
exponentially with temperature. So here,

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:49.880
Arrhenius was the first to suggest it. The
next was another theory which was done by

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.600
Russian climatologist so-called C. I.
Sobriro. Charlie Kannel already

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.480
showed that. This took me 30 years to
start from the launch of the satellite to

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.130
come to this. I will say one of my
graduates student's thesis work: so as the

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:11.450
Arctic sea ice retreated, what the
climatologist said is, you know the ice

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.500
absorbs only 50% of the sunlight. It
bounces everything back. That's why it's

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:21.130
white. When you melt the ice away, you get
the sudden tipping point you will see the

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:27.620
dark ocean. And we documented that exactly
how much energy. And that energy increase,

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:32.530
although it's in a tiny part of the
planet, Arctic, was so large that it was

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:37.100
equal to one fourth of the greenhouse
effect of CO2 increase. Okay. Again this

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:42.050
was suggested but the magnitude or the
feedback is much larger than what the

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:47.640
models were using. The last one I want to
mention to you . . .one of the key things

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:53.040
we are after is: is a warmer planet going
to be more cloudy? Why is that an

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.900
important question? Clouds are one of the
most powerful regulators of sunlight. The

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:06.320
clouds are white because it's reflecting
50% to 70%. In our planet, both in the

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:12.420
Northern polar region, Southern polar
region, this massive extra tropical cloud

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.530
system. Remember that's what you see
when you fly across in the Pacific

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:21.840
Atlantic thick white, they are the
refrigerants for the planet. What we are

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.350
finding is, think of them as two white
umbrellas, they are shrinking, letting

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:33.880
in more sunlight in the tropical ocean.
Again an amplification. So when they put

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.610
all of these together- remember I
forecast in the 1980. Boldened by the

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:46.040
success of that, we made two forecasts
seven years ago. In fact, we have already

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.810
dumped enough gases to heat the planet by
two and a half degrees. We've only seen

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:59.330
about one third of it. The other thing,
which is what made me go after the pursuit

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:04.110
of the common good, is that we're gonna
hit this two degrees, not what people are

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:11.430
saying 100 years from now, around the
corner, 30 to 40 years from now. Okay. So

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:19.120
the so-called two degrees is facing us
already. So how do we slow down the

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:26.240
warming? Of course, you know most of the
studies talk about cutting down CO2 which

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:32.480
I agree with. So we came with a number to
reduce the long term warming. You've got

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:41.940
to stabilise the CO2 below 440 p.p.m. .
CO2 is already at 400, so to limit to 440,

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:50.200
we can't emit more than thousand billion
tons. That looks large but every year

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:57.470
we're emitting 40 billion tons. So we have
only 25 years left. Okay. But that's not

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.600
gonna help the near term warming because
CO2 is like a super tanker. Its lifetime

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:08.920
essentially is 1,000 years. [inaudible
00:13:05] So remember my work on the CFCs

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:14.640
that's put as HC, halocarbons, that's a
family of chemicals. And after that work

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.740
in '75, it came with numerous other
pollutants. Ozone, it's called smog.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:24.490
Methane, we've heard about it. The other
is black carbon. It is soot the dark stuff

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.790
comes from diesel. It's not a greenhouse
gas, it's a particle that will absorb

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:34.410
sunlight. Much of my work with UAVs was to
track that. But we have technologies to

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:40.410
cut them down. And their lifetime is a few
weeks to a decade. If you eliminate black

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:45.380
carbon from diesel, their warming effect
is gone two weeks from now. So if we cut

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.800
these pollutants with existing
technologies, we can cut down the rate of

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:56.550
warming in the next 30 years by nearly
50%. So you need a two-pronged strategy.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:05.600
So now let's look at who is gonna do
which. By the way, this idea of the CCAC,

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.410
the short-lived climate pollutants, I
wrote a paper of this for policy makers

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:17.230
with the political scientists at UCSD that
was read by Hillary Clinton. And she

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:22.250
formed a coalition three years ago, now
there are 40 nations that are working to

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:28.330
cut down the short-lived pollutants. So
now let's look at the human side of the

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:35.220
problem. For reasons I'm not gonna get
into, I spent, you know . . .took my

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:40.250
sabbatical and spent with my wife living
villages in India for three months. We

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:45.330
also do work in Kenya. And every week or
so the life in the village was so

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:52.060
oppressive I would escape to the nearest
city for a cold glass of beer. I have a

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:56.810
movie I will show you if there's time.
That's when I discovered, my god, there

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:03.680
are two worlds in this planet. The first
is inhabited by the top 1 billion with

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:09.840
obviously seemingly unlimited access to
fossil fuels. The other world is inhabited

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.060
by the bottom 3 billion, lack of access to
the fossil fuels even for cooking. They

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:20.290
still burn fire wood and cow dung. I was
having my meals in this woman's house

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:28.840
in the foothills of Himalayas. So the top
1 billion consumed 50% of the energy are

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:35.550
responsible for something like 50% to 70%
of the greenhouse gas emissions. So where

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:40.970
population is a problem as Doctor Hadley
said, the other big gorilla is

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:47.720
unsustainable consumption by a small part
of the world's population. Okay.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:53.900
Particularly climate change. So in terms
of cutting CO2, the buzzword is

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:59.370
decarbonisation. So that takes about-,
to've been estimated about $1 trillion per

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:06.670
year. That's about $1,000 per person for
the top 1 billion. And there were fossil

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:13.510
fuel subsidies about $450 billion. So you
take it out, it's basically a $500 problem

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:19.250
we are arguing about. And then the second
thing is, the worst consequences of

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:24.920
climate change is going to be experienced
by the bottom 3 billion. This woman

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:30.700
represents about 600 million women around
the world who are on subsistence farming.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:36.610
One or two to five acres. A draught like
what hit California extending for three,

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:42.780
four years would wipe them out. They will
become homeless, go to slums in cities,

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:48.900
etc. . So the question is we have to give
them energy access. And that has also been

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:56.250
costed out. It's about $250 billion. So if
you divide it amongst the top 1 billion,

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:02.150
it's a $250 problem. So the question you
have to ask is why should I living here,.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.470
I am of course part of the top 1
billion. I'm almost on the top of the top

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:10.950
1 billion if you bring all my travels. So
why should I give $250 to this woman

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:18.200
sitting in Himalayas? If I don't do that,
she climbs on the fossil fuel ladder. Her

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:25.050
consumption of fossil fuel will go up by
30%. Now that will be 13 billion. So

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:32.070
purely selfish reasons, we want to provide
energy access. But if we now throw $250

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:39.130
billion, it's not gonna reach them. Right.
So we started a project called Surya where

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:45.610
we developed improved cook stoves to cut
down the emission. My

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:49.470
daughter developed cellphone technologies
to measure these emissions. My instruments

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:55.120
were all way too expensive. But this cook
stove is about $70 a person. That's about

00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:02.470
five weeks of her pay check. Okay. So we
said she is cutting down climate by

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:07.000
cutting down the black carbon emissions
and CO2 emissions. She's saving about five

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.660
tons a year. So if I give the minimum
carbon credit to her which is about $15,

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:20.740
she'd get the stove paid off. And she'll
be making money next two, three years. But

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.330
how do you know she's gonna use it? That's
the biggest problem in compliance. So I

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:31.530
went to my daughter again. Asked her to do
something useful. She's a wireless

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:37.130
technology genius. So she came up with a
simple temperature sensor which heats as

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:42.280
soon as she starts the stove, the data
comes to her lab, she's at Los Angeles.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:48.030
She shifts it to my lab. We convert the
carbon credits. UCSD created the first

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:53.420
climate mitigation fund. And we have
demonstrated it in 5,000 homes. In fact,

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:59.200
this work was started first by donation
from Qualcomm, Charlie Kannel and a

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:05.140
billionaire in San Francisco got it
started. So next week, this methodology

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:09.320
has been excepted by United Nations. I'll
be there in a summit. They're gonna

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:16.690
release it as one way to provide energy
access. So let me go on. So I'm now taken

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:23.510
my quantum mechanics to religious. So why
did I meet the Pope? Clearly we

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:29.000
particularly heard from the last speaker
and the previous speaker. I decided by the

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.350
way, I'm never going to follow Naomi
Oreskes. I was so mesmerised by what she

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:43.790
was saying, I forgot what I was gonna say.
So we teamed up. You know, I belong to the

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:48.900
Pope's academy of science with the
Economist, nobel laureates and biology,

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:54.220
physics, chemistry. In fact, Charlie and
Naomi attended that summit. And we

00:19:54.220 --> 00:20:00.590
discussed this whole issue of
sustainability. And at the end of it we

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:05.280
were asked to brief to the Pope. And I've
been in this academy for the last . .

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.790
.every time we meet Pope like Pope John
Paul and Pope Benedict, it's always in the

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:14.950
most ornate room at the Vatican. This Pope
met us in the parking lot. Right here you

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:21.340
see. That's why he's called people's Pope.
So we briefed. What is remarkable about

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:27.770
this group, at the end of it, three days
of intense talks, we didn't talk about

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:32.550
technology, we didn't talk about this.
What we said was the main way to solve

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:40.430
this problem is to change our attitude
towards nature and towards each other. And

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:47.040
remember by leaving 3 billion behind,
they're gonna suffer the consequences of

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.880
our fuel consumption. And then from the
previous speaker we heard we're gonna be

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.840
generations of yet unborn suffering our
unsustainable consumption. So it's a moral

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:04.800
issue. So what we're saying is that
religious leaders should take hold of

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:11.400
this. And two weeks ago Pope Francis
because of this previous meeting,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:17.360
assembled religious leaders from Islam,
Hindu, Jewish, all the religions

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:22.750
represented. And they all signed a
decoration. And anyway, so let me just

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:28.820
come to the last point. I joined this
infamous group, Planetary Boundaries

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:36.350
group. So we publish this Planetary
Boundary that is a safe eco-system. That's

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:43.080
the inner-circle. And then you exceed the
outer circle you go to the danger zone.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.650
And so there were eight components we
identified. Was the only climate scientist

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:52.060
there. And climate change and then the
atmospheric aerosol loading is there. Two

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.090
of the components we already exceeded the
boundaries. Doctor Hadley's talk

00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:00.800
beautifully showed that species
extinction. It turns out our extinction

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.320
rate is 10 to 100 times larger than when
we compared to extinction rates before

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:12.650
humans really started colonizing the
planet. The other major is nitrogen. You

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:18.700
know, fertilisers. We have anoxic zones in
the ocean. They're there because

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:25.730
pollutants, effluents from the ocean. So
climate change, there are denialists

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:32.380
because of political and economic reasons.
But our chairman also said we're also

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:39.930
denialists, it is coded into our genes. So
no matter how, if we don't do much about

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:45.960
it, I want to conclude with my prediction
that you'll see that the red zone, the

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:53.850
climate was still in the yellow zone, we
will exceed that by 2050, two degrees. So

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:59.760
the anthropocene which is coined by my
good friend, Paul Crutzen will reach

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.710
adolescence by 2050. I'm thinking they're
the teenagers the most dangerous age in

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:11.950
the human being's evolution. Right. So
we'll reach two degree world. But I

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:17.250
predict when it reach two degrees the
changes would be huge, just physically and

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:22.860
thermodynamically, the water vapor alone
would be 15% more. Fuelling the storms,

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:29.230
fuelling draughts, fuelling floods. So we
would change our attitude towards nature.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:35.350
We will decarbonise the economy. But I'm
saying it's a $450 problem amongst the top

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:42.000
1 billion. It's safe to assume all of us
here belong to that prestigious club. And

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.481
then we need to provide clean energy for
the bottom 3 billion. Thank you very much.
