00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.660
Let's say you're
trying to design

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.229
some type of a product for men.

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:06.180
One that is somehow
based on their height.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.680
And the product is
for the United States.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.200
So ideally, you
would like to know

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.030
the mean height of men
in the United States.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.340
Let me write this down.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.920
So how would you do that?

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.390
And when I talk
about the mean, I'm

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.285
talking about the
arithmetic mean.

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:35.410
If I were to talk about
some other types of means--

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.570
and there are other
types of means,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.150
like the geometric mean--
I would specify it.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.840
But when people just
say mean, they're

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.330
usually talking about
the arithmetic mean.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.830
So how would you
go about finding

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.470
the mean height of men
in the United States?

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.510
Well, the obvious one
is, is you go and ask

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.540
every or measure every
man in the United States.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.750
Take their height,
add them all together,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.300
and then divide by
the number of men

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.050
there are in the United States.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.020
But the question
you'd ask yourself

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.280
is whether that is practical.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.290
Because you have on
the order-- let's see,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.960
there's about 300 million
people in the United States.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.410
Roughly half of them
will be men, or at least

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.200
they'll be male, and so
you will have 150 million,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.670
roughly 150 million men
in the United States.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.370
So if you wanted
the true mean height

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.170
of all of the men
United States, you

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.659
would have to somehow
survey-- or not even survey.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.450
You would have to be
able to go and measure

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.850
all 150 million men.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.890
And even if you did try to do
that, by the time you're done,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.670
many of them might
have passed away,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.120
new men will have been born,
and so your data will go stale

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.170
immediately.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.210
So it is seemingly impossible,
or almost impossible,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.770
to get the exact height of
every man in the United States

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.000
in a snapshot of time.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.770
And so, instead, what you
do is say, well, look, OK,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.600
I can't get every man, but
maybe I can take a sample.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.020
I could take a sample of the
men in the United States.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.320
And I'm going to make an effort
that it's a random sample.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.670
I don't want to just go
sample 100 people who

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.729
happen to play basketball,
or played basketball

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.750
for their college.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.315
I don't want to go
sample 100 people who

00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:13.540
are volleyball players.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.920
I want to randomly sample.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.520
Maybe the first
person who comes out

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.810
of the mall in a random
town, or in several towns,

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.768
or something like that.

00:02:20.768 --> 00:02:22.860
Something that should
not be based in any way,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.840
or skewed in any way, by height.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.410
So you take a sample
and from that sample

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.180
you can calculate a mean
of at least the sample.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.580
And you'll hope that that is
indicative of-- especially

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.050
if this was a reasonably
random sample-- you'll

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.600
hope that was indicative of the
mean of the entire population.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.330
And what you're going to
see in much of statistics

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.675
it is all about using
information, using things

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:56.480
that we can calculate
about a sample,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.010
to infer things
about a population.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.230
Because we can't directly
measure the entire population.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.200
So for example, let's say--
And if you're actually

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.700
trying to do this,
I would recommend

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.570
doing at least 100
data points, or 1,000,

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.250
and later on we'll
talk about how

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.850
you can think about whether
you've measured enough

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.410
or how confident you can be.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.243
But let's just say
you're a little bit lazy,

00:03:19.243 --> 00:03:21.600
and you just sample five men.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.140
And so you get
their five heights.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.950
Let's say one is 6.2 feet.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.300
Let's say one is 5.5 feet-- 5.5
feet would be 5 foot, 6 inches.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.390
Let's say one ends
up being 5.75 feet.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.560
Another one is 6.3 feet.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.460
Another is 5.9 feet.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.230
Now, if these are
the ones that you

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.150
happen to sample,
what would you get

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.985
for the mean of this sample?

00:03:57.524 --> 00:03:58.940
Well let's get our
calculator out.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:12.690
And we get 6.2 plus 5.5
plus 5.75 plus 6.3 plus 5.9.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.760
The sum is 29.65.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.740
And then we want to divide
by the number of data points

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.240
we have.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.430
So we have five data points.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:29.710
So let's divide 29.65 divided
by 5, and we get 5.93 feet.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.990
So here, our sample
mean-- and I'm

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.400
going to denote it with an
x with a bar over it, is--

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.320
and I already forgot
the number-- 5.93 feet.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:50.760
This is our sample mean, or,
if we want to make it clear,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.540
sample arithmetic mean.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.850
And when we're taking this
calculation based on a sample,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.830
and somehow we're
trying to estimate it

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.560
for the entire population,
we call this right over here,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.060
we call it a statistic.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.230
Now, you might be saying,
well, what notation

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.269
do we use if, somehow,
we are able to measure it

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:14.060
for the population?

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.310
Let's say we can't even
measure it for the population,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.920
but we at least want to denote
what the population mean is.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.730
Well if you want to do
that, the population mean

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.700
is usually denoted by
the Greek letter mu.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.180
And so in a lot of
statistics, it's

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.750
calculating a sample
mean in an attempt

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.060
to estimate this thing
that you might not know,

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.010
the population mean.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.569
And these calculations
on the entire population,

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:45.110
sometimes you might
be able to do it.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.480
Oftentimes, you will
not be able to do it.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.860
These are called parameters.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.350
So what you're going to
find in much of statistics,

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.080
it's all about calculating
statistics for a sample,

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.560
finding these sample
statistics in order

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.100
to estimate parameters
for an entire population.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.440
Now the last thing I want
to do is introduce you

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.160
to some of the notation that
you might see in a statistics

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.530
textbook that looks very
math-y and very difficult.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.736
But hopefully, after
the next few minutes,

00:06:17.736 --> 00:06:19.610
you'll appreciate that
it's really just doing

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.920
exactly what we did here--
adding up the numbers

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.059
and dividing by the
number of numbers you add.

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:25.600
If you had to do
the population mean,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.470
it's the exact same thing.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.553
It's just many, many more
numbers in this context.

00:06:28.553 --> 00:06:30.310
You have to add up
150 million numbers

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.540
and divide by 150 million.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.670
So how do mathematicians
talk about an operation

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.890
like that-- adding
up a bunch of numbers

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.550
and then dividing by
the number of numbers?

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.030
Let's first think
about the sample mean,

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.560
because that's where we
actually did the calculation.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.550
So a mathematician
might call each

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.590
of these data points-- let's
say they'll call this first one

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.270
right over here x sub 1.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.200
They'll call this one x sub 2.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.375
They'll call this one x sub 3.

00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:02.000
They'll call this
one-- when I say sub,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.780
I'm really saying subscript
1, subscript 2, subscript 3.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.090
They could call
this x subscript 4.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.590
They could call
this x subscript 5.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.640
And so if you had n of these
you would just keep going.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.910
x subscript 6, x
subscript seven, all

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.360
the way to x subscript n.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.720
And so to take the
sum of all of these,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.440
they would denote it as let
me write it right over here.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:34.400
So they will say that the sample
mean is equal to the sum of all

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.890
my x sub i's-- so the way
you can conceptualize it,

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.040
these i's will change.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.350
In this case, the
i started at 1.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.180
The i's are going to
start at 1 until the size

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.020
of our actual sample.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.860
So all the way until n.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.780
In this case n was equal to 5.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.280
So this is literally
saying this is

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.170
equal to x sub 1 plus x
sub 2 plus x sub 3, all

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.140
the way to the nth one.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.200
Once again, in this
case, we only had five.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.320
Now, are we done?

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.189
Is this what the sample mean is?

00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:13.230
Well, no, we aren't done.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.680
We don't just add up
all of the data points.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.640
We then have to divide by
the number of data points

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.220
there are.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.200
So this might look like
very fancy notation,

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.720
but it's really just saying,
add up your data points

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.570
and divide by the number
of data points you have.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.885
And this capital Greek letter
sigma literally means sum.

00:08:40.885 --> 00:08:45.950
Sum all of the x i's, from x
sub 1 all the way to x sub n,

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.290
and then divide by the number
of data points you have.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.700
Now let's think about how we
would denote the same thing

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.810
but, instead of for the
sample mean, doing it

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.840
for the population mean.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.500
So the population mean,
they will denote it with mu,

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.010
we already talked about that.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.520
And here, once again you're
going to take the sum,

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.510
but this time it's going
to be the sum of all

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.670
of the elements in
your population.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:12.607
So your x sub i's-- and you'll
still start at i equals 1.

00:09:12.607 --> 00:09:14.440
But it usually gets
denoted that, hey you're

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.960
taking the whole
population, so they'll often

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.670
put a capital N right over
here to somehow denote

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:24.130
that this is a bigger number
than maybe this smaller n.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.200
But once again, we are not done.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.400
We have to divide by the
number of data points

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.470
that we are actually summing.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.390
And so this, once
again, is the same thing

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:40.260
as x sub 1 plus x sub 2 plus
x sub 3-- all the way to x sub

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.820
capital N, all of that
divided by capital N.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.330
And once again,
in this situation,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.530
we found this practical.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.530
We found this impractical.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.500
We can debate whether
we took enough data

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.170
points on our sample
mean right over here.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.220
But we're hoping that
it's at least somehow

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.731
indicative of our
population mean.
