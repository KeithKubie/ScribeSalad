1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,890
Okay. Ready? Hey, I'm Jad
Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,690
This is radiolab and this whole hour
we have been talking about, go ahead.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,120
Guts, guts.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,810
In the last section we
talked about bacteria and the
armies of them that are in

5
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:14,320
your gut.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,530
You know the problem is that they're a
little hard to picture kind of abstract.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:17,980
Oh,

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,150
why don't we finish with a story that
makes the whole issue real and much more

9
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:22,691
concrete.

10
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:27,691
This is the tail of a
troubled relationship between
a man and his on again,

11
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:32,590
off again, gut. Yeah. Hello. Hello.
Hello man. His name's John Reiner.

12
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:34,150
He's a writer, lives here in New York.

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,680
So one day you are eating your way
through your life as you usually do.

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,740
And then things take an odd turn.
Yeah. How did it, how did it begin?

15
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,230
It began with, the surprise

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,440
is at home and I was about to go
make myself a tuna fish sandwich.

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,720
John Thought, you know what,

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,650
let me go to the bathroom first
to get that out of the way.

19
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,170
So he sits down on the
pot to do his business.

20
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,330
And I felt a funny twinge in my gut.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,140
Now John has had gut pain before.

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,120
I suffer from something
called Crohn's disease,

23
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:06,160
which is a gastrointestinal condition.

24
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,340
But I had gone through a period
of about a year, his remission,

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,990
excellent health. And so when this
pain came on, John figured no big deal.

26
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,120
It seemed to come out of nowhere and I
thought it'll go away out of nowhere,

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,490
like usual, but it didn't.

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,250
Within about a minute,

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,430
what was a small twinge all of a sudden
felt like a knife into my gut before

30
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:31,070
long, I'm on my living room floor,

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,090
flat on my back and I can't
move. John calls an ambulance,

32
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:36,890
they rushed him to the hospital
and when they get there,

33
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:40,860
the doctors take one look and tell him
your intestines were clock and now they

34
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:41,694
burst

35
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,030
and it's now spreading bacteria
throughout your system.

36
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:52,070
Basically you're on the verge of
having Sepsis, meaning you could die.

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,750
So you need emergency surgery. But they
also told them that I should recover.

38
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,830
And when he came out of the oir look
like he would, but the doctor said,

39
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:02,930
let's play it safe. Stay here for a week.

40
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,690
We'll feed you through an IV
and give your gut a break.

41
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:09,110
So I'm on an IEP for a couple of days
and I've been on nothing by mouth in the

42
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:13,340
hospital numerous times before,
but always for four to five days.

43
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,260
And after four or five days, John says,

44
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,870
what normally happens is that
you'll start to feel hungry again.

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,711
That's a great sign.

46
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:21,200
That means that your gut is
healing and it's ready for food.

47
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,180
But this time that didn't happen. In
fact, he says he got sicker, nausea,

48
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,210
vomiting, chills, fever, spike.

49
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,230
So the doctors take more pictures of
John's insights and they noticed something

50
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:36,980
weird in the area where I
had the tear in my intestine.

51
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,840
There is no a Fistula, which is a hole.

52
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,100
And normally this is something
you could so right back up,

53
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,700
the doctors tell them in your case, no,

54
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,410
the tissue of around the area of the
tear so compromised that you can't

55
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:54,890
withstand another surgery right now.
Plus you've got high level of infection.

56
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:55,250
Again,

57
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,500
you're no candidate for surgery or only
solution they tell them is to let gut

58
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:03,940
heal on its own. But in order to do
that, we've got to shut it down. Yes,

59
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,330
basically numb it with anesthesia.
So my gut was in an induced coma.

60
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,990
Nothing would pass through
it. There'd be no activity,

61
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,900
which meant the doctors told
them obviously no eating.

62
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,260
Instead we're going to put you on a food
pump and the food pump is a mechanical

63
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:25,110
pump about the size and the weight of
two bricks carry carrying in the backpack

64
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,690
and the pump in the backpack is
attached to this big bag. Big Bladder.

65
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:33,691
The big 3000 milliliter bag of a TPN
is the medical name for the nutrients

66
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,510
visits and for total parent Terrell
nutrition and and stream runs out of the

67
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,180
pump through the tube into my arm.

68
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,140
You are going to be given essentially
a a an outdoor stomach. That's right.

69
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,540
And this is where our story really
begins. So John goes home with his new XO,

70
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,980
stomach canny,

71
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,630
but every day around mealtime he
says he would turn on the food. Yeah.

72
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,830
And this is actually what it sounds like.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,833
[inaudible]

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,330
so, uh, I'd start my feeding at
four o'clock. Pump would start,

75
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:18,720
I'd sit on the love seat for awhile and
my kids would come home from school,

76
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,100
my wife would come home from teaching and
then the real food would come into the

77
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:25,620
apartment. Sometimes
neighbors brought food over.

78
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,440
Sometimes John's wife
would cook regardless.

79
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,830
I was always sitting on the love seat
in our living room with the food pump

80
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,340
worrying like a dishwasher
while just a few feet away.

81
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,200
His family would sit at the table, uh,
eating fabulous food night after night.

82
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,380
This happens and it's
making me absolutely crazy.

83
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,390
And he says, after about a week of this,

84
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,380
and then two weeks and then three weeks
of just sitting there night after night

85
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:54,750
watching his family
eat dinner without him,

86
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,420
he says he would start to drift off

87
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,040
and get lost to these really vivid
daydreams of meals that he'd eaten in the

88
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:09,420
past. One of the first memories I have
is going to Katz's for the first time.

89
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,640
Ladies and gentlemen, please. Getz is
a famous Jewish Jelly in Manhattan. Oh,

90
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,643
how are you doing? Good. All right.

91
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,970
We're going along and
standing there at the counter.

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,130
We must be right where the counter man
cuts the Pastrami and puts it on a plate

93
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,060
and it cuts it out of the hot cooker and
it's on a fork and he hands it to you

94
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,490
and you take a taste. And he
says, in that particular instance,

95
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:33,360
when he took a bite, that first bite
of the astronomy sandwich, it was like,

96
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,300
he said, it was the first time in his
life where he suddenly, he was like,

97
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,070
Oh my God, I'm Jewish. I am
Jewish. She's there. My people.

98
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,850
That was the first time you
felt that it was. It was.

99
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,980
And after about a month of no food at
all, and these vivid daydreams about food,

100
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,800
something happened.

101
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,190
John got Hungry, like actually hungry,

102
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,660
which really doesn't make
much sense because hunger
signals normally travel from

103
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:09,140
the gut up to the brain, and
his gut was numb. But he says,

104
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,290
he really started to feel hungry.
It was, you know, I think of it,

105
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,050
it was an existential hunger
and he got really bad.

106
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,511
For example, uh,

107
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:22,050
my wife's a terrific cook
and one night she made a,

108
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:23,690
a little treat for the kids, uh,

109
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,960
mini burgers and French fries and our
small apartment smelled like the kitchen

110
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,850
of a white castle. So, um,

111
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,290
my wife brought out this big plate of
sliders in a pyramid and the kids were

112
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:41,090
knocking down the pyramid and throwing
the back and I couldn't take it anymore.

113
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,270
So I snuck out of the living
room while they were preoccupied,

114
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,450
I went into our kitchen and there were
some fries on the stove top and I put my

115
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:56,741
hand on the fries and I brought them up
to my mouth and I was expecting salt and

116
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:02,840
oil, fatty goodness, fatty goodness and
the texture of crunchiness and all that.

117
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,790
And I'm tasting it now and I put it
on my tongue and I've got nothing,

118
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,770
nothing really, and I'm
rolling it around and options,

119
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:16,130
you can't even feel it on my
tongue. Feels even the salt.

120
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:19,400
It's like when you go to the dentist
and you've got novacane and really,

121
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,060
and my tongue is numb at a roll. So I
start at your tone, just out of practice.

122
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,820
I couldn't figure out what's going on.

123
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,800
And then I brought up a knife and
John claims that when he looked at the

124
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:33,650
reflection of his tongue
in this metal knife,

125
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,830
I see that my tongue is as flat and
smooth as this for Micah tabletop.

126
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:40,430
I've got my hand on.

127
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,190
And you're still saying you don't have
the little a personally no bristles.

128
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,581
Right.

129
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:48,581
And I realize I haven't used it in so
long that my taste buds have evaporated.

130
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,450
You know, they're gone. And at the
moment that that happens, my oldest son,

131
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:57,710
teddy, who was nine at the
time, comes in and he says, Dad,

132
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,910
you're not supposed to eat. I said to
him, I wasn't eating, I wasn't eating.

133
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,560
It's like you switch places almost.

134
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,590
And he looked at me with
the most scornful disgusted,

135
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,640
just ashamed expression. And
I was completely humiliated.

136
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:18,290
I normally failed as neater. Shame flood.
Right? I failed as a father as well.

137
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,003
Uh Huh

138
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:23,880
[inaudible].

139
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,100
As the weeks dragged on and
John didn't get any better,

140
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,950
he actually started to take
that thought seriously.

141
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,210
Like maybe he really was
failing at being a dad.

142
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,230
I'm a stay at home dad
and uh, as a result,

143
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,430
I'm the shopper and the cooker and the
food planner and the provider for us.

144
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,960
And I was out of commission three
years out of work with no gut.

145
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,460
Meanwhile, I can't stop thinking
about food. I'm remembering and

146
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,170
food that I ate 20 years ago.
Like I had it out that afternoon.

147
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,320
And I'm online looking up menus from
restaurants that I've gone to and looking

148
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:04,110
up recipes, you know, for,
for dishes that I've made.

149
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,830
Obsession grew and grew until one
night he says his neighbor Marsha,

150
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,760
I decided to cook for us one night when
I wasn't eating and she brought down a

151
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,570
chocolate Bundt cake for that.

152
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:20,150
My wife and kids to eat walks it right
past John on the way to the kitchen.

153
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,200
And I could smell this thing, I could
smell the rum, I could smell the eggs,

154
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:26,960
I can smell the flower, I could
smell everything. So again,

155
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,990
he sneaks into the kitchen and I lower
my nose down to this bunk cake and I'm

156
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:33,920
smelling it and I'm sniffing it.

157
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:38,921
And I'm inhaling this thing
like an anteater and that's
not enough in my state,

158
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:44,710
so I plunge my hands
into the chocolate cake.

159
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,230
You what? I lunge my hand
into the chocolate cake.

160
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,810
You'd order to get one with the Gu or
what order to get some sensation of

161
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:56,000
connection with food.

162
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,180
Did you think what's happening
to me or did you think, oh,

163
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,210
the moment my fingers were in this cake,

164
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,230
I felt I'm in heaven. I've
reconnected with the living.

165
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,570
I have food if not in me,

166
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,150
at least on me and at
the moment where allowed,

167
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:16,710
I'm experiencing most pleasure.
My wife comes into the kitchen

168
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,530
when I went in to get the kids
some more food. I found him.

169
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,120
This of course is John's wife Susan with
his hands in the cake just trying to

170
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:28,800
touch the crumbs and he looked so guilty
and I was also like, why are you doing?

171
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,680
What are you doing? Like somebody's
going through an underwear drawer.

172
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:35,130
It was very, you know, wrong.
And I have no explanation.

173
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,530
I mean I can say I need to do this.

174
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,750
You have no idea how wonderful this is.

175
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,840
Please give me some time
alone with my bun cake.

176
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,630
It was this bizarrely
funny, but deeply sad,

177
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:52,690
perverse moments. Yeah.

178
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,360
I suppose it was the first
crack in my, in my bubbled, uh,

179
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,600
attempt to pretend things were normal.

180
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,030
[inaudible]

181
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,850
you know, I realized how
bad things had gotten

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:10,900
[inaudible]

183
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,460
and after that she says things
only got worse. It just became,

184
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,970
there was never anything to be
happy about. He wasn't able to eat,

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,980
he wasn't sure what the prognosis was.

186
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:25,870
He wasn't sure if he was going to need
a second surgery. It was just all bad.

187
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,380
She says John became really depressed
and he became very difficult to even,

188
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:34,150
not even to cheer up,
but just to say, well,

189
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,330
let's just not talk about
it for now. You know,

190
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,250
he was constantly expressing
his unhappiness was that,

191
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,590
was that the thing? It was just the,
it was dark all the time. Very dark.

192
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,460
Hmm.

193
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,550
It just became very hard to face.

194
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,530
So she left.

195
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,140
Well, I had spring break and
my kids had spring break.

196
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,160
So Susan took the kids to her parents'
place in Indiana for a week. I needed,

197
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,400
I needed to take a break for good.

198
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,870
Maybe the kind of break that means I'm
not really sure what our future looks

199
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:08,380
like.

200
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,820
I don't know how we're going to do this
and they can't really figure that out

201
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,680
while I'm with you. So I was alone,

202
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,680
not entirely while I was on the
food pump and not doing well.

203
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,490
But after a few days of moping
around the house, John gets an idea.

204
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,640
What I need to get myself out of this
is I need to return to a place of

205
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,150
sanctuary for me.

206
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,380
There was a restaurant not far from
your studio here called Chanterelle.

207
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,410
Uh,

208
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,040
it's a French restaurant and it was one
of these very expensive capital letter

209
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,030
restaurants that my wife and
I had always planned to go to.

210
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,520
If we had a special occasion for years.

211
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:51,110
I walked past this restaurant and I would
look in the window before getting onto

212
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:54,810
the subway and I would see
the plates of, you know,

213
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,080
scallops coming out and the
wine steward pouring, you know,

214
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,830
red wine and the handwritten menus
on the tables and things like that.

215
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,520
So I thought if I can get to chanterelle
and if I can look through the window,

216
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,630
then I can heal myself.

217
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:11,750
[inaudible]

218
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,960
I'll have a reason to hope.

219
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,480
So I got on the subway and it was past
four o'clock and I'm supposed to be home

220
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:23,481
starting up the pump and feeding and I
got off the subway and I walked over to

221
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,351
Chanterelle on,

222
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,560
I was kind of a little dizzy and
delirious and I get to the window

223
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:31,560
[inaudible]

224
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,360
and the dining room is empty.

225
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,620
[inaudible]

226
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,820
there's dust on the floor, the
wall panels have been stripped,

227
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,050
the tables are bare,
it's empty, it's a cave.

228
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,690
Sometime in the intervening months or
the proceeding months rather chanterelle

229
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,280
has closed. And I didn't know that.
Ah, you're killing me with this story.

230
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,670
And I think to myself, you've reached
the end of the line. This is it.

231
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:57,930
There's nowhere else to go.

232
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,583
[inaudible]

233
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,590
and um,

234
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,100
I walk towards the river and I know that
people throw themselves in when they do

235
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:09,040
this. And it never made
sense to me before, you know,

236
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,210
I wasn't ever ready to end
things. Well, you really, uh,

237
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,240
cause I was having
suicidal thoughts. I mean,

238
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,640
I always having really
depressed thoughts and I, I,

239
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:19,040
and I don't know that I
would have thrown myself in,

240
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,890
but it was the first time I was standing
at the edge thinking about it and

241
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,170
thinking about this is
how these things happen.

242
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,320
So I got to the river and I blacked out.

243
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,640
[inaudible]

244
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,790
collapsed on the sidewalk and
I, I woke up and it was dark.

245
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,810
No,

246
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,040
I had scraped my Chin and my elbows
were bruised and I'd taken a hard fall.

247
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,470
And, um, I got up and I
started to walk around. Uh,

248
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:51,680
I was on this buckled old sidewalk and
I looked around and there are these

249
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,710
federal era houses and there was a grill,

250
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,530
a gas grill in one of the
backyards that was going,

251
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,560
somebody was cooking dinner
and I could smell it.

252
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,500
I could smell the smoke coming off
the grill and I could smell it.

253
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,370
It was pork chops.

254
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,180
And I was so delirious and so happy to
be smelling food that I took it upon

255
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:19,250
myself to finish cooking
this guy's meal. So wait,

256
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,840
what? So I, um, it's so
eerie. I lifted up the lid,

257
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,740
I lifted up the lid and it
looked like to me, you know,

258
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:31,130
one side of the pork shops were cooked
and they were ready to be flipped.

259
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,320
So I flipped them. And, um, I was
so far gone that I thought, okay,

260
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:39,350
well four more minutes and these babies
are going to be ready to go. And,

261
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,930
and I didn't have a watch.
So I started counting off,

262
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,990
counting down for minutes in my head
because I was going to get this stuff

263
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:45,824
perfect.

264
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,490
And all of a sudden the back door of this
townhouse opens up and a guy walks out

265
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,610
with an apron on and a cocktail in one
hand and a season Shaker in the other.

266
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,460
And he looks at me and I
look very borderline. I mean,

267
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,920
I'm rail fin. I've got, you know,

268
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:10,730
I'm caught up from having fallen on
the sidewalk. I've got, you know,

269
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,470
crazy expression in my eyes. I
haven't shaved in, you know, a week.

270
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,230
I looked really very unsavory.

271
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,980
So he sees me and I have
no way of explaining myself
other than to say they're

272
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:26,840
just about done.

273
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,300
And I hand him the tools and I turn
around and I walk away before he has the

274
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,220
chance to call the police
or anything like that.

275
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,090
How many years ago was this? Uh,
this was now, uh, three years ago.

276
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,490
And what do you take away
from that? Was that, uh,

277
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,880
was that some kind of turning point
where you walk away from the grill and

278
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,160
you're ready to fight the
good fight or what? Um,

279
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,620
that only happens in the
movies and in fairytales.

280
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,370
But actually happened
was I got sick again. Uh,

281
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:58,460
I had another infection, more bacteria,

282
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,590
and I had to go back to the hospital.

283
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,460
And when I went back to the
hospital this time they said, okay,

284
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:09,500
we can't even do the food pump anymore
because you keep getting these infections

285
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,520
and if the bacteria spreads to your
bloodstream through the food pump,

286
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:17,660
but then you'll be gone and we can't
operate on you because you won't survive

287
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,650
the surgery. So all we
have left is to try eating.

288
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,300
The only thing that's left is to go
back to food cause you can't ingest it

289
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:27,230
intravenously.

290
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,010
We're afraid of infection and we
can't repair your gut surgically.

291
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,750
So the only way you can keep yourself
alive is to try to use your gun again.

292
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,220
Huh? So they start you on a,
on around have a, I don't know,

293
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:45,200
baby food gerbers I did start on the
traditional applesauce and Jello and

294
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:50,190
putting soft and easily digested
foods. And John says they worked,

295
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,660
his body was able to take the food
but I couldn't taste anything.

296
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,700
And it continued that way
for another couple of months.

297
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,830
And a deferred ever tastes like food
again. Well I was at the radiologist,

298
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,520
the scene, the scene I was
expecting. Yeah. Well you know,

299
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,760
I have a little ritual with
this particular radiologist.

300
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,090
He's on the east side and
whenever I get tests there,

301
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,370
when I'm done with the tests,
I'm able to eat again. And again,

302
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:20,370
this is when you do test prep, you're
going about 24 hours without eating.

303
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,121
So you know,

304
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:24,690
the thought of food becomes a celebration
that you're going to have. Right?

305
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,820
So there's a diner on third
avenue and 84th street,

306
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:33,510
a fifth street that I always go to
and I get the same meal every time.

307
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:38,511
I sit at the counter and I get fried
egg and Bacon Sandwich on whole wheat

308
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:39,384
toast.

309
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,380
So I went there and I got the last seat
at the counter and I ordered my usual

310
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:49,010
and I chew into it and I realized that
I've got sort of embryonic flavors going

311
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:54,181
on.

312
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:59,181
I've got the sort of the start of the
sensation of tasting and the start of

313
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:04,200
flavors in my mouth and I could feel
that great combination of the fried egg

314
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:08,910
congealing with the crunchy bacon and
the crunchy toast. And I do the same,

315
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,691
you know, mirror.

316
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,980
I've got a knife about a knife and I do
the same mirror knife examination at the

317
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:18,981
counter and I can see that where before
it was shiny and smooth as a porpoise.

318
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,600
I've got little bristles,

319
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:26,630
I've got little bumps on my tongue and
I can taste this fantastic $3 sandwich.

320
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,790
Do you kiss the lady
sitting next to you? Well,

321
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,270
I turned to the guy sitting
next to me and I tell him,

322
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,360
this is the best damn
thing I've ever eaten.

323
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,600
And in classic New York diner fashion.

324
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,470
Okay. Ready? Hey, I'm Jad
Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

325
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,500
This is radio lab and this whole hour we
have been talking about good guts guts.

326
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,390
In the last section we
talked about bacteria and the
armies of them that are in

327
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:53,990
your gut. Yeah.

328
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,450
The problem is that they're a little
hard to picture kind of abstract. Oh,

329
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,730
why don't we finish with a story that
makes the whole issue real and much more

330
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:02,271
concrete.

331
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:07,271
This is the tail of a
troubled relationship between
a man and his on again,

332
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:12,170
off again, gut. Yeah. Hello. Hello.
Hello man. His name is John Reiner.

333
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:13,730
He's a writer, lives here in New York.

334
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,260
So one day you are eating your way
through your life as you usually do,

335
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:21,320
and then things take an odd turn.
Yeah. How did it, how did it begin?

336
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,800
It began with the surprise.

337
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,960
I'm his at home and I was about
to go make myself a tuna. Yeah.
