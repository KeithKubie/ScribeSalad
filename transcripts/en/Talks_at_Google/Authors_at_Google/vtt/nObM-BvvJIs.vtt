00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:10.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.970
PROF.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.344
HARRY COLLINS: OK, thanks very
much for inviting me here.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.100
I'll kind of organize my
talk into different bits.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.720
So I'll go through
these sections--

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.650
Me and My Project, Some History,
the events from September

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.229
the 14th to February the 11th,
the Event and its Reception.

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.520
You know, this is the discovery
of gravitational waves,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.530
the first confirmed detection
of gravitational waves announced

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.270
at a press conference on
February the 11th, 2016.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.320
But the actual event was seen
on September the 15th, 2015.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.540
And a few more
things at the end,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.280
some which might be
quite interesting.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.249
And I'll head each of
the sections with this.

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:57.790
So we'll see how
we're getting along.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.950
I'll try and talk
for about 30 minutes

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.650
and leave plenty of time
for questions and answers

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.519
because there usually
are various questions.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.060
So let's start with
me of my project.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.220
I've been doing this for--

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.120
I think this is the 45th
year, not 30th year.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.520
At least, I started in 1972.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.020
Those were the
first interviews I

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.590
conducted on what was
then the controversy

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.825
over gravitational waves.

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:29.060
I'll talk a bit more
about that in a moment.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.700
And these are some of the books.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.740
"Gravity's Shadow," which
is a very thick book,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.600
it's about over 800 pages
long, nearly 900 pages,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.640
which was published in 2004.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.292
My advice is not to buy it
because once you start reading

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:44.500
it, you'll never put it down.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.590
And it will waste
a lot of your time.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.850
And the second-- that
book, "Gravity's Ghost,"

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.920
is actually two books in one.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.410
One book is called "Gravity's
Ghost," which was originally

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.900
published separately by itself.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.350
And then the second book
was called "Big Dog,"

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.360
and I persuaded the
publishers to include

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.940
"Gravity's Ghost" in the
publication of "Big Dog."

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.710
So this book is the
paperback version

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.900
of "Gravity's Ghost," as
well as being the paperback

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.920
version of "Big Dog."

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.620
There was never a
hardback version of it.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.940
And what that book describes is
two so-called blind injections.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.550
This is when the
big interferometric

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.950
gravitational wave
detectors were in business.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.090
I'll explain that in a moment.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.860
And what the scientist did
was get a small group, two

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.690
or three people, to inject
into the interferometers

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.630
a signal which looked
like a gravitational wave

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.380
and keep it secret so that
the whole community had

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.010
to investigate this signal
not knowing whether it was

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.520
a real signal or a fake signal.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.289
So they were rehearsing for
the detection of a real signal,

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:56.830
not knowing whether
they were already

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.069
looking at a real signal, to
make it as valid as possible.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.110
One of the things that
the book talks about a lot

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.070
is whether these blind
injections were really

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.647
mimicking a real detection
of gravitational waves.

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:11.230
Because now, we had
the real detection

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.188
of gravitational waves.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:22.020
This book is a real-time account
from the evening of September

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.560
the 15th, 2015, when I first
read the mail that said,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.570
interesting event has
happened, for about six months,

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.326
until the thing
was out in public.

00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:37.200
And then it goes on
about the reception of it

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.080
in public and so forth.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.760
It's all written in real time,
or mostly real time anyway.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.990
I didn't start
writing it until--

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.990
the event happened on a Monday.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.810
And I didn't start writing
the book until the Thursday

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.060
because I assumed it
wasn't a real event,

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.330
just like all the other
scientists did as well.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.480
You know, they thought, this
is another bit of noise.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.120
But then it grew
rapidly in credibility

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.110
over about two days.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.440
And then I realized, hey,
this is something interesting

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.360
going on here, and I started
to write on the Thursday,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.624
just having collected
the emails up till then.

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:20.550
And it was obviously
interesting from the word

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.960
go to be worth collecting
the emails, which I did.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.410
Incidentally, I'll tell
you how I wrote this book.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.060
I mean, I've been at this for
donkey's years, as you see.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.960
And my method is
mostly initially,

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.810
to interview the scientists.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.100
In 1972, I drove across
America in an old car

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.475
talking to all
the scientists who

00:04:41.475 --> 00:04:43.770
were involved in
gravitational wave detection.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.390
And then from the
mid-90s to the mid-2000s,

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.330
I went to every single
gravitational wave conference

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.520
that took place around
the world and got

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.470
to know the gravitational
wave scientists really well.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.210
I mean, one of the
very senior people

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.970
was staying with
us for the weekend

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.580
just last weekend, actually,
because we've become friends.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.900
And so I did an awful
lot of traveling.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.056
I used an awful lot of air
miles, enough air miles

00:05:16.056 --> 00:05:17.430
to travel business
class wherever

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.990
I went for about 10 years,
because I had all these air

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.490
miles.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.200
I can't do it anymore,
unfortunately.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.730
And so I was going to maybe six,
seven international meetings

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.210
a year across the world.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.864
But this event, I
assumed, was going

00:05:33.864 --> 00:05:36.030
to involve me in a hell of
a lot of airplane travel.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.640
But it didn't because
the whole thing happened

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.510
over email, emails, a few
telecoms, a few telephone

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.557
calls.

00:05:43.557 --> 00:05:45.390
Obviously, people were
talking to each other

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.306
in their local groups.

00:05:46.306 --> 00:05:49.710
Remember, this is a group
of 1,200 people scattered

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:50.790
around the world.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.250
And they did not at any
time during the course

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.010
of this discovery meet
together in one place.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.530
They did it all by
email and by telecom.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.080
And I was just sitting in the
middle of this web of emails

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.260
and telecoms collecting them.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.430
Now, the question
is, why on Earth--

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.539
why me?

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.580
If you want to know
something about the detection

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.940
of gravitational waves, why
have you invited a sociologist?

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.820
I'm a sociologist,
for heaven's sake.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.990
OK, and this is a fairly
serious question for me too.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.990
Am I capable of writing
about the detection

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.120
of gravitational waves?

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.870
And the answer is yes.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.590
But I'm going to justify
this a little bit more

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.790
than I might normally.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.610
Let me say one justification
is that when I write stuff,

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.560
I send it to the gravitational
wave physicists and say,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.390
read this and tell me if
there's anything wrong with it.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.930
I've never had any
serious problem.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.304
But you know, we
have a few odds.

00:06:48.304 --> 00:06:49.920
You know, you're
saying that, Harry.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.680
That's not true.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.505
And I say, well, I
think it is true.

00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:54.540
And we argue backwards
and forwards.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.320
And generally, when I have a
serious conversation like that,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.460
I'll alter maybe half of
the points that I object to

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.230
and leave the other
half as the were.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.815
That's the kind of way it goes.

00:07:05.815 --> 00:07:07.440
But I'm going to talk
a little bit more

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.440
about why it is that I am
capable of writing this book.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:17.070
Because I think one of the tests
I did is of particular interest

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.500
to you guys.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.370
And there you are.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.190
There's a piece in "Nature,"
"Sociologist Fools Physics

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.901
Judges."

00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:26.400
That's me.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.990
I'm the sociologist.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.980
And I did it by playing
imitation games,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.350
which, of course, are the
forerunner of the Turing test.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.160
So I thought you might be
slightly interested in these.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.340
And what this "Nature"
article is reporting

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.890
is something we did
in 2005-6, where

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:52.030
I got a gravitational physicist
from my university department

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.410
in Cardiff.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.490
Cardiff is, by coincidence,
by complete coincidence,

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.070
quite a big place for
gravitational wave physics.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.530
So I got one of the guys
from there, a professor

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.800
from there, to
ask some questions

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.640
of me and a gravitational
wave physicist.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.160
And then we had
three dialogues--

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.600
me, the question there, the
answer from Respondent A

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.540
there, the answer from
Respondent B there.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.150
This was sent to nine other
gravitational wave physicists.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.000
They were technical questions.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.790
And the nine other gravitational
wave physicists were asked,

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.610
which one's the real
gravitational wave physicist?

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.740
We've done a lot in Cardiff.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.450
Me and my group have done a
lot more imitation games since.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.760
We got a very nice 2 1/4 million
European Research Council

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.400
advanced grant to use imitation
games as a new social science

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:43.900
method.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.410
And we're just writing a
book about imitation games

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.460
for MIT Press.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.131
And then we repeated
this experiment.

00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:51.130
Those are the questions.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.820
Wait a minute.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.265
Let me just-- Sorry.

00:08:53.265 --> 00:08:54.390
We repeated the experiment.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.848
So these are the results for
some much more recent versions

00:08:56.848 --> 00:08:58.119
of it in 2016.

00:08:58.119 --> 00:09:00.160
If you want to know what
the questions were like,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.279
I've given you the
2016 questions.

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:04.570
Don't bother to read through
all those eight questions.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.970
Just pick one or
two at random so you

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.920
get a sense of the nature of
the questions being asked.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.100
This wasn't trivial stuff.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.580
OK, this was quite a
reasonably hard test.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.504
Same professor of physics at
Cardiff asked those questions.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.390
OK.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.150
And here's the
results of that test.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.820
So on the left-hand
side of the table,

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.810
you see that the question is--

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:40.890
this time we elaborated.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.870
We got not just me,
but other people

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.760
to answer the
questions, not just

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.560
me and a gravitational
wave physicist.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.330
We got three gravitational
wave physicists

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.790
to answer the questions.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.631
We got what I call
three savvy physicists

00:09:53.631 --> 00:09:54.630
to answer the questions.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.950
Now, savvy physicists
are astrophysicists

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.350
working in the same
department, Cardiff department,

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.340
as the gravitational
wave physicists.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.910
So they knew a lot about
gravitational waves

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.410
from working in the
same department,

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.800
as well as being
astrophysicists themselves.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.620
Two savvy social scientists--
and savvy social scientists

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.710
are people like my
junior colleagues

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.930
at Cardiff, who have to
read everything I ever

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.556
write and listen to me
talking at enormous length

00:10:22.556 --> 00:10:23.930
about gravitational
wave physics.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.410
So they know quite a
bit about it as well.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.080
And me, Harry Collins.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.590
And then on the right,
going across the top,

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.846
you see the people who
marked the answers.

00:10:33.846 --> 00:10:35.220
The people who
marked the answers

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.380
were another four
gravitational wave physicists,

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.510
four different ones entirely.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.760
OK?

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.974
The same two savvy
social scientists--

00:10:46.544 --> 00:10:48.960
it may have already struck you
that there's a problem here

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.260
because there are people
marking their own answers.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.577
But actually, it's
less of a problem

00:10:54.577 --> 00:10:56.160
than you think because
the marking was

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.270
done a long time after the
questions were being asked.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.040
And there are 72 randomly
ordered questions.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.710
And it's not actually
so easy to recognize

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.180
which question you'd answered.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.970
So it's a little bit messy,
but it's not too bad.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.302
OK, two ordinary
social scientists

00:11:11.302 --> 00:11:13.010
who knew nothing about
gravitational wave

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:17.100
physicists especially, because
they weren't under my control,

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.510
and me, myself.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.645
So the first thing to look
down is the left-hand column.

00:11:21.645 --> 00:11:24.270
And you'll see the way the four
gravitational wave physicists--

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.300
you could get a
maximum of 32 points

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.010
if you answered
every question right.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.060
And the three other
gravitational wave physics

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.040
got an average of
27 points, and I

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.480
got 25 points, which isn't bad,
whereas the non-gravitational

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.670
wave physicists,
crucially, including

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.250
the savvy physicists
who didn't know anything

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.180
about gravitational waves,
got considerably less points.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.590
And there's an
interesting lesson

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.200
in this very little
small experiment,

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.060
which is that expertises
are like crevasses.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.290
They're very narrow and deep.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.450
And it's not the
case that if you're

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.860
a scientist in a white coat,
you can go up and pronounce

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.150
authoritatively on any similar
subject that's close to yours.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.700
And this little tiny
experiment shows it.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.770
And even a snotty-nosed
sociologist

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.580
like me can do better in
answering those questions

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.310
than a physicist who
has spent a lot of time

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.980
near to other gravitational
wave physicists.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.152
Well, there's more
in that table.

00:12:25.152 --> 00:12:27.610
We can come back to it in the
question session if you want.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.440
But I don't want to spend
the whole lecture on that.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.650
So some history of this.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.500
The first person to have tried
to detect gravitational waves--

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.880
Einstein worked out
these were a consequence

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.650
of the theory of relativity
in the early 20th century.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:50.010
He worked out not the wave form,
but some of their properties

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:54.480
when he worked out the general
theory of relativity in 1915.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.010
The detection,
which was in 2015,

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.420
was miraculously just 100 years
after Einstein had come up

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.369
with a detailed idea.

00:13:03.369 --> 00:13:05.160
But the first person
to try and detect them

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.040
was Joe Weber, this
guy here, shown here,

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.990
who started to try
and detect them

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:14.610
in the early '60s with
a device like this.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:19.620
That thing he's working on
is a cylinder of aluminum,

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.010
weighing a ton-and-a-half or
a couple of tons, suspended,

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.470
insulated in a vacuum tube.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.660
It has piezoelectric
crystals glued

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:34.360
to its surface, which will
sense any slight vibration

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.362
in the cylinder.

00:13:35.362 --> 00:13:37.320
And the trick is to have
two of these cylinders

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.960
a couple of thousand
miles apart and look

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.740
for co-incident excitations
in the two cylinders.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.010
And what you see
is if this happens,

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:52.200
if you've eliminated all sources
of vibration in the cylinders--

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.780
you can't.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.990
They're always jiggling
about from Brownian motion

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.395
and residual vibrations
coming up through the Earth

00:13:59.395 --> 00:14:01.510
that you haven't quite
managed to damp out,

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.410
and residual 60 mains
frequency and things

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.660
like that that's coming
through the electrical system.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.570
But if you can eliminate
most of that stuff.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:16.300
And then you see a couple of big
excursions happening at exactly

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.600
the same time, or
to be more exact,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.640
within the light travel
time between the two

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.400
2,000-miles-an-hour detectors.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.820
OK?

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.080
You say, well, I can't think
what could have caused this.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.990
So we'll call that
gravitational waves.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.549
OK?

00:14:32.549 --> 00:14:34.840
You can think of some things
that could have caused it.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.140
If you get a lightning strike
somewhere in between the two

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.767
detectors, well,
they could cause it.

00:14:39.767 --> 00:14:41.350
And the other thing,
the sort of thing

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.120
that people used
to worry about is,

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.090
what if this happens
on Monday night

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:51.130
in America when everybody's
watching Monday Night Football?

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.050
And at the interval,
they all got up

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.180
and switched their kettles on.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.150
That's going to send a pulse
through the grid at exactly

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.870
the same time.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:59.560
And that could fool you.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.240
You might think
that's a gravity wave.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.990
But so wipe out all
that sort of stuff.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.060
And you try and measure
all that sort of stuff.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:10.390
And you try and get to
a gravitational wave.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:15.790
That's a schematic of
Joe Weber's design.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.720
Another half dozen people tried
to repeat Joe Weber's findings.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.720
Pretty well, completely,
they didn't confirm it.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.664
And that's when I come in
1972, going around interviewing

00:15:25.664 --> 00:15:27.580
both lots of scientists
and trying to work out

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.530
how they argue with
each other and how

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.165
they come to a conclusion.

00:15:31.165 --> 00:15:34.750
So that was my earliest work.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.180
And yeah, let's see that.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:40.440
So with that technology,
which was improved--

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.860
the next generation
of these resonance

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.660
bars was cooled down
to near absolute zero.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.957
They're quite difficult.
So Joe Weber's apparatus

00:15:49.957 --> 00:15:52.040
must have cost a few tens
of thousands of dollars.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.050
And then you're getting
into the hundreds

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:57.630
of thousands of dollars' worth
of cryogenically cooled bars.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.100
A big center for this
were Italy, as well as

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.960
the United States.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.370
And over the period
up to the early 2000s,

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.740
about half a dozen
claims were made

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.210
to have detected gravitational
waves with this technology.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.180
But they were all
shot down eventually

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.800
by the scientific community.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.430
That's an important piece of
context to the discovery when

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.770
it did happen, because you've
got to realize that when

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.900
these people were
thinking they were seeing

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.990
a gravitational
wave in 2015, this

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.380
was against a background of
nearly 50 years of shooting

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.980
down every single claim that
had ever been made to have seen

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.930
a gravitational wave.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:42.170
And there was a lot of paranoia
about and a lot of enmity

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.540
about because the rest
of the physics community

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.040
generally felt that
their money was

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.350
being wasted by
these idiots trying

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.300
to detect gravitational waves.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.255
I should add that--

00:16:53.255 --> 00:16:55.412
I should have said this before.

00:16:55.412 --> 00:16:56.870
The point about
gravitational waves

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.910
is they're very, very,
very difficult to detect.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.900
So how are they produced?

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.790
They're produced
by moving masses.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.010
So just as
electromagnetic waves are

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.589
produced by moving
electrons, my fist

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:12.010
here is producing
gravitational waves

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.579
because I'm moving it about.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:14.690
How much?

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.630
Well, probably about a quantum
of energy in the lifetime

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.329
of a couple of universes.

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.490
When Einstein worked
out the formula

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:26.220
for the emission of
gravitational waves,

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.840
in the denominator was a
factor of the speed of light

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.692
to the power of four.

00:17:32.692 --> 00:17:38.410
That just gives you a
sense of how difficult

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.535
to detect these things are.

00:17:39.535 --> 00:17:41.034
We'll come back to
that in a minute.

00:17:43.376 --> 00:17:44.750
So half a dozen
claims were made.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.130
And the point is that if
Joe Weber had been right

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:53.440
and he'd really been detecting
gravitational waves, according

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.900
to the theory, either
something very funny

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.730
would must have been
going on, like there

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.580
was a very local source
which we couldn't see--

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.280
I mean, really local--

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.895
emitting the waves
that he was saying.

00:18:05.895 --> 00:18:07.270
But most people
thought the waves

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.311
ought to be coming from
the center of the galaxy,

00:18:09.311 --> 00:18:11.920
if he was seeing them.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.150
Either that, or
so much energy was

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.930
being produced in
gravitational radiation

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.560
that the Milky Way should have
been burning up before our eyes

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.130
and disappearing.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.480
And people were
upset by that idea.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.510
And so they didn't really want
to accept Joe Weber's findings,

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.240
nor any of the
subsequent findings.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.800
So that's the early technology.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.600
Then the technology slowly
and gradually moved over

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.410
to interferometry.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.830
An interferometer-- who doesn't
know what an interferometer is?

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.190
Hands up.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:50.170
OK, an interferometer is
a device with two arms.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.131
There you can see the two arms.

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:52.630
OK?

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.460
You go from a center station.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.830
You shine light
down the two arms.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:00.220
The light is reflected back
from mirrors at the end.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.290
And then the reflected
light is combined

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:05.000
on a screen in the middle.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.290
And if that light
is coherent, you

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:14.950
will see a pattern of light
and dark so-called fringes,

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:18.480
light and dark
stripes on the screen.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.534
OK?

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:20.950
And the light and
dark stripes are

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.760
caused by the interference
of the two beams of light

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.770
coming back and
meeting each other.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.070
They're dark where
a trough and a peak

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.350
coincide and cancel
each other out.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.650
They're bright where
two peaks or two troughs

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.900
coincide and double the effect.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.910
So you get these light
and dark troughs.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:44.380
Now, supposing you minutely
increase the length of one

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:51.322
of the arms, then
the position where

00:19:51.322 --> 00:19:53.280
the light and dark troughs
will meet each other

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.540
will be slightly different.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.080
So what you will see is
that that pattern of fringes

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.330
moves slightly
across the screen.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.490
And this is an incredibly
sensitive instrument.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:05.600
Now, I've built one.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.880
I've built a lot of
these actually myself,

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.680
just a homemade one.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.520
And you can do it.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.420
And I'm going to
write another book

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.420
about gravitational waves
in which I'll give you

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.500
instructions on how to do it.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.420
But it's pretty easy.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.670
Mine has arms about--

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.240
my typical one has arms
about eight inches long.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.740
The source of light
is a laser pointer.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.805
OK?

00:20:26.805 --> 00:20:28.930
The mirrors are just bits
of broken shaving mirror.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.620
You don't need anything fancy.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:35.150
You need here a
beam splitter, which

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.150
should be something like
a semi-silvered mirror.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.120
But I've discovered any
old bit of glass will do.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.050
I just use a bit of glass out
of a picture frame from IKEA.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.350
And you can produce
interference fringes, not nice,

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:51.395
neat lined-up ones,
pretty rough ones.

00:20:51.395 --> 00:20:53.020
But nevertheless,
you can see that they

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.400
are interference fringes,
light and dark, the light

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.700
and dark pattern.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.910
And you can test this out.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.590
So this little type of
interferometer that I built

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.875
is made out of a
chip board as a base.

00:21:04.875 --> 00:21:06.250
And if you've get
a cup of coffee

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:10.060
and put it down on the
base somewhere near where

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.099
one of the beams is,
the wood will expand,

00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:14.890
and you will see the
expansion of that wood

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.410
as a movement of the
light and dark patches.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.600
And when you take the coffee
back, pick your coffee cup up,

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.330
that expansion will
slowly go back again.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.480
And then you can put your
coffee cup near the other beam,

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.880
and you will see the
movement of the fringes

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.280
in the other direction and
back again and so forth.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.320
So it's quite a nice
fun instrument to build.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.950
I just did that
for myself, to help

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.450
myself be more of a participant
in the whole gravitational wave

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:42.950
business.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.867
So I once took it to a
physicist, a gravitational wave

00:21:46.867 --> 00:21:48.450
physicists' conference
and said, well,

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:49.616
do you want to display this?

00:21:49.616 --> 00:21:50.593
And they sneered at me.

00:21:50.593 --> 00:21:51.092
So--

00:21:51.092 --> 00:21:52.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.240
Because, of course,
their interferometers

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.920
are somewhat more sensitive.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.690
The interferometers used in
the detection instrument,

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.970
the arms are four
kilometers long.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:05.850
OK?

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:10.040
The lasers are
extraordinarily powerful.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.487
And the light doesn't just
bounce four kilometers

00:22:12.487 --> 00:22:13.070
and come back.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.730
It bounces backwards
and forwards

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:19.550
100 times before they recombine
it, and so on and so on and so

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.660
on and so on and so on.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.240
These things are probably--

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.330
no, I don't way probably.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.530
They are the most sensitive
large-scale instruments

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.940
that have ever
been built. It may

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.650
be that they're the most
sensitive instruments that

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.441
have ever been built.
But they're certainly

00:22:32.441 --> 00:22:34.460
the most sensitive
large-scale instruments that

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.630
have ever been built.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.730
So that kind of
interferometry took over

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:44.610
from about the early
2000s or late 1990s.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:47.760
And there was a big war
between the people championing

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.700
the interferometer
technology, which

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.790
costs hundreds of
millions of dollars,

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:56.990
and the people championing the
resonant bar technology, which

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.926
costs $100,000.

00:22:57.926 --> 00:22:59.804
There was a big
war between them.

00:22:59.804 --> 00:23:01.970
And one of the things I
document in my earlier books

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:06.230
is how this war played out, how
they won, and what happened.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:11.460
But by now, the resonant
bars are almost forgotten.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.040
Those are the two big
interferometers in America,

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.570
one in Hanford in
Washington State,

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.710
one in Livingston, Louisiana.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.980
And there, you can see
the four-kilometer arms

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.520
stretching into the distance
and the center station.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.460
And it was these instruments
that made the discovery.

00:23:32.407 --> 00:23:34.365
There are two generations
of these instruments.

00:23:34.365 --> 00:23:38.220
The initial LIGO
was built about--

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.690
well, it was taken down
about five or six years ago.

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:45.290
And they used the
same housings to put

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.940
in bigger mirrors, more powerful
lasers, various other things

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.190
like this, better
suspension and so on so

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.230
that it would work still better.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:57.260
And that was ready for
business in the autumn of 2015.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.261
February the 11th was
the press conference,

00:24:00.261 --> 00:24:01.260
which you may have seen.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.490
It was all over all the news
bulletins when that gravity

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:06.720
waves had been discovered.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.360
I was up here in London,
because they had a little press

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.470
conference in London.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.220
I went to that.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.750
And down in the basement of the
building, we went afterwards,

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.316
we went for a drink.

00:24:17.316 --> 00:24:19.670
And I was doing high
fives with the physicists

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.380
as the announcement came up
on the BBC News at 6 o'clock.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.160
This is the very first email.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.600
I keep writing
September the 14th.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.130
I'm sorry about that.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:33.450
That's the phrase.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:39.440
"Hi all, cWB has just put on
gracedb a very interesting

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.580
event in the last hour."

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.150
OK.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.722
If you want to find out what
all those technical terms mean,

00:24:45.722 --> 00:24:46.930
you'll have to read the book.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.390
It's all explained
in some detail.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.350
But that was it.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:56.800
But didn't excite
me particularly.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.640
I just thought, oh, I'd
better save-- you see,

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.040
I'm always getting--

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.090
for years, been getting
dozens of emails a day

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.380
from the gravitational
wave community.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.230
Every now and again, I think,
oh, that might be interesting.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.867
I'll put them in
a separate folder.

00:25:09.867 --> 00:25:12.450
But mostly, I just delete them
after reading the subject line.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.908
But this one, I
thought, well, I'll

00:25:13.908 --> 00:25:16.740
start putting these
in their own folder

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.780
and see how it fades out.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.070
And you know, a couple
of months later,

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.580
I just reaffirmed that I was
not the only person thinking

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.079
like that.

00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:28.240
So you can read that quote from
a gravitational wave physicist.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.610
Now, he says, could it have
appeared so early in the run?

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:48.800
It's because the machines
weren't officially switched on.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.930
They weren't supposed to
be officially switched

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.110
on for another few days.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.520
What was going on was
an engineering run,

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.290
and they were still
being shaken down.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:04.430
As it happens, that was an
extraordinarily lucky thing.

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.672
On the one hand, people
who were doubters-- well,

00:26:06.672 --> 00:26:08.505
this shouldn't happen
in an engineering run.

00:26:08.505 --> 00:26:12.200
And are we in a position to
make any claim with this, given

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.750
that it's an engineering run?

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.980
There'll be too much noise.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.747
The machine won't
be steady enough.

00:26:17.747 --> 00:26:19.580
People will have been
messing about with it.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.996
But it turned out people hadn't
been messing about with it

00:26:21.996 --> 00:26:24.470
just around the time,
and there was just

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:28.460
enough period of
smooth noise for them

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.894
to be able to do this--

00:26:30.894 --> 00:26:32.810
for there to be enough
of that period for them

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.400
to be able to do
the calculations,

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.550
the statistical calculations
they needed to do.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.020
So that was so early in the run.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:44.090
But the great advantage of
it being so early in the run

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.540
is that it made it
very unlikely that this

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.930
was a blind injection.

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:53.522
Because that's what all the
physicists, by this time,

00:26:53.522 --> 00:26:54.230
were fed up with.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.830
They'd already spent
a lot of their lives

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:01.549
analyzing and investigating
blind injection.

00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:03.340
And they didn't want
to have to investigate

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.995
another blind injection.

00:27:04.995 --> 00:27:06.370
And they thought,
oh, no, this is

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.411
the management shoving it
another blind injection

00:27:08.411 --> 00:27:09.550
to test us again.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:10.720
And nobody knows what to do.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.730
Because if you're
seriously investigating

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.520
gravitational waves,
your life changes.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.690
You know, you stop talking
to your partner and family

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:20.950
and seeing your kids.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:24.130
You're working like hell
to analyze the data.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.860
And it's even worse
for me, because I'd

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.820
written two books about
blind injections, which

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.290
was a good thing.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:32.960
That was fine.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.590
I was happy about it.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.298
But there was no way
I was going to write

00:27:35.298 --> 00:27:37.240
a third about blind injection.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.785
And that meant if it had
been a blind injection,

00:27:39.785 --> 00:27:41.410
I would have been
wasting another three

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:42.630
months of my life.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.130
Now, I spoke to the director
of the project, and said, look,

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.240
this is going to happen.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.823
If you put in another
blind injection,

00:27:47.823 --> 00:27:51.160
you better tell me, because
I can't spend another--

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.950
I'm too old to spend another
three months of my life messing

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.720
about with a blind injection.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.300
And he kind of--

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.980
I think we had an
understanding that he would.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.290
OK?

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.510
And then we worked out,
how am I going to keep it,

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:07.480
the fact that I know, a
secret from everybody else.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.760
And I'll pretend that
I'm very ill so I can't

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.622
get on the planes to fly to
meetings, which I thought would

00:28:12.622 --> 00:28:13.705
be necessary at that time.

00:28:13.705 --> 00:28:15.590
It turned out not to be.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:19.880
And we sort of had a nod
and a wink about that.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:24.130
But because it happened
in this engineering run,

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.676
most people were ready to
believe the directorate when

00:28:27.676 --> 00:28:29.050
they sent around
an email saying,

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.820
no, this is not a
blind injection.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.352
I mean, there was
a lot of paranoia.

00:28:32.352 --> 00:28:34.310
There were people who
still didn't believe them

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.685
They thought, oh,
those bastards.

00:28:35.685 --> 00:28:38.191
They're trying to test
us even more, you know.

00:28:38.191 --> 00:28:40.169
But eventually,
people decided, well,

00:28:40.169 --> 00:28:41.710
there's nothing we
can do about this.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:43.600
We've got to get on
with the analysis.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.480
And I decided, if this turns out
to be a blind injection, that's

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.650
the last I'm going to
have to do with LIGO.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:49.150
OK?

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:52.000
But it wasn't a blind injection.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.520
And I was reassured
by the fact--

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.750
five minutes.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.090
Oh, I'm going to take a bit
longer than my promised half

00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:58.660
hour.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.160
OK?

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.140
Is that all right?

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:05.244
So it was OK.

00:29:05.244 --> 00:29:06.910
Then the other thing
that people started

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:09.049
to do-- so you've
got this signal.

00:29:09.049 --> 00:29:10.090
Do you believe it or not?

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:12.930
Well, I will tell
you that remarkably--

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.560
and this was
completely astonishing,

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.340
given the paranoia
that was around--

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:22.090
that it only took about two days
before people began to believe

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.490
this was a real signal.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.590
Once they dismissed
the idea of--

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.134
they hadn't yet dismissed
the idea of blind injection.

00:29:29.134 --> 00:29:31.300
And the other thing that
everybody was worried about

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.130
was it a malicious hack.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.740
Was it some clever
malicious people

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:40.600
from Google who
got into the system

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.170
and injected something
which appeared

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.790
to be a gravitational wave
into the big machines?

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:51.310
And one of the big efforts
was to work out, well,

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.660
what would it take to do?

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.407
Is it credible that somebody
could have hacked into it

00:29:55.407 --> 00:29:55.990
and done this?

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.330
And the conclusion
was, no, it wasn't.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.970
It would have required
too big a conspiracy,

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:01.970
and it couldn't be done.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:05.500
People were reasonably
satisfied with that notion.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.249
Though the idea of a
malicious hack, or a hack,

00:30:08.249 --> 00:30:10.790
is still around among the fringe
scientists who don't believe

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:11.289
this.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.330
So that was another thing
that spent a lot of time.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.090
And then the analysis
starts, you know.

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.100
The belief, that
belief in two days,

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.330
came because the signal produced
a very nice waveform, which

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:29.860
very nicely matched the
signal from an inspiraling

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.250
binary pair of black holes.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.770
And the waveform
overlapped very nicely

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.840
on the two detectors,
the one at Hanford

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.470
and the one at Livingston, a
couple of thousand miles apart.

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:43.960
And that got people
to believe it.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.920
But that's not good enough
for the physics community.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.930
For the physics
community, you have

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.110
to show that the unlikelihood
of this being due to chance

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.330
is about one in 3.5 million.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.960
That's the five-sigma standard.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.480
There's a whole
sociological story

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.180
about how that sigma,
how that standard changed

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.500
in physics from three-sigma
in the 1960s up to five-sigma

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:11.060
in the 2000s, which is
also discussed in the book.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.660
So that's the signal.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.840
That's the figure from
the first publication.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.030
That's a slightly simpler
and more easy to understand

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.030
version of it, which I
got one of the physicists

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.410
to draw for me.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:28.420
And you can see--

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.520
oh, you've got to
do a few things.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:38.020
So that's what the signal from
one of these overlapping--

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.250
sorry, inspiraling
binary neutron stars

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:42.140
ought to look like.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.130
OK?

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:46.100
This is more like what it
would look like on the machine.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.110
You've got to take into
account the sensitivity

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:51.440
of the machine at the various
different frequencies.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.610
And these are the actual
signals from the machine.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:59.780
And they overlap very
nicely, as you can see here.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:00.620
OK?

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.127
And if you take that
overlapping signal out,

00:32:03.127 --> 00:32:04.210
this is what you get left.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.540
And it looks like noise.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.590
Therein lies a story.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.320
Does anybody know--

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:15.800
I'm doing a piece of
sociological fieldwork now.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.010
Has anybody heard of
any recent objections

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:23.150
to the validity of
this finding by LIGO?

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.060
Yeah.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:24.620
Anybody else?

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.450
That's one person.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:27.540
You've heard of it.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.290
Yeah.

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:29.950
OK.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.060
Yeah, see, I really
want to know this.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.060
Really, put your hands up
high because I want to count.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.420
One, two, three, four, five.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:43.174
OK, five people
in a room of 100.

00:32:43.174 --> 00:32:45.862
Yeah, something like that.

00:32:45.862 --> 00:32:47.679
And what they found
out, these people

00:32:47.679 --> 00:32:49.220
who were making the
recent objection,

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.630
is they've analyzed this.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:58.040
And they found out that there
is an overlapping signal here.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.960
And there is
leftover because when

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.140
the subtraction was
made of this from this,

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.640
it wasn't done quite right.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.150
And so there is, in fact, a
bit of overlapping signal here.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.371
But for some reason,
these objectors

00:33:14.371 --> 00:33:16.620
have decided that the fact
that there's an overlapping

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.520
signal there means that the
original detection can't

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.830
be trusted.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:28.200
Nobody in LIGO thinks this is in
any way a reasonable objection.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.880
And for what my
opinion is worth,

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.500
I don't think it is either.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.650
But it's interesting
sociologically

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.380
and bears very nicely on
the difference between what

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.650
you know when you
are inside a team

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:43.410
and what you know when
you're outside a team.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.710
Because the objectors
are outside the team.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:48.810
And they, as most people
think, don't know how

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:50.700
to analyze the signal properly.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.670
And that goes back to
my little experiment

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.280
on the narrow crevasse-like
nature of science.

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:04.910
Just the difference
between how you

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.250
come to believe in a signal,
which was the overlapping

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:11.090
waveforms, and what you have
to do to prove it to the wider

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:13.500
scientific community,
you could read

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.980
that quotation from one of the
gravitational wave physicists.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:20.630
They did a little jiggery-pokery
with the statistics.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.139
Everybody was agonizing,
was this legitimate,

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:25.699
or what was this
statistical massage

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:29.615
concluded it wasn't statistical
massage, what they did was OK.

00:34:29.615 --> 00:34:31.370
And I believe it was OK as well.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:36.980
But you see there's a nice
thought about it from one

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.960
of my colleagues in the
gravitational wave physicist.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.320
And you see how people
are worried about--

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.820
The reason I'm
putting out the quote

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.230
is you want to see the
difference between what

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:47.000
makes people believe
in something,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.310
and what makes people
think about what

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:53.502
they have to do to convince
the wider scientific community.

00:34:53.502 --> 00:34:56.210
The event and its
reception, that's

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.010
what was said at the
press conference.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:59.730
"We have detected
gravitational waves.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.908
We did it."

00:35:01.908 --> 00:35:05.830
What nobody knew at
the time, and what

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:10.610
I was extremely cross
about, was that the reason--

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:13.370
one of the reasons anyway--
that the announcement was made

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:17.270
was such huge confidence
is because by that time,

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:21.830
they had already seen a second
gravitational wave, which

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:27.020
hit on Boxing Day,
2015, December the 26th.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.720
But they decided as they hadn't
finished fully analyzing it,

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.750
they weren't going to mention
it in the discovery paper.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:37.100
I thought this was deceitful,
and it was falsifying history.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.880
Because the real-- there
have been cases in physics

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.310
before where a single event
has turned out to be wrong.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:47.150
The most famous one is
that magnetic monopole.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:50.030
And during the course
of this whole event,

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.500
people were saying,
oh, let's hope

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.410
this isn't another
magnetic monopole.

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:57.000
And then on December the
26th, the Boxing Day after,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.040
a little bit of analysis
had been done on it.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.620
And there was a
great sigh of relief.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.237
Thank heaven we
found a second one.

00:36:02.237 --> 00:36:04.820
But that wasn't mentioned in the
discovery announcement, which

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.444
it seemed to me to
be completely wrong.

00:36:09.117 --> 00:36:11.450
The title of the paper, that
was the title of the paper,

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.949
"Observation of Gravitational
Waves From a Binary Black Hole

00:36:13.949 --> 00:36:15.020
Merger."

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:19.040
and it really did, when I
was not in sociological mode,

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.096
but scientific mode, send
cold shivers down my spine

00:36:23.096 --> 00:36:25.220
to imagine this would happen
after I'd been hanging

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.780
about for over 44 years.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.540
This is the event.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.070
A billion-and-a-half years
ago, a billion-and-a-half light

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:36.140
years away, two black holes of
masses 36 and 29 solar masses

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.260
collided, losing three
suns' worth of mass,

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.800
which was totally converted
into gravitational wave energy.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.220
Compare that three
suns' worth of mass

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:48.920
with about a gram
converted into energy

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.620
for the first atomic
bomb, five pounds

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:56.150
from the biggest hydrogen
bomb that's ever been made.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:59.960
If the energy had been emitted
as electromagnetic radiation,

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.390
it would have been brighter
than the full moon,

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:05.882
even though it was a
billion-and-a-half light years

00:37:05.882 --> 00:37:08.090
away, brighter than the full
moon for just a fraction

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:09.750
of a second.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.510
And if it happened
where our sun was,

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:15.290
it would have evaporated the
solar system in an instant.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.470
But as the energy was emitted
as gravitational waves--

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:21.960
remember I said how faint it is,
faint gravitational radiation

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:26.000
is-- if you'd been at
a distance of our sun

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.480
from this huge
emission of energy,

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.460
all you would have
noticed would have

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:37.370
been a slight bang in your
ears as the bones in your ears

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:40.430
were moved slightly by the
gravitational wave passing by.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:42.450
You wouldn't have
noticed it otherwise.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:46.490
The effect on the four-kilometer
interferometer arms,

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:49.940
changes in the length of one
arm as compared to the other,

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:57.520
down to 1/10,000th of the
diameter of a proton, small,

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.210
which I worked out.

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.640
Now, I live in Cardiff.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:05.660
That's Cardiff Bay taken
from what was then my study.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.050
Cardiff Bay is about a
square mile of water.

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:11.140
What you were looking for was
a rise in the level of Cardiff

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.570
Bay, which would have been
caused by the addition

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:17.730
of 1/1,000 of a drop of water.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:20.100
And that's why I said it's
the most sensitive instrument

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.236
that's probably ever been built.

00:38:22.236 --> 00:38:24.280
Here's the press conferences.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.590
Here's the newspaper headlines.

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.610
There's a song to the tune
of "I'm a Believer" written

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:30.700
by some of the physicists.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:38.110
There's the huge spike
in Google Trends, which

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.300
shows that the whole
population has suddenly

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.560
become fascinated by
gravitational waves,

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.130
but not as fascinated as
they are in Kim Kardashian--

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.490
--which was checked
out at the same time.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:55.420
It's about 2% of Kim
Kardashian's peak

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.240
and completely invisible
by Kim Kardashian's

00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.770
average popularity.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.520
OK?

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.680
A few more things.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.300
How do we know
it's true nowadays?

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.470
Well, we don't.

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:15.850
Discoveries in physics
are social changes.

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:18.750
And one of the reasons these
social changes come about

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:23.540
is because you know when
to stop questioning.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:26.390
There's all kinds of doubts
you can still think up.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.990
OK?

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:29.930
The whole thing depends on
trust and a reasonable level

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.580
of questioning.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.530
On the day of the
press announcements,

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.960
this was announced in CERN.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:41.960
And I listened to the recording
of the announcement in CERN.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.380
And somebody said, how do we
know that the gravity waves

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.610
travel at the speed of light?

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:48.735
Because if they don't travel
at the speed of light,

00:39:48.735 --> 00:39:49.670
all bets are off.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.740
How do we know they travel
at the speed of light?

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.201
The whole observation
is consistent

00:39:53.201 --> 00:39:54.950
with them traveling
at the speed of light.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.780
But we've never
had any real proof.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.060
And somebody put up their
hand from the audience

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:02.060
and said, look, if you carry
on questioning like this,

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:05.300
we'll soon have uninvented
the Higgs boson.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:05.800
OK?

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.530
And that's right.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:08.154
That's the reason
you stop questioning,

00:40:08.154 --> 00:40:12.670
because if you question deeply
enough, everything collapses.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:15.760
Undiscover the Higgs.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.460
Then there's a whole lot of
stuff with the fringe, who

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.290
were criticizing it.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:21.479
The fringe don't believe it.

00:40:21.479 --> 00:40:23.020
I was in touch with
fringe scientists

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.340
and corresponding with them.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.900
And the reason was--

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.607
well, I'd better stop actually.

00:40:30.607 --> 00:40:32.440
Otherwise, we won't
have time for questions.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.140
We can always come back to
these slides if you want.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.287
But I'll stop there.

00:40:37.287 --> 00:40:40.269
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:44.765 --> 00:40:46.390
SPEAKER: We do have
time for questions.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:48.313
Please wait for the microphone.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:56.010
AUDIENCE: Why did you pick
gravitational waves community

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:56.830
to study?

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:57.330
PROF.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.010
HARRY COLLINS: Pure coincidence.

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:00.600
I was doing my PhD.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.500
I had already done a study
of scientific communication

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.370
among people building
a new kind of laser,

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:10.290
the transversely excited
atmospheric pressure CO2 laser.

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.910
I wanted a more competitive
field to compare it with.

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:17.632
I read about the controversy
in the "New Scientist."

00:41:17.632 --> 00:41:18.840
And I thought, that'll do me.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.298
I picked one or
two others as well.

00:41:20.298 --> 00:41:22.530
AUDIENCE: And is there a
community of sociologists

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:23.670
doing equivalent work?

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:26.291
Is there someone embedded in
the Higgs boson community,

00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:26.790
for example?

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.838
PROF.

00:41:26.838 --> 00:41:28.680
HARRY COLLINS: Well,
there are sociologists

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.950
going around studying
other bits of science.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.080
I'm trying to encourage
more of this kind of work

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:38.280
to be done because I think
it's very important that people

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.640
outside of the technical
scientific community

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.640
have a really deep
understanding of science.

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.870
AUDIENCE: How much does
this observatory cost?

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:57.000
And when you take the whole
scientific budget, the budget

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.640
allocated for the scientific
research, fundamental research,

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:04.301
how much is allocated for
this particular device?

00:42:04.301 --> 00:42:04.801
PROF.

00:42:04.801 --> 00:42:06.060
HARRY COLLINS: OK,
well, the whole lot, you

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.970
can say nowadays, by now, it's
cost about a billion dollars.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.430
I don't know how that compares
with the scientific budget

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:16.210
as a whole.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.750
One of the problems
for the interferometers

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.640
was being so expensive.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.690
I should have said they were
funded by the US National

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:26.760
Science Foundation.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.010
And it was the biggest
experiment the National Science

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.200
Foundation had ever funded.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.070
Now, high energy
physics is mostly funded

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:36.510
by the Department of Energy.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:39.160
And they have a lot more money.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.340
So the trouble
with gravity waves

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.400
is it had an impact on
the many scientists doing

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.730
much smaller experiments
which were funded by the NSF.

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:53.340
So it became very unpopular
among a large constituency.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.950
But when people ask
me how much it costs,

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.620
I always say, well, probably
about the same as the wing

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.680
of a stealth fighter.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.460
You know, compare it
with military budgets

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.320
to put it in
perspective, I think.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.310
AUDIENCE: There must be similar
ones built all around the world

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:10.830
also, right?

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:13.266
I heard in India, they
are building one there.

00:43:13.266 --> 00:43:13.766
PROF.

00:43:13.766 --> 00:43:14.599
HARRY COLLINS: Yeah.

00:43:14.599 --> 00:43:17.750
AUDIENCE: Does it make sense
to spend that much money there?

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:18.250
PROF.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:23.824
HARRY COLLINS: Yeah,
in India, they're now--

00:43:23.824 --> 00:43:25.740
and there's been a long
negotiation over this.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:30.460
They're building the
infrastructure for it,

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.250
the beam tubes and
the foundations

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:33.820
and the buildings in India.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.230
But the interferometer parts
are coming from America,

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:39.180
because when initial
LIGO was built,

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:43.260
they built three interferometers
within the beam tubes for two.

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.470
And they're taking the third
one, and that's going to India.

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:47.950
Why does it make sense?

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.950
Well, why does the
whole thing makes sense?

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:52.800
It makes sense because
it's a fantastic

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.620
confirmation of Einstein's
general theory of relativity.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.020
But it also makes sense
if you like astronomy.

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:02.370
Because where it goes
is the foundation

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:06.840
of a new gravitational
wave astronomy, which

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.970
enables you to see
things that you can't see

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:10.740
with electromagnetic astronomy.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.900
So you can pretty
well look directly

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:16.690
at black holes, which can't
be seen any other way.

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:18.410
So this phenomenon
that was discovered,

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.510
the inspiraling of two
black holes, nobody

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:23.177
knew if such things existed.

00:44:23.177 --> 00:44:25.260
So there were two discoveries,
the first discovery

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.200
of gravitational waves and the
first discovery of inspiraling

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.700
binary black holes.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.770
Why do we need
another one in India?

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:36.330
Well, what the ideal is is
to move this astronomy along

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:39.930
so that you can see
a gravitational wave

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.210
and compare its
position in the sky,

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:43.860
look at its position
in the sky with

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:46.554
electromagnetic telescopes.

00:44:46.554 --> 00:44:48.720
And for that reason, you've
got to know its position

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.380
in the sky.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.930
And the only way to know
its position in the sky

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:55.890
is by triangulation
of the time of arrival

00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:59.670
of the event on widely
separated instruments.

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:02.950
At the moment, with
only two instruments,

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.874
you get a huge area on the sky
where it could have come from.

00:45:05.874 --> 00:45:07.540
There's a third one,
actually, in Italy,

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.324
which is just coming online.

00:45:09.324 --> 00:45:10.740
And then with the
India one, there

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.220
will be four, fairly
widely separated.

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.950
And you may be able to
narrow down the position

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:18.180
in the sky more narrowly then.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.900
And then your
gravitational astronomy

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.253
will get better and better.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.980
AUDIENCE: With hindsight,
we can certainly

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:34.490
tell that the first 40
years of interferometers

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:36.976
were clearly not
sensitive enough.

00:45:36.976 --> 00:45:37.476
PROF.

00:45:37.476 --> 00:45:38.420
HARRY COLLINS: Well,
it's not 40 years

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.027
of interferometers, 40 years--

00:45:40.027 --> 00:45:41.360
AUDIENCE: 40 years of detectors.

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:41.406
PROF.

00:45:41.406 --> 00:45:42.290
HARRY COLLINS: Yeah.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:44.414
AUDIENCE: Was there any
acknowledgement at the time

00:45:44.414 --> 00:45:46.157
that this might be the case?

00:45:46.157 --> 00:45:46.657
PROF.

00:45:46.657 --> 00:45:47.490
HARRY COLLINS: Yeah.

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:51.320
I mean, Joe Weber, who
I interviewed in '72,

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.560
told me that when he
built this apparatus,

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.430
he didn't expect
to see anything.

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:57.710
Because everybody knew it
was not sensitive enough

00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:03.620
by a factor of 1,000 million.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:08.140
And the question
is, what do you do

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.690
when you appear to
make a discovery which

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:12.080
ought to be impossible?

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.960
Do you say, oh, forget about it,
it's theoretically impossible?

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.650
Or do you say,
well, maybe we need

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:20.500
to think rethink our
theories through?

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.110
And a lot of people did start
rethinking their theories

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:26.650
and find ways to make
Joe Weber's findings

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:31.240
compatible with theory, like
focusing of gravitational waves

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.370
by some curious mechanism.

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:35.290
So there's a dilemma there.

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:37.990
And that dilemma was played
out among the people who

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:41.440
put experiment first and the
people who put theory first.

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.116
So everybody knew
that in theory,

00:46:44.116 --> 00:46:48.140
at least in the initial theory,
these instruments were far too

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.020
insensitive to see anything.

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:52.080
But the determined
experimentalists still

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.282
felt, well, if I've
seen something,

00:46:54.282 --> 00:46:55.240
I'm going to report it.

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:03.900
AUDIENCE: Do you see any
sociological parallels

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:09.450
between the whole field of
gravitational waves and people

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:12.388
on both sides of it
to climate science?

00:47:12.388 --> 00:47:12.888
PROF.

00:47:12.888 --> 00:47:13.846
HARRY COLLINS: Oh, yes.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.220
As I said, I did my first
lot of interviews in 1972

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:24.500
and then another lot
of interviews in '75.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:32.430
Well, in '72-- in 1974, I wrote
the paper that emerged out

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:36.810
of the 1972 fieldwork.

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:38.700
And the big claim in
that paper, the reason

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:43.290
I got a secure university
job and had a stellar career

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:47.059
subsequently was
the observation I

00:47:47.059 --> 00:47:49.350
made that there was something
called the experimenter's

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:50.455
regress.

00:47:50.455 --> 00:47:53.886
And the experimenter's
regress goes like this.

00:47:53.886 --> 00:47:55.260
Scientists say,
well, if you want

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.470
to know whether
something is true or not,

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:57.690
you have to replicate it.

00:47:57.690 --> 00:47:58.872
And I think that's correct.

00:47:58.872 --> 00:48:00.830
But the trouble is, how
do you know whether you

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:02.910
replicated something or not?

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:05.610
So the people who copied Joe
Weber's experiment, or roughly

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.520
copied it, said, look, we've
built an apparatus like yours,

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.110
Joe, and we don't see anything.

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:11.760
And Joe Weber said
to them, that's

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.010
because you haven't
built it right.

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:16.200
And that's not an
unreasonable claim,

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.110
because doing an experiment
is very, very, very, very

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:22.800
difficult. Think about the
experiments you did at school.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.550
They never worked mostly.

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:25.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:26.310
OK?

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.250
You have to be told
by the school teacher

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:29.670
that they weren't
working, and you

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:33.079
had to keep on repeating them
until you got them to work.

00:48:33.079 --> 00:48:35.370
And this is what Joe Weber
said the other people needed

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:36.630
to be doing.

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:37.590
Yeah?

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:43.230
So what happens is if you
look at what happened in '72

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.270
and for a few years
afterwards, the argument

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:47.820
turned from, has
this been repeated,

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:53.250
to who's competent to repeat it.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:54.960
Who's the most
competent experimenter?

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.100
Is it Joe Weber?

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.230
Or is it his rivals?

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:59.820
And then when you
get this idea--

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:04.730
you see it happens all the time,
cold fusion, climate change.

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:08.420
Yes, you can put this
template onto climate change

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.310
and it works very well.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:13.250
I mean, the next problem you
have, having done all that,

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:16.760
is to say, well,
how do we come down

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.260
on the right side
of climate change.

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:24.050
And I've been involved in a
huge row since the early 2000s

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:26.870
with my colleagues, because we
put forward the view that we

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:30.170
have to shift our attention
in social studies of science

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:33.110
from how do you reach
the truth to how

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:35.750
do you decide who's an expert.

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:38.040
And you should always
listen to the experts,

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.920
whether they're right or wrong.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.740
Because otherwise, your
society is going to collapse,

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.870
and you're going
to have a dystopia.

00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:47.090
And fortunately, my
friend Donald Trump

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:49.950
has come along to help
my views get salient.

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:52.215
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.179
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:55.179 --> 00:49:56.470
Thanks very much for your talk.

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:57.261
I was just curious.

00:49:57.261 --> 00:49:59.770
You mentioned before
about how black holes

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:03.720
can't be observed any other
way, except gravitational waves.

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.860
So how did they know
when they observed

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.740
these gravitational waves
that they were two black holes

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:09.280
rotating?

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.816
Is it because they had the
theoretical model of what

00:50:12.816 --> 00:50:14.440
the gravitational
waves would look like

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.606
and this kind of matched it?

00:50:15.606 --> 00:50:17.380
Or was there some other
way that they knew

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:18.730
these black holes were there?

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:19.230
PROF.

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.980
HARRY COLLINS: No.

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:23.080
It's a good question.

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:23.690
So two things.

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:27.560
Yeah, firstly, you've
got this model,

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.820
which took years and years
and decades to work out,

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:32.170
which did match it.

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:36.250
But then at the time, people
were saying that maybe they're

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:37.350
not black holes.

00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:39.550
Maybe they're boson stars.

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:42.350
Boson stars weigh about
the same as black holes.

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.020
OK?

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.451
But who's ever
seen a boson star?

00:50:45.451 --> 00:50:47.200
We've seen it even
less than a black hole.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.720
This is just a figment of
theoretical physicists'

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.380
imagination.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.890
You can imagine anything.

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:53.600
And I'm tearing out
my hair, saying,

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.180
oh, no, not boson stars.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.320
We don't want boson stars.

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.403
For heaven's sake, let's
have a discovery at last.

00:50:58.403 --> 00:51:01.780
I want to die having
reported a discovery.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.550
And the boson star
thing faded away.

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:07.330
But it's one of those
things you could still ask.

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:10.370
You could still ask, has
it really been black holes?

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:12.970
And people could still
argue, no, it's boson stars.

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:14.650
It's one of those
places where you say,

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:18.080
time to stop questioning, OK?

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.880
Then there was another
nice little argument

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:24.820
produced for why they
had to be black holes.

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:28.270
They could tell how
far apart these things

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:33.830
were just before they collided
from the speed of rotation.

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:35.710
And they knew how
much they weighed also

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:37.280
from that kind of thing.

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.830
And you could work
out that nothing

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:41.080
that wasn't very
compact could get

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.820
that close without touching.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:45.320
And that was another argument
for them being black holes.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.920
So it's a good question, because
the argument is still not

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.660
completely settled.

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:53.710
But it's settled if
you're a physicist

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:58.980
and you want to be called
kind of reasonably sane.

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.990
AUDIENCE: Have you now finished
with the gravitational wave

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.620
community?

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.740
Or what are you
going to do next?

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:04.600
I don't know if
anything else is still

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:05.870
going on that you're studying?

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.881
PROF.

00:52:05.881 --> 00:52:08.172
HARRY COLLINS: Well, that's
a very good question again,

00:52:08.172 --> 00:52:09.490
because I thought I'd finished.

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:12.910
I decided this was
the time to finish.

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:14.440
Nothing as exciting
as this is ever

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.020
going to happen to me in
my life studying again,

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.050
in my life studying physicists.

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:21.640
And I've kind of
corralled somebody else

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:27.080
to carry on after me looking
at gravitational waves physics

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.290
and continuing to write
the detailed history of it,

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:30.998
because I don't want
it to stop suddenly.

00:52:30.998 --> 00:52:35.620
But this business about
these guys objecting to it

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.120
is really interesting from a
sociological point of view.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.300
So I've found myself getting
sucked into it again.

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.150
And I'll probably write
a bit more about it

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:47.220
before I do completely finish.

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.050
SPEAKER: We are
unfortunately out of time.

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:51.649
We have time for
one more question.

00:52:51.649 --> 00:52:53.440
AUDIENCE: Hopefully,
a quick question then.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.640
And so if expertise
is very narrow,

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.580
going back to your
chart at the beginning,

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:00.960
but we should identify the
experts and believe them,

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.545
right or wrong, do those two
things make life difficult

00:53:04.545 --> 00:53:05.670
when you put them together?

00:53:10.586 --> 00:53:11.086
PROF.

00:53:11.086 --> 00:53:13.400
HARRY COLLINS: I don't think so.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:17.560
I mean, there's another whole
element of which experts

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:18.530
you believe in.

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:22.760
You also have to believe only
in decent, honest experts.

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.850
And there's plenty of
non-decent, dishonest experts

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:26.690
around.

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:29.755
But you need a different
kind of argument--

00:53:29.755 --> 00:53:31.880
I mean, a different kind
of investigative technique

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.580
to find out who those are.

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:38.090
I mean, the instant
that I always

00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:43.420
use as my touchstone in how
to think about these things

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:46.010
is the mumps, measles,
and rubella vaccination

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:47.800
controversy.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.460
And this is one
of the things that

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:52.940
got me started in being
hated by lots of people

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.060
in social studies of
science because I noticed

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.710
that many of my
colleagues in the field

00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:02.330
wanted to defend the parents'
right not to vaccinate

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:06.020
their children during the course
of the mumps, measles, rubella

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.490
controversy.

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:10.570
And my view was that
that was terrible,

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:14.960
and that, in fact, parents had
to vaccinate their children.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:19.160
And the reason is,
if you look at what

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.600
Andrew Wakefield,
a the person who

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.141
started the whole controversy,
said, if you look at his paper

00:54:23.141 --> 00:54:24.050
in "The Lancet"--

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:26.720
I was reading it just
the other day actually.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:31.870
He had no evidence at
all that mumps, measles,

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:34.270
and rubella vaccine
were linked to autism.

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:38.710
There's lots of allusions and
asides in that original paper.

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:40.910
But the paper says,
we haven't proved it.

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:43.130
And he certainly
hadn't proved it.

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:45.770
And if you allow a panic
like this to arise,

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:49.390
which was very much
amplified by the press,

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:53.190
who have a view that they should
always tell a balanced story--

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:56.570
well, their balanced
story was about--

00:54:56.570 --> 00:54:58.580
on the one side were
parents, poor things,

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:02.000
who'd seen their children
become autistic a little while

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.330
after receiving the MMR vaccine.

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:06.650
And the other side
of the balance

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:08.780
was the huge
epidemiological studies

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:12.350
which showed that nowhere where
MMR vaccine had been introduced

00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:16.290
into countries was there any
increase in the instance of MMR

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.480
in a population.

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.130
And the latter thing is
the end of the story.

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:28.160
The parents were always going
to see some children becoming

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.130
autistic after
they'd been injected

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:35.250
with MMR, because both things
happen at about same age.

00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:35.750
OK?

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:37.166
And there would
be an equal number

00:55:37.166 --> 00:55:39.890
of children who nobody
would be talking about,

00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:44.420
who would have received the MMR
just after becoming autistic.

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:46.070
But nobody was
talking about them.

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:49.070
So all this balancing in the
newspapers and so on was wrong.

00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:51.530
And one of the arguments
that really infuriated me

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:55.550
by one of my colleagues
was, well, look,

00:55:55.550 --> 00:56:00.740
there is a possibility that
some small subset of children

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:02.570
who are peculiarly
vulnerable in some way

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:05.000
were affected by
the MMR vaccine.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.820
The epidemiological
statistics are too large scale

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:09.320
to deal with that.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.240
And of course, he
was absolutely right.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.160
But you could make
exactly the same argument

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.330
for whether people became
autistic just after they'd

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:20.810
eaten a kiwi fruit for the first
time or anything else you like.

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:24.620
So if you allow this kind
of non-expert inference

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:29.060
from observational statistics
to enter the public domain,

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.392
you can waste all your national
health service money on scares

00:56:32.392 --> 00:56:33.350
and never get anywhere.

00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:34.849
I mean, the whole
argument is always

00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:39.260
carried out under the
constraint of scarcity.

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:42.350
And so it's not a question
of what's absolutely

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:43.520
right in the long term.

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.530
It probably is the case
that one or two kids

00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:47.390
are vulnerable to MMR.

00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:48.890
But it's no good saying it.

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:52.070
It doesn't get you
to the policy answer.

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:56.290
So that's my answer
to your question.

00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:57.655
Does it answer your question?

00:56:57.655 --> 00:56:58.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:58.780
PROF.

00:56:58.780 --> 00:56:59.600
HARRY COLLINS: OK.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.850
SPEAKER: Thank you very much,
Professor Harry Collins.
