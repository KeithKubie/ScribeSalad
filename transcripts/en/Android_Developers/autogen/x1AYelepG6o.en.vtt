so we've now rolled out that capability

00:24:34.649 --> 00:24:34.659
so we've now rolled out that capability
 

00:24:34.659 --> 00:24:37.440
so we've now rolled out that capability
so you could say for example offer a

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:37.450
so you could say for example offer a
 

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:39.870
so you could say for example offer a
dollar for 90 days and then kick in to

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880
dollar for 90 days and then kick in to
