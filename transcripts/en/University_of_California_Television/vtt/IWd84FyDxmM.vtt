00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:04.519
(electronic music)

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.870
- Good afternoon.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.520
My name is Andrew Szeri, I'm
dean of the Graduate Division.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.030
And we are pleased, along with

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.890
the Hitchcock Professorship Committee

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.970
and the Graduate Council to
present Professor John Heilbron,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.200
this year's speaker in the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.003
Charles and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.740
As a condition of this bequest,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.900
it's my pleasure to tell you

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.980
how the endowment came to UC Berkeley.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.310
It's a story that
exemplifies the many ways

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.300
this campus is linked to the history

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.563
of California and the Bay Area.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.860
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician for the Army,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.098
came to San Francisco during the Gold Rush

00:01:11.098 --> 00:01:14.820
where he opened a
thriving private practice.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.850
In 1885, Charles
established a professorship

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.900
here at Berkeley as an expression

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.753
of his long-held interest in education.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.620
His daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.470
still treasured in San Francisco

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.000
for her colorful personality
as well as her generosity,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.850
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.140
to establish a professorship at Berkeley,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.043
making it possible for us to
present a series of lectures.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.770
The Hitchcock Fund has become one

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.260
of the most cherished endowments

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.240
of the University of California,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.920
recognizing the highest distinction

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.133
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.610
And for this, we are
grateful to the Hitchcocks.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.610
I now invite William Lester,
Professor of Chemistry

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.260
and Chair of the Hitchcock Committee,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
to the podium to say a few words

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.220
about Professor John Heilbron.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.683
Thank you.

00:02:07.683 --> 00:02:10.516
(audience claps)

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.490
- Thank you, Andrew.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.650
John Heilbron has made
fundamental contributions

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.510
as an historian of science.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.090
His work sets the history
of the physical sciences

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.230
within its wider cultural context.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.890
Heilbron is best known for his writings

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.560
on the history of physics and astronomy,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.420
but the full breadth of his expertise

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.520
ranges from early
experiments in electricity

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.641
and European solar observatories,

00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:40.342
to the work of Ernest O.
Lawrence and Max Planck.

00:02:40.342 --> 00:02:42.320
His works are highly regarded

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.917
for illuminating the technical
complexities of science,

00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:47.430
as well as the social
and political contexts

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.890
in which it has been advanced.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.020
His current research interests include

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.210
relations between science and religion

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.740
in the 17th and 18th centuries,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.700
physics and its institutions
in the 20th century,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.230
and the use of history of science

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.963
in the teaching of science.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.800
After graduating from San
Francisco's Lowell High School,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.110
Heilbron obtained all of
his degrees at UC Berkeley,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.110
earning his BA and MA in
Physics and his PhD in History.

00:03:15.168 --> 00:03:17.430
Heilbron taught at the
University of Pennsylvania

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.890
for three years and returned

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.483
to UC Berkeley's History
Department in 1967.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.070
As a professor at UC
Berkeley, Heilbron created

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.080
the Office for the History
of Science and Technology,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.513
which he directed from 1973
until his retirement in 1994.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.950
He was named Class of
1936 Professor of History

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.980
and History of Science in 1985.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.250
And also served as the Vice Chancellor

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.250
under Chancellor Chang-Lin
Tien, this was 1990 to 1994,

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.720
and chair of the Berkeley
division of the Academic Senate

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.210
from 1988 to 1990.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.210
Since retiring in 1994,
Heilbron has served

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.870
as a visiting professor

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.290
at the California Institute of Technology,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.460
Yale University, and UC Berkeley.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.170
In 2002, the Bancroft Library awarded him

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.487
the Hubert Howe Bancroft
Award to honor his quote,

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.387
"Significant achievements in the support

00:04:16.387 --> 00:04:20.760
"of historical research and
scholarship," close quote.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.690
He has also received the Sarton Medal

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.177
from the History of Science Society,

00:04:25.177 --> 00:04:28.580
the Abraham Pais Prize
for History of Physics,

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.396
awarded jointly by the
American Physical Society

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:33.570
and the American Institute of Physics,

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.020
and the Premio Internazionale
Galileo Galilei.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.180
Heilbron is a foreign member

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.820
of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.370
and an honorary fellow at
Wooster College, Oxford, England

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.110
where he now resides.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.185
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Professor John Heilbron.

00:04:51.185 --> 00:04:53.935
(audience claps)

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.473
- Good afternoon.

00:05:00.473 --> 00:05:03.153
I was overwhelmed to be invited

00:05:03.153 --> 00:05:05.150
to give the Hitchcock Lectures,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.770
and humbled by the list
of previous lecturers.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.970
It includes many great physicists

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.260
like Niles Bohr, Enrico
Fermi, and Steve Chu,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.593
and two historians, one
of whom was a saint.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.080
Or any way, the patron saint

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.083
of my discipline, George Sarton.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.290
He gave eight lectures,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.270
perhaps more than the audience required,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.760
on medieval science and culture.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.000
His ectatic report of his visit

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.271
opens with the memorable phrase,

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:41.557
"No university, certainly
no American university,

00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:44.327
"has done so much to promote
the history of science

00:05:44.327 --> 00:05:47.540
"as the University of California."

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.683
That was in 1933.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.480
The university has continued

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.120
to support the subject generously,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.110
for which I was and am immensely grateful.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.130
However, I fear that Sarton could not

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.900
give priority to Berkeley today.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.898
Not only because he's
dead, but more importantly,

00:06:08.898 --> 00:06:12.170
because Harvard, with
which he was associated,

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.780
and a few other places,

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.380
now devote substantially greater resources

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.123
to the subject than we do.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.260
I'm sure that the powerful
administrators present

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.281
here today can right this historic wrong.

00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:28.011
(audience laughs)

00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:32.619
The high medieval culture
extensively described by Sarton

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:35.980
was made of a surprisingly durable alloy

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.010
of pagan and Christian elements.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.461
Tough though it was, however,

00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:44.960
the alloy deformed
irreversibly under the weight

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.630
of such events as the European
discovery of the New World,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.270
the Protestant Reformation,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.870
the rise of belligerent nation states,

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.830
and the recovery and printing
of ancient authorities

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.830
in conflict with the Aristotelian basis

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.303
of scholastic learning.

00:07:04.254 --> 00:07:07.320
At the high culture end, these events

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.840
prompted the creation of
a newly vigorous physics

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.730
and a newly corrosive history.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.380
The rise and early development

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.340
of these twin destroyers of
the medieval world picture

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.303
are the subject of my lectures.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.070
Now, it's not news that the
medieval world picture is dead

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.820
or that it faded during the 16th

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.630
and died during the 17th century.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.400
Where I think that I may have
added something to the story

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.344
is an argument that in the transformation

00:07:37.344 --> 00:07:41.310
from the medieval to the
early modern world picture,

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.570
the historical sciences
worked in tandem with,

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.583
and sometimes more strongly
than, the physical sciences.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.380
My lectures turn on a set of parallels

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.190
intended to show that
both sets of sciences

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.770
obtain their modern impulses
from the same sources

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:03.490
and grew strong by appeal
to similar arguments.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.653
So here is the course of today's lecture.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.930
Throughout, I shall
have to stomp roughshod

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.570
over pastures long cultivated by scholars

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.370
with tweezers and nail scissors.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.310
I beg their forgiveness and yours, too,

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.860
for any damage I might
do to academic hedges

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.777
and flower beds by omitting many useful

00:08:22.777 --> 00:08:25.803
and perhaps some necessary qualifications.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.250
One hedge I must make at the outset,

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.800
in today's lecture I use physics,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.340
as my early modern actors did,

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.830
to refer to the study of
the entire natural world

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.133
from astrology to zoology.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.425
So to the situation around 1550.

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:48.967
I begin my story around
1550 when Copernicus,

00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:52.650
Vesalius, Paracelsus, and
the recovered Archimedes

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.040
quickened criticism of
the medieval universe.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.382
And when the political histories

00:08:58.382 --> 00:08:59.690
of Machiavelli and Guicciardini,

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.110
the recovery of Tacitus and Polybius,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.770
and the discovery of the
value of medieval documents

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.270
in religious and legal disputes

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.253
began to transform the writing of history.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.770
Which proves that I'm not
a Christian chronicler

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.750
of the type still current around 1550,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.210
for if I were, I would've
begun at the beginning:

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.758
with creation, some 4,000
years before Augustus Caesar

00:09:25.758 --> 00:09:30.290
and continued year after
year down to my own time

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.373
with one damn thing after another.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.830
If I were more concerned with national

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.160
than with universal history,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.570
I probably would've begun
with the descendants

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.960
of the sons of Noah, or better,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.500
with the diaspora
following the fall of Troy,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.020
which had the advantages of
moving the action forward

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.830
and boasting a classic
of Latin literature,

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.053
Virgil's Aeneid, as a pattern.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.040
Many members of the present European Union

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.690
once traced their founding
to fertile Trojans,

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.890
like Hector's son Francio,

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.890
and Aeneis' grandson, Brutus,
whom the Brits call Brute.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.290
Medieval writers often use this device

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.480
to launch their histories
and to give their kings

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.730
a pedigree as old as Romulus.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.470
The practice was still
alive in the 16th century,

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.790
when Jean Bodin allowed a
Trojan origin to the Galls

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.810
and the odd abbot Johannes Trithemius

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.690
invented an eponymous King
Frank of Trojan descent

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.223
to replace fanciful Francio.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.310
And if I wrote in the
humanist tradition in 1550,

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.640
I would not write history as my colleagues

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.220
at Dwinelle Hall do today.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.200
Humanist history belong
to the art of rhetoric,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.090
learned along with the ancient languages

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.102
and applied as a source of

00:10:51.102 --> 00:10:53.310
uplifting or instructive examples.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.100
The Stoicism of Cato, the
prudence of Fabius Maximus,

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.460
the misbehavior of almost everyone,

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.340
and more recently the battles

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.050
and intrigues of Italian Princelings,

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:08.520
illustrated the rewards of
virtue, and the wages of sin.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.580
There was no point trying

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.090
to check the truth of these stories,

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.870
for who could know
better than the ancients

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.460
what the ancients did?

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.410
Or, more about recent happenings

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.330
than the eyewitnesses
who wrote about them.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.560
And, in any case, there
was no market for nuances

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.120
that would blur the stories, the lessons,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.023
and the rationale of history.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.890
In short; enter rough first approximation.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.950
Around 1550 secular history
was a part of rhetoric,

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.580
in search of exemplars and origins.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.570
Ecclesiastical history
was a true chronicle,

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.170
anchored in scripture, and the
annals of medieval clerics,

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.660
and national history
was a mixture of myth,

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.600
wars, dynasties, disaster
and self-promotion.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.786
What's changed, I suppose you'll ask.

00:11:53.786 --> 00:11:54.619
(audience laughs)

00:11:54.619 --> 00:11:56.900
To be sure, there was indication of change

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.940
in the writings of
Machiavelli, Guicciardini,

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.045
and other disingenuous
commentators on the then,

00:12:02.045 --> 00:12:05.560
recent past, and in the
philological criticism

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.563
developed by Lorenzo Valla and
other Italian rhetoricians.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.590
Come now to the cosmos,

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.830
as it was seen roughly around 1550,

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.130
by literate people who
were not mathematicians.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.470
It was then still much as Dante saw it

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.880
on his journey to Paradise,
250 years earlier.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.950
So, here he is, with Beatrice,
visiting the 3rd heaven,

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.200
inhabited by formerly lusty Venusians.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.450
Astrologers will notice that
Venus appears on the left,

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.890
the far left, in both her zodiacal houses,

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.333
the bull and the balance.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.236
The travelers then gradually ascended,

00:12:45.236 --> 00:12:47.880
to the Sphere of the Stars.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.350
This picture was Greek,

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.040
in what may be called its spatial aspect.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.030
Symmetrical, unchanging,
with no beginning,

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.490
and not anticipated end.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.380
Its marriage to Christian
theology in the 13th century

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.240
provided it with a temporal dimension.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.340
The standard illustrations
of the late medieval universe

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.550
have a Greek part, consisting
of a celestial region,

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.980
composed of ether or quintessence,

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:17.000
in which the planets and the
stars, the sun and the moon,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.270
circulate eternally
around a stationary Earth,

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.310
and a sublinary sphere composed of

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.300
the Earth at the center
with its surrounding layers

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.083
of water, air, and
fire, eternally in flux.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.750
The Christian part is linear,

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.990
stretching from the damned
at the pit of the universe,

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.620
to the saved beyond the stars.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.008
Here is a prelapsarian version,

00:13:41.008 --> 00:13:44.990
showing god resting on the 7th day

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.363
before the invention of
sin, and so there is no pit.

00:13:50.089 --> 00:13:54.420
Humans came into existence with the Earth,

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.420
or maybe a day or two
later, and would continue,

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.380
despite the fall, to
lord it over all other

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.300
terrestrial creatures, until the end,

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.140
some 6,000 years after the beginning.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.820
Meanwhile, humankind would continue

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.020
to suffer in the flesh for Adam's sin,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.460
which, as interpreted by
Greek physiology meant

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.610
to experience imbalances
in their black bile

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.490
and other humors, provoked by bad habits

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.403
and astral influences.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.200
This cocoon-like world
picture was not very helpful

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.930
to mathematicians,
physicians, and theologians,

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.980
of the later 16th century,

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.080
when they went about their
professional business.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.980
Mathematical astronomers could not

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.530
predict the places of the planets

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.820
from the geocentric universe
of concentric spheres

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.333
turning eternally at constant velocity.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.010
The ancient authority
on the humoral system,

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.730
Galen, had made gross
errors in human anatomy,

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.480
which he had inferred
from cutting up animals.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.970
And, there was much more to eschatology

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.683
than Dante's vision included.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.230
Anyone wanting exact knowledge
needed more refined tools.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.970
Astronomers turned to mathematics,

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.220
which, however, made use of models

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.120
in conflict with the cosmos
of concentric spheres.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.170
Anatomists turned to
systematic human dissection,

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.230
and found the circulation of the blood,

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.480
the lymphatic system, and other structures

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.687
in conflict with the teachings
of the medical schools.

00:15:23.687 --> 00:15:27.160
They did not hide their novelties.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.600
Theologians tried to formulate
exegetical principals

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.820
that would accommodate information

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.000
like the existence of Americans,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.313
about which the scriptures
and the fathers were silent.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.713
Experts lived, as they often
do, in discordant worlds.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.040
I turn now to the logic of practice,

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.480
which is supposed to change the situation

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.823
I've just described.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.660
The applications of mathematics
and natural philosophy

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.340
was driven largely by practical interests.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:03.022
Navigation for exploration,
commerce and conquest.

00:16:03.022 --> 00:16:07.280
Calendrics for the liturgy, chronology,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.573
and the conversion of the Chinese.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.593
That's a Belgian Jesuit
you see before you.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.853
Astrology for improving life,

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.543
ballistics for ending it,

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.740
and architecture, surveying, hydraulics,

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.530
and after the invention of the telescope,

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.590
optical instruments.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.140
These items were bundled
together with astronomy,

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.680
mechanics, optics, and
pneumatics, into what the later,

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.706
17th century called physico mathematics.

00:16:41.706 --> 00:16:44.208
Here is an indication of the apparatus

00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:46.080
required by the up-to-date,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.143
early modern physico mathematician.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.800
History, too, owed its
break from rhetoric,

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.810
exemplary tales, and
ecclesiastical chronicles

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.423
to practical concerns.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.110
During the second half
of the 16th century,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.740
the great scholars on either side

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.240
of the Protestant Reformation

00:17:07.139 --> 00:17:09.256
invoked history to
authenticate their communions,

00:17:09.256 --> 00:17:12.870
and a generation or two of
French lawyers rewrote history

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:16.408
and law in order to free
the France of their day

00:17:16.408 --> 00:17:20.713
from previous and current
entanglements with Rome.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.550
In both cases, the application required

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.090
extensive engagement with the Middle Ages,

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:30.830
a subject despised, or
ignored, by Italian humanists,

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.113
and books and research
groups equal to the task.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.280
I begin with the mathematicians
and the philosophers.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.830
The problem of forging a reliable union

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.400
of physics and astronomy, or
philosophy and mathematics

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.843
goes back to antiquity.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.120
A solution satisfactory
to the philosophers

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.160
was reached on the principle that,

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.820
and I hope I do not offend anyone,

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.420
the principle that there
is no truth in mathematics.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.750
Mathematicians can
describe phenomena exactly,

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.240
using whatever contrivances
they think most convenient,

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.900
but to accept points without dimension,

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.040
cords without weight,
planes without frictions,

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.238
epicycles, eccentrics,
equents, wave functions,

00:18:14.238 --> 00:18:17.570
as existing objectively, is,

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.150
according to 16th century ideas,

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.823
to misunderstand both nature and science.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.660
An important and perhaps
the most important

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.750
achievement of the Scientific Revolution

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.360
was to overcome the ancient dichotomy

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.230
between mathematics and physics.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.530
Quantitative arguments could
then be brought to bear

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.810
effectively against
qualitative generalizations.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.410
Let me give you an early example,

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:46.750
the attempt to measure the
universe by Stellar Parallax.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.050
You all know what that is.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.199
By putting the Earth in motion,

00:18:51.199 --> 00:18:54.040
Copernicus made possible the detection

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.244
of a Stellar Parallax 25,000 times smaller

00:18:58.244 --> 00:19:01.270
than the minimum detectable
from a stationary Earth.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.366
This was by making the stations,

00:19:03.366 --> 00:19:07.000
from which you can measure a parallax,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.710
the diameter of the Earth's orbit apart

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.513
rather than the diameter
of the Earth apart.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.380
Since astronomers still could not discern

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.690
any displacement of the stars,

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.670
they had to conclude that
the universe was at least

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.543
25,000 times larger than
the Greeks had left it.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.190
That was not the least of
what the Holy Inquisition

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.383
later called the philosophical
absurdities of Heliocentrism.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.060
Where was the perpetual wind arising from

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.763
the supposed turning of the Earth?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.240
In order to have the
quantitative advantages

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.810
of the Copernican hypothesis,
like an unambiguous

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.370
calculation of planetary distances,

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.960
without the attendant absurdities,

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.670
most of the few people who
knew about it before 1600

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.987
withdrew to the default position;

00:19:52.987 --> 00:19:56.483
mathematics is useful but not truthful.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.610
In so doing, they could claim

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.930
the authority of Copernicus himself,

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.038
who had appeared to warn his readers

00:20:04.038 --> 00:20:09.038
not to take as fact hypotheses
he intended as fictions,

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.807
lest and I quote his words directly,

00:20:12.807 --> 00:20:15.717
"Lest you hadst leave
the study of astronomy

00:20:15.717 --> 00:20:18.247
"a greater fool than when you entered it."

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.070
In fact, his warning did
not come from Copernicus,

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.640
but from his editor, a theologian,

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.870
who thought that the
traditional understanding

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.880
of mathematical constructs as fictions

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.133
might protect the book
from other theologians.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.900
Another mathematical
challenge to the cocoon model

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.099
in the later 16th century
was the determination by

00:20:41.099 --> 00:20:45.600
parallactic measurements
that comets and super novi

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.600
such as the nova that lighted
up Cassiopeia's chair in 1572,

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.773
ran their courses where theory
forbade their appearance.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:59.330
The heavens, apparently,
were not eternally the same.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.723
They too must have a history.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.090
The main author of these
discoveries and conclusions,

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.700
Tycho Brahe, could work his
prodigies of measurement

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.470
because the King of Denmark,

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.470
eager for glory and sound astrology,

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.150
and perhaps also for better navigation,

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.480
gave him an island on which
to build an observatory

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.353
and perfect naked eye astronomy.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.960
Copernicus also was asked to
make his knowledge useful,

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.730
but he rejected a call to Rome

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.853
to advise on the reform of the calendar.

00:21:33.638 --> 00:21:35.960
The effect of mathematics
of altering physics

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.210
may be followed on the Earth
as well as in the heavens.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:42.710
Archimedes approach to mechanical
and hydrostatic problems,

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.030
his method of abstraction
that paradoxically,

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.130
yielded concrete results,

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.850
and his legendary
military accomplishments,

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.017
such as incinerating the Roman fleet,

00:21:53.017 --> 00:21:56.560
made him a heroic figure
to applied mathematicians

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.200
after the publication of
the Greek and Latin edition

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.663
of his work in 1544.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.940
Galileo became a master at
using Archimedes' methods

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.920
to destroy physical
propositions that Aristotle

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.653
had intended merely as qualitative.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.912
He, that is, Galileo,
met a lot of resistance

00:22:15.912 --> 00:22:18.390
from people in positions of power

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.090
who refused to allow mathematical
hypotheses to puncture

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:26.930
a physical system in such perfect
harmony with common sense,

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.363
and scripture as the old cocoon universe.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:35.700
I come now to the practical
applications of history

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.953
in the hands of theologians and lawyers.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.140
During the same half century that physics

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.390
first wrestled with
Copernicus and Archimedes,

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.840
that's the second half
of the 16th century,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.393
practice was enlarging and
redefining the domain of history.

00:22:50.393 --> 00:22:53.880
Theologians strove to make the case for

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.750
their confession on
historical grounds with as

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.947
Berkeley's historiographer
James Westfall Thompson put it,

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:05.177
"Incalculable significance
for the development

00:23:05.177 --> 00:23:06.997
"of historical scholarship."

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.660
To show that the bishops of Rome

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.340
had distorted the teachings
of the early church,

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.720
and usurped its authority,
Protestants used

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.400
technical, historical arguments
against Catholic claims

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.360
much as up to date
astronomers used mathematics

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.673
against the Christianized
Aristotelean cosmos.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.010
The most productive of
these reverend spin doctors

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.733
was Matthias Flacius Illyricus,

00:23:33.319 --> 00:23:35.984
a leading Lutheran theologian,

00:23:35.984 --> 00:23:40.010
and a very hot controversialist.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.520
He set up shop in Magdeburg
with four colleagues,

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.940
seven studiosi, or graduate students,

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.960
an payment from Protestant princes

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.090
to trace the rivulet of true Christianity

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:54.913
and the flood of Papal
pretension from Christ to Luther.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.987
This precocious research group,

00:23:57.987 --> 00:24:01.680
historians preceded
physicists, incidentally,

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.120
in working in groups, this
precocious research group

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.360
printed 13 stout volumes
between 1559 and 1574

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.080
and reached the 14th century before

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.223
the death of Flacius ended their work.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.850
The group arranged their
materials in blocks of 100 years,

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:20.850
which earned their books
the informal title of

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:25.850
Magdeburg Centuries and them
the novel name of Centuriators.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.380
Over half of the work is given to dogma,

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.420
liturgy and theology,
and much of the balance

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.300
to the progress of anti-Christ,
that is, the Papacy,

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.150
which in the judgment of the Centuriators,

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.080
was as dangerous to the true faith

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.253
as the institution of Islam.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:49.010
Here is one version of their attitudes.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.180
If you are Protestant, read the left,

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.172
if you are Catholic, don't read the right.

00:24:55.172 --> 00:24:56.530
(audience laughs)

00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:01.530
There you find Flacius' idea
of the worship of idols,

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.420
the worship of money, and so on,

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:09.240
depicted under the sermon of a fat monk,

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.354
whereas on the left side, you
have only reasonable people

00:25:13.354 --> 00:25:16.520
attending to the words of a scholar

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.370
as they take communion in two kinds.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:23.020
In pursuing these themes, that is,

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.060
the history of the Church
from Christ to Luther,

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.770
with the help of manuscripts
that Flacius and his post docs

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:33.130
turned up in libraries
from Hungary to Scotland,

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.180
the Magdeburg group assembled
many facts not easily answered

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.480
and pointed their argument
by reference to forgeries,

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.891
such as the well-known
Donation of Constantine

00:25:42.891 --> 00:25:46.800
on which the Holy See rested some of its

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.233
spiritual and temporal claims.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:54.510
The fight against the blind
fanatics inspired by the devil,

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.000
as the Centuriators described the forgers,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.720
had its excitement.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.130
One Centuriator died suddenly,
poisoned, it was said,

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:07.140
by counter reformers, unhappy
at his supplying documents

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.273
from Catholic libraries
for Protestant causes.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.433
Catholics found their
champion in Cesare Baronio,

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.330
an oratorian priest who
very nearly became Pope,

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.183
and may be on his way to Canonization.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.630
Although he had not wanted the assignment,

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.090
his boss, St. Philip
Neri, judged him the equal

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:34.090
of a dozen Centuriators, and
so, informed him by telepathy.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:35.863
(audience laughs)

00:26:35.863 --> 00:26:38.960
For 28 years the venerable
Baronio did nothing

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.150
but take notes and copy
extracts from the material

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:45.500
put at his disposal in
the Vatican Library.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.680
Then came the folios, 12 of them,

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.590
at the rate of one every 18 months.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:55.420
The series began with the
action packed title page

00:26:55.420 --> 00:27:00.420
you see on your right, in
which Saints Peter and Paul

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.490
stand on their pedestals
and a female figure

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:08.720
representing the Catholic
Church holds a cross

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.880
to which are chained an old
hag, representing heresy,

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.463
and a man representing
other uncooperative people.

00:27:18.705 --> 00:27:23.705
Baronio's Annals were a great
success among Catholics,

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.220
although to say the truth,
they are unreadable.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.500
Like the Magdeburg centuries,
they devote one volume

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.050
to every hundred years
since the birth of Christ,

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:38.050
listing year by year the Popes,
Emperors, Saints, and so on,

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.007
all to show, as Baronio put it,

00:27:41.007 --> 00:27:43.477
"That the visible monarchy
of the Catholic Church,

00:27:43.477 --> 00:27:46.997
"instituted by Christ, and
founded on the rock of Peter,

00:27:46.997 --> 00:27:50.637
"has been conserved inviolate,
through his legitimate

00:27:50.637 --> 00:27:54.683
"and true successors.", that
is to say, the Roman Popes.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.480
At first it appeared that Baronio's folios

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.213
had crushed the Centuriators.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.460
Then the technicians went to work.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:07.720
James I of England hired a
great scholar, Isaac Casaubon,

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.170
to look for mistakes in Baronio's work.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:12.688
It was a slam dunk.

00:28:12.688 --> 00:28:15.950
Casaubon found enough errors
in Baronio's first volume

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:19.089
to inspire 800 pages of criticism.

00:28:19.089 --> 00:28:19.922
(audience laughs)

00:28:19.922 --> 00:28:23.190
Another energetic expert
found 8,000 in the whole work.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.100
And, even the Catholics had to admit

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.283
that their gladiator had
little judgment and less Greek.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.820
We need not follow further
the low and learned

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.720
appropriation of historical documents for

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.240
the high purpose of confirming faith.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.190
It is enough to say that
each round brought to light

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:42.940
cornucopias of information
and buckets of spin,

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:47.940
fuel at once historians,
controversialists, and cynics.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.210
Lawyers writing in France during

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.720
the civil and religious wars
of the later 16th century

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.470
gave as strong a shove to
historical studies as the

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.613
theologians who tracked the
pure streams of Christianity.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.820
Here, the Gallican cause,
which asserted independence

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.250
of France and the French Church from Rome,

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:09.540
played the part of confessional conflict,

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.880
which peaked in 1572 in
the massacre of Protestants

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.000
buy Catholics in commemoration

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.293
of the flaying of St. Bartholomew.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:23.250
The lawyers, the best known
of whom now is Jean Bodin,

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.920
relied on the philological tools developed

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.856
by Italian humanists to
subvert the common belief that

00:29:28.856 --> 00:29:33.200
French civil law derived
directly from Roman precedence.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.536
Similarly, they show that
the famous Code of Justinian

00:29:36.536 --> 00:29:40.750
taught as a model of rational
design in European law schools

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.270
hardly had the coherence it claimed.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.020
Like technical astronomy,
it had been knocked together

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.780
from bits and pieces from
different times and places.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.100
With this insight, François Hotman,

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.510
a choleric controversialist,
long time civil lawyer,

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:58.590
one time Royal Historiographer,

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.630
and part time secretary to Calvin himself,

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.660
sweated over medieval
manuscripts to discover

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.673
the true customary law of France.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.210
Hotman and his colleagues wanted to ground

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.840
French law and institutions
on the supposedly free

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.610
oligarchies of the German tribes.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:19.750
He derived France not from Francio,

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:24.010
whom he relegated to poetry,
but from Frank, free,

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.000
like the Protestant theologians,
he sought to recover

00:30:27.916 --> 00:30:30.228
the true, pure fountain, in this case,

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:32.050
of laws, custom, and government,

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:35.348
not primarily to enrich
historical studies,

00:30:35.348 --> 00:30:36.675
but to tip the balance

00:30:36.675 --> 00:30:39.860
in contemporary political
and religious battles.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:43.080
But again, like the theologians,
he and his colleagues

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.140
dug up all sorts of original information

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.720
about the Middle Ages
in trying to demonstrate

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.490
their preferred form of
Gallicanism and the roots

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.273
of French feudal law and institutions.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.890
Étienne Pasquier, perhaps
the best historian

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:00.670
among the 16th century lawyers,

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:04.030
might qualify as the Copernicus
of French Historiography,

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.960
for putting France, rather than Rome,

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.893
at the center of historical interest.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:12.110
No medieval records, however
repellent, repelled him.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.710
Acts of Parliament, Papal
Bulls, coins, travel reports,

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.730
chronicles, trial
records, he was the first,

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:20.740
incidentally, to look at the
trial records of Joan of Arc.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:24.200
With copious documents and
exact philology, he said,

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.280
the rise and fall of
states could be explained

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.460
and even predicted by methods
as quote "easily grasped"

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.743
as mathematical demonstrations.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.050
That was to invoke a dubious ally.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:40.090
Contemporaries who knew there
is not truth in mathematics

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.140
suspected there was little in history

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.230
written as a legal brief, or
in ecclesiastical history,

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.053
compiled by controversialists.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.810
Even people with the best credentials

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:51.760
turned out to be liars.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.460
For example, Annius of Viterbo,
a Dominican theologian,

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.890
and professor of theology,
who made up most of the matter

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.330
he claimed to derive from the lost books

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:05.286
of Barosus the Babylonian,
and, Abbot Trithemius,

00:32:05.286 --> 00:32:09.164
the good Benedictine, though a magician,

00:32:09.164 --> 00:32:13.030
who invented the 18 ancient
books from which he wrote

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.943
the History of the Franks,
from Troy to Clovis.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:21.946
How was one to know what to believe?

00:32:21.946 --> 00:32:23.164
(audience laughs)

00:32:23.164 --> 00:32:26.223
I come to Skepticism and its defeat.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.800
An easy solution was to accept
the religious confession

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.340
as the leap of faith and
deny that anything else

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.610
could be known with certainty.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.710
This feckless policy was recommended,

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.900
not only by the confusion of the times,

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.440
but also by the writings of the
grandfather of all skeptics,

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.810
Sextus Impericus, who was
awakened from his slumbers

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:51.910
in the later 16th century to
supply Montagne's generation

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.290
with many finely crafted arguments,

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.760
subversive of all dogmatisms.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.220
Sextus observed that a
criterion was necessary

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.440
to resolve disputes and that
to establish the criterion,

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.303
another would be needed,
and so ad infinitum.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.400
The bottom line of this
Pyranism, is that we cannot know

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.663
whether any knowledge claim is true.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.330
How comforting.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.760
If no world picture could
truly be said to be true,

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.460
why fight over any?

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:24.000
Only a madman would allow
himself to suffer punishment

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.680
for insisting on the truth
of a history or cosmology

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.620
offensive to his
community, which of course,

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.130
would be equally crazy if
it acted from conviction

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:36.010
that it knew the truth,
rather than from concern

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.563
to maintain public order.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.161
However useful in undercutting dogmatism

00:33:42.161 --> 00:33:46.230
Pyranism is not a satisfactory
long term strategy.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.250
It allows only a temporary withdrawal

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.450
from the struggle to
understand the universe,

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:53.169
and the place of human beings in it.

00:33:53.169 --> 00:33:57.390
John Locke's Pyranist
King of Siam may have been

00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:00.580
an impeccable epistemologist,
when he refused to believe

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.240
the Dutch Ambassador's
tale about water so hard

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.853
an elephant could walk upon it,

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.747
but in rejecting this true report,

00:34:07.747 --> 00:34:10.910
he deprived himself a chance
of winning the Nobel Prize

00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:12.310
for the physics of freezing.

00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:16.080
Perhaps a greater danger
is run by people like

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.080
Sir Kenelm Digby, an ancient
ornament of my Oxford College,

00:34:21.546 --> 00:34:24.470
who credited the so-called
salve of sympathy

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:27.260
on the say so of a gentleman and a monk.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.250
This salve healed a wound when applied

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.290
to the weapon that had caused it,

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:35.310
and although the ointment
no doubt was more helpful

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:37.691
to the victim when smeared on
the weapon than on the wound,

00:34:37.691 --> 00:34:41.323
in neither place did it
advance medical science.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:45.570
In abandoning the relative
safety of Pyranism,

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:48.710
the enquiring mind needed prophylactics

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:51.030
against the gullibility of a Digby

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:53.653
and the incredulity of the King of Siam.

00:34:55.557 --> 00:34:57.589
The criterion in physics.

00:34:57.589 --> 00:35:01.220
The two most influential
solutions to the problem

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:04.040
of this criterion during
the Scientific Revolution

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:08.050
originated among people who,
because of their line of work,

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.193
implicitly rejected Pyranism.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.753
These were lawyers and Jesuits.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.690
The lawyer-like solution
came from Francis Bacon,

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.790
who rose to the pinnacle of
the English Bar under James I.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.480
The Jesuit-like solution
came from that preternatural

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.193
product of their pedagogy, René Descartes.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.490
Curiously, Bacon much
admired Jesuit teaching,

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:33.443
and Descartes studied to be a lawyer.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.380
They began by unraveling what

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.580
remained of the cocoon universe.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.810
Bacon did so by identifying
certain idols or prejudices

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:44.360
in thought patterns,
which blocked access to

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.190
truth about the natural
world and perverted attempts

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.410
to transmit the little secure information

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:50.660
that had been discovered.

00:35:51.837 --> 00:35:54.000
Decartes jettisoned even more, indeed,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.110
everything but his own mind,
by doubting the existence

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.300
of the external world and everything

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.583
that any philosopher
had ever said about it.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.470
To rebuild, Bacon
proposed the collection of

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:08.270
all available information
about the external world,

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.040
from every likely source,
and its assortment into

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.513
natural histories of related phenomena.

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.190
Careful analysis would then
produce trial hypotheses

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.960
about their relationships,
systematic experiment

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.170
would eliminate most of the hypotheses,

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.740
and eventually a series
of crucial experiments

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.851
would determine the correct world picture.

00:36:27.851 --> 00:36:29.770
To achieve this goal,

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.930
Bacon designed a costly
research establishment,

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:35.240
which he called Solomon's House.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:39.490
As you see, I hope, it
boasted an observatory,

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.790
botanical and zoological gardens,

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.730
instruments for what he called
"twisting the lion's tail",

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:47.100
that is for experimenting under conditions

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:51.140
not found in nature,
a mine, orchard, farm,

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.300
hospital, workshops of all
kinds, in which experiments

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.180
could be conducted and
their fruit supplied.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.460
And, an extensive system of
espionage in case foreigners

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.233
had discovered something
the Solomons had overlooked.

00:37:04.631 --> 00:37:08.430
The design was premature
when proposed in the 1620s,

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.713
Bacon couldn't get James to fund it.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:13.910
It was revived rhetorically
some 40 years later

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.910
in the Royal Society of
London, which unabashedly,

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:18.950
without Pyranist reservations,

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:21.500
claimed to seek natural knowledge.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.163
It is still doing so.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.980
Descartes' analysis left him with a weapon

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.470
more powerful even than Bacon's, that is,

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.760
the criterion of his own conviction.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.070
Any proposition that struck
him as clearly and distinctly

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:39.380
as the great truth, "I doubt,
therefore, my mind exists",

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.167
now best known in the sound bite,

00:37:41.167 --> 00:37:44.960
"Cogito Ergo Sum", must be true.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.380
Incidentally, the ultimate
ground of the validity

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.170
of this test, was the
inference from God's goodness

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:52.800
that he would not deceive
Descartes about any matter

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.180
that Descartes grasped
clearly and distinctly,

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:59.997
a proposition that Einstein
later rendered in the terms

00:37:59.997 --> 00:38:03.337
"God is clever but not malicious."

00:38:04.527 --> 00:38:06.770
(audience laughs)

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:09.860
The first and fundamental
truth about nature,

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.320
that Descartes tests secured,
was that the material world

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.040
consists of a very few primary qualities,

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:20.540
qualities easily quantified,
like extension and mobility.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.500
From which, it followed, forgive
me for not explaining how,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.400
that the universe "...is full of suns,

00:38:27.242 --> 00:38:28.075
"placed at the centers of vortices,

00:38:28.075 --> 00:38:30.340
"in which the planets swim."

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.330
Those things that look like chili peppers

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.053
over on the left are comets.

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:39.370
That demoted almost all of the
myriad substantial qualities

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:42.991
of the Aristotelian world view
like hotness, and moistness,

00:38:42.991 --> 00:38:46.490
and magnetism, and bogginess,
to secondary effects

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.743
created in the perceiving mind.

00:38:50.201 --> 00:38:52.940
Despite the arrogance of the argument,

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.300
Descartes' universe of
pushes and whirlpools,

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.930
of animal machines and disembodied minds

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:00.910
very quickly gained
adherents, particularly among

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.730
young doctors, dissatisfied
with the teachings of Galen

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:06.253
and the rigidity of the
medical establishment.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.900
Although many of the special
arguments and mechanisms

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.610
did not survive long, his
insistence that a true physics,

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.680
that is a mathematical
and mechanical philosophy,

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.670
which would've been considered

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.880
an oxymoron 100 years
earlier, could be found.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.920
That inspired many deep minds
of the later 17th century,

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.990
including Leibniz' and Newton's.

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.143
The strength of mechanism
as a weapon against Pyranism

00:39:30.143 --> 00:39:33.047
lies in its appeal to the intuition.

00:39:33.047 --> 00:39:35.560
As the Victorian physicist
who came as close

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.010
as may be possible to reducing
all physical phenomena

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:42.367
to strictly mechanical
principles liked to say,

00:39:42.367 --> 00:39:44.817
"Thinking about a mechanical
universe is as easy

00:39:44.817 --> 00:39:47.767
"as imagining yourself
inside a steam engine."

00:39:49.104 --> 00:39:51.870
Perhaps the strongest criticism
that Bacon and Descartes

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:55.580
leveled at a received
learning was uselessness,

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:59.363
and each promised that his
method would, in Bacon's phrase,

00:40:00.356 --> 00:40:01.710
"Improve man's estate."

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:04.120
Given sufficient resources,
they would reveal

00:40:05.114 --> 00:40:07.270
the operations of the body,
build a rational medicine,

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:09.103
and lengthen human life.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:12.190
In fact, neither of them had sense enough

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.200
to come in out of the cold.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.660
Bacon is said to have caught his death

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.740
while stuffing a chicken with ice,

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.730
although it is more likely that he died

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:22.010
from swallowing his own medicines

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:23.798
before Solomon's House had approved them.

00:40:23.798 --> 00:40:26.700
Descartes caught his
death while instructing

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:30.670
Christina, the philosophical
Queen of Sweden,

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.460
in the principles of his
system at two in the morning

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.543
in her frozen palace in Stockholm.

00:40:36.888 --> 00:40:37.721
(audience laughs)

00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:41.100
These stories, which tell
us that the true savant

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.960
is heedless of health
in the pursuit of truth,

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.603
are example of history
as a branch of rhetoric.

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.703
That brings me to the
criterion in history.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:56.190
Historians obtain their
criterion by privileging material

00:40:56.190 --> 00:41:00.470
survivals of the past over the
writings of their colleagues.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.420
The up-to-date historian
must have inscriptions,

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:08.420
statues, candelabra, sarcophagi,
coins, seals, and gems,

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:10.223
which did not lie.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.640
In this way, the
distinction between primary

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.630
and secondary qualities
introduced against the

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.139
Aristotelian world view

00:41:19.139 --> 00:41:22.670
had an exact parallel in
the essential distinction

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.788
between primary and secondary sources

00:41:24.788 --> 00:41:28.210
in historical research.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:30.900
Furthermore, the privileging
of physical artifacts

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.030
among primary historical
sources had much the same

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:36.390
psychological appeal as the preference

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.750
for mechanical concepts
among primary qualities,

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:42.570
for just as a supposition
of a mechanical universe

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:45.970
stimulated the imaginations
of natural philosophers,

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:49.941
so handling ancient coins or
puzzling out old inscriptions

00:41:49.941 --> 00:41:54.513
gave susceptible souls the
feeling of the presence of Rome.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.900
A single artifact might be
difficult to date and interpret,

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.596
but with enough items, with
large enough collections,

00:42:02.596 --> 00:42:05.630
carful comparison would
elicit the historical truth

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:08.325
as faithfully and in much the same manner

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:12.123
as Bacon's philosophers
winnowed out physical truth.

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.053
The business of the antiquary,

00:42:16.087 --> 00:42:19.810
the collection and comparison of relics,

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:23.880
amounted to a Baconian
natural history of history.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.750
Bird and bugs, gems and coins,
rarities of nature and art,

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.960
sat side by side in the cabinets

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.380
of philosophers and gentlemen.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.170
Here is a small portion
of a cabineto in Bologna

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:40.933
with a living rarity, a
dwarf, as chicharonne,

00:42:41.954 --> 00:42:44.373
and here is the rest of the clutter.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.330
The philosophical narrative
that would incorporate

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:51.880
antiquarian findings in the
manner that physical theory

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.760
would rise from the
siftings of Solomon's House,

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.010
was the work of the 18th century,

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:59.353
and a subject I'll deal with tomorrow.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:04.500
Several auxiliary sciences,
and a brisk trade in artifacts,

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.500
grew up during the 17th century,

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:10.070
around the comparative
study of ancient monuments.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.400
The great antiquarian Nicolas de Peiresc,

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.960
who was also a good astronomer
and natural philosopher,

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.337
remarked that "Coins and
metals ancient and modern,

00:43:18.337 --> 00:43:21.290
"real and fake", were
available in such profusion

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.677
in the markets in Rome
that sellers offered them

00:43:23.677 --> 00:43:26.720
"strung together as if necklaces."

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.770
That gave buyers an additional spur

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:33.350
to develop critical antiquarian expertise.

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:36.030
Among the disciplines
at their disposal in the

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:39.643
mid 17th century, at the time
that Descartes was writing,

00:43:39.643 --> 00:43:42.720
were epigraphy, the
science of inscriptions,

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.750
sfragistics, the science of seals,

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:49.380
and numismatics, the
study of coins and metals.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.510
Here are some numismatical connoisseurs,

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:56.118
exercising discernment
in a market in Rome.

00:43:56.118 --> 00:43:57.900
(audience laughs)

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.760
The first major application
of ancient coins

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.380
to historical writing was
to history as rhetoric,

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.240
that is, it made available
depictions of emperors

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.160
to go with the usual ancient accounts

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.943
of their deeds and misdeeds.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.880
The first application to unscrambling

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:18.020
geography and chronology by Ania Vico,

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.910
who is not the Great Vico,

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.410
came at the middle of the 16th century,

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:25.050
but had very little influence
for a hundred years,

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.590
much as the major innovations
in natural science

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:30.457
of Vico's time associated with Copernicus,

00:44:30.457 --> 00:44:33.690
Thessalius, and Romus,
did not have a wide impact

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.183
before Galileo, Harvey, and Descartes.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:38.730
But, from the middle of the 17th century,

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:42.050
most knowledgeable people
accepted Vico's dictum

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:44.660
that no sound ancient
history could be written

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.053
without reference to coins and metals.

00:44:48.113 --> 00:44:50.600
Numismatics was but child's play

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.810
in comparison with diplomatics,

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:57.810
a subject at first approached
as "cold, dry, and repulsive",

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.290
according to a Dictionnaire
de la Diplomatie,

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.527
of the 18th century, "as
cold, dry, and repulsive

00:45:04.527 --> 00:45:07.397
"as calculation with
trigonometric functions."

00:45:08.268 --> 00:45:09.385
(audience laughs)

00:45:09.385 --> 00:45:10.218
In both cases, however,

00:45:10.218 --> 00:45:11.960
perseverance would be
rewarded a thousand fold.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.980
Master trigonometry and you can ascend

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.400
to the height of the
Newtonian world system.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:21.017
Master diplomatics, and you
have internalized the, quote,

00:45:21.017 --> 00:45:23.417
"judicious criticism that is the very key

00:45:23.417 --> 00:45:25.317
"to nearly all the sciences."

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.120
The parallel can be drawn out further.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.210
By coincidence, or divine plan,

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:33.300
the mathematical world system

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:36.250
and the critical evaluation of documents,

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:40.660
fixed their foundations in
the same decade, the 1680s.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:41.670
The first, in Newton's

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:44.550
Mathematical Principles
of Natural Philosophy,

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:48.323
the second in Jean
Mabillon's De re diplomatica.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.380
As everyone knew, Newton
assembled empirical laws

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:58.090
found by Kepler and
Galileo, critically compared

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:00.260
measurements reported by astronomers,

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:01.750
transcended the blueprint for a

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:05.160
mechanical natural philosophy
laid down by Descartes,

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.860
and with one encompassing
law, not only showed

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.570
that phenomena previously held distinct,

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:13.100
like the motions of the
planets of the luminaries,

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.290
the rotations of Jupiter's satellites,

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:16.810
the elliptical shape of the Earth,

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:19.560
the ocean tides and the
precession of the equinoxes,

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:23.773
were all consequences of
the same simple principle.

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:28.053
He also accounted for them
in quantitative detail.

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:33.260
As not so many know, Mabillon
assembled and compared

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.110
information about the physical makeup

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:38.930
of medieval documents collected
by himself and other members

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:42.341
of the Benedictine convent
at Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

00:46:42.341 --> 00:46:46.560
His research group worked
out the styles, inks,

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.776
parchment, paper, seals and calendars

00:46:48.776 --> 00:46:52.830
employed by the various
chancelleries, monastery,

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.400
cathedrals, cities, regions,
nations, and empires

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.320
at different times, and
found enough correspondences

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.880
to be able to judge decisively
whether a test document

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.453
came from the time and place it claimed.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:09.200
Trithemius could've got
nowhere with Mabillon.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.050
The answer to Pyranism in
history turned out to be

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:15.290
the close and critical
comparison of original sources

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:17.940
for which medieval documents provided

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.593
the chief material and test bed.

00:47:22.119 --> 00:47:26.450
It may not be too fanciful
to think that the Middle Ages

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:29.329
played the same part
in historical thinking

00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:31.973
as the vacuum did in physics.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:35.500
Both were unknown territory in 1550.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.170
In the second half of the 17th century,

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:39.400
they were the sites of
the some of the most

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.050
progressive research in
their respective areas.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:45.690
To pick but one example from history,

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:48.560
the half century after
1660 saw the invention,

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.160
almost from whole cloth,
of Anglo Saxon studies

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.500
with their attendant
dictionaries, grammars,

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.893
catalogs, additions, and translations.

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.880
These instruments had
their parallel in physics

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.670
in the air pump, invented just before 1660

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:07.213
and its paraphernalia, which
revolutionized understanding

00:48:07.213 --> 00:48:10.883
of the nature of matter
during the same half century.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:14.830
The parallels between modern history and

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:18.403
experimental science that I
hope to have made plausible are,

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:24.422
if you will believe only half
of them, I will be content.

00:48:24.422 --> 00:48:26.930
(audience laughs)

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.403
A further parallel deserves mention.

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:33.840
Distinctions and collections,
applications and analogies,

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:37.900
do not automatically generate,
what from time to time

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.593
is accepted as truth.

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:43.470
To produce even transient
truth, according to

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:47.017
Mabillon's Italian disciple, Muratori,

00:48:47.017 --> 00:48:49.847
"requires good taste as well."

00:48:50.731 --> 00:48:53.316
Muratori, the man of good taste,

00:48:53.316 --> 00:48:56.690
wrote several volumes on on bon gusto

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:59.950
in all the arts and sciences
for those who lacked it.

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:02.550
This was the early 18th century.

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:05.720
His long lesson came down to this:

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.350
The three fundamental
ingredients of good taste are,

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:11.630
and I think you can remember this,

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:14.708
humility, humility, humility.

00:49:14.708 --> 00:49:16.340
(audience laughs)

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.365
In this spirit, I quit for the day,

00:49:18.365 --> 00:49:20.650
humbly confident that you will tell me

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:23.300
where I have gone astray,
and hopeful that I will

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:27.320
see you here tomorrow for
a surprising conclusion.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.153
Thank you.

00:49:28.153 --> 00:49:30.867
(audience claps)

00:49:39.658 --> 00:49:42.658
