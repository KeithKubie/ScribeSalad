1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.880
Yes.
You have your conservative values moved in one way or another.

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.830
Have they shifted at all?

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.790
My personal valley's probably haven't shifted very much,

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.790
but my political values have shifted.
Libertarian mm.
I mean,

5
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:15.390
so I used to be a proponent of criminalization of marijuana.
I'm no longer,

6
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:18.450
I've been in favor.
It's a change for you.
I a couple of things.

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.100
One was just a general sense that government sucks at everything and the more I

8
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.710
see the government tried to crack down on things,
the more prevalent it becomes.

9
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:28.290
I mean,
people were dealing pot on my sixth grade,

10
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:32.520
seventh grade playground in public school.
So obviously like that was la.
Yeah,

11
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:36.600
exactly.
And then it's terrible.
Just a general,

12
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.600
a general perception.
Not only the government sucks at everything,

13
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.740
but you got to own your own actions and also examining more of the evidence

14
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:48.380
about the impact of,
of pot on people's lives.
And you know,

15
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020
again,
there's you ruining your own life through use of,

16
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:53.970
of drugs and there's drugs that legitimately ruin other people's lives.

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.170
I mean there are drugs that remove your ability to even reason or think.

18
00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:00.720
I think there are only two reasons to criminalize drugs in any fashion.

19
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:04.630
One is if there are drugs like for example,
PCP that legitimately make violent,

20
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.680
uh,
and then you are going out and committing acts of violence against people,

21
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.400
then there's a case,
uh,

22
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.460
or if you're talking about a drug where it legitimately robs you of your

23
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:16.890
capacity to reason.
If it were heroin,

24
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.010
if you're able to actually crack down on it successfully.
But even there,

25
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:23.940
I'm not sure that the proper government solution is criminalization because

26
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:26.670
we've criminalized it and it's still incredibly prevalent.

27
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:29.130
So it's agree with you.
I agree with her on that.

28
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.150
And I agree with you in terms of drugs being extremely detrimental.

29
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.160
And the other part is that there's comparable drugs that are legal and

30
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:39.150
comparable drugs,

31
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:43.290
meaning not even really comparable drugs that are far more devastating like

32
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:44.124
alcohol.

33
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.160
Like you could just go to any grocery store and buy a jug of whisky and kill

34
00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:51.720
yourself with it.
Yeah,
it's not difficult.

35
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.050
And just drink laws on the books already that prevent externalities.

36
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:56.730
If you drive high,
it's the same as driving drunk.

37
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.600
So I'm not sure that you need additional laws to do that.
And also,
you know,

38
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:02.000
I'm not opposed to zoning laws.

39
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.430
I don't think a pot shop should open up right next to my house right there.

40
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.190
Residential Zoning.
That's fine.
Same with liquor stores though,
right?

41
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.250
I don't want to liquor store right next to my house.
This is correct.
Yeah.
So the,

42
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.280
so I become a libertarian in some ways on that sort of stuff.

43
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.240
At the same thing is true by the way,

44
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:19.140
when it comes to the issue of same sex marriage.
So on a personal moral level,

45
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.460
I am opposed to same sex marriage.

46
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:24.420
I'm an Orthodox Jew and I believe that a man and a woman were made for each

47
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:26.400
other when it comes to government involvement.

48
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:28.650
I don't think that's anybody's business.
I think a lot of things,

49
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:29.820
I think adults raised bad too.

50
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.020
I don't think the government ought to be involved in adultery.
I,
I'm,

51
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.270
I'm so strict.
I don't think premarital sex is a good thing.
Right.
I,

52
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.800
I've been very vocal about this.
I was a virgin until I was married.

53
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:39.960
My wife was a virgin until she was married.
I think that's a good thing.

54
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.860
So I think the government has anything to do with any of those things.
No,

55
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:45.480
I don't.
I don't think it's any of the government's business.

56
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.910
It's consensual activity.
There are no externalities.

57
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.120
So what exactly is the government getting involved in?

58
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.540
And when the government gets involved and stuff,
then there are externalities,

59
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.140
right?
Once the government starts to cram down its vision on people,

60
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.830
then you start to get unintended externality.
So for example,
with the law,

61
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.170
with the legalization,
my,

62
00:03:04.171 --> 00:03:06.790
my view on marriage is that the government should get completely out of the

63
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.100
business.
I don't think the government should be involved in straight marriage.

64
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:10.360
I don't think it should be involved in gay marriage.

65
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:12.950
I think the government should be out.
I agree 100% again,

66
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.300
the reason that I say that is because as a religious person,
right?

67
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:20.320
Who believes in traditional marriage,
I have two.
I have to marriage certificates.

68
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:22.600
I have the one from the state that I don't give two craps about.

69
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:24.700
It's buried somewhere in my garage.
And then I have my religion,

70
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.020
my religious marriage certificate,

71
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.120
which meant among other things that I got to shoot up my wife,
right?

72
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:29.950
I mean like this was the one that mattered to me.

73
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.680
And I think that's true for most religious people.

74
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:35.950
The religious ceremony matters a lot more than the state saying a thing.

75
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.660
And the state isn't incentivizing.

76
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:39.130
There's people aren't getting married because they're like,
yeah,

77
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:41.260
I need the tax break.
Right?
So that's a bunch of nonsense.

78
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.110
And once the government decides what version of marriage it wants to push,

79
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.320
that then comes into conflict with other values.
So for example,

80
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.190
once the state of California decides that same sex marriage is on legal par with

81
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:52.030
heterosexual marriage,

82
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.300
now I'm worried about the externality of I have religious day school or I have
a,

83
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.740
my,
my synagogue,
my synagogue is religious institution.

84
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:01.060
It doesn't approve of same sex marriage.

85
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.450
Now is the government gonna come in and tell my synagogue how it ought to act

86
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.480
with regard to same sex marriage?
I don't think that's the government's business.

87
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.321
So how about this?

88
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:10.780
How about everybody gets to do basically what they want associated with whom

89
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:12.430
they want and it's none of the government's business.

90
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:13.900
This seems like a pretty good,
happy medium.

91
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.950
<v 1>I,
I'm so glad you talked about the two things that I want to talk to you about</v>

92
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.190
that I'm sure we disagree with.

93
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.200
One of them being marijuana and the other one being gay people marrying each

94
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:26.410
other.
Um,
so let's start with the marijuana one.

95
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.130
Do you think marijuana ruins people's lives?
Is that,

96
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.090
is that one of your contentions?

97
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.163
<v 0>Um,</v>

98
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.920
I think that it can and I think in the same way I ever had any experience with

99
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:37.570
marijuana,
no,
I'm just talking about the,

100
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:41.590
I'm just talking about these statistical over use of marijuana among teenagers

101
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:44.940
does have detrimental brain effects that have some longterm after effects.

102
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.120
<v 1>It's pretty proven and that's one of the things that I really,</v>

103
00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:48.980
I'm glad you said that because I wanted to cover that.

104
00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:51.800
But you were in the middle of a rent where we were joking around about six and

105
00:04:51.801 --> 00:04:56.420
seventh graders selling pot.
Don't smoke pot when you're young.
You really should.

106
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.840
It's not good for the development of your brain.
Same thing with drinking.

107
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.330
You know,
I didn't smoke a lot of pot when I was a kid.

108
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.790
I did it a handful of times until I was 30 years old,

109
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.790
but I did drink a bunch of times when I was young and in high school,

110
00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:09.380
and it's terrible for brain development,
right?

111
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.810
Especially before you're 25 and your,

112
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.480
your frontal cortex hasn't even been fully formed.

113
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.450
Your frontal lobe is like this.
It's,
it's,
it's a developing thing there.

114
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.810
There was an article recently that I posted from BBC.

115
00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:23.510
There were saying that you probably shouldn't be considered an adult until

116
00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:24.140
you're 30

117
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.351
<v 0>right?</v>

118
00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:27.440
They're saying brain development doesn't even stop until you're 26 or 28 this is

119
00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:30.110
why when,
when people are saying,
let's,
let's lower the voting age

120
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.890
<v 1>16 I'm like,
what the,
what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

121
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.900
When I was 16 I was a champ.
You know?
I mean,

122
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.340
it was a chimp in a high school.

123
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.490
Now when the problem that I have with many people's perceptions on marijuana is

124
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:49.870
that it's based on ignorance,
meaning not no personal experience with them.

125
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.020
You know,
and listen,
I'll admit I have no personal life.
No,

126
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:54.550
you don't want to sell.
I know you don't.

127
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:57.920
I'm not speaking about we should get high.
That's what I'm trying to tie it man.

128
00:05:57.921 --> 00:05:58.040
I've

129
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.040
<v 0>seen the effects on,
on stock prices.
When people get hired in this,</v>

130
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.350
<v 1>they don't,
they jump up,
man.
They jumped down for a little one,</v>

131
00:06:04.351 --> 00:06:09.120
a bunch of chickens jump off the boat,
then they come right back up.
Um,

132
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.700
the marijuana thing is,
in my opinion,
uh,

133
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.800
it's another one of those things where people have this,

134
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.860
this categorized box that they like to put in marijuana users in like this is

135
00:06:19.861 --> 00:06:23.730
the category.
Lazy Stoner,
stupid,
delusional.

136
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.180
<v 0>It's too widespread for that.
I mean there,</v>

137
00:06:25.181 --> 00:06:27.930
there are people I know who are doctors who use marijuana.

138
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.790
<v 1>Well,
there's the Jujitsu community is a big one.</v>

139
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.320
There's a giant percentage of the Jiu Jitsu community that does Jujitsu high.

140
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.580
They have competitions like more a party.
It's not,
man,

141
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:43.130
I'm telling you because it's not what people think it is.

142
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.930
If you've never smoked marijuana,

143
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:47.480
this is going to be a very difficult thing to grasp,

144
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:51.320
but marijuana enhances Jujitsu because it eliminates the rest of the world.

145
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.280
When you're rolling,
which rolling is like,
say if,
uh,

146
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.190
you and Jamie were going to have a sparring match that would be rolling,

147
00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:01.520
like it's slap hands and then you'd go and you try to choke him and he's trying

148
00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:03.320
to get you in an arm bar and you're going after it.

149
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.360
When you do that on marijuana,

150
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:08.900
it's like you don't think of anything else other than those movements and it

151
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:13.310
becomes like this very intense meditation in violence.

152
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.480
Like it's not violent in terms of most of the time you don't really even get

153
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:19.490
hurt.
He's like,
you get to the point,

154
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:22.880
like one of the beautiful things about Jujitsu so you can grab a hold of someone

155
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.940
and choked him to the point where they're going to go to sleep and you would

156
00:07:25.941 --> 00:07:29.270
kill them if you kept going and they tap around your friends again and

157
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:31.700
everybody's cool and you try to do it to me.
And I tried to do it to you.

158
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.970
And you really can do it reasonably hard without people getting hurt.

159
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.560
And it happens every day,
all throughout the world.

160
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.490
A lot of these people are high and they're doing this Jujitsu practice in this

161
00:07:43.491 --> 00:07:48.230
little,
almost like a trends.
It's like it's a straight extension state.

162
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.940
<v 0>If you can function when you're using marijuana,
I don't care.
But you can,</v>

163
00:07:51.941 --> 00:07:55.810
this is what I'm saying,
that and perceptions are off.
I mean,

164
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.470
I would assume there's a small subset of the population for whom that's not
true.

165
00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:01.660
Right.
Who are over using marijuana.
Yes.
And,

166
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.550
and that's probably the majority in fact.
Okay.
So,
so then,
you know,
but again,

167
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.350
it's not a case.
Same Way with food.
Uh,
I agree.

168
00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:11.140
So I don't think there's anything we disagree about here because I'm not talking

169
00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:13.670
about criminalizing marijuana use.
Right.

170
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.710
I think that we should honestly discuss the,

171
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.550
the evidence that for a subset of the population,

172
00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:21.670
there is some evidence that marijuana is addicting,
but it's a subset.

173
00:08:21.671 --> 00:08:23.260
It's not everybody who's on marijuana,

174
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:26.200
the vast majority of people on marijuana or not addicted to marijuana.

175
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.780
I think in the same way the alcohol atmosphere of alcohol was,
well,

176
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.890
<v 1>there's,
there's people that are going to be addicted to almost anything.</v>

177
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.820
And I think there's just absolutely people that are addicted to sugar.

178
00:08:35.821 --> 00:08:36.900
This for sure,

179
00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:39.870
people that are addicted to nicotine and alcohol and all these things that we

180
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:40.880
let people have.

181
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.010
<v 0>The material addictiveness of marijuana is not comparable to opioids though for</v>

182
00:08:44.011 --> 00:08:44.210
sure.

183
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.480
<v 1>It's not even comparable to alcohol or nicotine.
It's,
it's,
uh,</v>

184
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.660
seems to be very rare when people become physically addicted to it.

185
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:52.400
Extremely rare.
And what's,

186
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.920
what's common though is abuse and

187
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.190
<v 0>it's common in everything that human beings consume.</v>

188
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.240
It's abuse as common as we said with food.
Certainly common with alcohol.

189
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:05.100
It's certainly common with pills.
You know,

190
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.690
I really believe that the way to solve some of these problems is a social fabric

191
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:12.240
problem.
Like it's a parenting problem.
It's a social fabric problem.

192
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:16.020
It's a personal choice problem.
That's why virtually every solution I suggested.

193
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:19.530
So funny and I'm constantly conservatives like me who are libertarian leaning or

194
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:22.110
constantly accused of being non-compassionate no,

195
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:24.870
it's just our compassionate solutions don't involve the use of government.

196
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.870
It's like we're going to encourage people to make better decisions with their

197
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:31.350
lives.
And if you choose not to do that,
it's a free country.
Well,
you know,

198
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:33.030
coming from religious background,

199
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:36.540
you have this community that reinforces this kind of behavior and thought.

200
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.300
And uh,
I think that's one of the major,
really,

201
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:43.680
one of the best benefits of religion is that moral fabric and that community,

202
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:47.190
the sense of community.
Even silly ones like Mormons,
you know,

203
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.780
they're the nicest folks,
right?

204
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:51.690
They believe something that is fucking patently insane.

205
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:56.580
If you go and read the Joseph Smith texts from 1820 when he was 14 years old,

206
00:09:56.581 --> 00:09:59.760
the shit that he wrote,
like I try not to get into that triangle in Santa Fe.

207
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:02.680
I wear a funny hat all day.
I'm just going to get to that.

208
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.650
But you know with that said,
I mean Alexis de Tocqueville talks about this,

209
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.390
you know,
early on in the American republic,

210
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:12.060
the idea is that what makes America very different is the idea.

211
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:14.940
You don't need a big government when you do have a supportive social fabric

212
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:17.880
where people feel like they're at least oriented toward a common goal.

213
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.250
It's one of the problems that I think we have in the country right now.

214
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:25.170
I'm not sure people are oriented toward even a common sense of,
of conversation,

215
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.480
right?
I mean it's,
you don't have to agree on,

216
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.010
on everything in order to have a common sense of the important values that that

217
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.400
unify the country are showing us.
I always use Sam Harris is sort of my bet.

218
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.680
No art here because he's obviously a militant atheist.
I'm,

219
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.740
I'm in equally in equally strong believer and yet when it comes to the things

220
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:45.300
that we would like to see happen in the country,

221
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:48.840
not government policy level but on a let's have a conversation level and discuss

222
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:51.240
on evidence level,
we're on the same page.

223
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:53.880
There are certain core assumptions you have to make in order for that to to

224
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:54.630
happen.

225
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.010
And my argument about America and the West is that those core assumptions are

226
00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:00.630
built on Judeo Christian foundations.

227
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.110
Sam's core argument seems to be that they're built on evolutionary biology.

228
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.020
We differ a little bit there.
Um,

229
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.280
I don't want to let this marijuana then go to shit.

230
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:14.180
One of the things that I wanted to bring up too was this idea that if you're

231
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.090
religious person,

232
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.900
don't you think that there's certain things that may be God put here for us to

233
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:24.570
consume,
to change your perspective,

234
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.360
to allow you to reach new levels of consciousness.

235
00:11:27.361 --> 00:11:30.540
Do you think it's entirely possible that some of these things that are here,

236
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.010
and I know you haven't experienced,

237
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.660
but they might literally have been put there by God and there's some evidence to

238
00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:41.460
say that a lot of the texts from the Bible that in particular,

239
00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:42.510
there was a,

240
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:48.020
I think it was the University of Tel Aviv somewhere in in Jerusalem,

241
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:52.950
or these scholars were,
they were trying to decipher what it,

242
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.010
when Moses

243
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.630
<v 1>encountered the burning Bush,
right,</v>

244
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.330
and they believe that it may have been the Acacia tree,

245
00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:00.520
which is very rich and dimethyltryptamine,

246
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:03.820
which is a psychedelic substance that actually that the brain produces.

247
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:08.050
It's very common in plants and they think that this might have been when he met

248
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:10.420
God and the God was a burning Bush,

249
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:15.630
that this might have been some crude translation of them being involved in some

250
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:18.010
sort of a psychedelic experience.

251
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:22.120
Now it sounds outlandish unless you've had that psychedelic experience and when

252
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:26.500
you have,
you very well could think that you were in a conversation with God.

253
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.160
This is on earth and this is something that may very well have been lost

254
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:37.600
information or this may very well have been rituals that people participated in

255
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:40.720
to bring them closer together and to reinforce that sense of community that you

256
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:42.980
do get from a church.
And you do get from uh,

257
00:12:42.981 --> 00:12:46.330
a group of people that share more beliefs and values.
And there's a,

258
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:51.190
there's a real good discussion that a lot of these experiences that became these

259
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:54.550
religious doctrines came from psychedelic experiences.
Now,

260
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:56.530
as someone who's never experienced that before,

261
00:12:56.531 --> 00:13:00.160
I know this is probably a very strange thing to try to even wrap your head

262
00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:04.570
around it.
It is entirely alien until you experience it,

263
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.820
but it might very well be religious.

264
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.930
<v 0>I mean,
I've,
I've heard that from other people who've been,</v>

265
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.170
who've used those kinds of driving.

266
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.870
Sam actually made this argument to me too about the use of psychedelics and any

267
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.690
maybe,
I mean God apples.
Well.
Okay,
so then this argument,

268
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.130
I will say I'm not super fond of the argument that God made something and

269
00:13:23.131 --> 00:13:28.080
therefor it's ours to use or abuse.
I mean like I keep kosher,
right?

270
00:13:28.081 --> 00:13:30.680
Like God made pigs,
I don't need them.
So,
so I,

271
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:35.690
I am not a huge fan of the argument that because something is here or because in

272
00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:36.930
urges natural,

273
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.440
therefore we ought to imbibe or therefore we ought to participate in a

274
00:13:40.441 --> 00:13:44.390
particular activity.
You know,
one of the things that I,
that I'm very big on,
I'm,

275
00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:44.641
I'm a,

276
00:13:44.641 --> 00:13:49.170
I'm a rationalist when it comes to religion as much as you can be a rationalist

277
00:13:49.171 --> 00:13:53.040
with regard to religion to the extent that I think that it's up to us to use our

278
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.550
reasonable faculties to determine the proper use of things.
So,

279
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.250
which is why you shouldn't overuse drugs.
Even if you're going to use drugs,

280
00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.840
<v 1>this is part of the problem making things illegal.
You make things illegal,</v>

281
00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:07.841
then you really don't know what it is or how it affects the body or what's the

282
00:14:08.151 --> 00:14:09.890
right dose or the wrong dose.

283
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.400
And then people get involved in these terrible situations where they're taking

284
00:14:13.401 --> 00:14:14.270
things.
They're just guessing.

285
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.900
<v 0>I mean there's truth to that,
but it's also true that on a social level,</v>

286
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:19.150
I'm not talking about legal cause we totally agree on the legal level,

287
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.530
on the social level,
there's a couple of things that are true of,
for example,

288
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:24.670
the Orthodox Jewish community,

289
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.390
low rates of addiction because people have that social fabric.

290
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:31.780
They don't feel the necessity.
Also,
you know,
as you say,

291
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:34.690
substance use in moderation can actually be quite a good thing.

292
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:36.610
So low rates of alcoholism in the Jewish community.

293
00:14:36.611 --> 00:14:39.220
And part of that is the fact that you are given kiddish wine from the time

294
00:14:39.221 --> 00:14:42.120
you're a kid.
Right?
I mean you actually are our de-stigmatize.
Yeah.

295
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.250
It's de stigmatized.
And the idea is that in its proper context,

296
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.060
this could be a good thing.
Right?
Uh,
so I'll admit,

297
00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:51.830
I don't know enough about the proper context of marijuana to know when it would

298
00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:55.640
be a quote unquote good thing.
And so I can also be a good thing.

299
00:14:55.641 --> 00:14:58.130
This is what I'm talking about.
So,
and also I'm,
you know,
I don't,

300
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.220
the truth is I don't enjoy drinking.
Right.
I'm not,
I'm not a drinker.

301
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:03.020
I don't enjoy.
I like reality.

302
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:06.110
I like living in reality and I like experiencing it totally sober.

303
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.400
So I've never really felt the urge to do any of that stuff.
I,
I hear the pitch,

304
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.263
I hear the bench,

305
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:16.040
but I've never really felt the interior desire or need to jump into that.

306
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:21.970
<v 1>I think that what we're dealing with though is perceptions that have been molded</v>

307
00:15:22.131 --> 00:15:26.600
by laws that were shaped by tyrants.
That's what I think.
I mean,
again,

308
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.660
that's totally possible and plausible.
Yeah,

309
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.740
and it's historically accurate.
I mean when it comes to prohibition,

310
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:35.130
prohibition with alcohol didn't work.

311
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.760
Prohibition with drugs is just making the cartels bigger and it's causing

312
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.780
<v 0>middle.
I had no problems with [inaudible] on a practical level.
I agree.</v>

313
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.370
Whether you like drugs or don't like drugs,

314
00:15:44.371 --> 00:15:46.500
government intervention is generally a giant fail.

315
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:51.580
<v 1>I think our perceptions of what is good for you and is bad for you is also based</v>

316
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:54.140
on laws that the government created ignorantly,

317
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.750
these sweeping psychedelic act of 1970,

318
00:15:56.751 --> 00:15:59.810
which made virtually everything psychedelic that they could,

319
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.300
they missed a few things,
few things slip through the crack,

320
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.960
but all of the trip to means and or most of them,
um,

321
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.360
the bacillus been LSD,

322
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:11.420
all that stuff was made completely illegal by people really didn't even know

323
00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:12.230
what it was.

324
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:17.230
And a lot of that is why we base our ideas of what's good or bad for you.

325
00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:17.781
It's,

326
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:22.490
it's based on what is legal and what other people have done with it.

327
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.010
<v 0>Uh,
on,
on this area,
I'll admit,
not only complete experiential ignorance,</v>

328
00:16:26.011 --> 00:16:28.590
but complete evidentiary ignorance.
So I haven't examined the evidence.

329
00:16:28.591 --> 00:16:30.900
I really don't have strong opinions on any of this stuff.

330
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
<v 1>It's one of the bridges that we all could use between conservative thought in</v>

331
00:16:36.731 --> 00:16:39.640
liberal thought it particularly for people that are dying.

332
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.910
It's one of the things that Johns Hopkins found.
And,
uh,

333
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.330
so there's been other studies done and there's been therapy dawn on people that

334
00:16:46.331 --> 00:16:50.260
are dying of terminal diseases and they give them silicide [inaudible] and when

335
00:16:50.261 --> 00:16:51.790
they give them these mushroom trips,

336
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.050
they have these beautiful experiences where they completely accept death and

337
00:16:56.051 --> 00:16:59.560
it's almost a universal reaction to it that like the,

338
00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:03.700
the amount of people who still experience a positive benefit months and months

339
00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:05.620
after the experience while they're dying,

340
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.970
that they say this was an incredibly moving and powerful moment in my life that

341
00:17:11.561 --> 00:17:14.800
allowed me to accept the fact that my time here is done.

342
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.120
<v 0>I mean,
listen,
if,
if that's something that,</v>

343
00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:19.320
that works for people and that's what it's designed to do,

344
00:17:19.321 --> 00:17:22.460
then I don't know if it's designed well,
even if it is designed,

345
00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:26.370
it is designed by God,
like literally mine,
that that's fine.
I mean,

346
00:17:26.371 --> 00:17:29.490
I think there's also the generalized religious counter argument that there are

347
00:17:29.491 --> 00:17:33.900
no shortcuts to nor no short cuts to happiness.
So there's hope let's it,

348
00:17:33.901 --> 00:17:37.590
let's pose a shortcut.
I don't think,
well,
this is the question,
right?

349
00:17:37.591 --> 00:17:40.800
I mean like let's say that I could guarantee you that tomorrow you're going to

350
00:17:40.801 --> 00:17:44.040
be a happier person.
All you have to do is take this regimen of,

351
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.090
of drugs that you're going to take every day and it's gonna make you a happier

352
00:17:48.091 --> 00:17:49.980
person,
a more rounded person,

353
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.110
but it's going to permanently change your brain chemistry.

354
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:54.930
Is that something that you think is good or is it something you think is bad?

355
00:17:54.931 --> 00:17:56.190
Cause from a religious perspective,

356
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.470
there's an argument to be made that these are,

357
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.220
this is work you need to do on yourself without outside aid.
If possible.

358
00:18:02.221 --> 00:18:05.460
If there's cases where you can't,
then you can't.
But yeah,
you know,

359
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:06.660
turns an interesting thought.
Experiment

360
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.290
<v 1>turns.
We kinda had a line about that.
Uh,
he said that,
uh,</v>

361
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.720
there was a joke about,

362
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.500
there was a monk and he met Buddha because Buddha came to town and he said,

363
00:18:15.501 --> 00:18:20.030
Buddha,
he wanted to impress him.
He said,
I practiced a city of levitation.
And,
uh,

364
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:24.530
I've done this for 10 years and now I can walk on water.
And the Buddha says,

365
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.970
put the ferries.
Only a nickel.
It's like,

366
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.850
what are you fucking wasted your time?

367
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:37.100
Like you can aid the progression rapidly with psychedelic drugs.

368
00:18:37.101 --> 00:18:38.750
And this is something that the,
you know,

369
00:18:38.751 --> 00:18:43.751
do you know about maps and their work with Mtma and soldiers that have had PTSD

370
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.320
not sell as much?
You know,
it's,

371
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:50.030
it's phenomenal by giving these soldiers MTMA therapy,
meaning they,

372
00:18:50.031 --> 00:18:54.260
they give them MDM DMA,
which is essentially what people think of as ecstasy.

373
00:18:54.261 --> 00:18:58.840
The street name.
They give them pure Mtma and then they assist them with the,

374
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.270
they actually have a psychologist sit with them,
a therapist,

375
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.560
and they'd go over all these details of these traumatic events and they come to

376
00:19:06.561 --> 00:19:07.490
peace with everything.

377
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:12.710
And they've had profound benefits for a soldiers.
And four,
we,

378
00:19:12.711 --> 00:19:16.370
uh,
some combat journalists did different people that have been over there.

379
00:19:16.371 --> 00:19:21.170
And I've experienced the horrors of war and just general PTSD maybe for people

380
00:19:21.171 --> 00:19:22.760
who've experienced violence attacks.

381
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:27.680
That is shown to be one of the very best things we've ever discovered for

382
00:19:27.681 --> 00:19:29.150
helping people get past.

383
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.570
<v 0>So here's to me,
and I'm thinking about this on the fly,</v>

384
00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:35.510
because this is stuff I don't think about very much.
Um,
but it's,
it's,

385
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.320
there's a complex moral equation to the extent that if you're talking about

386
00:19:39.321 --> 00:19:40.850
somebody who has PTSD,

387
00:19:40.851 --> 00:19:44.780
somebody has a condition and the only way to help that condition is to use these

388
00:19:44.781 --> 00:19:48.040
drugs.
I've never had a problem with any of that stuff.
Right.
I mean,
I've had,

389
00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.580
my grandfather was,
was schizophrenia and by maybe bipolar,
maybe schizophrenia,

390
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.410
the diagnosis not exactly clear,
they prescribed him.

391
00:19:54.411 --> 00:19:55.490
Lithium made him a lot better,

392
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.400
would have been better off struggling with the schizophrenia of course not it

393
00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.490
much better than he should have the lithium and then be able to live in his

394
00:20:01.491 --> 00:20:02.670
rational mind.
Yeah.

395
00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:07.100
So when there's a problem using drugs to get past it and work with it is a good

396
00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:07.730
thing.

397
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:12.730
You do run the risk of the sort of brave new world situation where you have a

398
00:20:13.071 --> 00:20:17.510
group of people who have a certain level of Ersatz happiness that is not driven

399
00:20:17.511 --> 00:20:20.540
by,
uh,
a point of view,

400
00:20:20.541 --> 00:20:24.140
but more by just the chemicals in their body.

401
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.990
Chemicals affect your point of view.
That is 100% true.

402
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.800
But are you Yuval Harari talks about maybe this is the future,
right?

403
00:20:30.801 --> 00:20:33.740
He talks about the idea that maybe the future is we just drug ourselves until

404
00:20:33.741 --> 00:20:36.860
we're happy.
Basically a more that happiness is the drugs.

405
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.170
Because if you're a scientific materialist,
that's what it is.

406
00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:41.600
Happiness is just a bunch of chemicals flowing through your body.

407
00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:44.960
So if you can bring them in without self change,

408
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.120
but I do wonder that robs people of a certain level of purpose that,

409
00:20:49.121 --> 00:20:51.220
that the struggle is part of being human.
I think

410
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.420
<v 1>changing what it is to be human just by carrying around phones and just,</v>

411
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.110
<v 0>I mean that's,
that's true.
But I think that that's again,</v>

412
00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.540
one of the things that I think makes being a human worth while is the idea that

413
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.900
you are struggling.
I think.
I think the struggle is actually meaningful.

414
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.340
And I think that's why religions tend to set prophylactic rules sometimes for

415
00:21:11.341 --> 00:21:14.700
good,
sometimes for ill.
So for example,
I am addicted to my phone.

416
00:21:14.701 --> 00:21:18.180
I mean there's just no question,
right?
It's,
it's in my hand all the time.
And,

417
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.130
but from Friday night to Saturday night,
it's off.

418
00:21:20.131 --> 00:21:22.500
I can't look at it and forbidden from looking at it.

419
00:21:22.501 --> 00:21:25.650
And this breaks the cycle at least for one day a week.

420
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.760
And that's a good thing that makes me better as a human being is a limit I set

421
00:21:29.761 --> 00:21:34.520
for myself and then limit that I abide by.
And if you believe in in self mastery,

422
00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.530
what,
where's the happy medium between self mastery and I need a little bit of a,

423
00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:40.890
and I think that there,
there is a happy medium in there.
Um,

424
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.830
but I'm not sure that that,
you know,
drugs are the answer to,

425
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.580
I don't think you're suggesting drugs or no,
I'm not

426
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.413
<v 1>suggesting that.</v>

427
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.840
There's also a problem with the word drugs that the,

428
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.340
everything is under that blanket and that blanket can be entirely negative or

429
00:21:54.341 --> 00:21:57.750
extremely positive.
And Eric,
but I know,
but that's it.

430
00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.020
There is a pro I use it too.

431
00:21:59.021 --> 00:22:03.250
I mean it's not accusing you but that that term it's a problem.

432
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:08.310
It's a problem term because what these are are substances that are psychoactive

433
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.630
and some of them can be extremely beneficial.

434
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:15.100
And some of them have short term experiences that last with longterm results.

435
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:20.670
And I don't think that there's enough knowledge that I don't think the people

436
00:22:21.761 --> 00:22:26.761
that are negative against it have experienced enough of it or have looked at it

437
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.300
in an objective,

438
00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:33.160
rational way because I think it's something that could be here to aid

439
00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:33.994
perspective,

440
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:39.150
to give people a chance to think outside of their normal conditioned way of

441
00:22:39.761 --> 00:22:43.030
thinking that might've been established by their community or by their church or

442
00:22:43.031 --> 00:22:47.710
by their neighborhood,
whatever it is.
Sometimes it a little bit of a break,

443
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.571
a little bit of a,

444
00:22:48.571 --> 00:22:53.571
a mental break from what you're experiencing in the vibration that you exist on

445
00:22:53.771 --> 00:22:58.390
almost every day.
To separate from that and to get a look at it from the outside.

446
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.890
Sometimes it allows you to have a renewed perspective that can enhance your life

447
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:03.310
greatly.
