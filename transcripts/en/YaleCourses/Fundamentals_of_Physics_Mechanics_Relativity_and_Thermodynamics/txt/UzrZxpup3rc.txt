Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Let's begin a part two of rotations. I thought I should summarize for you the main points because you learned a whole lot of stuff but you don't have to carry all that in your head. What I'm going to write down is the essential subject you should know, so we were going to do rotation of rigid bodies, which are forced to lie on the x, y plane and they have some shape and here are the main ideas. You should know your first pick a point I don't, which you want to rotate the body by driving a little skewer through that. That's the point of rotation. Then here are the things we learned. First of all, the body has a mass m the simple thing, you put it on a weighing machine, that's the mass. Then it has a moment of inertia, which if the body were made of for discrete set of points would be the massive each point m some I named the square foot distance from the point of rotation, but a continuous distribution of matter like this one, the Sam is replaced by an intake.

Speaker 2:          00:01:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:17       But example for a rod youth was m l square over 12 our own, one of the ends are on the center of mass and 40 disk. It was m r square over two so everybody has a moment of inertia. Here's the important caveat with respect to a particular point, there is nothing called the more medical issue because depending on the point these distances we'll be okay. Then if you want that, it did body to start doing interesting things. You want it to move around. It will have an angular velocity Omega, which is the rate at which it goes round and round. It's the usual frequency times two Pi because two Pi ready and set up full circle. Then it has an angular momentum, which is the analog of the mass and the analog of the velocity is just universally denoted by the symbol l.

Speaker 2:          00:02:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       Then if you want to change this angular momentum, it's like asking how do you change the ordinary moment then more of a particular play force, so no, we apply what's called a torque. The torque is the reason the angular momentum changes. That's the analog of forces. The reason, the usual momentum changes. I remind you peace and V, so it is really m DVD, t equals m. A so you can answer right analogous be here. How equals I alpha because if you take the d by Dt of this guy that's a constant at Alpha is at eight of tangible Omega.

Speaker 2:          00:02:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       Last thing I have to tell

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       you is what is the park or the total torque on a body? We are live. That is a force. For example, acting in that direction. Let me just take one force. It is separated by a distance are auto vector are from the point of rotation. They find that angle data as the angle between this point of separation, distance of separation art and the applied force than the Torque is f times r five signed data. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       If you took after be perpendicular to this separation vector, then scientists one your book have to be a paddle at the separation vector at park vanishes because it's no use, no use applying a force in the line joining you to the center because you don't produce patients that just signed data tells you how much of the force is good at producing rotations. If you've got many forces and many targets, you got to add all the torques. That's one thing to be careful about. For example, you can have a body where one force is trained to do that and he had maybe a second force acting that way. Trying to do the opposite. So we keep track of the Torque by saying, hey that it's clockwise or counter clockwise eat fours. You can tell intuitively by looking at it, this guy's making it go counter clockwise. This rotating clockwise, counterclockwise, we'll be taken positive clockwise, we'll be taken negative.

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       Similarly, angular acceleration will be positive if it's counterclockwise increase. So this is somebody of what everything we did yesterday on Monday. You guys follow that? So there's an analogy to f equals m a everything has rotational counterpart, but life is more difficult because in the case of f equals m a m was simply given to you here the moment of inertia. It has to be calculated from scratch given the mass distribution that forms the body. Similarly, you may have been simply given the forces in f equals I may, but he had even after I give you the forces, you got to do some work calculating the Torque, but every force you've got to find how far it is from the point of rotation. What's the angle between the force in the vector separating where the forces to bear the rotation is taking place and calculating the same day.

Speaker 1:          00:05:27       Okay, so that's all we did and what I did towards the end of the class was to calculate the moment of inertia for a couple of objects I showed you for the disc. It's Mr squared over two for the Rod. I did two calculations. One was around this end and the want me to finish here around the end was ml square over three and the moment of inertia around the center was ml square over 12 and at the end of the lecture I said notice the following fact, that moment of Venetia through the end and the one that did finish here through the center of mass are related in a very simple way. We're just the moment of inertia with respect to the new point is more men definition of the Spec to the center plus the mass of the entire Rod Times the square of the distance Ello were two squared separating the access going through the center of mass and the new access and that's called the parallel access theater. And I'm going to show you in general why it is true

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       battle. Alexis theorem says that if you know the more metal finisher who the center of mass you are done because then the moment of inertia through any other points does not require you to go back and do the whole integral. One more time. I'll tell you the answer once and for all the answers, take the moment to finish of the spectrum center of mass, add to it in general, the mass of the whole body times the square of the distance between the center of mass and your new axis. For example, you want to rotate it around this point, that's the distance d, Add that MD square.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       So I said, I don't want to just give you a result. I want to tell you where everything comes from. So I will now prove this. So let's start with that proof. So this is the proof of the parallel access theater before I do the paddle axis theater and I'm going to use one result in vectors. So you might as well be reminded of that because I use it freely and I don't want you to get caught in that. If a is the vector, then the length of a square is found by taking a.eight.is the length of eight times the length of it, eight times of course, sine of the angle between a and a angle between and zero and course signage. Just one. Therefore, the way to find the length of the vectors or take the dot product or the vector with itself. No other way to say this is the dot product of a and B. You remember it's a x, B x Plus Ayby. So Abel itself is x squared plus y squared, which is the length where a, this is I want to use today is if you take a vector, a add to it, the vector B, and he wanted to find the length square of a plus B, or you take the dot product of that with itself.

Speaker 2:          00:08:36       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:08:38       And when you do the dot product, you can open out the brackets as if it does an ordinary product. So you can do this in your head. You will get the length of a square from doing the a dot. A like the big square from doing the Bedard B. Then you'll get an a. Dot B plus B. Dot. A and are both equal. So you will get twice a week. That's the result I want to use. So here is the calculation. So let's take some arbitrary optic and you want to find the center, the moment of inertia around that point.

Speaker 2:          00:09:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       This is the center of mass and this is a part of the body that I'm calling. I actually you should integrate over it, but let's do it as a song. Mentally divide this body and 200,000 million tiny little squares, which when tightly together found this object because it's easier for me to work with some than with an integral. So this fellow has some mass m I, it has a location which is our I, I'm going to call it ra prime because the prime means is the distance measured from this new access. I'm going to visit the symbol Ri for the separation from the center of mass. Big Center of mass is a privileged point. All distances measured from it. One kid a prime. If you pick an arbitrary point, I want to put a prime for that one. Then d is a vector that tells you how to go from your chosen access to the center of mass. So what does the moment of inertia I'm paying to calculate with respect to this point in the summer when I, the mass of the little fellow here am I times r I prime square, but ra prime square you can see is the length of Ri Plus D. Dot. Product with all right, let's d using this is ebay established.

Speaker 2:          00:10:57       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:11:00       Okay. Now let's start opening out the bracket and look at the terms you will get first. You pick dot product of this guy with this guy, which is Ra Square. That's going to be, am I all right? Square somewhere, would I? I think you guys can recognize that as the moment of inertia with respect to the center of mass. That's what you would do if I said point in a moment of finish up this book, the center of Mass, you'll take the square of that distance. So the first time I get is just the eye, this specter center of mass. Now I purposely want to skip the middle term and go to the last term in the last term. That is no some over right because d is the fixed vector. It doesn't have to do with the particle. I, I get d. Dot. D which is just the square times, some over all the masses, which is just the total. And that's part of the theater because I got the two parts, say like I is ICM plus m d square. The trouble is, uh, I got what I want but I got more stuff. I got to hope that the stuff I don't want will go away.

Speaker 2:          00:12:14       Okay. It's like putting a

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       washing machine or something. And when you're done, you find three or four parts in the ground. You don't know where they are there. In that case, uh, there's no solution to that problem. But in this problem, there's a very nice solution. This stuff I don't want is going to vanish. It's going to vanish. And let's see why. Advantages. Let's take the cross germs. The Cross. Jerome said like the two eight dot. Beat terms. So here's the two, one of the vectors a is the vector d and it's going to be taking the dark product with m I r I summed over I cause there's going to be a d. Dot. Ri twice, but d is not dependent on the summation index. It's common to all the terms of some of you pull it up. Now you can think about what this is. This is every mass multiplied by his position, so take this guy some over I m I r I divided by the total mass and multiplied by the total mass, but what is this?

Speaker 2:          00:13:24       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:28       Yup. That the center of mass but that the center of mass in a coordinate system with the center of mass as the origin,

Speaker 2:          00:13:38       so you will get zero.

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       You I use, this is the origin take Mri. That's the center of mass. It will have some coordinators from that origin, but these artists are all measured from the center of mass itself. If your computer, the center of mass with the center of mass is your origin of coordinates, then it is zero. One way to say that. If you're sitting at the center of mass, then all the masses are surrounding the center of mass in such a way that the weight of some of the positions will be the center of mass, but which will be then zero if that you already have coordinates. That's the reason this advantage, this is a very useful result. The center of mass coordinate in a coordinate system at the center of mass at the audit as the origin will therefore be zero and that's where this drug manages. Then I get the result I mentioned to you, I use ice center of mass plus and these square and the rod was a special case of this, but I put the equals l over to do that exam. What does generally true? Okay? One useful. One place where you may find the result. Useful is the following. Let's think about the moment of furniture of a coin or a disc.

Speaker 2:          00:15:00       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:15:00       If I want the moment to finish here through the center, I truly have to calculate it. You divided into concentric rings. The answer for each ring is simple. You're do an integral. You get Mr squared over two, but suppose I say I want a moment to finish through that point. You know what I mean? Stick the pin through that and rotate it. If some wobbly motion it will perform with that as the center more minute finish up to that point. If you just went back to basics, it's very hard to calculate because you can try you a little trick with concept circles. That'll be nice. That'll be nice. Then you'll run to the edge and after that certain ones are not really full circles and depending on how far you go, you take different fractions of a circle is not easy to do. That summation, luckily leave the moment of inertia was through the center.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       The whole object is divided into the concept of it rings and you can do the some easily, but here is where this DRM comes into play. You don't have to do any more work through this point. It is Amr square over to that, the answer to the center plus and B square where d is simply the distance from the center of mass to where you sent your access. Okay. All right, so that's one demonstrational parallel axes, theater on the proof of the parallel Lexis theater. Now I'm going to show you a similar result because that's going to be also useful in the study of rigid bodies. It has the very same flavors. I wanted to do that side by side and that's the following question. Suppose you have a in two dimensions, a whole bunch of masters and one with the location are one m with location art too and they're all moving around. You know that given all the masses, that is something in some way here. That's the center of mass are

Speaker 1:          00:17:02       as the bodies move. This is not a fixed situation. The whole, it could be a bunch of planets traveling as seen by another galaxy. The whole solar system is drifting. Then ask, the whole thing is drifting. That center of mass, which is the weighted average of the location to, we'll also drift with that. Now I want to write a formula for the Kennedy Energy of this complex, which is one half some over I am I the I squared? No. I want to look at the velocity of this object of every object to be I, I want to see it as the velocity of the center of mass listed velocity relative to the center of mass, which I will denote maybe with the symbol r [inaudible] you see that every little speck is moving, but let's ride in a frame moving with the center of miles. Wherever it goes, we go with that. We latch onto it as seen by us. The body will have a velocity, the a relative, but from the point of view of the ground, we should add to that velocity. The velocity of the center of mass to get there the last year with respect to the ground are some fixed coordinate system.

Speaker 1:          00:18:21       So let's do that same trick. The expansion one half am I? No, I think you will. Let me do this a little faster because we've done the thing similarly to before. Now I'm squatting velocities in the of sweating positions. So one term there'll be this capital v itemized u is the velocity of the center of mass. I just don't want to show the subsequent every time, but capital B's center of mass, so when I squared this via square, I would get a v squared term. Then I'll get a bi relative.

Speaker 2:          00:18:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:57       Squared term, and I'll get across to him twice. V. Dot. Vi relative some with all the products, so let's expand the three terms. The first term, this is the last of central mass has nothing to do with index ISO. You can pull it out of the sun and what will I get? I allowed up all the masters. I'll get the total mass. I get that a zone one half MV square that does a Kennedy energy off the center of mass. Other words, the center of mass, if it's treated as a point containing the entire mass of the object moving at the Velocity v, that's the kinetic energy of the center of mass. Okay. Then let me take this term. This is some am I the eye relative square.

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       What does that, you guys should think about, what is this quantity stand for? Can you tell me what it stands for? Yeah. The kinetic energy of the object's relative to the central. Yeah. It means if you're really traveling with the center of mass and you made a measurement on how fast everybody is moving, this is the energy you will attribute to these particles. It's not the kinetic energy as seen by somebody on the ground who is static, but, but somebody riding with the center of mass. So this is the Kennedy Energy. A little bit of the center of mass. We can give it some name. It's whatever it is. But once again, the costumes are going to vanish. That's what I, to show you. Let's look at a crossroad. The two cancers, the half. Then I get this capital. We can be pulled out at the summation. Am I the I irrelative summed over all the pockets. M I v I relative is the momentum of particle. I I seen by this coal moving observer who was moving with the center of mass. So this term is really some over, I have the individual moment of the party, but you could go back to your notes. You'll find the some of the moment of all the particles is the momentum of the center of mass,

Speaker 1:          00:21:32       but there's the moment I'm at the center of mass as measured by a person called moving with the center of mass. What will that person get? Will you get zero? That's the same trick as before. For that reason, the Spanish is so don't say it to me. How can I say central mass momentum a zero. We know the center of mass is moving but that is from the vantage of this person here. But if you go and ride with the center of mass, this is how you would compute the momentum of the center of mass by looking at the moment of the fragments as seen by you, they better add up to zero. What it means is if there are two masters moving at different velocities, the only two of them, if you go to the center of mass and right with the center of mass, whatever momentum one guy has other will have the opposite moment.

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       So the momentum office system will appear to be zero as seen by the central mass. Okay. That for here is the result, the Kennedy Energy of a collection of masses is the kinetic energy that you can associate with the center of mass motion plus candidate energy relative to center of mass, but I just call it k, let's do better. Understood is willing to at the center of mass, this is just a, it's true no matter what I'm talking about. Collection of loosely moving, loosely connected particles, but now I play it to the case where these particles form a rigid body. Think about it now, so it's not a swarm of bees that all connected better. He did Raj, so they form a rigid complex. In that case, what motion is allowed if you ride with the center of mass, think about it. What motion can you have? Yes, it's the rotational, but you can be more specific rotation about which point and was that a good guesser or was that a reason for that?

Speaker 3:          00:23:29       You're moving relative to the center of this is probably you'll be waiting. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:35       Yeah. Let me repeat what he said. If you're writing with the rigid body and you are sitting wherever the center of mass city and the only emotion allowed for you is the rotation around the center of mass. Because if it does not, I don't want the center of mass, then the central mass, we'll be moving relative to the axis of rotation, but that's not allowed because according to the center of mass is not moving. Therefore, any rotation that takes place must be around an axis passing through the central mass. In that case, we know what the kinetic energy is. There's one half MV squared plus one half I central mass and I guess squared, but Omegas, whatever the angular velocities at that moment.

Speaker 1:          00:24:23       So this is the statement that the Kennedy Energy is the summer of two times a translation part and the rotational part provided, uh, you separated as the kinetic energy of translation off the center of mass and rotation relate to percent of the mass. It's a bit of useful result because so far what we did is in the early part of the course we took bodies. We just translate that point. Particles. They have a massive velocity. We got used to one half MV squared as the answer. Last lecture. We took a rigid body which has a size and a ship. We nailed one part of it so it could move, so all it could do was rotate around the point and we learned that the energy of rotation, I've written somewhere there, there's one half Iomega Square, but in reality a body can translate and rotate to anything you wanted. The air, it'll spin or move and so rotate. Then the kinetic energy of that complicated motion remarkably is the sum of two terms. One, you ignore all the wobbling, just zero in on the center of mass treated like a point and associate and energy with its motion. Then think of the rotation around the center of mass, which is all that is allowed to that observer and add that energy

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       maybe for the mortar mathematically minded people. What is interesting is if you take a plus B whole square, there's an term terminal B squared term and they told you long back not to forget the two ab turn. The Crosstrek practice across. Jim always vanishes both in that derivation. In this derivation, it has to do with the fact that the point that I'm talking about is not any old point but the center of mass. So long ago when you learn about center of mass, you say, why did people think of this notion? You can see it repeatedly. It's a very powerful notion that if you want to study at a dead body, if you want to pick any one point that you want to focus on, it's gotta be central mass. Yes, this, this problem. Ignoring the effects of gravity.

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       No, this is a kinematic, that statement that doesn't require that the particles are not subject to gravitational force. They can be subject to any force, external forces and internal forces. Whatever you, all I've done is given instance, take a snapshot, dig the Kinetic Energy and write it in a different way. Take the candidate going to be seen by a static observer and rewrite it as seen by an observer moving with the central mass. So I'm going to play this to a simple problem so you can get a feeling for this. That's simple problem is going to be

Speaker 2:          00:27:07       a disc.

Speaker 1:          00:27:12       You can think of the problem as either a disk art as a cylinder. A cylinder is just a disc with a certain thickness, so discuss like a coin and the is a stack of coins or the moment of inertia for the disc or the cylinder is the same. Do you guys understand that? If it took one coin it's got Mr squared over two. Let me put a second coin on top of it and rotate them through the same axes whether there's Mr squared over two for this guy plus Mr squared or two for that guy it then it's equal to the total Mrr square four cylinder Rod. At this moment of Venetia is just Mr squared over two through the center of mass.

Speaker 1:          00:27:53       Okay, yes, I remember that. Now let's take this disk which is sitting now and give it some energy of motion. Think of it as a pilot in a, in a car, one of the four tires spinning. So there are different things you could imagine. Lift the car off the ground, you know, and the service station and you let the tire spin. That is rotational energy for that. The answer is one half Iomega Square. That's what we've been doing all of last time. But let's do something else. Uh, let the tire hit the ground and cod is going and get say 50 miles an hour. Then you slammed the brakes. We prevent the tire from Tony. If you prevent the tire from turning, you lock the brakes. The tire can still move with a certain velocity. V which is just the translational motion of the center of mass.

Speaker 1:          00:28:52       So this is a card with the skidding. This is a card which is either spinning its wheels are lifted off the ground. They had the two simple kinds of motion. You can imagine. One is simple translation. There is notation to worry about the entities. One half MV squared. Oh that a simple rotation which we learned. No translation. That candidate energy of all the little guys, all moving in the tangential direction is one half I omegas where all right, I'd real car. Both things are happening in a real car. The tire is rolling along the ground and also rotating around the center and also translating. It's got both motions.

Speaker 1:          00:29:33       No, the two motions, namely that linear velocity of the center and the angular velocity. I don't under center in general don't have to be connected in any way. Suppose you to start your car on a slippery road. The tire spinning got cars not moving, so that's Omega equal to not zero but be equal to zero. Odd. When the car is moving along, you're slammed the brake, then you kill the Omega but not the V. I'm just trying to tell you in general that are two philosophies that linear motion to the center and the angular motion around the center are independent but one is this getting caught in. One is a car that spinning his wheels, but I want to talk about the car the way we like it in a car that's moving the way we like it. There's a correlation between the angular velocity and the linear velocity and that is called rolling without slipping.

Speaker 2:          00:30:30       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:31       That's the term people use. Admin is rolling without slipping. I think you have an intuitive feeling. If this guy is to roll with are slipping on the ground, can you see that? By the time it finishes one full revolution vendors come over here, the center would have moved the distance equals the circumference of that tire, so every part of the tire patches of ground. Then that comes down to that comes down and when it goes all the way to this end, you dishonest the finished one full revolution. For example, if every part of that circle was colored with some chalk, then when it finished the full revolution, every part of the circle would have passed the road and made an impression and the length of that thing should be the circumference of the circle. That's when it rolls without slipping. So what does it mean to roll without slipping? What's the velocity? Let's calculate the velocity when you roll without slipping, when you'd roll without slipping. The velocity of the center of mass, which is always the Nord by B is equal to two Pi r you might it, but the time to make one full revolution.

Speaker 1:          00:31:42       But what is two Pi over t oh, let me write it another way. Is Two pi times the frequency of revolution because one over time is the frequency and two pie. F is the angular frequency in radiance per second. So here is the connection between linear velocity and angular velocity. If you're rolling without slipping, v Equals Omega are all right. So in general would be an Omega independent, but rolling without slipping refers to a particular situation. No. In that case, that's fine. The kinetic energy of an automobile tire that's rolling without slipping. So what are, what do I want to get the candidate energy is one half M v squared plus one half I omega squared. That's always true. I is always I to the center of mass, but now I'm going to use the fact that it is one half m B squared plus one over two m r squared over two we'll make a square. Not done anything different, but now we must remember that Omega are, here's the velocity of the car. So if I do that, I find going back to this corner here, k equals one half MV squared. That's one fort Mv Square.

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       So you can write it as one half times the m over to the square. So the kinetic energy of the rotating tire is not just one half MV squared. If it's rolling without slipping, it's incumbent on the tire to have some rotational energy that's correlated with this translational energy. So the total energy will be this. But I'm going to write this in a different way. Let me replace V by Omega are. So I can write it as one half by m m m over two times r square. Make a square. And that means it's equal to one half m r squared plus one half amrs square. I'm still Omega Square. There's a lot of rewriting. So if you don't follow all the details, now you can go back and check the inflammadry at steps. But what do you notice about this formula? I want you to think about what the formula such as to suggest anything. The stuff in the brackets. Yes, yes you, yeah. What do you see in the brackets that is [inaudible] we got the more specific than just saying hi. That's correct. So this term is a moment of finish up this, pick the center of mass and this looks like

Speaker 3:          00:35:12       walking up.

Speaker 1:          00:35:13       Yeah. Somebody in the last year. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:35:15       One minute.

Speaker 1:          00:35:20       Uh, not hollow ring, but I'm having something else in mind. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:35:27       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:35:28       Let me repeat what he said. If you ask me what's the moment of inertia of the tire with respect to this point, what will you do? You'll do the paddle Alexis theater on the parallel axis data. We'll give you mr squared over two for the moment. It finishes with the center and an extra MD squared, which now becomes m r squared.

Speaker 1:          00:35:53       So this is really one half I watch that we call it road or something. It's up to you. You can call it whatever you like. Here's the moment of inertia with respect to this point of contact on the road. Well, you have to think about the result. It's a very interesting result. It is telling you the entire energy off this tire is as though it is rotating. I don't disappoint with angular velocity, Omega, forget translation. It just a pure rotation around this point. I vendor just rotating around the point, it means that point cannot be moving and I will now convince you that that is actually true if you look at your car tire.

Speaker 2:          00:36:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:45       How fastest are the different parts of the tire moving? The car has a whole is moving at a speed B

Speaker 1:          00:36:54       on top of this, the tightest spinning. So if you take a point here, would that be, you got to add an extra tangential velocity which is v Plus Omega are that just happens to be, to me, if he'd come to the bottom part of it as seen by the car is moving backwards at this velocity minus v. After that, the speed of the car you get zero. In other words, the front at the top of the tire is moving along with the car at the same velocity of the center. The bottom of the tightest is moving opposite to the car at the same velocity of the center. So it's really the last year seen by the ground as you. This is a very surprising result. A car going past you at 200 miles an hour. That is that part of the car that a zero velocity, the lift off the ground, it's not obvious that zooming caught as one part of it. That's not moving at all. It's not the same part. Otherwise a card really is not moving. But at every instance, the part of the tire that is the ground has zero velocity. I hope you understand why it's a cancellation of the central portion of the overall motion with the rotational motion. You can see the rotational motion on the top adds to the speed of the car rotational motion in the bottom, subtract from the speed of the car. And if you write v Equals Omega are the two precisely cancer here in double bay.

Speaker 2:          00:38:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       So if the bottom point is addressed, then the only thing that car can do is to rotate around that point. And that's the reason why the energy comes out to be purely rotational energy or on the center. So this is a simple problem that illustrates all the things you have learned today, how to use the parallax theater and how to do the energy calculation, how to interpret the energy calculations.

Speaker 1:          00:38:40       But now this is useful for the following example. Suppose I have a little slope. I release an object from the top and I asked you how fast is it moving when it comes here. If it's a point mass and the heifers is age, we know from very elementary ideas if it, if it's a point mass. So don't quote me on this. If it's a point mass, I would say MGH has become one half MV way. Kennedy potential has become kinetic. But if it is a cylinder rolling without slipping and it comes here in the center of mass, cannot move at this speed because it's gotta be a lower speed. So that the rotational energy plus translation energy without blame g h so this must be equal to the total Kennedy Kennedy. And I've sold it for you guys to remember that you have to write three over two m this were to go back to whatever was done here,

Speaker 2:          00:39:42       uh, here.

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       So you can see that if you cancel the mass, you're going to get v squared, not equal. The two g h as you normally would, you're going to get [inaudible] for 30 days, so it'd be moving somewhat slower.

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       Then a

Speaker 1:          00:40:03       point mark party. So if it runs without slipping, then you will be traveling slower at the foot of the rack.

Speaker 1:          00:40:13       So what did I do? I use the law of conservation of energy. That's all I did. But in finding the kinetic energy at the bottom, I was careful to not just take one half MV squared, which is the energy of a point particle, but take the kinetic energy of translation and rotation, which I've done for you here. That's the kinetic and the plan selection. That's the kinetic energy of rotation. By the way, don't make the mistake of thinking it is three 40 MV squared for everything. It is three 40 Mba squared for a cylinder, if which is this it or something. You got to add a different thing, but every time you will have to find a moment of an issue you do rotation and add to the energy of the rotation at the energy of translation.

Speaker 1:          00:40:57       You follow that for each body it'll have a different moment of furniture, so you've got to use in the place at one half MV squared. Let me just tell you for a sphere, if this was a sphere, not a disc, they all look the same, but if it's a sphere, this one half Mv Square, I think it's two fifth Mr Square, the different number, but then it's all Mr squared times some number. So you can take the artist squared out of this and turn it into v Square. So you will find instead of just the mass, you'll get some multiple of the mass entering here in the Kennedy Energy and to the extent that's bigger than the mass, the velocity will be that much slower.

Speaker 1:          00:41:37       So that are all cancer variants you can have. Here's a variation of this theme. You remember that when you want to do the loop, the loop, if you release a block from here at the top, I have shown you many times velocity squared has to be bigger than or equal to argue. That's the make sure it doesn't just fall down to the track. That's the critical time at with the track is exerting zero force. If you went faster than that, it'll push you down and everything would be fine. Do you went slower than that? You will fall down. Okay, but now it's supposed to, it's not a point mass, but a object like it coin on a disk rolling with our slipping. It is still true. Be Square at least has to be equal to RG, but to find the visa, wait here you will use the law of conservation of energy. That's all just fine. The potential energy here will be empty times two are working channel energy. Here is AMG at times are yes, don't make the mistake of saying the kinetic energy is one half MV squared and put basically medical RG. That would be wrong. This am here. Maybe become three, four that nine seventh or whatever it is for that body.

Speaker 1:          00:42:50       So it's the same idea but you can add more and more ideas and put them together and make a more interesting problem. But if I were to summarize in one sentence what I've told you all of this time, you said when rigid bodies move, they have a translational and rotational energy in general, they are independent numbers, but when you have a rolling without slipping the angular velocity of the linear velocity, I've connected in this fashion so it's not surprising that the total energy has got a contribution from both which you can read, right? Eight and in terms of the angular velocity are the linear velocity. In other words, if I don't how fast the wheel is spinning, I can tell you how fast the car is moving. If I tell you how fast the car is moving, I inaugurated with the wheels are spinning, provided is not skidding. If it's getting, these bets are off.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       All right, so now we continue with this saga of rotations and let me remind you where we stand. When I did F equals, I may after telling you a little bit about how mass is measured and everybody knew who acceleration measured, what did we do? The first took a bunch of problems where some forces that are acting on a body, maybe something is pulling, something is pushing, then learn how to find the acceleration. Then uh, I took other cases where there are many bodies exerting a mutual force on each other than if that had no external forces. We saw the turtle momentum. Other system is concerned. They are going to do analogous things with our new found equation at Tao week was I alpha. You want to get used to more? That's all. That's all I'm going to do from now on. I already told you in the beginning, uh, that new thing you learned was topic was I Alpha and we are going to use it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:45       So let's take various situations where we can do this. So let me take a simple example or you can make up your own problem. It doesn't matter, but get practice. One possibility is uh, it is a disk like a merry go round. It's sitting still. He's got a massive, got it radius and I wound up play a torque. So one way to play the Torque is the way kids do. You know you, you grabbed the sandy and you run with it on the site and as you run it, it picks up speed. But what you're trying to do is I play a tangential force as long as you can and the force times the distance will turn into a target and that will produce angular acceleration. Another way to do that if you're really high tech is to buy yourself a rocket. It's got some flames coming here. Then if you just put one rocket, the Dane did, what do you think the danger is? Just put one of these rockets.

Speaker 2:          00:45:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:40       You know what the problem may be? Certainly exerted torque. Yes. Yeah, because look, that will be translational motion left to itself because that is a force and ethical Timei is not gone away just because we are in chapter 11 that's still true. So what will happen is this pivot point, it's trying to hold the merry go round in place. You're putting a lot of force on it because it'll try to move. It has to counter the force at every instance. As long as the merry go round doesn't fly off. What'll happen is if the rockets pushing and emitting gas at this way and applying a force that way, the pivotal level and opposite force and as the rocket goes there ill play an opposite force the other direction but this bad, this pivot is unwanted agony. What you do is you get a second rocket.

Speaker 1:          00:46:23       Similar thrust, put a diamond totally opposite and habits flames going out like this. So when you buy a rocket they will tell you this rocket has the thrust of so many uh newtons. That's the force it will exert by everything the gas. So if it got a certain trust f here, get another rocket at the same stress deaf here did ADSL is are the torque you're applying is an f times r time sign of 90, which is one and another f names are from the other guy and the two parks. That additive, that'd be the torque. Then the rest is very easy. What's the angle? That acceleration of this guy? It is to have our [inaudible] by the moment of finish. Yeah. Which in this case is Mr squared over two. If it's a disc,

Speaker 2:          00:47:14       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:15       What if they put some passengers on this? Supposed to put one loan passenger here, officer mass. Uh, let me call it a little less then what happens?

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       You liked the guests? Yep. Yeah. Right,

Speaker 1:          00:47:36       right. So what should add to the denominator?

Speaker 3:          00:47:38       Uh, yes.

Speaker 1:          00:47:43       All right. That sounds to connect. Uh, so my picked it is wrong. Saudi for this one. This r should be capital r and let's use for this mass here. Small are small. Honors. Square capitalized is the symbol. I wanted to use Florida. Oh my God, this is a nightmare. I have to change it in so many places. I guess once I started down this road, I have to do that. Okay. Look, it's very natural. That big [inaudible] is the disc radius and small artists. Some point in sight, but I did, I was not planning to put this guy in the platforms. I just used the random symbol that everybody understand. Now for the moment, computation is the radius of the disk for the moment of inertia up. The little person we put on this little r squared. Okay, so that's simplest example of using [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:48:36       Once the rockets start burning, you got this alpha. I can ask you things like how many degrees has rotated after 19 seconds. Then you should know what to do. Data is stayed or not, plus Omega, not t plus one half alpha, t square data and art. You can choose to be zero. Initial angle of velocity was zero, just one half Alpha t squared, but alpha is this. You put the number of seconds they gave you that will tell you how many ang degrees it as rotated by that time. If they say, how many revolutions has it made, then what will you do?

Speaker 3:          00:49:12       Yes. Any idea? Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       Divided by two Pi to Pi is one full revolution. These are things you must know. Okay. Then if I say, what's the angle of velocity after 36 seconds, whether it's Alpha Times 36 these are simple problems, so now I'm going to do a slightly more complicated problems. Yet it's the first complication you can have that is the pulley and there is a mass. I better get everything right here. This is, let's call it a little m. Let's call that radius r and mass began and I just let go of the mass and the question is what's the acceleration of this mass? So this is a combination of rotational problems and translation, the masters translating the police, rotating. And the point is what's the acceleration of this mass? So we know from the old days that if you want to find what's happening, the mass, you should draw free body diagram with a downward force mg and some pension t on the road.

Speaker 2:          00:50:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:32       Then you must also drive free body diagram for the pulley. When you look at the free body diagram for the pulley, I have a tension t acting down here. How about run all the forces on this? Yup. Right? So this pivot point is going to be playing some forces. Basically what it has to do is to overcome the weight of this mass and overcome this tension t but I'm not going to bother to write that. I'll tell you why. So this is an incomplete picture. That is something else here. But I won't pay any attention to it because I'm going to use torque called the I Alpha and I'm going to take the torque through the center and this is something they'll come over and over again. You could take a torque through a certain point. The forces acting to that point, they don't get the contribute because in the formula for Torque fr sign, Tara are managers and that forces don't do anything. That's where I don't pay any attention to what the pivot is doing. This t is trying to rotate it this way and I know that p times r is the torque that's going to be Amr square or Mr Square over two times. Alpha Alpha is the angular acceleration of this guy. For the mass it is AMG minus t equals m a so let's go and cancel one part of our here but we seem to have two unknowns. This problem, the tension t, sorry, three unknowns, the acceleration a and the tangential angular acceleration Alpha of the pulley.

Speaker 1:          00:52:22       But here is where you do the trick you that even with the two masses they are not independent accelerations because if this point has an angular acceleration alpha, you can see that point as a tangential acceleration of our times alpha. That has to be the acceleration of this mass also because the rope is being given out at a certain rate and that's the same. So the mass can go one. It's only if the pulley turns by a corresponding amount to release one more inch. So the tangents of velocity of the point here, this is the last year of the mass. The acceleration of that contact point is the acceleration of this. Therefore we have to use the fact that a equal to our alpha is really what I call a tangential in the first lecture. So if you do that, you can see that this art, Pam's Alpha is just a, this combination becomes a, now I'm ready to add these two equations, minus d and plastic cancel giving me mg equals n times m plus m over too, so we can get the acceleration. The acceleration is g and you might add by m plus m over too.

Speaker 1:          00:53:46       So does it make sense when you get a calculation like this, you can test in many ways. Firstly, the pulley is massless capital and vanishes. Forget it. Downstairs. Cancer, little lamb, little lamb, and you get eight with, gee, that's the correct answer. Just falling down freely.

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       No, I'm going to subject it to another stringent test was to ask you some points. It got a distance eights through which it can fall. How fast is that block moving when it hits the ground? Just before it hits the ground. Watch the velocity. So you have to think about what ideas you will invoke to do that. Yes. The acceleration constant. First of all, yes. Debbie, when the back said yes, anybody know if which is constant [inaudible] how many people think it's constant? Okay. See, I don't know what you guys are thinking. So I am always worried whether your silence means no idea what I'm saying. God, it's so obvious. You don't want to tell me that's going to happen in a class with a hundred people. That is this video. Unfortunate. You'll be locked nicer if five, 10 people than I can stop and ask you to one, a few. But I asked you if you don't fall as something you got to tell me. Okay. Otherwise I just don't know. So if a is constant and they use a lot of you seem to agree is constant, then you go back to lecture number zero. What did we find? We Square is B Zero Square with the zero plus to a times the distance traveled, which in our case would be h. So let's put that in too. Eh is this number here and plus m over two times eight.

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       So I'm going to write it in the very suggestive language as to over m plus m over two times. Aim G H O. Anyway, that's the square of the velocity when the blockage, the ground. So what do you think I'm trying to test? No, what's my goal? Any idea where I'm going with this?

Speaker 3:          00:56:10       Yep. Because it's moving slower. When it hits the ground and it has less energy, that means that energy is stored in rotation. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:21       That is correct. But if I want to test, if I wanted to subject his answer to a test, what test do you think I can apply here? This has to meet a certain requirement.

Speaker 3:          00:56:32       Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:56:35       I want to show that the energy is conserved. That is no friction, nothing in this problem. So if you want to say energy is conserved, we know what we want. We want, MGH has to be the kinetic energy of all these objects, right? So go to my answer here. The same g, H let's send all the other stuff to the left hand side. If I do that, I get em over to B squared plus one half m over to B square equals MGH. All I've done guys is to transfer this fellow to the other side. Well, MDH is wonderful. That's my initial potential energy. There is no kinetic energy. Nobody was moving. This is clearly the kinetic energy of the mass. And last thing is is is the kinetic energy of the pulley. I think by now you recognize this is the kinetic energy of the pulley. If you're not convinced, I can be places v by Omega are and bring the r squared in here and write this last term as one half r square omega squared, which is the kinetic energy of the, so you've got to understand the linear velocity of the mass and the angular velocity. The pulley are connected and the connection factor is always our artists, the number that connects linear to angular quantity. So indeed, this answer satisfies the law of conservation of energy. That's a very good test.

Speaker 1:          00:58:08       Now you can have variations of this problem. I don't want to do too many variations. In fact, I'm just going to draw it in the corner of the board and I don't feel like pursuing it because there is a limit to how many things can be done in the class. So here is a pulley and here to say a mass and you guys can work out the acceleration of the mass downhill. It's the same story that I did here. Okay. You got to draw the free body diagram of the mass. You're going to draw the free body diagram of the pulley and the are going to say the net force on this, bringing it down with the network and this is turning it and you'll realize that the a of this and the Alpha of this are not independent, but that the a of the block is related to the alpha of the pulley. By this factor, then you'll be home.

Speaker 3:          00:58:54       Things will just work out.

Speaker 1:          00:58:58       I will of course depend on this angle. Tatoe suppose you did the calculation and you wanted to subject that to a test.

Speaker 3:          00:59:10       What can you do? Yep. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:59:25       uh, that is no friction. So what you're saying is you can use the law of conservation of energy. For example, if there's dropped a certain height, eight from that height to the ground, your answers should satisfy the condition that MGH was equal to the Kennedy energy of the mass and the police. At the end of the day, you're answerable, satisfying. Other thing you can do is if this angle theta goes to 90 degrees, look what happens if data goes to 90 forget about a block. It was just falling freely and that's the previous problem and you can check if the answer do you get agrees with the previous rep, so I'm just teaching you that. It's good to have constant checks on the problem. One way to check the calculation as to go back and do it again. Most of the time if you screwed up the first time, it probably screw up the second time because one of the basic rules of nature is that if you repeat a certain experiment under the same conditions, you'd get the same answer.

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       That's why when I proofread anything at right, I don't find any mistakes, but my readers are playfully pointing out this and that type of cause. We cannot detect those errors. That's true even for a scientific calculation because for some reason you forgot something the first time, you will keep making the same mistake that is known in the businesses chasing after pie. In all the calculations we do. We look at the right answer and we look at our answer and we take, the ratio is always 3.14 so we know somewhere we lost a pipe. It's called chasing after pie and chasing after factors of two is roughly how I spend 80% of my time when I'm debugging something. So how do you beat those things is by all these extreme limits. That's another thing I want to tell you with is all of us are partial to working these things with symbols and not with numbers.

Speaker 1:          01:01:05       I think this is a big issue in introductory physics that I said resistance to working with symbols. People want to know what's the mass m and watch the odd number or let me put that in. If you put numbers into early, you cannot test your answer for anything. In the end he has got a number. You cannot take the limit of one particular number, but if you've got a function that depends on all the parameters, you can vary them and in some extreme limit you will know what the answer is. That's why you should be already even in the exam. That's not a secret. I will tell you right now, most of the problems they give you, we'll work with symbols. Now, I don't know why it's harder working with symbols. For me, just the opposite. Once they put numbers in, I don't know what the number stands for.

Speaker 1:          01:01:47       That is separate call it am or I call it art and ecology. I know what it stands, so you guys have to get used to, even in a homework problem where numbers were given to you, you know, block of mass, 46 kilograms collides with some elephant first. Call them all one, two, three. Give the masses, solve the equation, then put the numbers. That's what I would recommend. Anyway, I think you can see here the advantage of working with symbols. Okay, so what I've had done now, I took examples of topic, but I Alpha in all problems. I did something, had a park and it was spinning. The target that came from the rockets are, it came from the pool of this mass art from the pool of this mass. Now I'm going to take a subset of problems in nature where the Torque, the total torque on a collection of bodies is zero. So I'm going to take a system that in many tarkes, but the external torque forces outside the things forming my system is zero. Then you remember when the external forces vanished, then the momentum of the system was the same. P One plus p two was B one prime plus p to prime. So he had, he will find l one plus l two l three any number of them would it be so in other words, in the absence of external torics, angular momentum of a system is concerned, that means it has the same value.

Speaker 1:          01:03:17       Angular momentum is conserved if power week's journal is zero. That's like saying linear momentum is conservative. The external forces zero. So let's take some examples of this. Here's one example that is a disk on a spindle spinning around the discuss some more money to finish your eye. One spinning at some angular velocity. Omega one on top of this is the second disk, I guess the one millimeter away. Andrew said rest.

Speaker 4:          01:03:58       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       it's got some woman to finish your eye too, but it's got the same center as this guy. And then this one follows on that one and the question is what happens? So I think we all know what happens. We all know the true will now stick to get them rotated as a single unit with a common angular velocity. So the law of conservation of angular momentum will say, I want Omega one for the first guy plus zero for the second guy is now equal to I want plus I two times my final omega. So it's a trivial thing to solve for Omega.

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       This should remind you of the following problem in translation motion. That is a body sitting at rest and one on m two there's a body and one coming at a speed v one the stick together and travel as a unit. What happens then? We say the initial momentum is the momentum of m one plus m two traveling or some final speed is identical to that with the usual dictionary for translating quantities here. Okay, now let's take a slightly more interesting problem that made it go down. You're spinning. I'm seeing it from the top. It's got some angular velocity. I won. I mean I ain't got a momentum. I want Omega one because of moment definition, angular velocity. This is the top view and I dropped a piece of chewing gum on it. What happened? It's very simple. The chewing gum and the thing will start rotating together. The new moment of finish or you should use here would be this Mr squared. I think people seem to know that when you stick a point mass on a disk, extra contribution, Mr Square, you'll slow down. Remember, these are problems in which there are no external tarkes one disc. This disc is speeding up that disk. A slowing, I'm sorry, this is speeding that up and that is slowing this, but together they can actually end the tour after the whole point.

Speaker 3:          01:06:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       What if this party or chewing gum was not just dropped but shot from the side like this with some Speed v zero it's got some mass m this guy is eight Esr big game. Not what happens. This is something that may not be obvious. You a party that's traveling and then comes and lambs and sticks to it. What's the difference now?

Speaker 3:          01:06:34       Yup. This is going to have to apply for with the motion of the body. Very good. So that's important.

Speaker 1:          01:06:42       Excellent. So let me repeat what he said. This moving chewing gum has to be brought to rest. Be brought [inaudible] by the disc. Little push it backwards and the chewing gum and push it forward. So it'll apply a torque that Mississippi Chante angular momentum. But instead of going through that route of finding the Torque, if I only knew the angular momentum of this party, then I will add it to the angular momentum of the disc. Then I would say that's the total angular momentum. That should not change. So the question is, what's the angular momentum of a mass that's not really moving in a circle, but that's moving in a straight line. And the answer it is, pretend that is part of a circle right there. Moving a disability, what will be its angular momentum? In other words, if you had the moving party and you'd look to your left, the disk is spinning and you're going at a certain speed at that instant, you are not distinguishable from another body that's actually orbiting the center.

Speaker 1:          01:07:39       But what would be the relation of your velocity of your angular velocity? Well, your tangents are velocity is v Zero Angle of velocity will be be zero divided by R had that incident. That would be your angular velocity because somebody we're looking at you, you will be there now. You'll be there later. Your data will change and the angular velocity will be be zero. Our net 40 your angular momentum will be m r square times Omega, but you can aid us m R squared Times v Zero over our, it becomes an B zero r which I would like to write as p times r but p is the usual moment. So when a body comes with a tangential momentum, P and plants have cell phone, the disk, it actually has an angular momentum. P Times r. This is not very surprising. Just like art himself gives the force our time speed gives the angular moment.

Speaker 1:          01:08:41       So the surprising thing for you guys's things don't have to be going around the circle to have an angular momentum. They can be going in a straight line at every instant. I can find the angular momentum by asking what is the moment of inertia, namely Mr Square and what's the angular velocity? The angular velocity is easiest to find when this guy is right next to the disk. The new, you know from what we did earlier, angular velocities, linear velocity divided by R. Okay. The last problem I want to do, which I'm not going to do quantitatively, but qualitatively is a very, very interesting problem. Go to a single particle in translational motion with momentum is empty and we know if there are no forces, the momentum cannot change. So NBA is a constant. Now that translates into visa constant because is a constant, there's nothing you can do and now comes the interesting possibilities that are available to you when you do rotations. And that's the famous ice capade example. Okay. So let me do the ice capades thing. So here his eyes here, the some, uh, the answer or,

Speaker 2:          01:09:57       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:00       All right. So this person is spinning around with some, I lost you omega with that hands out, you emphasize the whole thing. Let's imagine this ice dancer, there's no mass except for the two dumbbells on two hands are the two masses and a person is rotating with some angular velocity. Omega. That means a moment. Angular momentum is I times Omega and that cannot change. But then suppose the ice dams are designed to do the following, which is to drop the arms right to the side so that for all purposes, the masters that are the center, now you really reduce the moment of finisher. So what'll happen, uh, so I will signify that. And globalize is bigger or Harris kind of standing out. So that's a rapidly spinning ballerina. And that's because what is changing is I, if bodies curtained their mass, it'll be very interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:11:04       If a body can reduce the mass in half, it get double the velocity. But bodies have no way of getting rid of their maths. But bodies can change that anger. I'm the moment of here just by redistributing the mass and that's why all these, uh, ice dancers, you know, they, they spin around and they bring their hands together at the speed up and slow down to speed up and slow down. What is interesting is the following, if you go back and find the candidate energy, you would find a kinetic energy's not the same because Canada energy is one half Iomega squared. The beginning of it, it is one half one omega, one square at the end of the day is one half I too, or may got to square, but Omega to Canberra, tennis, I won all but I to Omega one square.

Speaker 3:          01:11:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:11:54       And you can easily compare the two numbers in the geometry I've given you to show the final candidate candidate is actually higher. When you start spinning faster, you in fact have a bigger kinetic energy because if you don't make a doubles, because you want me to finish, it went down by a factor of half that keeps iomega constant. What do you suppose to square the Omega? So we ended up product Iomega Square. When you reduce one by half and double the other, you gain a factor of two. So take the simple case where, uh, I to is half of I won and you will see it. Okay. So you can ask, where does that energy come from? How does this uh, ice skater pickup speed pick up angular momentum or Kennedy Energy? Anglo momentum doesn't change but rotational energy changes.

Speaker 3:          01:12:51       Yep. Sort of court type show like angular energy. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:12:58       you can do this without invoking any new concepts using this old concept. You just go back and say, look, I had only one rule in this game with the energy went up. Ben. What? Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:13:10       The system itself is performing work on a different elements of the system. Uh, so that work is increasing.

Speaker 1:          01:13:18       Yeah. But how about who is doing work? The skater is

Speaker 3:          01:13:21       doing, uh, work by bringing together the barbells.

Speaker 1:          01:13:26       Yeah. And why is that take any work? Because I gravity is pulling you down yet moving perpendicular. The gravity. So why are you, you had an answer in the last row.

Speaker 3:          01:13:36       Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:13:41       No, but see, you're not doing work against gravity because you're not changing the height of those barbells. You're just pulling it in. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:13:47       In your, you have a different than the potential energy. You have less the energy and you're holding it up.

Speaker 1:          01:13:53       Yeah. No, but oh, oh, I see. I'm sorry. I know why you guys had giving this answer. It's not your fault. Take the case where you don't change the height of the dumbbells. Go from there to here. Not Changing the heights of the MGH does not the answer. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:14:10       [inaudible] against this [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:14:23       yes, energy. It comes from the muscle. But the question is why do you have to do any work? And I think since I'm running out of time, I will repeat that answer, which I believe is close enough to what I was looking for. When the dumbbells or spinning, they're going in a circle and we know that they have an acceleration. We squared over R and we know somebody's got to provide NV squared over r and the person that's providing that force. But as long as it's providing the force but not moving, you can move tangentially. But in the force and velocity of perpendicular, so you're not doing any work, but the minute you pull in, you're applying a force and the displacement, which at both parallel than f Times d is no longer zero. You will find that for these things that tend to fly off, I see set and you're trying to not only hold onto them, but trying to bring them in during the time. It'll be just like lifting weights. If you want to lift weights and you go to a planet where there's no gravity, you can tell somebody to spend you. Then when you pull this stuff in, it'd be like lifting weights. Okay? That's what the person's doing and that's where the energy is coming.
