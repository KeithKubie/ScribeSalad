00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.369 line:0%
- Let's talk about
the trans community.

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:04.504 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
We don't do that
enough on this show.

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:05.972
- I feel we do it more
than most shows probably.

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:07.107
- That's probably true.

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:12.946 align:start size:94% position:6%
A controversy erupted
last week when some clowns

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:17.017 align:start position:0%
who probably don't pay any
attention to Division II sports

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:21.721 align:start size:88% position:13%
unless there's some sort
of trans controversy

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:25.525
were upset because a
woman, CeCe Telfer,

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:30.530
won the 400 meter hurdles
in Division II last week,

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:36.903 align:start size:88% position:13%
and she had transitioned
into becoming a woman

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:41.374
the year before and so a
lot of people out there

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:46.346 align:start position:0%
are upset that, watch out,
they're taking over our sports.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.251
- This is hilarious to
me because it's clearly

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:52.619
coming from a place of hate,

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.554
of I don't understand
the trans community

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:58.358 align:start size:97% position:3%
so I hate them, and I don't
want them in my sports.

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.760
No one in America
gives a flying fuck

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.728
about track and field.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:02.962
(laughs)

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.097
In Europe, of course
it's a huge thing,

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.398
but in America no one cares.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.499
- Especially this is DII.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:07.767
- DII, exactly.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:09.402
- It was DII, she's
at Franklin Pierce.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:13.840
She had been competing
in men's track and field

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.576 align:start size:88% position:13%
before that and she
did win the 400 meters,

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.311
which is a great accomplishment.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:21.081
Boo is by no means
a dominant athlete.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.249 align:start size:88% position:13%
Did not make the
finals in other events,

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.252 align:start size:97% position:3%
did not do particularly well
overall the year before,

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.921
but did have this one event,

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.824
and suddenly people are
paying attention to it

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.225
like it's the biggest
thing in the world.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.493 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Exactly, like
they're ruining it

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.762
for the other women competing,

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.665
the women who were cis
women, I guess you say.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:39.732
Competing in this thing.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:41.601
But she's not dominating.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.169
She won one event.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.304
She's in DII.

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:45.538
(Gregg laughs)

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.307
She comes in 4th
place all the time.

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:48.541
(laughs)

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:51.010 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's not like it's
some cheat code.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.147 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like she gets to take
steroids and no one else does.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.182
It is insane that
people are mad,

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.918
and if you're mad about
this, it's truly coming

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.888
from a place of hate
inside your own heart.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:05.792 align:start size:88% position:13%
If you have the courage
to become a part

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.995
of the trans community and
go through all of the hellish

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.998
things you have to
do to transition,

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.700 align:start size:84% position:16%
you should be allowed
to play sports.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.436
It's not something
they're doing just

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:19.005
to dominate womens' DII events.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.273
(Gregg and Erica laugh)

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:21.708
It's not like the
400 meter hurdles,

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.711 align:start size:97% position:3%
winning that is like a
free pass around the world.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.980
That she decided to go
through this for that.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.016
If you're a trans person, and
you go through these things,

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:32.785 align:start size:84% position:16%
compete in whatever
sport you want.

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.821
And again, she's not the best.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.391 align:start size:97% position:3%
If she was DI, like Olympian
or going through this,

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.793 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I don't have a
problem with that either.

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:43.029
If you transition
and you're the best

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.531
at what you do, great.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:49.269
- Right, and everything
that the woman Telfer did

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.405
is totally, NCAA,
it is complicated.

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:54.541
They've had to make
rules about all this,

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:55.875
but everything she did,
hormones, blah blah blah

00:02:55.875 --> 00:03:00.113
blah blah, was exactly
what the rules say you

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:02.148
should do and there
was nothing going on.

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:05.952 align:start size:84% position:16%
It reminds me a little
bit of sometimes,

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:07.387
and I saw this last week too,

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:09.856 align:start size:88% position:13%
like a minor league
baseball team will have

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.691 align:start size:94% position:6%
Pride night, you know it's
Pride month right now.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:15.295 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Did you see the comments
on the Dodgers' post

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.830 align:start size:84% position:16%
for last week was
Pride night, I guess.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.432
- No, see that's, I wasn't even

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:24.437 align:start size:97% position:3%
- They flew the rainbow flag
and the trans Pride flag

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.740
at the same height
as the American flag,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.975
since there's all the flags,

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:31.578
and all of the comments
were literally in LA,

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:34.747
they should not be flying as
high as the American flag,

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:37.350 align:start size:84% position:16%
like this is bullshit,
it was insane.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.918
- People are so full of hate,

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.653
and when you talk about flags,

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.155
here's another one.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.791
At the hockey game, in the
NHL finals the other night,

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.459
I believe, I don't know if
it was in Boston or Toronto,

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.061
I think it was in Toronto.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.996
They have, it must
have been in Boston,

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:51.331
it was American troops.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:52.365
They have a color guard.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:53.967
They have the American flag.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:56.736
They have a Canadian flag.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.038 align:start size:97% position:3%
They have the Massachusetts
state flag maybe.

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:00.506
There's a Boston flag.

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:04.210 align:start size:97% position:3%
But then they also have a flag
for Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.144 align:start size:84% position:16%
I swear to God
they're flying a flag.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:07.313
- Yeah, that was in St. Louis.

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:09.215 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Equally with all the
other flags there's

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:10.450 align:start size:84% position:16%
a flag for Enterprise
Rent-A-Car.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.684
(Gregg laughs)

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:12.919
That's how much
the flag matters,

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.089 align:start size:84% position:16%
and if you're mad that
the gay rights flag

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.858
is flying as high as
the stars and stripes,

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:22.595 align:start size:88% position:13%
and you're not mad
about Enterprise
Rent-A-Car being there,

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.430
get the fuck out of my face.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.565
They're flags.

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:26.766
It's not that big a deal.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.401 align:start size:84% position:16%
If Betsy Ross could
just make it up

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:31.204
off the top of her
head, who cares?

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.707 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Some local conservative
activist actually in Boston,

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:36.709 align:start size:94% position:6%
this is a totally separate
story but it's related,

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:40.146
are planning a straight
Pride parade in Boston

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:41.080
- What?

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.750
- Because they're getting upset

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.954
with all the gay
Pride talk in June.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.123
And so they're doing a
straight Pride parade.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.592 align:start size:88% position:13%
You know what a straight
Pride parade is?

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:54.060
Every other parade.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.595 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Actually, actually, no
parade is actually straight.

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:57.130
(Gregg laughs)

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.231
They're all pretty gay.

00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.699
I don't care who you are.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.770 align:start size:97% position:3%
You can be the most anti-gay
Irish alcoholic wastoid

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.472
in the world, if you're in
a parade, that's the gayest

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.508
thing you've ever done.

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:13.513 align:start size:94% position:6%
I welcome our queer and
trans brothers and sisters

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.748
during this month of Pride.

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.517
Fly that flag higher.

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.485
I think that the United
States flag should be

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:22.055
at half-mast out
of embarrassment

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:25.191
for the way some Americans
are treating gay Pride month,

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:28.127
and that's all I have
to say about that.

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:32.098 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Our next story is
related to the NBA finals

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:35.868
where Drake is making
his presence known

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.904 align:start size:97% position:3%
as he has really throughout
the NBA playoffs.

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:40.606
It's been kind of
a fun storyline

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:44.811 align:start size:97% position:3%
to see Drake on the sidelines
in Toronto and Milwaukee

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:48.681 align:start size:97% position:3%
and in various locales.
- [Anthony] It's been so long.

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start size:94% position:6%
- He had to cover up
during the first two games

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.857
of the finals that he has
apparently made a tattoo

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.493
over the last couple
years of Steph Curry,

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:05.264
who plays for the Warriors
and Kevin Durant's numbers

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:07.500 align:start size:84% position:16%
and a little message
underneath them.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.570
And now that his team,
the Raptors, are playing

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.739
the Warriors in the finals,

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:15.241 align:start size:94% position:6%
he's embarrassed about
that and is covering it up

00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:16.476
with an armband.

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:19.278
- Yeah, I think you
gotta sit at home.

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:20.980
If you got tattoos
of the other team,

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.485
he's a Toronto fan, and
I get he's from the six,

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:26.886
he wants to be the hometown guy,

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.921 align:start size:84% position:16%
he's annoying as
hell on the sideline.

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:30.223
It's like watching Jeopardy

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.791 align:start size:84% position:16%
with someone when they
just keep on trying

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:33.826
to yell out the answer
even if they're wrong,

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:34.660 align:start size:84% position:16%
they're just with
complete confidence.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.062
(Erica laughs)

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.264 align:start size:97% position:3%
Him strutting down the
sidelines talking to players,

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:39.799
giving the coach a back massage.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.033
- [Erica] Talking trash.

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.835
- Like yeah, you can't
play basketball, Drake.

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:46.105
Go rap or something,
but don't be calling

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:48.941
Draymond Green trash.

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:52.345
It just makes him look like
the biggest dork of all time.

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:55.047 align:start size:88% position:13%
I love the NBA's
telling him to cool it.

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.749
But if you have those tattoos,

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:57.950
you should stay home.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.185 align:start size:84% position:16%
If you have to cover
up your tattoos

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:01.754
to go to a game because
you're such a fanboy.

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:05.158 align:start size:84% position:16%
You have the numbers
of other players,

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:06.793
which is a weird
thing already even

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:08.361
if you just got Toronto players.

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:09.595
- That's what I'm saying.

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:10.396
You should not get it
in the first place.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:11.831
- No, it's a bad tattoo.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.332 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Put another man's, another
just random athlete's

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:16.569
numbers on your body, then
it's not even your team.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.204 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Exactly, if it was your
team, okay, I get it.

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:19.472 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Where's the
respect, self-respect?

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:21.340 align:start size:97% position:3%
- If I got Ben
Roethlisberger's number seven,

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.742
(laughter)

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:24.477 align:start size:94% position:6%
and like a Roethlisberger
written above it,

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:26.078 align:start size:84% position:16%
it would make
perfect sense for me.

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:27.547 align:start size:84% position:16%
It would be totally
in character.

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:29.382 align:start size:94% position:6%
You'd never have to cover
that up out of shame.

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:30.516
- Garth Brooks would do that.

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.151
He loves Ben Roethlisberger.

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.120 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Garth Brooks
without his shirt on,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.456 align:start size:88% position:13%
he's got the full, it's
like a full jersey.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:39.225
It looks like he's
wearing a jersey

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:40.126
even when he's bare-chested.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.160
(laughs)

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.429
It's Roethlisberger.

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:44.664
- [Erica] Jesus.

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:45.932
- He had to get it fixed
'cause they misspelled

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:46.899
Roethlisberger the first time.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:47.834
(Erica laughs)

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:49.302
But it looks good on him.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.371
- I find Drake kind of
interesting because he is

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:55.274
the dominant, it's taken
me a while to realize this,

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:59.111 align:start size:97% position:3%
but he's the dominant
musical force in the world.

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:00.413
He has the crown.

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:02.949
I would say if you look
at the aughts in general

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:05.117
Drake is probably number one.

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:06.352
Not to me.

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:07.887
- Bigger than Beyoncé,
bigger than Rihanna?

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:11.390
- Talk about album sales, who
people actually listen to,

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.060 align:start size:94% position:6%
he blows Beyoncé and
Rihanna out of the water.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.328 align:start size:84% position:16%
The only one that
would be even close,

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.797
over the last decade,
would be Taylor Swift.

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:18.731
That's definitely a different

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:20.199
- Taylor Swift kills him.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:23.369
- Would kill him, but she
doesn't have the cred.

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:26.005
- That just makes him The
Big Bang Theory of hip hop.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.208
Just because you're popular
doesn't mean you're good.

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.610
- [Erica] Some of
his stuff's good.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.111
- He is good though,
he is good though,

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:33.613
but that's what I kinda mean
is like someone like that,

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:36.816
usually you're trying to
be cool and sort of his MO

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:38.150
is not cool.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.687 align:start size:94% position:6%
He is not that
interested in being cool.

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.356 align:start position:0%
- I think he's very interested,
he just can't do it.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.824 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Like, his relationship
with Rihanna,

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.759
he's very like,

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:49.462
I don't know if he's okay,
but whatever he's doing,

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:53.266
he doesn't come off as a
cool guy or the coolest guy

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:55.201
in the room, and yet
he's the most popular.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:58.471
- He's corny, and
people like corny,

00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:00.973 align:start size:97% position:3%
but I think the best part
of Drake during the playoffs

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:03.609 align:start size:94% position:6%
was when they were playing
the Milwaukee Bucks,

00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:06.379
and the owner of the
Bucks, his daughter,

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.314
who's a beautiful young girl,

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:10.850 align:start size:81% position:19%
wore a Pusha T
t-shirt to a game.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.651
- It was a good move.

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:13.052
- I was like, awesome.

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:15.888
That's the way you get
back at Drake is just

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:18.958
bring up Pusha T
whenever you can.

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.893
If you have tattoos
of the other team

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:24.463 align:start size:94% position:6%
that you're against, just
don't go to the game.

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:25.698
Stay at home.

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:28.568
- Unless it's a super
super, the Drake curse,

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:31.003
whatever team he supports loses,

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:32.471
and he wears all the
different jerseys,

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:33.773 align:start size:97% position:3%
and he did that for the
Bucks and all kind of stuff,

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:35.575 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then they
lose, and whatever.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:40.580
Maybe this is the long-game
to have the Raptors win.

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:42.982
- [Gregg] That's confusing.

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:44.216
- And Drake's dumb enough to
get it tattooed on his body.

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:45.718
- He's corny.

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Does your three year plan
for the Jeselnik and Rosenthal

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.654
Vanity Project

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:49.822
- [All whispering] JRVP

00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:50.990
- Junior Vice President

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.391
- Include any tattoos?

00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:54.327
- Yeah, of course.

00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:55.328
- 'Cause I feel like I'm

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:56.329
- I'm ready.

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:57.830
- Emika and I are itching.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.567
It might not have to do
with this podcast or not,

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:06.372
but I'm ready to go spend
some money and get a tattoo

00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:08.774 align:start size:97% position:3%
with my wife this summer
before the feeling leaves me.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:10.643
- If you and Emika got tattoos,

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:13.145
and you would let me be
a third and get matching

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:15.281 align:start size:84% position:16%
tattoos with you guys,
I would pay for it.

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.515
I would set it all up,

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:18.618 align:start size:88% position:13%
and it would be
Draymond Green's number.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:19.852
(laughs)

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:22.288
(rock music)

00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:27.159
(beeps)
