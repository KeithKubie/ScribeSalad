00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.120
From the magical mind of J.K Rowling

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.020
and the magical wallet of a Harry Potter Global Franchise Development Team

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.200
comes a movie based on

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.580
a real fake textbook

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.380
based on a fake real textbook.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.780
briefly mentioned in real Harry Potter books

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.740
Boy

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.220
We are really scraping the bottom of the barrel here, aren't we?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.780
Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.480
Long after J.K ran out of novels,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.420
the world still craves more Potter

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.760
But Hermione is way too famous these days (seriously?)

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.080
Harry is literally farting around

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.080
*Farting noise*

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.780
And Ron is...

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.220
where is Ron doing anyway?

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.940
Now

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.940
Get ready for a five-part prequel

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.360
that isn't off to the best start

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.900
but who cares, men?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.140
that's part of heads need to fix

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.100
Ahhhhh

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.780
Uhhh

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.040
Nevermind.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.580
Maybe I'll go find my patronus again

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.100
Look!

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.320
I'm a salmon!

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.320
That's...Â¿cool?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.620
Journey.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.620
To the upthight repressed society

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.040
at 1920's  New York

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.500
But beneath the surface

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.660
lies a magical world

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.500
That's also a really uptighted repress

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.500
They got their own non-creative slang

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.300
-The No-Maj

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.100
-The what?

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.280
-No magic!

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.800
Their own muggle racism

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.040
-I know that you have a broader

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.360
backwords non-relationship

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.640
with no magic people.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.640
And the own stains sponsores murder jacuzzis

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.020
Don't that look good.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.520
Uhmmm

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.780
Can we go back to Hogwarts, please?

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.480
Once upon a time

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.780
JK Rowling insisted on only using

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.300
british actors

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.700
but now the franchise has come to America

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.860
and everyone

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.560
is still

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.540
british

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.900
like fancy lad

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.720
Newt Scamander

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.760
the latest of Eddie Redmayne's

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.020
whisper mumblers

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.380
Marlin's beard!

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.060
wouldn't that be nice professor

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.280
I will harvest that planet

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.800
Don't you think this is ok?

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.520
He may not be charming

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.120
He may not be popular

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.660
None on us really fit into school

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.080
but he is willing to lie

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.140
to save his pokemon

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.420
at the cost of human lives

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.820
Nothing in there is dangerous

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.820
Please don't hurt my creatures!

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.900
They aren't dangerous!

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.300
Leave his brain. Come on

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.340
They aren't dangerous!

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.540
The first symptom would be flames out of his anus

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.580
They aren't dangerous!

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.080
*Grasp*

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.580
Ahhh!

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.960
*Creature noises*

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.360
*Breaking glass*

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.300
They aren't dangerous!

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.940
Please, please. They are not dangerous!

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.020
Newt's not alone in the big city

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.060
Move over

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.560
Ron

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.060
Draco

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.560
Snape

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.060
and Hermione

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.600
Because there's a far less interesting

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.760
gang in town

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.520
Like

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.520
The boring Tina Goldstein

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.300
The psychic Betty Boop

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.000
Random Jhon boy family drama

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.500
and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.420
the actually likeable Kowalski

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.460
A muggle

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.920
who steals the show just by

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.840
reacting to stuff

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.460
That guy's got great face

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.580
So come along in a story

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.260
that works well enough on its own

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.460
but isn't that promising

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.900
as an intro to a franchise

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.760
oh

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.760
because what a whole world look

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.240
growing up with Harry Potter

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.300
We all know what happens

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.100
when Jhonny Deep plays a pale weirdo.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.100
and no one ever need to see that again

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.480
Good morning, star shine

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.480
The earth says "Hello!"

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.880
Starring

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.880
Eddie Redmayne talks to animals

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.860
The pillsbury O-face

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.380
True Auror season 2

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.380

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.380
DTF Scott Fitzgerald

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.380
We need to talk about Creedence

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.820
Avada Kadeppra

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.500
And

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.300
Ahhh!

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.800
Fake Monsters

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.420
He Brought a Zoo

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.580
cockroach in teapot

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.540
Jee!

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.540
If only there were a magic spell

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.540
that could help you out in this situation!

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.300
Acchio!

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.680
Hey, screen junkies

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.540

Harry Potter, you must go to the shire

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.440
and become a Jedi Knight

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.300
so you can sit on the Iron Throne

Farm fresh butt nuggets from sale at your mom's house

I like pineapples on pizza

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.240
I honestly don't even know what's in my sprite
