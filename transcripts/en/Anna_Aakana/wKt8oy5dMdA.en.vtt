00:00:00.338 --> 00:00:02.123
I've never been good at talking.

00:00:02.123 --> 00:00:05.609
When I was 13 and I would talk to boys
that I like on the phone,

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.510
I would have a list

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.224
of questions and topics

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:12.384
that I could refer to if the conversation lulled.

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:14.092
Which was like, 100% of the time.

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:15.449
Um..

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.479
Well, uh..

00:00:16.479 --> 00:00:19.678
"Mrs. Michael Esmeralda heart heart heart."

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.422
Wait, no..

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:23.739
No that's--that's just a doodle,

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.332
that's n--it's not a real...

00:00:25.332 --> 00:00:26.468
a real topic..

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:29.362
Anna, you idiot!

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.478
(slap)

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:32.468
(sobs)

00:00:33.423 --> 00:00:35.738
And often, I'll find myself in a conversation

00:00:35.738 --> 00:00:38.448
where I really don't have anything to say or add,

00:00:38.448 --> 00:00:41.071
but it feels awkward to just exist there,

00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:42.601
so I'll just nod and smile

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:44.362
and laugh really loud.

00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:45.770
And look, it's not like I don't have

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.240
opinions or things to say,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.449
it's just that in most conversations

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.106
I like being the listener, you know?

00:00:53.106 --> 00:00:55.010
But unfortunately, this has led to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.740
not being able to keep conversations going

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.072
if it's completely up to me

00:00:59.072 --> 00:00:59.978
to keep them going..

00:01:01.448 --> 00:01:02.301
So uh..

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.359
You like cats?

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.119
Uh, you asked me that already.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.721
Right...

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.496
Alright.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.600
So do you?

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.760
But I've realized

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:17.701
over the course of many many conversations
in Los Angeles,

00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:19.399
that the only thing you really have to do

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.809
is to ask people about themselves.

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:23.161
So where were you

00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:25.178
on the 25th of January?

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.842
You mean today?

00:01:26.842 --> 00:01:27.687
(scoffs)

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:28.951
Exactly.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.962
I worked for a little bit,

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:31.632
uh..

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:33.923
did some grocery shopping..

00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:35.363
So you cook, huh?

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:37.029
Yeah, I mean...

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.720
it's much cheaper than eating out
all the time...

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.102
What are some of your favorite recipes?

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:43.602
Oh,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.692
I've recently been introduced to quinoa.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.787
All it really takes

00:01:47.787 --> 00:01:50.071
is to find common ground on one thing.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.325
And for me, that, most of the time,

00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:52.784
that's a love for cats.

00:01:52.784 --> 00:01:55.571
Or like, have a genuine interest in something that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.350
someone's revealed to you.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.224
And then the conversation just..

00:01:59.224 --> 00:01:59.764
flourishes.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.433
And I don't know why it's taken me

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.725
so long to figure out, but...

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:04.965
hope it helps.

00:02:05.163 --> 00:02:06.637
Vague movie quote and reference

00:02:06.637 --> 00:02:08.776
to an obscure indie film in the 70s.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.748
Ooh, recognition of said subtle reference,

00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:13.428
and the preceding movie quote

00:02:13.428 --> 00:02:14.668
right back at ya.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.087
(nervous giggle)

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.953
(giggling builds)

00:02:19.953 --> 00:02:21.118
(subsides)

00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:25.832
