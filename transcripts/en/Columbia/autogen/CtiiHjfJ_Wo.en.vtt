take policymakers a very long time

00:46:28.839 --> 00:46:28.849
take policymakers a very long time
 

00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:31.120
take policymakers a very long time

you're alone they're quite a few a

you're alone they're quite a few a
little hard to read but one question is

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:52.930
little hard to read but one question is
 

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:56.260
little hard to read but one question is
how have we really reduced the risk of

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:56.270
how have we really reduced the risk of
 

00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:03.190
how have we really reduced the risk of
bailouts well I think it's a good

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200
bailouts well I think it's a good
 

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.990
bailouts well I think it's a good
question i think first in the near term

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000
question i think first in the near term
 

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.940
question i think first in the near term
with soggy near-term and longer-term i

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:06.950
with soggy near-term and longer-term i
 

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:10.059
with soggy near-term and longer-term i
think in the near term the the first

00:47:10.059 --> 00:47:10.069
think in the near term the the first
 

00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:11.800
think in the near term the the first
thing that's been focused on is is

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:11.810
thing that's been focused on is is
 

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:13.930
thing that's been focused on is is
capital capital and banks and i think

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:13.940
capital capital and banks and i think
 

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.910
capital capital and banks and i think
you've seen really a significant

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920
you've seen really a significant
 

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:19.240
you've seen really a significant
increase in capital ratios and that

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:19.250
increase in capital ratios and that
 

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.910
increase in capital ratios and that
that's continuing regulators are very

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920
that's continuing regulators are very
 

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.890
that's continuing regulators are very
focused institutions have gone out and

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:23.900
focused institutions have gone out and
 

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.720
focused institutions have gone out and
raise capital will continue to do it so

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:25.730
raise capital will continue to do it so
 

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:28.030
raise capital will continue to do it so
the ratios are not only before right

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:28.040
the ratios are not only before right
 

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.530
the ratios are not only before right
before the crisis but significantly

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:29.540
before the crisis but significantly
 

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.660
before the crisis but significantly
higher than then then well before the

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:31.670
higher than then then well before the
 

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:34.180
higher than then then well before the
crisis so I think that that's one and

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:34.190
crisis so I think that that's one and
 

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:36.339
crisis so I think that that's one and
that's an important again an important

00:47:36.339 --> 00:47:36.349
that's an important again an important
 

00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:41.069
that's an important again an important
part of the health of a bank longer-term

00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079
part of the health of a bank longer-term
 

00:47:41.079 --> 00:47:43.030
part of the health of a bank longer-term
again it's going to depend on the

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040
again it's going to depend on the
 

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.500
again it's going to depend on the
implementation of dodd-frank which

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:44.510
implementation of dodd-frank which
 

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:46.630
implementation of dodd-frank which
really is in its early stages so I think

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640
really is in its early stages so I think
 

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.150
really is in its early stages so I think
better oversight is critical and there's

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:49.160
better oversight is critical and there's
 

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.210
better oversight is critical and there's
a lot of work to do having been part of

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:52.220
a lot of work to do having been part of
 

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.500
a lot of work to do having been part of
a start-up within the government

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:53.510
a start-up within the government
 

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:56.710
a start-up within the government
bureaucracy is very challenging things

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720
bureaucracy is very challenging things
 

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.900
bureaucracy is very challenging things
that you I think from the outside expect

00:47:58.900 --> 00:47:58.910
that you I think from the outside expect
 

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.390
that you I think from the outside expect
exist like massive infrastructure and

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:01.400
exist like massive infrastructure and
 

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.010
exist like massive infrastructure and
hundreds and hundreds of qualified

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:03.020
hundreds and hundreds of qualified
 

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:04.990
hundreds and hundreds of qualified
people just simply doesn't exist it

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.000
people just simply doesn't exist it
 

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.300
people just simply doesn't exist it
takes a long time to actually go out and

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:07.310
takes a long time to actually go out and
 

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:10.329
takes a long time to actually go out and
build these these important pieces of

00:48:10.329 --> 00:48:10.339
build these these important pieces of
 

00:48:10.339 --> 00:48:13.270
build these these important pieces of
oversight that will I think make the

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280
oversight that will I think make the
 

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.819
oversight that will I think make the
system you know even more stable going

00:48:15.819 --> 00:48:15.829
system you know even more stable going
 

00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:17.410
system you know even more stable going
forward but but those are big challenges

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:17.420
forward but but those are big challenges
 

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.950
forward but but those are big challenges
and again I think time will tell how

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960
and again I think time will tell how
 

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.289
and again I think time will tell how

credit metrics looking at capital both
 

00:48:30.819 --> 00:48:32.549
credit metrics looking at capital both
here and globally and I think in some

here and globally and I think in some

ways we're ahead of some other countries

00:48:35.039 --> 00:48:35.049
ways we're ahead of some other countries
 

00:48:35.049 --> 00:48:37.259
ways we're ahead of some other countries
in perhaps other part parts of the

00:48:37.259 --> 00:48:37.269
in perhaps other part parts of the
 

00:48:37.269 --> 00:48:38.729
in perhaps other part parts of the
banking sector particularly smaller

00:48:38.729 --> 00:48:38.739

banks are more challenged we can talk a

00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599
banks are more challenged we can talk a
 

00:48:40.599 --> 00:48:42.299
banks are more challenged we can talk a
little more about that but I think so

00:48:42.299 --> 00:48:42.309
little more about that but I think so
 

00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:43.919
little more about that but I think so
the system is more stable but there's a

00:48:43.919 --> 00:48:43.929
the system is more stable but there's a
 

00:48:43.929 --> 00:48:45.499
the system is more stable but there's a
lot of work to do so that there isn't

00:48:45.499 --> 00:48:45.509
lot of work to do so that there isn't
 

00:48:45.509 --> 00:48:49.620

question about the banking sector you

00:48:56.009 --> 00:48:56.019
question about the banking sector you
 

00:48:56.019 --> 00:48:58.140

owned over twenty-five percent and we
 

00:52:29.059 --> 00:52:30.519
owned over twenty-five percent and we
monetize that over the course of the

interests do you agree with this or not
and then a further question what would

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:41.530
and then a further question what would
 

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:43.920
and then a further question what would
you like to see in the rules on

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:43.930
you like to see in the rules on
 

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:46.740
you like to see in the rules on
executive compensation and that's a

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:46.750
executive compensation and that's a
 

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:51.360
executive compensation and that's a
press question okay so first and

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:51.370
press question okay so first and
 

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:53.970
press question okay so first and
foremost a lot of the regulation is

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:53.980
foremost a lot of the regulation is
 

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:55.830
foremost a lot of the regulation is
getting discussed right now and in terms

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:55.840
getting discussed right now and in terms
 

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.360
getting discussed right now and in terms
of what things will look like going

00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:57.370
of what things will look like going
 

00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:59.940
of what things will look like going
forward I think there's general

00:53:59.940 --> 00:53:59.950
forward I think there's general
 

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:01.950
forward I think there's general
agreement that incentives need to be

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:01.960
agreement that incentives need to be
 

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.650
agreement that incentives need to be
aligned I don't have a particular view

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:04.660
aligned I don't have a particular view
 

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:07.020
aligned I don't have a particular view
on the overall size of executive

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:07.030
on the overall size of executive
 

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:08.490
on the overall size of executive
compensation I don't think that's a

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:08.500
compensation I don't think that's a
 

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.590
compensation I don't think that's a
major issue it is is how that's

00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:10.600
major issue it is is how that's
 

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.090
major issue it is is how that's
determined and what are the incentives

00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:12.100
determined and what are the incentives
 

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:14.760
determined and what are the incentives
so I think you know the general premise

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:14.770
so I think you know the general premise
 

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:17.340
so I think you know the general premise
of looking out over a longer time

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:17.350
of looking out over a longer time
 

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:20.790
of looking out over a longer time
horizon which both allows certainly

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800
horizon which both allows certainly
 

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.760
horizon which both allows certainly
reduces the gaming going into sort of

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:23.770
reduces the gaming going into sort of
 

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:27.120
reduces the gaming going into sort of
one year time horizons and then having

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:27.130
one year time horizons and then having
 

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:29.280
one year time horizons and then having
the ability to claw back as we saw in

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:29.290
the ability to claw back as we saw in
 

00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:31.650
the ability to claw back as we saw in
the crisis there were paper fake profits

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:31.660
the crisis there were paper fake profits
 

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:34.620
the crisis there were paper fake profits
that were based really on fiction and I

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:34.630
that were based really on fiction and I
 

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:36.180
that were based really on fiction and I
think those are areas what you're trying

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:36.190
think those are areas what you're trying
 

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:39.210
think those are areas what you're trying
to solve for again I think there are

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:39.220
to solve for again I think there are
 

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:40.770
to solve for again I think there are
lots of ways to do it I think we need to

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:40.780
lots of ways to do it I think we need to
 

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:42.720
lots of ways to do it I think we need to
be very careful not to create another

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:42.730
be very careful not to create another
 

00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:44.790
be very careful not to create another
set of distortions so I think a

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:44.800
set of distortions so I think a
 

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.740
set of distortions so I think a
broad-based principle of more

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:46.750
broad-based principle of more
 

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:49.140
broad-based principle of more
compensation in the form of equity more

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:49.150
compensation in the form of equity more
 

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:50.700
compensation in the form of equity more
deferred compensation these are all

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:50.710
deferred compensation these are all
 

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:52.110
deferred compensation these are all
steps in the right direction I don't

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:52.120
steps in the right direction I don't
 

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.380
steps in the right direction I don't
profess to be an expert on it I think as

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:55.390
profess to be an expert on it I think as
 

00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:57.930
profess to be an expert on it I think as
far as you know shareholders I think

00:54:57.930 --> 00:54:57.940
far as you know shareholders I think
 

00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:59.790
far as you know shareholders I think
it's always good for shareholders to

00:54:59.790 --> 00:54:59.800
it's always good for shareholders to
 

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.440
it's always good for shareholders to
play more active role in the governor

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:01.450
play more active role in the governor
 

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:03.060
play more active role in the governor
so there of their company I think there

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:03.070
so there of their company I think there
 

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.800
so there of their company I think there
will be you know you'll see more on

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:04.810
will be you know you'll see more on
 

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:06.900
will be you know you'll see more on
say-on-pay votes and I think again

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:06.910
say-on-pay votes and I think again
 

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:08.460
say-on-pay votes and I think again
that's that something is more about

00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:08.470
that's that something is more about
 

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:10.740
that's that something is more about
corporate governance but shareholders

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:10.750
corporate governance but shareholders
 

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:13.099
corporate governance but shareholders
need to do their part to to essentially

00:55:13.099 --> 00:55:13.109
need to do their part to to essentially
 

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:15.750
need to do their part to to essentially
to vote and guide boards as to what they

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760
to vote and guide boards as to what they
 

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.190
to vote and guide boards as to what they
feel is appropriate but again I think

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200
feel is appropriate but again I think
 

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.050
feel is appropriate but again I think
you know there needs to be balance I

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:19.060
you know there needs to be balance I
 

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:20.910
you know there needs to be balance I
think you don't want a situation where

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:20.920
think you don't want a situation where
 

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.859
think you don't want a situation where
certain parts of the financial system

00:55:22.859 --> 00:55:22.869
certain parts of the financial system
 

00:55:22.869 --> 00:55:25.800
certain parts of the financial system
have certain regulations other parts

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:25.810
have certain regulations other parts
 

00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:27.750
have certain regulations other parts
don't particularly since we live in a

00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760
don't particularly since we live in a
 

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.120
don't particularly since we live in a
global economy there needs to be a lot

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:30.130
global economy there needs to be a lot
 

00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:31.650
global economy there needs to be a lot
of coordination there because then you

00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:31.660
of coordination there because then you
 

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:33.900
of coordination there because then you
just you'll end up having similar forms

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:33.910
just you'll end up having similar forms
 

00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:35.700
just you'll end up having similar forms
of instead of regulatory arbitrage

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:35.710
of instead of regulatory arbitrage
 

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:38.339
of instead of regulatory arbitrage
you'll have compensation arbitrage and I

00:55:38.339 --> 00:55:38.349
you'll have compensation arbitrage and I
 

00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:39.660
you'll have compensation arbitrage and I
don't think that's that's beneficial so

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:39.670
don't think that's that's beneficial so
 

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:40.770
don't think that's that's beneficial so
I think it needs to be done carefully

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:40.780
I think it needs to be done carefully
 

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.470
I think it needs to be done carefully
needs to be done you know sensibly but

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:43.480
needs to be done you know sensibly but
 

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.630
needs to be done you know sensibly but
again along the same themes of

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640
again along the same themes of
 

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:50.000
again along the same themes of
longer-term horizons okay thank you and

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:50.010
longer-term horizons okay thank you and
 

00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:54.990
longer-term horizons okay thank you and
let me raise two last questions first is

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:55.000
let me raise two last questions first is
 

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
let me raise two last questions first is
this issue you just mentioned of

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:57.010
this issue you just mentioned of
 

00:55:57.010 --> 00:56:00.329
this issue you just mentioned of
regulatory arbitrage and one question

00:56:00.329 --> 00:56:00.339
regulatory arbitrage and one question
 

00:56:00.339 --> 00:56:03.359
regulatory arbitrage and one question
here from a second year student is does

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:03.369
here from a second year student is does
 

00:56:03.369 --> 00:56:05.599
here from a second year student is does
the existence of many regulators and

00:56:05.599 --> 00:56:05.609
the existence of many regulators and
 

00:56:05.609 --> 00:56:08.880
the existence of many regulators and
agency overlaps create the groundwork

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:08.890
agency overlaps create the groundwork
 

00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:11.370
agency overlaps create the groundwork
the ground for big banks to circumvent

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:11.380
the ground for big banks to circumvent
 

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:16.640
the ground for big banks to circumvent
the rules or is that been resolved I

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:16.650
 

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:19.620
think it's a great question I'd like to

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:19.630
think it's a great question I'd like to
 

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:22.559
think it's a great question I'd like to
say it's been fully resolved I I don't

00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:22.569
say it's been fully resolved I I don't
 

00:56:22.569 --> 00:56:25.680
say it's been fully resolved I I don't
know I think time will tell you no

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:25.690
know I think time will tell you no
 

00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:26.970
know I think time will tell you no
different countries have different

00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:26.980
different countries have different
 

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:30.930
different countries have different
regulatory regimes and so those that

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:30.940
regulatory regimes and so those that
 

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:34.349
regulatory regimes and so those that
have one centralized regulator still had

00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359
have one centralized regulator still had
 

00:56:34.359 --> 00:56:36.420
have one centralized regulator still had
similar problems versus of fragmented

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:36.430
similar problems versus of fragmented
 

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:38.040
similar problems versus of fragmented
system they were different issues there

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:38.050
system they were different issues there
 

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:39.780
system they were different issues there
were different lapses and oversight so

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:39.790
were different lapses and oversight so
 

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:41.339
were different lapses and oversight so
it's not to say one is definitely better

00:56:41.339 --> 00:56:41.349
it's not to say one is definitely better
 

00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:43.470
it's not to say one is definitely better
than the other that being said there

00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:43.480
than the other that being said there
 

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.150
than the other that being said there
needs to clearly be more coordination

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.160
needs to clearly be more coordination
 

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.680
needs to clearly be more coordination
and I'm not sure I know the best way to

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:46.690
and I'm not sure I know the best way to
 

00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:48.809
and I'm not sure I know the best way to
do that so I think dodd-frank brings in

00:56:48.809 --> 00:56:48.819
do that so I think dodd-frank brings in
 

00:56:48.819 --> 00:56:50.609
do that so I think dodd-frank brings in
some of this sort of someone sitting on

00:56:50.609 --> 00:56:50.619
some of this sort of someone sitting on
 

00:56:50.619 --> 00:56:52.680
some of this sort of someone sitting on
top having data to all you know look at

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:52.690
top having data to all you know look at
 

00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:55.050
top having data to all you know look at
all of them but in the real world and I

00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:55.060
all of them but in the real world and I
 

00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:56.520
all of them but in the real world and I
think that works very well in theory I

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:56.530
think that works very well in theory I
 

00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:58.050
think that works very well in theory I
think practically speaking it will be

00:56:58.050 --> 00:56:58.060
think practically speaking it will be
 

00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.880
think practically speaking it will be
difficult because institutions that

00:56:59.880 --> 00:56:59.890
difficult because institutions that
 

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:02.490
difficult because institutions that
exist that have long histories have long

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:02.500
exist that have long histories have long
 

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.750
exist that have long histories have long
personal have literally have

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760
personal have literally have
 

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.230
personal have literally have
personalities you know tend to do things

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:07.240
personalities you know tend to do things
 

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.940
personalities you know tend to do things
their own way and that creates these

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:08.950
their own way and that creates these
 

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:11.730
their own way and that creates these
separate entities so I think it depends

00:57:11.730 --> 00:57:11.740
separate entities so I think it depends
 

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:14.880
separate entities so I think it depends
and we'll see but I don't

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:14.890
and we'll see but I don't
 

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:18.089

and one is a little closer to totally

what are those cases I think again the
