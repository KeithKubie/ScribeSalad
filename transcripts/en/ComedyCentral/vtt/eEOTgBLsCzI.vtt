As conservatives, we know
that getting an abortion

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:05.571
is as easy as getting a cab
in New York City.

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:07.540
Cab!

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.444
<i> Roe v. Wade</i> has resulted

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:14.947
in some of the most permissive
abortion laws

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.249
anywhere in the world.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.084
Do you want abortion on demand?

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:21.154
-Abortion on demand...
-Abortion on demand...

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.889
Yet somehow
the liberals complain

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.024
that we've gotten in the way
of their abortion on demand,

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:27.827
and now they won't stop talking
about the state of Mississippi.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.929
While you weren't looking,
the governor of Mississippi

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:31.197
is trying to make his state

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.599
the hardest place in America
to get an abortion.

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:34.767
Now we don't have access

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.270
to safe and legal
abortion services.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.639
Clearly Republicans
are trying to take us back

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.107
to the days when women died

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.509
from unsafe abortions
in this country.

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:47.180
GREY:<i> Time to fly south
 to expose these lies.</i>

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.382 line:0%
<i> So we came to the only Planned
 Parenthood in Mississippi</i>

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.851 line:0%
to show you just how easy it is
to get an abortion.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.252
In what's sure to be

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:57.056
<i> The Opposition's</i> 
shortest field piece ever.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.225
-All right.
-(both grunting)

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:00.827
Shouldn't have packed
all these Bibles.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.995
Hey. So, we'd like
two abortions, please.

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:04.163
-Two abortions now.
-Yeah.

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:05.665
Here in Mississippi,
the landscape

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.467
-that the politicians
have created -Uh-huh.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.768
have made it so difficult

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.536
that places
like our health centers

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.738
can't provide a full range
of services.

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:15.274
-Okay, I feel like that was
a very loaded no. -Yeah.

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:16.809
That's correct.

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:19.145
THURMAN:<i> So, according to
 Planned Parenthood's Staci Fox,</i>

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.180
<i> this clinic
 doesn't offer abortions.</i>

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:22.315
GREY:
<i> But why?</i>

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.749
States are introducing
more bills

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:25.551
to prevent access to care.

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:26.619
Right here in Mississippi,

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:28.121
the state legislature
passed a bill

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.889
banning abortion at 15 weeks.

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:32.725
I think these laws are tactics
to start to chip away

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:35.728
access to what
the<i> Roe v. Wade</i> decision set

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.197
as the legal standard
in the United States.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.900 line:0%
THURMAN:<i> If Mississippi has made
 it so hard to get abortions,</i>

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.469 line:0%
<i> how come there's a clinic
 right next door?</i>

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:46.539
GREY:<i> So we infiltrated what was
 obviously an abortion provider</i>

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:48.107
<i> based on the fact
 that their website</i>

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.943
<i> clearly targets
 people seeking abortions.</i>

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:52.044
We don't do abortions,

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:53.479
and we don't refer
for abortions.

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.281
-(record scratches)
-BOTH:<i> Wait, what?</i>

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:57.550
The building next door
is a fake women's health center,

00:01:57.583 --> 00:01:59.952
and these centers
that exist all over the country

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:01.721
provide women
distorted information

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.656
and often
inaccurate information.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.692
That is, like, the worst prank
but, like, the best prank.

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:09.462
It's like<i> Jackass</i> but for your
reproductive rights.

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:10.730
THURMAN:
<i> In Mississippi, there are more</i>

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.064
<i> of these fake
 women's health centers,</i>

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:13.833
<i> aka crisis pregnancy centers,</i>

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:15.268
<i> than there are Starbucks.</i>

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.503
<i> But it's still so easy.</i>

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:19.906
If you're a woman who wanted
to access abortion care

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.774
in the state of Mississippi,
unfortunately,

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:23.776
you'll have to drive
to Jackson, Mississippi.

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.145
THURMAN:<i> Okay, there's only
 one clinic left in Mississippi.</i>

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:28.147
<i> You know what that means.</i>

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.783
BOTH:
<i> Road trip!</i>

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:32.752
GREY:<i> And who could possibly
 have a problem</i>

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.820
<i> with a road trip?</i>

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:36.789
Imagine if you were a woman
who had a job

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:38.090
GREY:
<i> I don't. Show's canceled.</i>

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:39.759
Or needed to put the children

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.394
that you had at home
in childcare.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.662
THURMAN:
<i> Ew, I don't have kids.</i>

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.964
And the financial resources
to drive 100 miles.

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:46.899
THURMAN:<i> We're rich, Staci.
 Quit playing.</i>

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:48.100
<i> The 100 mile trip</i>

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:50.036
<i> from Hattiesburg to Jackson

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.004
GREY:<i> And just imagine,
 some lucky ladies</i>

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:54.840

<i> we can show you how easy it is

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:04.884
THURMAN:<i> As soon as we get past
 a few brave protesters.</i>

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:06.452
We are here for the gospel
of Jesus Christ.

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:08.087
I would absolutely
counsel people

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.355
that the Lord says
all fornicators

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:10.690
have their place
in the lake of fire.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:13.359
And so we are here crying out
for people to consider

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:15.795
that we stand before
a holy and righteous god.

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:17.396
You want to go back
to when abortion was illegal

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:18.531
and no one had abortions.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:19.932
-Oh, wait.
-They had them.

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:21.200
But they were illegal
and dangerous

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:22.768
-and they died.
-People were dying. Yeah.

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:25.137
GREY:<i> After making it past
 this guy and his sound logic...</i>

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.839
Well, it's no different
than at the Holocaust.

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:28.541
<i> ...we could finally go inside</i>

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:30.409
<i> with the help
 of a clinic escort</i>

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:31.844
<i> protecting women
 from protesters.</i>

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:33.279
<i> What a breeze.</i>

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:34.981
THURMAN:<i> After that,
 we could finally talk</i>

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:36.582
<i> to Shannon Brewer,
 the clinic's director,</i>

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:39.218
<i> about how getting an abortion
 was so freaking easy.</i>

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.887
No, it's not... it's not
that easy to get an abortion.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.323
Um, you have to call,
schedule an appointment.

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:45.691
GREY:
<i> To get your abortion on demand,</i>

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:48.327
<i> all you need is an appointment.
 Then...</i>

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.630
You have to speak with
a counselor about your options.

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:51.864
THURMAN:
<i> In this mandatory meeting,</i>

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:53.165

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:00.673
It's a two-visit process.

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:02.174
For (bleep) sake.

00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:04.844
There's a 24-hour
waiting period.

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:06.946
THURMAN:<i> Even though the law
 requires women to wait 24 hours</i>

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.781
<i> to think about the choice
 they've already made,</i>

00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:10.483
<i> it's still pretty on demand.</i>

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.184
-Oh, hey. What did you get?
-Okay.

00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:14.520
I got some water,
some fruit snacks,

00:04:14.553 --> 00:04:16.155
-oh, and a gun.
-Oh, cool.

00:04:16.188 --> 00:04:17.556
Yeah, super easy to get here.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.692
Thank God they don't have
a 24-hour waiting period.

00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:21.027
-Right?
-Right?

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.662
GREY:
<i> And since you're far from home,</i>

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:23.896
<i> you'll need

<i> and spend money on a hotel.</i>

00:04:25.597 --> 00:04:26.999
This looks good.

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:29.902
Planned Parenthood wants America
to start having more abortions

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:31.637
because that's liberation.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.407
-I like this. Good choice.
-Thank you.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.909
THURMAN:
<i> And now it's abortion o'clock</i>

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:38.644
<i> as long as it's a Tuesday,
 Wednesday or Thursday,</i>

00:04:38.677 --> 00:04:40.079
<i> because those are the only days</i>

THURMAN:
<i> Oh, goddamn it.</i>

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:56.062
I already have four kids.

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:58.164
Me and my husband did not plan
to have any more kids.

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:00.433
Took me two weeks
to get the money together.

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.868
Within the first six
to ten weeks,

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:04.804
it's $600 for the procedure.

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:08.341
When you are ten weeks
or even a day over ten weeks,

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:10.743
it's $800,
and you cannot do the pill.

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:13.112
You can only do
the surgical procedure.

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:14.680
That's kind of expensive.

00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:17.183
-Good thing everybody
in Mississippi is rich. -Yeah.

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:20.820
No, the majority of women here

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.788
to, you know, make ends meet.

00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:24.256
Everything's been stripped away
from them.

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.258
The childcare
has been stripped away,

00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:28.227
Medicaid's been stripped away.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.863
All of these things
are being taken away from them.

00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:33.332
The option to have an abortion
is being taken away, also.

00:05:33.365 --> 00:05:35.801
In talking to you right now,
it sort of sounds like

00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:38.838
if we do want
to reduce abortions,

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:43.175
maybe we should have
better child welfare services.

-Comprehensive health care.
-Contraception.

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:48.681

-Maternity-paternity leave.
