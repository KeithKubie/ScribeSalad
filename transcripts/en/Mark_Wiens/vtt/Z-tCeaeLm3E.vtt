00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:03.468
(people chattering)

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.610
- And they just take plate after plate

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.670
of the most tender meat you've ever tasted

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.210
in your life out of that oven.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.354
It's just oozy and dripping with juices.

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:17.937
(upbeat music)

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.412
Oh, there's our ride right there.

00:00:25.412 --> 00:00:29.079
(speaking foreign language)

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.313
Good morning!

00:00:31.313 --> 00:00:32.200
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.033
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.380
We just landed in Mexico City

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.610
and I had previously arranged

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.950
for a car to come meet us here.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.610
We're going directly to
a place called Texcoco,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.460
which is famous for Barbacoa,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.170
which is one of the
ultimate Mexican dishes.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.003
I love it so much!

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:50.750
We're gonna eat there and then after that,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.330
we'll be going to Teotihuacan

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.920
to visit the Pyramid of the Sun.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.845
That's the plan for today
on this Mexico food trip.

00:00:57.845 --> 00:00:59.998
(speaking foreign language)

00:00:59.998 --> 00:01:02.415
(chattering)

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.250
We're on our way to a
place called Texcoco first

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.827
to eat Barbacoa.

00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:17.410
(lively music)

00:01:29.427 --> 00:01:31.372
That was about a 45-minute
ride from the airport

00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:32.205
and we have arived.

00:01:32.205 --> 00:01:33.038
This is just,

00:01:33.038 --> 00:01:34.910
it's kinda like a hidden
town within the mountains

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.220
above Mexico City

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.230
and this entire town is
like a Barbacoa town.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.450
But we pulled into this restaurant.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.790
It's called El Pica I, and
immediately as we pulled in,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.920
you could smell the aroma of smoky meat.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.898
It literally filled into the Suburban.

00:01:49.898 --> 00:01:53.790
(lively mariachi music)

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.690
The meat aromas here are just irresistible

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.360
and this place is so huge.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.530
It's almost like a fair.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.070
They have kids, things for
kids, they have Ferris wheels,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.210
they have all sorts of snacks

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.760
that have sort of
surrounded the restaurant

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.120
and there's just a massive
seating section throughout the,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.820
almost throughout the jungle here.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.220
You just choose any table.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.550
They have tables throughout these.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.550
It's really like a shady
cool vine-filled dining room.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.483
We got a table here

00:02:23.483 --> 00:02:25.060
but they also have more
of a communal section,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.300
but this is really cool.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.010
Now we're gonna go check out the Barbacoa

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.298
and kind of figure out even how to order.

00:02:30.298 --> 00:02:33.381
(lively salsa music)

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.640
(people chattering)

00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:50.420
Oh, this is absolutely insane.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.900
So leading up to the main,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.200
this is the main Barbacoa here,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.630
and leading up to it, you
have all sorts of condiments.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.020
You can buy all sorts of side dishes,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.950
but this is what you're
gonna come here to eat.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.100
This is what you want
to eat, the Barbacoa.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.040
(people chattering)

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.470
You come up to the front first

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.820
and you make your order and
you pay and then after that,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.620
I think you go to the
meat-chopping station

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.855
to get your meat.

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:28.438
(shovel scraping on metal)

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.804
We're just in time as
they're opening a fresh oven.

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:44.804
(people chattering)

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.050
Oh, that is unbelievable!

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.630
He took off the lid of the clay oven

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.130
and just a poof of smoke came out

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.550
so that the smoke is just,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.630
it's just locked up inside that clay oven,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.270
and you can immediately smell,

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.320
the owner just told me it's lamb.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.390
And he's given me permission
to come back here and film.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.380
Oh, wow, that smells unbelievable.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.600
And there's some kinda like leaf.

00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:14.671
(people chattering)

00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:22.020
I'm standing up here on the clay oven,

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.570
just bathing in the steam
and smoke of the Barbacoa.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.030
And it's wrapped in many layers of,

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.530
it's a type of, it's similar to agave,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.130
but he said it's the ...

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.490
I can't remember the Spanish name

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.311
and it's wrapped in
multiple layers of that.

00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:40.311
(people chattering)

00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:48.694
(lively salsa music)

00:05:01.508 --> 00:05:04.370
So they have about six
or seven brick ovens

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.550
which are just stuffed full of lamb

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.220
and they're packed in so tight

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.930
so it holds in all of that steam and smoke

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.100
until the meat is ridiculously tender.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.110
And then as they finish
one, they open another one

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.450
and I think they just keep
selling until they sell out.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.200
But in order to take the
meat out of the oven,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.650
because it's so ridiculously ultra-tender,

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.160
they just scoop it out by the plateful.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.210
They don't need knives here.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.580
All they do is take a
plate and literally like,

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.260
scoop it in or grab it and they
just take plate after plate

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.140
of the most tender meat you've
ever tasted in your life

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.973
out of that oven.

00:05:38.973 --> 00:05:41.680
It's just oozy and dripping with juices.

00:05:42.607 --> 00:05:45.690
(lively salsa music)

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:02.430
Oh, (speaking foreign language).

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.930
This is right out of the oven.

00:06:07.816 --> 00:06:08.649
Oh!

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.940
Oh, wow!

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.580
That might be the most tender
piece of meat I've ever had.

00:06:17.518 --> 00:06:19.150
Oh, oh, that's insane.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.779
Wow, Carlos.

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:23.862
(lively salsa music)

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.310
That will make you weep with joy.

00:06:30.778 --> 00:06:33.190
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.920
I don't know if I've
ever been this excited

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.690
to go eat meat in my life.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.660
Oh, I'm running back to our table,

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.640
but yeah, you get the
meat at the back there.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.270
Whoa, and you can buy some
fried bananas here, too.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.460
But they have so many things you can buy,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.820
and you buy all your condiments.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.270
Carlos already got all the salsas,

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.500
but I also got a little cup of guacamole.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.690
Oh man, that meat!

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.190
That meat is insane.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.160
Okay, let's go eat.

00:06:56.074 --> 00:06:59.074
(people chattering)

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.459
Those guys that reach into the ovens?

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:08.292
(speaking foreign language)

00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:09.525
Those guys are like firemen, man.

00:07:09.525 --> 00:07:10.405
(laughing)

00:07:10.405 --> 00:07:11.238
Did you see those guys?

00:07:11.238 --> 00:07:12.071
- [Carlos] Now, and that
thing opens like (whooshing).

00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:13.870
- So hot, man, it's so hot.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.040
You can order two different versions.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.920
It's all lamb, but you
can either order a plate

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.650
without bones or with bones,

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.280
so we got one of each to share
and it comes by the kilo.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.010
You can only order it by
the kilo so we got two kilos

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.610
of the most tender meat ever.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.820
I've never been so excited to open a gift

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.024
in my entire life, to unwrap a gift.

00:07:30.024 --> 00:07:31.260
(paper crinkling)

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.350
Oh, it's just so hot.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.050
And then they wrap it in a plastic bag.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.430
Oh man, the juiciness is unbelievable.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.190
Look at all of those lamb juices and fats.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.200
I got the boneless first,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.900
I just have to take
another bite of that meat.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.393
Look at that.

00:07:48.393 --> 00:07:51.393
(people chattering)

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:54.152
Oh man.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.840
It falls apart in your
mouth is an understatement.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.920
You can definitely tell that it's lamb.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.850
It's just embedded with smoke.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.810
It's salty, unbelievable flavor.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.110
Next, I'll try a tortilla,

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.270
and I'm gonna kinda cover up the meat

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.970
so that it doesn't get cold on us.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.040
Just, oh look, look at that.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.590
Oh, it just flakes.

00:08:19.237 --> 00:08:23.010
(people chattering)

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.860
I'll add on a little
bit of that guacamole,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.010
a little bit of that salsa,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.390
and we also got a whole bag
of habaneros and onions.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.390
(people chattering)

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.990
And finally, a squeeze of lime.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.240
Oh, that's just a
beautiful, beautiful thing.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.023
Wow!

00:08:54.023 --> 00:08:56.380
Your teeth just immediately
slice through the meat.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.020
Yeah, those habaneros have a
little bit of heat to them.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.400
The salsa is excellent.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.920
You've got that creamy guacamole in there.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.234
That's all you need.

00:09:03.234 --> 00:09:06.317
(lively salsa music)

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.503
We've switched now.

00:09:19.503 --> 00:09:21.120
This is the meat with the bone,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.710
so it's just fall-apart bone tender.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.700
Oh, the bone just slips out!

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.683
Look at that.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.060
Oh, it just strings apart.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.339
Just look at that tenderness.

00:09:34.339 --> 00:09:37.339
(people chattering)

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.800
Oh wow, yeah this is another bone.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.190
Oh look, it's just
never-ending excitement.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.780
Okay, I think that's good.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.430
That's a pretty hefty one.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.978
Okay, guacamole.

00:09:51.978 --> 00:09:55.061
(lively salsa music)

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.130
And it's so incredibly good

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.200
with this habanero-onion mixture,

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.260
and it is pretty spicy.

00:10:03.109 --> 00:10:06.109
(people chattering)

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.433
Okay, and finally gotta
have the squeeze, oh.

00:10:13.433 --> 00:10:15.200
(chuckling)

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.551
My fingers are so slippery
that I lost the lime.

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:19.600
(chuckling) Okay.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.250
Finally gotta have the squeeze of lime.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.276
Oh, and that, and that is complete.

00:10:26.276 --> 00:10:28.450
This is a monster right here.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.296
Yeah, this is just insanely delicious.

00:10:32.296 --> 00:10:35.379
(lively salsa music)

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:02.273
(people chattering)

00:11:02.273 --> 00:11:05.606
(mariachi band playing)

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.200
Oh man, I'm feeling a little
disoriented after that,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.630
but people come here with
their entire families just

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.670
to hang out, just to
celebrate and eat lamb.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.989
Okay, I don't think I know how
to find my way out of here.

00:11:25.989 --> 00:11:29.990
(mariachi band playing)

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.670
And I love this environment here.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.150
This is absolutely sensational.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:39.010
Yeah, this place is literally
just Mexican lamb-sanity.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.760
Oh, okay, we gotta move
to the next location.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.090
That's the type of lamb
that when you eat it,

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.810
after you finish eating, you
feel like you've used Chapstick

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:51.770
because there's a layer
of oily fat on your lips.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.900
Oh yeah, that was fatty and
just packed full of flavor.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.740
This town is just a tiny
little sleepy, really like,

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.370
almost like a village,
it's a really small town.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.700
But this place is bumping,
this place is a lamb carnival.

00:12:12.726 --> 00:12:15.650
(chattering)

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.500
We're on our way next to Teotihuacan.

00:12:18.422 --> 00:12:21.005
(upbeat music)

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.380
It's not that hot but the
sun is extremely strong.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.680
I'm gonna lather up on the sunscreen

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.890
and good thing I have my hat.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.040
All right, we're ready.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.720
There's a 70-pesos entrance fee.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.250
It's a massive complex.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.610
There are a number of different pyramids,

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.300
including the Pyramid of the Sun,

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.950
and the Pyramid of the
Moon, and this is the center

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.225
of the powerful and mighty Aztec kingdom.

00:13:04.225 --> 00:13:06.808
(upbeat music)

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.870
We're starting off at
(speaking foreign language),

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.930
which is the Pyramid of the Moon.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.310
And you can see, the
steps are pretty steep.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.860
You can't go all the way
to the top of this one,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.130
but you can go to the first lookout point

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.430
where there's a flat area,
where you can get a nice view

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.830
so I'm gonna start climbing.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.490
It's a good thing I
ate a bunch of Barbacoa

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.405
so I have a bunch of energy.

00:13:33.405 --> 00:13:36.488
(lively salsa music)

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.880
Yeah, those are some
pretty steep steps, ah.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.865
Oh, awesome view up here though.

00:13:49.865 --> 00:13:52.865
(people chattering)

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.507
You would not wanna lose
your footing on those steps.

00:14:02.507 --> 00:14:05.590
(lively salsa music)

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.530
We're walking over now to
the Pyramid of the Sun,

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.070
which is the biggest pyramid here.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.160
It's a massive structure

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.490
and what's awesome about it is

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.890
that you can climb all the way to the top,

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.330
so you can see a bunch of people at top.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.776
Oh, the view from up there
is gonna be fantastic.

00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:23.859
(lively salsa music)

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.380
All right, time to get some exercise.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.040
We happen to be here on a Sunday

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.200
and it's absolutely packed.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.960
So we're having to queue
up to climb the pyramid

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.619
and there are just mobs
of people up there.

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:49.702
(lively salsa music)

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.490
Okay guys, some bad news.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.608
The line is so insanely long
that I'm sure it will take

00:15:01.608 --> 00:15:05.010
about maybe 1 1/2 or two hours
to get all the way to the top

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.730
because this line just snakes around.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.340
It's like an immigration line

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.870
and we're supposed to be
somewhere at 4:00 p.m.,

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.540
but we gotta drive somewhere.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.730
And it's already 2:30
or something like that,

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.890
so we're not gonna be able
to make it to the top.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.150
Just so packed.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.800
I mean, that's our fault
for coming on Sunday,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.700
but this was my only day to come,

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.960
but I'm still happy I came,

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.550
and you can still get amazing views

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.441
just from this first ledge here.

00:15:29.441 --> 00:15:32.441
(people chattering)

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.900
So if you can come on a
non-weekend, or an off-peak time,

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.930
I would definitely recommend it.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.990
Anyway, still worthwhile to visit

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.430
and that Barbacoa.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.010
Oh man, that was the highlight.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.070
That was so unbelievably good.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.670
It's a little bit off the beaten path

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.750
but it's so worth it if you love lamb

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.970
and if you love food.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.670
I'm gonna end this video right now.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.800
We're just gonna drive
into Mexico City from here.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.390
So thank you very much

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.690
