it's not a particularly powerful

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869
it's not a particularly powerful
 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.670
it's not a particularly powerful
restriction on carbon emissions it's the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680
restriction on carbon emissions it's the
 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740
restriction on carbon emissions it's the
position system it is based very much on

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
position system it is based very much on
 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.119
position system it is based very much on
the European Union's emission trading

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
the European Union's emission trading
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.919
the European Union's emission trading
scheme so that's the same it's the same

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
scheme so that's the same it's the same
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.780
scheme so that's the same it's the same
intellectual framework as that which in

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
intellectual framework as that which in
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.370
intellectual framework as that which in
turn was actually very similar to the US

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
turn was actually very similar to the US
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.140
turn was actually very similar to the US
sulfur dioxide trading scheme it was

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150
sulfur dioxide trading scheme it was
 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.740
sulfur dioxide trading scheme it was
introduced in 1990 it applies only to

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
introduced in 1990 it applies only to
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.230
introduced in 1990 it applies only to
electric utilities so I need two very

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240
electric utilities so I need two very
 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.770
electric utilities so I need two very
very large point sources just a bit

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780
very large point sources just a bit
 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.270
very large point sources just a bit
slower oh sure so it applies the this

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280
slower oh sure so it applies the this
 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.140
slower oh sure so it applies the this
applies only to electric utilities and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150
applies only to electric utilities and
 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.290
applies only to electric utilities and
the price on carbon current is very low

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300
the price on carbon current is very low
 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.500
the price on carbon current is very low
so it's about five dollars a ton the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510
so it's about five dollars a ton the
 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.530
so it's about five dollars a ton the
reason primarily for that is that the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540
reason primarily for that is that the
 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.320
reason primarily for that is that the
carbon permits were allocated before the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330
carbon permits were allocated before the
 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.990
carbon permits were allocated before the
recession and Adam and electricity has

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000
recession and Adam and electricity has
 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.540
recession and Adam and electricity has
dropped sharply during the recession and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550
dropped sharply during the recession and
 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.040
dropped sharply during the recession and
therefore the demand for permits is

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050
therefore the demand for permits is
 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.330
therefore the demand for permits is
dropped till you've seen the same thing

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
dropped till you've seen the same thing
 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.340
dropped till you've seen the same thing
in Europe obviously that's a very

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350
in Europe obviously that's a very
 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.670
in Europe obviously that's a very
similar story there the permits will be

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680
similar story there the permits will be
 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.480
similar story there the permits will be
reallocated in a year and a half and so

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490
reallocated in a year and a half and so
 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.000
reallocated in a year and a half and so
maybe in two or three years from now

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010
maybe in two or three years from now
 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.410
maybe in two or three years from now
we'll see a higher price for carbon on

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420
we'll see a higher price for carbon on
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.290
we'll see a higher price for carbon on
this market but right now it's not a

this market but right now it's not a
 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.050
this market but right now it's not a
major factor in the in the decision

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060
major factor in the in the decision
 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.480
major factor in the in the decision
making for utilities however there's a

making for utilities however there's a
 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.750
making for utilities however there's a
general expectation within the US that

general expectation within the US that
 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.320
general expectation within the US that
within 10 years there will be some kind

percentage so X percent of all electric

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.050

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.430
renewable varies from state to state so
 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.100
renewable varies from state to state so
hydro may be renewable in some states

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.110
hydro may be renewable in some states
 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.720
hydro may be renewable in some states
and not in others nuclear may be

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:36.730
and not in others nuclear may be
 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.130
and not in others nuclear may be
renewable in some states and not in

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:38.140
renewable in some states and not in
 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.970
renewable in some states and not in
others okay these these these

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:41.980
others okay these these these
 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.470
others okay these these these
requirements that a certain percentage

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:43.480
requirements that a certain percentage
 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.350
requirements that a certain percentage
be generated renewably is accompanied by

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360
be generated renewably is accompanied by
 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.790
be generated renewably is accompanied by
what's called a renewable energy

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800
what's called a renewable energy
 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.010
what's called a renewable energy
certificate market and as a wreck market

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.020
certificate market and as a wreck market
 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.910
certificate market and as a wreck market
so here's the story behind these if you

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:53.920
so here's the story behind these if you
 

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.210
so here's the story behind these if you
produce one megawatt hour of power using

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:57.220
produce one megawatt hour of power using
 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.890
produce one megawatt hour of power using
say wind or solar or some other

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:58.900
say wind or solar or some other
 

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.610
say wind or solar or some other
acceptable renewable base that generates

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:02.620
acceptable renewable base that generates
 

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.190
acceptable renewable base that generates
a certificate called the rec renewable

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:05.200
a certificate called the rec renewable
 

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.900
a certificate called the rec renewable
energy certificate which just a piece of

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:06.910
energy certificate which just a piece of
 

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.910
energy certificate which just a piece of
paper saying in a 1 megawatt hour power

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:08.920
paper saying in a 1 megawatt hour power
 

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.270
paper saying in a 1 megawatt hour power
was produced using renewable resources

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280
was produced using renewable resources
 

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.820
was produced using renewable resources
if you're a utility then to conform with

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:14.830
if you're a utility then to conform with
 

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.190
if you're a utility then to conform with
this regulation at the end of the year

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:17.200
this regulation at the end of the year
 

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.160
this regulation at the end of the year
you have to present to the regulator a

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.170
you have to present to the regulator a
 

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.870
you have to present to the regulator a
pile of these renewable energy

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:21.880
pile of these renewable energy
 

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.590
pile of these renewable energy
certificates equal to X percent of the

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:25.600
certificates equal to X percent of the
 

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.360
certificates equal to X percent of the
number of megawatt hours that you

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.370
number of megawatt hours that you
 

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.080
number of megawatt hours that you
generated during the year and the

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.090
generated during the year and the
 

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.790

producers of renewable power can sell

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800
producers of renewable power can sell
 

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.980
producers of renewable power can sell
these so if i'm running a wing farm i

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:34.990
these so if i'm running a wing farm i
 

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.510
these so if i'm running a wing farm i
produce the power and i sell the power

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:36.520
produce the power and i sell the power
 

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.150
produce the power and i sell the power
then i also produce renewable energy

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:39.160
then i also produce renewable energy
 

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.770
then i also produce renewable energy
certificates and i sell during your

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:40.780
certificates and i sell during your
 

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.290
certificates and i sell during your
granny's tickets and i'm a get and i'll

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:43.300
granny's tickets and i'm a get and i'll
 

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.030
granny's tickets and i'm a get and i'll
show you some numbers on this as much

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040
show you some numbers on this as much
 

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.460
show you some numbers on this as much
money for the certificates as i do for

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:47.470
money for the certificates as i do for
 

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.650
money for the certificates as i do for
the pound in fact in some cases i get

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:49.660
the pound in fact in some cases i get
 

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.420
the pound in fact in some cases i get
more money for certificates than i do

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:51.430
more money for certificates than i do
 

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.240
more money for certificates than i do
for the power

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:52.250
for the power
 

00:08:52.250 --> 00:09:00.370
for the power
so this is a major factor obligation

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:00.380
so this is a major factor obligation
 

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.290
so this is a major factor obligation
suppliers on the distributor's the

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:02.300
suppliers on the distributor's the
 

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.600
suppliers on the distributor's the
retail distributors so here will be con

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:04.610
retail distributors so here will be con
 

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:11.380
retail distributors so here will be con
it for example who has to do they know

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:11.390
it for example who has to do they know
 

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.660
it for example who has to do they know
the markets a state-specific which comes

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:13.670
the markets a state-specific which comes
 

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.310
the markets a state-specific which comes
back to your earlier question yeah it

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320
back to your earlier question yeah it
 

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.100
back to your earlier question yeah it
markets a state-specific there are some

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.110
markets a state-specific there are some
 

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.620
markets a state-specific there are some
bilateral agreements between states

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:20.630
bilateral agreements between states
 

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.560
bilateral agreements between states
where there are as where there is a big

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:23.570
where there are as where there is a big
 

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.020
where there are as where there is a big
interconnection between the grits but in

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:26.030
interconnection between the grits but in
 

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.850
interconnection between the grits but in
general the markets are state specific

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:27.860
general the markets are state specific
 

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.650
general the markets are state specific
and I'll show you some data on the

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:29.660
and I'll show you some data on the
 

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.580
and I'll show you some data on the
prices and you'll see they're very

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:30.590
prices and you'll see they're very
 

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.570
prices and you'll see they're very
different in different markets so these

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:34.580
different in different markets so these
 

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.370
different in different markets so these
renewable energy certificates basically

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:36.380
renewable energy certificates basically
 

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:41.170
renewable energy certificates basically
are a financial reward for producing non

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:41.180
are a financial reward for producing non
 

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.230
are a financial reward for producing non
non-fossil energy producing non-carbon

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240
non-fossil energy producing non-carbon
 

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.030
non-fossil energy producing non-carbon
energy from non carbon sources and I

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040
energy from non carbon sources and I
 

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.470
energy from non carbon sources and I
think this light synthesis what I've

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480
think this light synthesis what I've
 

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.410
think this light synthesis what I've
said already so this is just an example

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:53.420
said already so this is just an example
 

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.790
said already so this is just an example
of some of the difference some of the

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800
of some of the difference some of the
 

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.320
of some of the difference some of the
different renewable portfolio standards

00:09:59.320 --> 00:09:59.330
different renewable portfolio standards
 

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.360
different renewable portfolio standards
on a state-by-state basis I took this

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:01.370
on a state-by-state basis I took this
 

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.490
on a state-by-state basis I took this
from is a very useful adoption of the

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:03.500
from is a very useful adoption of the
 

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.170
from is a very useful adoption of the
United States energy information agency

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.930
summaries of what these laws are like
state-by-state so I guess review the

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:28.940
state-by-state so I guess review the
 

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.690
state-by-state so I guess review the
first one Arizona Arizona corporate

Arizona have fifteen percent of power

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440
Arizona have fifteen percent of power
 

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:50.340
Arizona have fifteen percent of power
renewable by 2025 California

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:50.350
 
 

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.829
 
thirty-three percent by 2020 so many

00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839
thirty-three percent by 2020 so many
 

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:55.920
thirty-three percent by 2020 so many
point if I difference in each of those

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:55.930
point if I difference in each of those
 

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.630
point if I difference in each of those
states listed there has a different goal

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640
states listed there has a different goal
 

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.790
states listed there has a different goal
and a different timetable for release

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800
and a different timetable for release
 

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.970
and a different timetable for release
realizing that goal

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:01.980
realizing that goal
 

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.040
realizing that goal
so utilities in different states very

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:04.050
so utilities in different states very
 

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.190
so utilities in different states very
very different regulatory regimes but

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200
very different regulatory regimes but
 

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.750
very different regulatory regimes but
what is common is in all of these

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760
what is common is in all of these
 

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.330
what is common is in all of these
context you guys simply get paid as a

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:11.340
context you guys simply get paid as a
 

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.360
context you guys simply get paid as a
power producer you get paid for not

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:14.370
power producer you get paid for not
 

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:23.110
power producer you get paid for not
producing carbon so these are just so

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120
 
 

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.990
 
yes yes yes even Texas occupation here

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000
yes yes yes even Texas occupation here
 

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.550
yes yes yes even Texas occupation here
make sure this is the well there is the

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560
make sure this is the well there is the
 

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.710
make sure this is the well there is the
Texas price so these are the prices of

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720
Texas price so these are the prices of
 

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.290
Texas price so these are the prices of
wrecks renewable energy certificates in

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.300
wrecks renewable energy certificates in
 

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.140
wrecks renewable energy certificates in
various different states over the period

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:39.150
various different states over the period
 

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.300
various different states over the period
so thousand two two two thousand seven I

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:41.310
so thousand two two two thousand seven I
 

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.070
so thousand two two two thousand seven I

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:43.080
mean the point about this graph is quite
 

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.240
mean the point about this graph is quite
simply these are dollars per

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:44.250
simply these are dollars per
 

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.670
simply these are dollars per
megawatt-hour to some recs or as little

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680
megawatt-hour to some recs or as little
 

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.800
megawatt-hour to some recs or as little
as six dollars a megawatt hour somewhere

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:48.810
as six dollars a megawatt hour somewhere
 

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.620
as six dollars a megawatt hour somewhere
as much as fifty dollars a megawatt hour

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:50.630
as much as fifty dollars a megawatt hour
 

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.080
as much as fifty dollars a megawatt hour
and they vary a lot in overtime and they

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.090
and they vary a lot in overtime and they
 

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.870
and they vary a lot in overtime and they
vary a lot across states so this is a

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880
vary a lot across states so this is a
 

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.720
vary a lot across states so this is a
very heterogeneous policy environment

00:11:59.720 --> 00:11:59.730
very heterogeneous policy environment
 

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.960
very heterogeneous policy environment
and if you're a multi-state utility many

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:02.970
and if you're a multi-state utility many
 

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.120
and if you're a multi-state utility many
utilities are multi-state and you have

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:05.130
utilities are multi-state and you have
 

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.260
utilities are multi-state and you have
to reckon with all of these different

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:06.270
to reckon with all of these different
 

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.660
to reckon with all of these different
prices and of course obviously with the

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:08.670
prices and of course obviously with the
 

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.250
prices and of course obviously with the
fluctuations that you may see in these

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260
fluctuations that you may see in these
 

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.090
fluctuations that you may see in these
prices so it's a it's a it's a tricky

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100
prices so it's a it's a it's a tricky
 

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:23.120
prices so it's a it's a it's a tricky
area um Connecticut there was discussion

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.130

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.400
area um Connecticut there was discussion
about removing the restriction and

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:25.410
about removing the restriction and
 

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:26.810
about removing the restriction and
changing the policy which the price

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:26.820
changing the policy which the price
 

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.820
changing the policy which the price
dropped and then it they decided not to

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:28.830
dropped and then it they decided not to
 

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.040

Jersey has a specific market for solar

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:36.960
Jersey has a specific market for solar
 

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.100
Jersey has a specific market for solar
power so new so these these are markets

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:40.110
power so new so these these are markets
 

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.130
power so new so these these are markets
for any kind of renewable in New Jersey

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:43.140
for any kind of renewable in New Jersey
 

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.390
for any kind of renewable in New Jersey
you actually have a market specifically

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:44.400
you actually have a market specifically
 

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.310
you actually have a market specifically
for solar renewable energy certificates

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320
for solar renewable energy certificates
 

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.320
for solar renewable energy certificates
which is why New Jersey has this huge

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:48.330
which is why New Jersey has this huge
 

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.180
which is why New Jersey has this huge
concentration of solar power I was

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:50.190
concentration of solar power I was
 

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.820
concentration of solar power I was
referring to just now and the New Jersey

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:52.830
referring to just now and the New Jersey
 

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.770
referring to just now and the New Jersey
market reached another this period of

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:54.780

wholesale price is about fifty dollars a

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:03.510
wholesale price is about fifty dollars a
 

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:07.370
wholesale price is about fifty dollars a
megawatt out so this is four times the

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:07.380
megawatt out so this is four times the
 

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.800
megawatt out so this is four times the
wholesale price of the power so for

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:09.810
wholesale price of the power so for
 

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.210
wholesale price of the power so for
every megawatt hour you're producing

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.220
every megawatt hour you're producing
 

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.520
every megawatt hour you're producing
you're getting fifty dollars on the

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:13.530
you're getting fifty dollars on the
 

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.440
you're getting fifty dollars on the
market and another 200

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:15.450

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:48.990
well the power company is paying to buy
 

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.410
well the power company is paying to buy
these certificates so the power company

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420
these certificates so the power company
 

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.360
these certificates so the power company
has to be the utility the utility the

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:53.370
has to be the utility the utility the
 

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.090
has to be the utility the utility the

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100
distributor the distributor has to buy
 

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.370
distributor the distributor has to buy
these certificates the cost of the

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:58.380
these certificates the cost of the
 

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.960
these certificates the cost of the
certificates is then incorporated in the

00:13:59.960 --> 00:13:59.970
certificates is then incorporated in the
 

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.000
certificates is then incorporated in the

from state to state there's no arbitrage

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:32.460
from state to state there's no arbitrage
 

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.850
from state to state there's no arbitrage
No basically there is no arbitrage no

yeah the u.s. the grid in the u.s. is

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800
yeah the u.s. the grid in the u.s. is
 

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.670
yeah the u.s. the grid in the u.s. is
not the national grid does not have the

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680
not the national grid does not have the
 

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.130
not the national grid does not have the
ability to shift power across large

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:46.140
ability to shift power across large
 

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:53.740
ability to shift power across large
distances at peak times

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:53.750
 
 

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.910
 
it's probably the u.s. is a less

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920
it's probably the u.s. is a less
 

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:01.570
it's probably the u.s. is a less
connected group than Europe Patrick oh

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:01.580
 
 

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.860
 
right yes if you think what do you think

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:03.870
right yes if you think what do you think
 

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.450
right yes if you think what do you think
of states as countries it's very similar

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:05.460
of states as countries it's very similar
 

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:16.190
of states as countries it's very similar
yes yeah absolutely yeah yeah that's

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:16.200
yes yeah absolutely yeah yeah that's
 

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.180
yes yeah absolutely yeah yeah that's
right and there's not even there's

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:17.190
right and there's not even there's
 

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.590
right and there's not even there's
nothing like that in the u.s. there's no

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600
nothing like that in the u.s. there's no
 

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.060
nothing like that in the u.s. there's no
general agreement of the u.s. yeah and

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.070
general agreement of the u.s. yeah and
 

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.530
general agreement of the u.s. yeah and
that's right i think that the the euro

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540
that's right i think that the the euro
 

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.660
that's right i think that the the euro
europe is more interconnected it is more

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:23.670
europe is more interconnected it is more
 

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.040
europe is more interconnected it is more
of a backbone period and there is in the

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.050
of a backbone period and there is in the
 

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:34.040
of a backbone period and there is in the
US yeah yeah the so that when these

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.050
US yeah yeah the so that when these
 

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:36.140
US yeah yeah the so that when these
these the cost of these difficulties is

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:36.150
these the cost of these difficulties is
 

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.940
these the cost of these difficulties is
incorporated in the final price to the

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:37.950
incorporated in the final price to the
 

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:45.650
incorporated in the final price to the
consumer so yeah so so so what's the

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660
consumer so yeah so so so what's the
 

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:50.960
consumer so yeah so so so what's the
question exactly oh I see what part of

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:50.970
question exactly oh I see what part of
 

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:59.200
question exactly oh I see what part of
the invoice Oh of the retail price

00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.210
 
 

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.550
 
probably in some cases as much as twenty

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560
probably in some cases as much as twenty
 

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.220
probably in some cases as much as twenty
five percent of retail price yes is this

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:04.230
five percent of retail price yes is this
 

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.380
five percent of retail price yes is this
not in all cases because the prices are

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:06.390
not in all cases because the prices are
 

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.960
not in all cases because the prices are
so different but but in the in case of

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:08.970
so different but but in the in case of
 

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:13.630
so different but but in the in case of
New Jersey with the solar price yes yes

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:13.640
New Jersey with the solar price yes yes
 

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.650
New Jersey with the solar price yes yes
okay um so in addition to the these

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:18.660
okay um so in addition to the these
 

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.300
okay um so in addition to the these
renewable energy certificates there are

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:20.310
renewable energy certificates there are
 

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.810
renewable energy certificates there are
other incentives to produce non-fossil

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:23.820
other incentives to produce non-fossil

to use non-fossil fuels in the US
 

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.900
to use non-fossil fuels in the US
there's a thing called the production

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:26.910
there's a thing called the production
 

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.660
there's a thing called the production
tax credit available for the generation

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:29.670
tax credit available for the generation
 

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.130
tax credit available for the generation
of renewable energy so for every

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:31.140
of renewable energy so for every
 

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.890
of renewable energy so for every
megawatt hour of renewable energy that

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:33.900
megawatt hour of renewable energy that
 

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.710
megawatt hour of renewable energy that
you produce you can get a tax credit

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720
you produce you can get a tax credit
 

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.780
you produce you can get a tax credit
there are also investment tax credits in

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:38.790
there are also investment tax credits in
 

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.270
there are also investment tax credits in
for every every every kilowatt of

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:41.280
for every every every kilowatt of
 

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.240
for every every every kilowatt of
generating capacity that you build of

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:44.250
generating capacity that you build of
 

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:45.620
generating capacity that you build of
renewable energy you can get a tax

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:45.630
renewable energy you can get a tax
 

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:49.430
renewable energy you can get a tax
credit and so there are in a significant

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440
credit and so there are in a significant
 

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.730
credit and so there are in a significant

certificates forty-two percent so

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:21.629
certificates forty-two percent so
 

00:17:21.629 --> 00:17:22.970
certificates forty-two percent so
basically this guy is not producing

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980
basically this guy is not producing

would like to think that you know

00:17:47.659 --> 00:17:47.669
would like to think that you know
 

00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:49.789
would like to think that you know
cheaper solar panels would increase the

00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799
cheaper solar panels would increase the
 

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:51.619
cheaper solar panels would increase the
profitability but cheaper solar panels

00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:51.629

might increase this from eight percent
 

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.999
might increase this from eight percent
to twelve percent another the make or

is oil followed by gas and coal the u.s.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640
is oil followed by gas and coal the u.s.
 

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.190
is oil followed by gas and coal the u.s.
is completely self-sufficient in coal

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.200
is completely self-sufficient in coal
 

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.980
is completely self-sufficient in coal
it's self sufficient in gas and it

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:56.990
it's self sufficient in gas and it
 

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.810
it's self sufficient in gas and it
produces a lot of oil but it's not

00:18:58.810 --> 00:18:58.820
produces a lot of oil but it's not
 

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.660
produces a lot of oil but it's not
self-sufficient you can see for example

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:01.670
self-sufficient you can see for example
 

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.170
self-sufficient you can see for example
from this that 93% of the coal goes to

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:05.180
from this that 93% of the coal goes to
 

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.420
from this that 93% of the coal goes to
produce electricity but ninety-four

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:07.430
produce electricity but ninety-four
 

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:08.590
produce electricity but ninety-four
percent of the oil goes into

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:08.600
percent of the oil goes into
 

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.960
percent of the oil goes into
transportation so basically oil equals

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:10.970
transportation so basically oil equals
 

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.970
transportation so basically oil equals
transportation co leapers electricity

transportation co leapers electricity
 

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.710
transportation co leapers electricity
and natural gas goes in all possible

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720
and natural gas goes in all possible
 

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.840
and natural gas goes in all possible
directions but no petroleum is used in

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:19.850
directions but no petroleum is used in
 

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.640
directions but no petroleum is used in
producing but virtually no petroleum is

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:21.650
producing but virtually no petroleum is
 

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.620
producing but virtually no petroleum is
used in producing electricity in the US

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:23.630
used in producing electricity in the US
 

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.920

that's where the main argument is

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440
that's where the main argument is
 

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.399
that's where the main argument is
between the EIA the industry and the

engineers at MIT however it's clear that

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:47.530
engineers at MIT however it's clear that
 

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:50.490
engineers at MIT however it's clear that
the US has at least a hundred years of

00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:50.500
the US has at least a hundred years of
 

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.260
the US has at least a hundred years of
gas available at current consumption

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:52.270
gas available at current consumption
 

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:54.690
gas available at current consumption
rates and maybe 200 years of gas

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:54.700
rates and maybe 200 years of gas
 

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.150
rates and maybe 200 years of gas
available at current consumption rates

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:56.160
available at current consumption rates
 

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.099
available at current consumption rates
so the US has hundreds of years of coal

00:34:59.099 --> 00:34:59.109
so the US has hundreds of years of coal
 

00:34:59.109 --> 00:35:02.060
so the US has hundreds of years of coal
and hundreds of years of gas basically

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:02.070
and hundreds of years of gas basically
 

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:04.530

of size of its gas reserves now there's
 

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.300
of size of its gas reserves now there's
been some debate recently about whether

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:24.310
been some debate recently about whether
 

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.940

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:43.720
 
 

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.510
 
Saudi Arabia was producing roughly

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520
Saudi Arabia was producing roughly
 

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.540
Saudi Arabia was producing roughly
10,000 barrels a day 10 so 10 million

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:49.550
10,000 barrels a day 10 so 10 million
 

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:53.380
10,000 barrels a day 10 so 10 million
barrels a day Russia slightly more in

less and everybody else is much much
 

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.950
less and everybody else is much much
smaller so the u.s. is either the second

00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960
smaller so the u.s. is either the second
 

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.450
smaller so the u.s. is either the second
or the third biggest oil producer in the

and then Russia and number in the US and
 

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:09.440
and then Russia and number in the US and
number 2's by

so the US imports about forty-eight

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720
so the US imports about forty-eight
 

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.890
so the US imports about forty-eight
percent of all of the oil used here in

ironically the biggest single source of
oil imports is Venezuela so the US gets

oil imports is Venezuela so the US gets
 

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.900

most of its imports from Venezuela from
 

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:39.680
most of its imports from Venezuela from
Canada and from Mexico us is actually

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:39.690
Canada and from Mexico us is actually
 

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.530
Canada and from Mexico us is actually
not dependent on Middle Eastern oil the

some imports from the North Sea but
 

00:40:53.849 --> 00:40:56.810
some imports from the North Sea but
they're small and then mainly because of

just relatively recently oil was trading
 

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.420
just relatively recently oil was trading
for twenty dollars a barrel that's back

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.250
in the 1990s gone up since then too well
it's gone up actually above this and

it's gone up actually above this and
 

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.680
it's gone up actually above this and
went very sharp spike briefly for about

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:51.690
went very sharp spike briefly for about
 

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:53.510
went very sharp spike briefly for about
one hundred and forty dollars the price

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520
one hundred and forty dollars the price
 

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.630

in other words a big price increases in

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:01.950
in other words a big price increases in

increases were really driven by supply

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:08.190
increases were really driven by supply
 

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.480
increases were really driven by supply
interruptions so this was the

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:10.490
interruptions so this was the
 

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:13.960
interruptions so this was the
arab-israeli war an Arab oil embargo

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:13.970
arab-israeli war an Arab oil embargo
 

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:16.550
arab-israeli war an Arab oil embargo
this was the Iranian Revolution on the

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560
this was the Iranian Revolution on the
 

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.319
this was the Iranian Revolution on the
war between the Iraq and Iran which took

00:42:18.319 --> 00:42:18.329
war between the Iraq and Iran which took
 

00:42:18.329 --> 00:42:20.540
war between the Iraq and Iran which took
both Iraq and Iran's oil off the market

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:20.550
both Iraq and Iran's oil off the market
 

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:22.820
both Iraq and Iran's oil off the market
those were supply interruptions

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:22.830
those were supply interruptions
 

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:25.370
those were supply interruptions
came back down after those interruptions

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.380
came back down after those interruptions
 

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.740
came back down after those interruptions
were taken away what's interesting about

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:27.750
were taken away what's interesting about
 

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:30.140
were taken away what's interesting about
this is there's no supply interruption

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:30.150
this is there's no supply interruption
 

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:33.200
this is there's no supply interruption
behind us this is entirely on the demand

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:33.210
behind us this is entirely on the demand
 

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:36.080
behind us this is entirely on the demand
side what's driving the price up here is

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:36.090
side what's driving the price up here is
 

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.630
side what's driving the price up here is
drawing demand in China drawing demand

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640

general and if you look at war oil

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:42.630
general and if you look at war oil
 

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:44.600
general and if you look at war oil
consumption you'll find that oil

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:44.610
consumption you'll find that oil
 

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:46.990
consumption you'll find that oil
consumption the u.s. is actually flat

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000
consumption the u.s. is actually flat
 

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.070

really quite flat for quite some time

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:49.080
really quite flat for quite some time
 

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.890
really quite flat for quite some time
now in fact there's a generous it's

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:51.900
now in fact there's a generous it's
 

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.510
now in fact there's a generous it's
generally thought that US oil

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520
generally thought that US oil
 

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.940
generally thought that US oil
consumption may have peaked I know the

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:55.950
consumption may have peaked I know the
 

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:57.440
consumption may have peaked I know the
u.s. is moving to more fuel-efficient

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:57.450
u.s. is moving to more fuel-efficient
 

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.330

vehicles slowly but is actually moving
 

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.150
vehicles slowly but is actually moving
that direction the higher price of all

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160
that direction the higher price of all
 

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.500
that direction the higher price of all
these are having an impact in the u.s.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:03.510
these are having an impact in the u.s.
 

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.200
these are having an impact in the u.s.
so us all production or consumption as

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:06.210
so us all production or consumption as
 

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:07.460
so us all production or consumption as
more or less peaked European oil

least in Western Europe so the what is

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:11.730

driving oil demand worldwide now is
entirely in Asia if you look at the

there are the data on this it's flat if
 

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.730
there are the data on this it's flat if
we're outside of Asia but growing

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740
we're outside of Asia but growing
 

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.610
we're outside of Asia but growing
rapidly in Asia China is growing at

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:22.620
rapidly in Asia China is growing at
 

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.460
rapidly in Asia China is growing at
eight percent a year at that stage of

economic development countries have a

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:27.090
economic development countries have a
 

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:28.850
economic development countries have a
very high income elasticity of demand

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:28.860
very high income elasticity of demand
 

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.580
very high income elasticity of demand
for oil so you could see Chinese demand

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:31.590
for oil so you could see Chinese demand
 

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.410
for oil so you could see Chinese demand
for oil growing about fifteen percent to

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.420
for oil growing about fifteen percent to
 

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.930
for oil growing about fifteen percent to
you if your China is now a bigger oil

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:35.940
you if your China is now a bigger oil
 

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.520
you if your China is now a bigger oil
consumer than the bigger energy consumer

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:37.530
consumer than the bigger energy consumer
 

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:38.930
consumer than the bigger energy consumer
in total and a bigger oil consumer than

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940
in total and a bigger oil consumer than
 

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.960
in total and a bigger oil consumer than
the u.s. so it's a big issue so this is

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:41.970
the u.s. so it's a big issue so this is
 

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:44.810
the u.s. so it's a big issue so this is
this is this is probably not a temporary

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:44.820
this is this is probably not a temporary
 

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.270
this is this is probably not a temporary
spike like these here because it's

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280
spike like these here because it's
 

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.710
spike like these here because it's
coming from the demand side rather than

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720
coming from the demand side rather than
 

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.240
coming from the demand side rather than
supply side if there's a big global

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:50.250
supply side if there's a big global
 

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:52.310
supply side if there's a big global
recession will see a drop again but will

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:52.320
recession will see a drop again but will
 

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:58.490
recession will see a drop again but will
pick up again after the recession this

00:43:58.490 --> 00:43:58.500
pick up again after the recession this
 

00:43:58.500 --> 00:43:59.570
pick up again after the recession this
is just what the energy information

00:43:59.570 --> 00:43:59.580
is just what the energy information
 

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:02.300
is just what the energy information
agency again thinks is likely to happen

to other possible scenarios for oil

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380
to other possible scenarios for oil
 

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:09.440
to other possible scenarios for oil
prices in the future the what is

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:09.450
prices in the future the what is
 

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:11.000
prices in the future the what is
interesting about this is that there is

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:11.010
interesting about this is that there is
 

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:14.990
interesting about this is that there is
they did this data here of course refers

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000
they did this data here of course refers
 

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.520

crude oil it is possible to get oil from

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:19.770
crude oil it is possible to get oil from
 

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:22.070
crude oil it is possible to get oil from
other sources so for example in Canada

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:22.080
other sources so for example in Canada
 

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.770

there are the so-called tar sands which

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:24.780
there are the so-called tar sands which
 

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.590
there are the so-called tar sands which
is deposits of oil which occurring in

mine this oil think you have a picture

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:33.450
mine this oil think you have a picture
 

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:36.030
mine this oil think you have a picture
of it somewhere here alright

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.040
of it somewhere here alright
 

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.610
of it somewhere here alright
yes so this is these are tar sands in

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:38.620
yes so this is these are tar sands in
 

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:41.670
yes so this is these are tar sands in
athabasca Canada and this is basically

oil you take the rock out you crush it

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:46.870
oil you take the rock out you crush it
 

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:50.700
oil you take the rock out you crush it
and you heat it and you can liquefy the

and you heat it and you can liquefy the
 

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:52.890
and you heat it and you can liquefy the

you put the oil and water mixture in big

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:54.700
you put the oil and water mixture in big
 

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.850
you put the oil and water mixture in big
ponds and you skim off the oil that's

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:56.860
ponds and you skim off the oil that's
 

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.940

dollars a barrel so you don't invest in

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:04.360
dollars a barrel so you don't invest in
 

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.760

this mr. you think the price of oil is

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:05.770
this mr. you think the price of oil is
 

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:07.560
this mr. you think the price of oil is
going to be high for a long time but

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:07.570
going to be high for a long time but
 

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:08.790
going to be high for a long time but
quite a few big oil companies are now

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800
quite a few big oil companies are now
 

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.910
quite a few big oil companies are now
investing in these tar sands what they

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920
investing in these tar sands what they
 

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.530
investing in these tar sands what they
know this tar sands can produce a lot of

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:13.540
know this tar sands can produce a lot of
 

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.200
know this tar sands can produce a lot of

on South Africa so all oil in South

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:53.350
on South Africa so all oil in South
 

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.620

coal reserves so you can convert coal to

00:45:58.530 --> 00:45:58.540
coal reserves so you can convert coal to
 

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:01.740
coal reserves so you can convert coal to
oil for about ninety dollars a barrel so

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:01.750
oil for about ninety dollars a barrel so
 

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:03.570
oil for about ninety dollars a barrel so
again if the price of oil goes really

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:03.580
again if the price of oil goes really
 

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.550
again if the price of oil goes really
high it's possible that some of those

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:05.560
high it's possible that some of those
 

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.220
high it's possible that some of those
huge reserves of coal that we saw data

you spent a lot of energy to get oil out

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:26.110
you spent a lot of energy to get oil out
 

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:28.080
you spent a lot of energy to get oil out
of tar sands a lot of energy you have to

of tar sands a lot of energy you have to
 

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:30.860
of tar sands a lot of energy you have to
dig then you have to bring the bring the

the oil up you have to crush it you have
 

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:36.210
the oil up you have to crush it you have
to heat it to liquefy it so you're

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:36.220
to heat it to liquefy it so you're
 

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.650
to heat it to liquefy it so you're
spending a lot of energy so that the

would have to pay a surcharge because of
 

00:47:03.569 --> 00:47:07.400
would have to pay a surcharge because of
its higher carbon content and I think

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:07.410
its higher carbon content and I think
 

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:08.690
its higher carbon content and I think
they reckoned the carbon content was

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:08.700
they reckoned the carbon content was
 

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.789
they reckoned the carbon content was

about sixty percent higher than
 

00:47:10.799 --> 00:47:13.130
about sixty percent higher than
conventional oil and that the same in

coal coming into Europe would also have
 

00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:25.509
coal coming into Europe would also have

and it's not expected to turn up again

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:08.660
and it's not expected to turn up again
 

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.989
and it's not expected to turn up again
there's an increasing amount of activity

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:11.999
there's an increasing amount of activity
 

00:48:11.999 --> 00:48:14.719
there's an increasing amount of activity
offshore in the US and that's expected

00:48:14.719 --> 00:48:14.729
offshore in the US and that's expected
 

00:48:14.729 --> 00:48:18.380
offshore in the US and that's expected
to continue but not to generate a huge

an interview some of you an increase in
oil production on shore in the US that's

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:24.210
oil production on shore in the US that's
 

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:26.029
oil production on shore in the US that's
partly because we've been to extract oil

00:48:26.029 --> 00:48:26.039
partly because we've been to extract oil
 

00:48:26.039 --> 00:48:28.279
partly because we've been to extract oil
from shale and there's no way I talked

00:48:28.279 --> 00:48:28.289
from shale and there's no way I talked
 

00:48:28.289 --> 00:48:30.709
from shale and there's no way I talked
about gas from shale earlier on and huge

00:48:30.709 --> 00:48:30.719
about gas from shale earlier on and huge
 

00:48:30.719 --> 00:48:32.809
about gas from shale earlier on and huge
amounts of gas being removed from shale

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:32.819
amounts of gas being removed from shale
 

00:48:32.819 --> 00:48:36.529
amounts of gas being removed from shale
rock so there's also oil in shale the

00:48:36.529 --> 00:48:36.539
rock so there's also oil in shale the
 

00:48:36.539 --> 00:48:38.450
rock so there's also oil in shale the
same techniques as being applied to gas

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:38.460
same techniques as being applied to gas
 

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.579
same techniques as being applied to gas
can be applied to oil as well you can

00:48:40.579 --> 00:48:40.589
can be applied to oil as well you can
 

00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:43.759
can be applied to oil as well you can
hydraulically fracture shale rocks to

00:48:43.759 --> 00:48:43.769
hydraulically fracture shale rocks to
 

00:48:43.769 --> 00:48:46.370
hydraulically fracture shale rocks to
extract oil that's inside of those and

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.380
extract oil that's inside of those and
 

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.890
extract oil that's inside of those and
so we're expecting to see some increase

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:48.900
so we're expecting to see some increase
 

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:53.839
so we're expecting to see some increase
in onshore US production from partly

00:48:53.839 --> 00:48:53.849

so us production expected to be

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:05.380
so us production expected to be
 

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.749
so us production expected to be
somewhere in the region of six million

00:49:06.749 --> 00:49:06.759
somewhere in the region of six million
 

00:49:06.759 --> 00:49:10.849
somewhere in the region of six million
dollars a day maybe somewhat above that

complete data for that wind is

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:22.420
complete data for that wind is
 

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:26.250
complete data for that wind is
economically attractive for onshore wind

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:26.260
economically attractive for onshore wind
 

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.099
economically attractive for onshore wind
in the u.s. the cost is about five to

00:51:29.099 --> 00:51:29.109
in the u.s. the cost is about five to
 

00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:31.200
in the u.s. the cost is about five to
six cents a kilowatt hour that's

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:31.210
six cents a kilowatt hour that's
 

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.300
six cents a kilowatt hour that's
competitive with gas and slightly

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:33.310
competitive with gas and slightly
 

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:36.990
competitive with gas and slightly
cheaper than coal and that's before you

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.000
cheaper than coal and that's before you
 

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.349
cheaper than coal and that's before you
allow for the various incentives that's

allow for investment tax credits or
 

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.650
allow for investment tax credits or
production tax credits so you know with

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:46.660
production tax credits so you know with
 

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.990

all of these things wind can be when can

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000
all of these things wind can be when can
 

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.820
all of these things wind can be when can
make a profit it's not prices as low as

three cents a kilowatt hour or even less
 

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:55.859
three cents a kilowatt hour or even less
than them so wind is competitive in the

00:51:55.859 --> 00:51:55.869
than them so wind is competitive in the
 

00:51:55.869 --> 00:51:58.650
than them so wind is competitive in the
US and you're seeing that's why you're

00:51:58.650 --> 00:51:58.660
US and you're seeing that's why you're
 

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:00.120
US and you're seeing that's why you're
seeing this big build out of wind that

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:00.130
seeing this big build out of wind that
 

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:03.330
seeing this big build out of wind that
we saw a couple of sites back onshore

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:03.340
we saw a couple of sites back onshore

there's when there are plans for power

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:12.760
there's when there are plans for power
 

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.220
there's when there are plans for power

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:21.940
Kennedy family is home and they spent
 

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:23.460
Kennedy family is home and they spent
many years blocking it but they finally

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:23.470
many years blocking it but they finally
 

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:26.400
many years blocking it but they finally
lost so that's going up that should be

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:26.410
lost so that's going up that should be
 

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:28.530
lost so that's going up that should be
operating next year but that will be the

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:28.540
operating next year but that will be the
 

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:29.940
operating next year but that will be the
first offshore and then there's a

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:29.950
first offshore and then there's a
 

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:32.940
first offshore and then there's a
there's a backbone being built an

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:32.950
there's a backbone being built an
 

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:34.830
there's a backbone being built an

50 miles offshore and the idea about the
 

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:41.849
50 miles offshore and the idea about the
ideas that that that we are series of

00:52:41.849 --> 00:52:41.859
ideas that that that we are series of
 

00:52:41.859 --> 00:52:43.680
ideas that that that we are series of
offshore wind power stations will feed

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:43.690
offshore wind power stations will feed
 

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:47.280
offshore wind power stations will feed
power into that backbone and then from

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:47.290
power into that backbone and then from
 

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:49.200
power into that backbone and then from
there into the northern industrial areas

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:49.210
there into the northern industrial areas
 

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:52.200
there into the northern industrial areas
in the Northeast so there are plans for

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:52.210
in the Northeast so there are plans for
 

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:54.270
in the Northeast so there are plans for
wind to assure when to expend quite a

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280
wind to assure when to expend quite a
 

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.340
wind to assure when to expend quite a
lot but this point offshore wind is

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:56.350
lot but this point offshore wind is
 

00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:58.859
lot but this point offshore wind is
expensive related to onshore wind in a

00:52:58.859 --> 00:52:58.869
expensive related to onshore wind in a
 

00:52:58.869 --> 00:53:01.230
expensive related to onshore wind in a
mini capital costs of onshore wind or

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240
mini capital costs of onshore wind or
 

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.730
mini capital costs of onshore wind or
about two thousand dollars a kilowatt at

00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:02.740
about two thousand dollars a kilowatt at
 

00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:05.160
about two thousand dollars a kilowatt at
capacity for the offshore it's more like

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:05.170
capacity for the offshore it's more like
 

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:07.320
capacity for the offshore it's more like
a five thousand dollars and then the

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:07.330
a five thousand dollars and then the
 

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:09.030
a five thousand dollars and then the
offshore wind you get a you know higher

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040
offshore wind you get a you know higher
 

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.160
offshore wind you get a you know higher
capacity factor and you get a higher

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:11.170
capacity factor and you get a higher
 

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:13.710
capacity factor and you get a higher
wind speed and the output goes up with

00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:13.720
wind speed and the output goes up with
 

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.510
wind speed and the output goes up with
the cube of wind speed power goes up

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520
the cube of wind speed power goes up
 

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:16.800
the cube of wind speed power goes up
with the cube of the wind speeds have

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:16.810
with the cube of the wind speeds have
 

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:18.000
with the cube of the wind speeds have
you can double the wind speed it's

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:18.010
you can double the wind speed it's
 

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:21.660
you can double the wind speed it's
obviously very advantageous but at this

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:21.670
obviously very advantageous but at this
 

00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:24.300
obviously very advantageous but at this
point that the u.s. offshore wind is

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:24.310
point that the u.s. offshore wind is
 

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:25.770
point that the u.s. offshore wind is
really a totally Northern European

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:25.780
really a totally Northern European
 

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:30.030
really a totally Northern European
there's nothing here Western ability

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040
there's nothing here Western ability
 

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:34.740
there's nothing here Western ability
years like six cents yep that's pretty

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:34.750
years like six cents yep that's pretty
 

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:39.060
years like six cents yep that's pretty
no that's just raw Yeah right if you

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:39.070
no that's just raw Yeah right if you
 

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:40.650
no that's just raw Yeah right if you
have the forecast so if you if you take

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:40.660
have the forecast so if you if you take
 

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:45.180
have the forecast so if you if you take
the the capital costs and you amortize

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:45.190
the the capital costs and you amortize
 

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:48.890
the the capital costs and you amortize
them over a 30-year life and you assume

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900
them over a 30-year life and you assume
 

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.810
them over a 30-year life and you assume
i think in working that are you some

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:51.820
i think in working that are you some
 

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:53.040
i think in working that are you some
suma thirty-three percent capacity

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:53.050
suma thirty-three percent capacity
 

00:53:53.050 --> 00:54:26.480
suma thirty-three percent capacity
factor let's tell right

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:26.490
 
 

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:29.050
 
no I'm interested so what what capex you

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:29.060
no I'm interested so what what capex you
 

00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:30.950
no I'm interested so what what capex you
would you be pallet wood you'll be

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960
would you be pallet wood you'll be
 

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.080
would you be pallet wood you'll be
paying for a kilowatt of capacity in

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:33.090
paying for a kilowatt of capacity in
 

00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:54.040
paying for a kilowatt of capacity in
Europe my million dollars from megawatt

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:54.050
 
 

00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:56.270
 
so yeah here they reckon it's about a

00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280
so yeah here they reckon it's about a
 

00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:01.390
so yeah here they reckon it's about a
thousand dollars a kilowatt I kill a lot

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:01.400
thousand dollars a kilowatt I kill a lot
 

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:08.090
thousand dollars a kilowatt I kill a lot
yeah yes right right right that's

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:08.100
yeah yes right right right that's
 

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.330
yeah yes right right right that's
speculatively 15 years okay well that

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:11.340
speculatively 15 years okay well that
 

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.410
speculatively 15 years okay well that
would account those two things where I

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420
would account those two things where I
 

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:17.810
would account those two things where I
can't feel a difference yeah okay yeah

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:17.820
can't feel a difference yeah okay yeah
 

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:21.800
can't feel a difference yeah okay yeah
so what most of the wing producers in

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:21.810
so what most of the wing producers in
 

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:23.510
so what most of the wing producers in
the u.s. do is they sign a long-term

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520
the u.s. do is they sign a long-term
 

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.970
the u.s. do is they sign a long-term
contracts with utilities which lock in a

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980
contracts with utilities which lock in a
 

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:32.980
contracts with utilities which lock in a
price for the life of the power station

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:32.990
 
 

00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:34.970
 
yeah the Catholics I mean the camp

00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980
yeah the Catholics I mean the camp
 

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:37.990
yeah the Catholics I mean the camp
causes all Catholics by Sigma D yeah

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000
causes all Catholics by Sigma D yeah
 

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:45.710
causes all Catholics by Sigma D yeah
yeah yeah I don't know what's the oldest

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720
yeah yeah I don't know what's the oldest
 

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.510
yeah yeah I don't know what's the oldest
wind turbine in Europe what's the oldest

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520
wind turbine in Europe what's the oldest
 

00:55:47.520 --> 00:56:00.200
wind turbine in Europe what's the oldest
wind turbine in Europe yeah right yeah

00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:00.210
wind turbine in Europe yeah right yeah
 

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:02.750
wind turbine in Europe yeah right yeah
so the Yemeni calculations that most of

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760
so the Yemeni calculations that most of
 

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.400
so the Yemeni calculations that most of
these numbers I take from this place for

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:04.410
these numbers I take from this place for
 

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:06.920
these numbers I take from this place for
Emeril National Renewable Energy Lab and

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:06.930
Emeril National Renewable Energy Lab and
 

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:09.859
Emeril National Renewable Energy Lab and
they're assuming short 20 to 30 years as

00:56:09.859 --> 00:56:09.869
they're assuming short 20 to 30 years as
 

00:56:09.869 --> 00:56:12.080
they're assuming short 20 to 30 years as
a life span on wind turbines I guess

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:12.090
a life span on wind turbines I guess
 

00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:13.609
a life span on wind turbines I guess
it's an open question whether that's a

00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:13.619
it's an open question whether that's a
 

00:56:13.619 --> 00:56:17.410
it's an open question whether that's a
an optimistic assumption or not and then

00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:17.420
an optimistic assumption or not and then
 

00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:25.310
an optimistic assumption or not and then
yeah okay so anyway this is certainly

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:25.320
yeah okay so anyway this is certainly
 

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.410
yeah okay so anyway this is certainly

it's not competitive at the moment
however what is interesting is that

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:25.150
however what is interesting is that
 

00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:27.150
however what is interesting is that
although this is not competitive with

although this is not competitive with
 

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:29.670
although this is not competitive with
the wholesale market its competitive in

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680
the wholesale market its competitive in
 

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.770
the wholesale market its competitive in
the retail market so in the u.s. you've

00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:31.780
the retail market so in the u.s. you've
 

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.450
the retail market so in the u.s. you've
got a wholesale power market where power

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:33.460
got a wholesale power market where power
 

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:35.490
got a wholesale power market where power
cells are at five six seven cents a

00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:35.500
cells are at five six seven cents a
 

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.260
cells are at five six seven cents a
kilowatt hour and you've got retail

00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:37.270
kilowatt hour and you've got retail
 

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:39.570
kilowatt hour and you've got retail
markets well anyway you and I by our

00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:39.580

power and those are anywhere from twelve

00:59:42.359 --> 00:59:42.369
power and those are anywhere from twelve
 

00:59:42.369 --> 00:59:44.760
power and those are anywhere from twelve
to twenty cents a kilowatt hour and this

00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:44.770
to twenty cents a kilowatt hour and this
 

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:47.460
to twenty cents a kilowatt hour and this
is less than the retail price so what

00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:47.470
is less than the retail price so what
 

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:48.599
is less than the retail price so what
you're seeing is a lot of what's called

00:59:48.599 --> 00:59:48.609
you're seeing is a lot of what's called
 

00:59:48.609 --> 00:59:52.980
you're seeing is a lot of what's called
off-grid solar in the US so a lot of lot

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:52.990
off-grid solar in the US so a lot of lot
 

00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:55.400
off-grid solar in the US so a lot of lot
of operations are putting up solar power

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:55.410
of operations are putting up solar power
 

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:57.720
of operations are putting up solar power
which is at their own expense and

00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:57.730
which is at their own expense and
 

00:59:57.730 --> 01:00:01.020
which is at their own expense and
they're using this to bypass power from

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:01.030
they're using this to bypass power from
 

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.760
they're using this to bypass power from
the grid they're not feeding it into the

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:02.770
the grid they're not feeding it into the
 

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:04.890
the grid they're not feeding it into the
grid and most of the grid in the US

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:04.900
grid and most of the grid in the US
 

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.080
grid and most of the grid in the US
don't take power but they are using it

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:07.090
don't take power but they are using it
 

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:08.970
don't take power but they are using it
to bypass road power at least during the

01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:08.980
to bypass road power at least during the
 

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:11.609
to bypass road power at least during the
daytime so there's a lot of these

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:11.619
daytime so there's a lot of these
 

01:00:11.619 --> 01:00:13.920

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:52.390
attractive and then nuclear there's been
 

01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:54.150

hard to raise capital to fund nuclear

01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:25.360
hard to raise capital to fund nuclear
 

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.940
hard to raise capital to fund nuclear
power stations risky partly because of

01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:26.950
power stations risky partly because of
 

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:29.490
power stations risky partly because of
the overruns and the production costs

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:29.500
the overruns and the production costs
 

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.400
the overruns and the production costs

getting an operational sense so I think

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:36.580
getting an operational sense so I think
 

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.160
getting an operational sense so I think
it's unlikely they'll be any nuclear

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:38.170
it's unlikely they'll be any nuclear

01:04:57.730 --> 01:05:00.580
 
yeah there's some hydro is attractive to

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:00.590
yeah there's some hydro is attractive to
 

01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:04.480

imports a lot of hydro from Canada so we

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:06.650
imports a lot of hydro from Canada so we
 

01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:07.810
imports a lot of hydro from Canada so we
get a lot of power here from hydro

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:07.820
get a lot of power here from hydro
 

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:11.740
get a lot of power here from hydro

not much extinction of hydro so going
 

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:22.120
not much extinction of hydro so going
forward I mean hydro capacity is pretty

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:22.130
forward I mean hydro capacity is pretty
 

01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:24.400
forward I mean hydro capacity is pretty
much maxed out in the US if anything

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:24.410

there's pressure to to reduce hydro

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:27.860
there's pressure to to reduce hydro
 

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:30.190
there's pressure to to reduce hydro
because of the environmental impacts of

actually a court case in which the
 

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.070
actually a court case in which the

Columbia River Authority was ordered to
 

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:48.070
Columbia River Authority was ordered to
remove some dams because of the effect

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:48.080
remove some dams because of the effect
 

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.220

they have on salmon populations which

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:51.230
they have on salmon populations which

the USS a thing called the Endangered
 

01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:58.090
the USS a thing called the Endangered
Species Act which makes it essentially

01:05:58.090 --> 01:05:58.100
Species Act which makes it essentially
 

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:00.640

the survival chances of a species which
 

01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:05.740
the survival chances of a species which
is listed as endangered and gives the

life chances of an endangered species
and so some of the Columbia River dams

01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:14.660
and so some of the Columbia River dams
 

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.350
and so some of the Columbia River dams
may have to be removed because of their

01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:17.360
may have to be removed because of their
 

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.120
may have to be removed because of their
impact on salmon populations and salmon

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:19.130
impact on salmon populations and salmon
 

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:22.090
impact on salmon populations and salmon
migration so it's so maybe you know

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:22.100
migration so it's so maybe you know
 

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:25.120
migration so it's so maybe you know
maybe in river hydro maybe so

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:25.130
maybe in river hydro maybe so
 

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:26.890
maybe in river hydro maybe so
run-of-the-river hydro you may see moral

01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:26.900
run-of-the-river hydro you may see moral
 

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.720
run-of-the-river hydro you may see moral
but big big hydro dams I don't think

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:28.730
but big big hydro dams I don't think
 

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:29.650
but big big hydro dams I don't think
you're going to see any more off in the

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:29.660
you're going to see any more off in the
 

01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:37.120
you're going to see any more off in the
u.s. I know

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:37.130
 
 

01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:41.300
 
yes right yes yes that's right this

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:41.310
yes right yes yes that's right this
 

01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:43.550
yes right yes yes that's right this
nobody ever said that policymakers are

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:43.560
nobody ever said that policymakers are
 

01:06:43.560 --> 01:07:01.010
nobody ever said that policymakers are
rational

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:05.880
 
the amount of what yeah right no the

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:05.890
the amount of what yeah right no the
 

01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:07.470

Environmental Protection Agency right

01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:07.480
Environmental Protection Agency right
 

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.290
Environmental Protection Agency right
now is undertaking a study of the impact

01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:10.300
now is undertaking a study of the impact
 

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:13.349
now is undertaking a study of the impact
of hydraulic fracturing on water and and

01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359
of hydraulic fracturing on water and and
 

01:07:13.359 --> 01:07:14.910
of hydraulic fracturing on water and and
the possibility for recycling the water

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:14.920
the possibility for recycling the water
 

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.520
the possibility for recycling the water
there but at this point we don't really

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:17.530
there but at this point we don't really
 

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:20.310
there but at this point we don't really
have a North aura tative study of how

01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:20.320
have a North aura tative study of how
 

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.290
have a North aura tative study of how
much water can be recycled how much it

01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:22.300
much water can be recycled how much it
 

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:23.700
much water can be recycled how much it
can be cleaned I mean basically you take

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:23.710
can be cleaned I mean basically you take
 

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.410
can be cleaned I mean basically you take
water you put sand into it you put a

01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:25.420
water you put sand into it you put a
 

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:26.970
water you put sand into it you put a
bunch of chemicals into it pump it down

01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:26.980
bunch of chemicals into it pump it down
 

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:29.130
bunch of chemicals into it pump it down
into the into the shale at very high

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:29.140
into the into the shale at very high
 

01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:31.080
into the into the shale at very high
pressure to fracture the stuff and then

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:31.090
pressure to fracture the stuff and then
 

01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:32.970
pressure to fracture the stuff and then
some of that water escapes but some of

01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:32.980
some of that water escapes but some of
 

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:35.370
some of that water escapes but some of
it can be recycled and reused and the

01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:35.380
it can be recycled and reused and the
 

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.020
it can be recycled and reused and the
balance between recycling and escaping

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:37.030
balance between recycling and escaping
 

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:40.890
balance between recycling and escaping
is not clear obviously some has is too

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:40.900
is not clear obviously some has is too
 

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.710
is not clear obviously some has is too
much as escapes historically I don't

01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720
much as escapes historically I don't
 

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.970
much as escapes historically I don't
think they'll ever recycle one hundred

01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:44.980
think they'll ever recycle one hundred
 

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.260
think they'll ever recycle one hundred
percent but I don't know what the upper

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:46.270
percent but I don't know what the upper
 

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.300
percent but I don't know what the upper
limit on the recycling can be in the EPA

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:48.310
limit on the recycling can be in the EPA
 

01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:49.650
limit on the recycling can be in the EPA
