00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.820
hello I'm the nostalgia critic I remember it so you don't have to

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.220
you know I love the Looney Tunes

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.640
who doesn't

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.800
they're funny they're clever, they're unique

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.200
they're absolutely wonderful

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.180
and you wanna know what else? I love

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.900
basketball

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.380
again - who doesn't?

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.260
it's fun, its intense

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.920
it gives you a rush of energy

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.400
it's also absolutely wonderful

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.280
however you want to be sure to keep these two

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.900
elements as faaar away from each other as humanly possible

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.560
because if you don't

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.180
you get fucking Space Jam!

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.200
the worst piece of commercialized half baked horse shit that ever hit the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.400
ok alright I apologize

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.900
I just really hate it when Hollywood

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.640
takes not one but two of the things that I hold so dear to me

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.580
and poisons it with undiluted urine filled backwash that I hate so much

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.040
so

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.960
with that said let's take a look at how these two wonderful

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.060
pastimes got transformed into the cinematic gangrape that lies before us

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.180
first of all

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.300
you might be wondering: how the hell did this idea even come about?

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.700
well in the early 90's Nike had a brilliant marketing plan

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.080
for selling their hottest new item Air Jordans

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.120
obviously they had Jordan on board

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.000
but they needed something else that would be sure to grab all the little kids' attention

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.980
so Nike made a deal with Warner Brothers to throw in characters like Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian into their commercials

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.060
who'd you expect?  Elmer Fudd?

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.160
the ads were a huge hit

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.580
and soon Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan became America's top marketing whores

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.500
sucking dick for Nike, McDonald's, toy mogul's and too many t-shirt companies to count

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.980
grousome, ain't it?

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.320
after this big success the marketing heads at Warner Brothers got an idea:

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.540
what if we turned the commercial into a movie

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.140
thereby turning a movie into a commercial

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.840
thereby producing commercials for commercials

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.240
it's like every advertiser's wet dream of perpetual marketing money making motion machine

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.480
that has the ability to turn shit into gold

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.000
Ah, that's how it goes.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and thus space jam was born

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.600
the first film that was quite literally a commercial for a commercial for a commercial

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.840
but don't worry, they hide that fact very cleverly

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.900
get your hanes on, lace up your Nikes, grab your wheaties and your Gatorade we'll pick up a Big Mac on the way to the ballpark

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.840
subtle

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.560
but still, a movie with two of America's most treasured icons

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.720
was a pretty big deal

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.580
and we knew that the heads of Hollywood

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.840
wouldn't just throw any crap together for their money making prized possessions

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.920
obviously

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.780
so tell us then, what's the story?

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.680
you see these aliens come from outer space

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.060
and they wanna make us slaves

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.200
in their theme park

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.100
so we challenged them to a basketball game

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.120
but then they show up and they ain't so little

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.460
they're huge!

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.500
we need to beat these guys

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.220
cause they're talking about slavery

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440
they're gonna make us do stand up comedy

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.760
the same jokes every night for all eternity

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.480
we're gonna be locked up like wild animals

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.000
and then trotted out to perform for a bunch of low brow

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.880
bug eyed, fat headed, humor challenged, aliens!

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.120
is it too late to get my money back?

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.380
okay so the story Bugs was trying to get across

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.760
starts off with Michael Jordan

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.660
after he dropped out of the NBA

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.780
the first time he dropped out

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.300
we see him during those embarrassing years when he actually took up baseball

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.200
instead of basketball

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.920
and that's not bad writing, that actually happened

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.720
meanwhile we travel to...um...outer space

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.080
where the evil ruler of uh...um...theme park on the moon

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.080
is looking for new attractions

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080
so he sends his aliens to kidnap the Looney Tunes

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.080
who live in...um...the middle of the earth

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.240
where the Looney Tunes retaliate by...um...challenging them to a basketball game

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.040
how many times have we heard that story?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.400
we gotta get new agents,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.380
we're getting screwed

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.580
but before we even get to that

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.940
we have to watch dozens of scenes where Michael Jordan

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.700
is interacting with his family

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.120
well he went two for five

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.940
and lost 32 points in his

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.440
yeah so that puts him at like a 6,85 or something

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500
oh come on can't you get to the looney tunes already?

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.480
what do you think?

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.580
i'm kinda partial to purple and gold myself

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.080
it goes better with my colour

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.520
on second thought go back to the boring family

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.040
whatcha cooking? -chicken

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.440
chicken with what?

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.600
chicken and collard greens

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.500
good

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.320
on second thought go back to the looney tunes

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.540
oh charlie come on

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.220
is the 700 club on?

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.420
I thought you'd never ask

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.260
judging by those clips you may have noticed the first problem with this movie:

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.940
the Looney Tuned aren't funny!

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.280
they're rude, loud and obnoxiously annoying

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.700
but they're certainly not funny

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.960
in fact the writing for this movie is so horrible

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.000
you almost wish the original Looney Tunes from the 50s could sit there and watch it

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.060
I'm a cheerleader

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.380
but mommy, I don't want to go to school today

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.820
boo!

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.580
I...wet myself

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.880
haha very funny

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.880
hahahaha

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.960
the second problem you may have noticed with this movie

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.020
is that Michael Jordan is not funny

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.320
he's dull, boring and incredibly bad actor

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.820
but he's certainly not funny

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.560
in fact I don't even think if he knows he's in a movie

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.220
i think they just followed him around with cameras and then painted some cartoon characters in the background

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.480
Sufferin Succotash

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.940
getting back to the story

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.860
the aliens decide to go back to our world

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.420
and try to get some extra strength

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.760
while there they sit next to the wife from everybody loves Raymond

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.720
and the guy who did the voice for Homer Simpson

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.860
how random

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.780
so the aliens steal all the talent from some of basketball's greatest players

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.340
we're fine; it's just some psychosomatic deal

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.040
or something to do with the moon and alingment of the planet

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.000
wow it looks like they took their acting talent too

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.200
it stinks

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.220
so the aliens become giant monsters which the Looney Tunes can't possibly defeat

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.600
so they get the help of Michael Jordan

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.200
and his wormy little assistant played by Wayne Knight

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.340
who I was surprised to find out is not a cartoon character

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.860
oh yeah? who says?

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.760
so the game is on and all the Looney Tuned join forces

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.920
to stop the evil aliens in a universal Space Jam

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.600
which still sounds strange to me

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.200
I don't know, when I think of Space Jam I think of that stuff they used in Spaceballs

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.340
to block out the radar

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.700
raspberry

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.620
so all your favourites are there for the line up:

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.980
including Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Taz, Elmer, Lola, Tweety, Marvin the...wait a minute!

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.960
who the fuck is Lola?

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.760
oh wait wait wait I remember - from the classic Lola cartoons

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.820
you know with the...and the...

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.020
who the fuck's Lola?

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.880
Lola turns out is a girl bunny they created to bring in more of the female demographic

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.980
unfortunately they didn't really make her fun, silly, goofy or zany

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.520
in fact they didn't give her any personality at all

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.900
they just tried to pose her off as some sort of strange sex symbol

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.900
which is kinda weird

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.440
because she is in fact a rabbit

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.560
she's not a person

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.400
she's a rabbit

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.420
if it was a person maybe it would make a little bit more sense to make her a sex symbol

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.440
but she is in fact a rabbit

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.540
why would anyone wanna fuck a rabbit?

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.680
what sense does that make?

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.240
rabbits aren't sexy, rabbits are food

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.100
I mean look at her

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.380
they dress her in skimpy clothes

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.900
they make her wear short shorts

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.760
oh and here's the biggest insult of all:

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.340
they actually gave her bunny boobies

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.400
bunny boobies!

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.140
I mean what kind of sick twisted pervert actually gives a cartoon character bunny boobies?

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.260
I mean if that ... actually has female genitalia

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.380
what does that mean the other Looney Tunes  characters have?

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.520
we've got balls

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.280
daah stop!

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.000
okay, alright

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.180
let me make one thing perfectly clear

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.340
to all you Warner Brothers representatives out there

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.600
we don't wanna fuck bunnies

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.140
I can't believe I have to say this

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.860
we don't wanna fuck bunnies

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.200
I mean we're people

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.480
therefore we like to fuck other people

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.380
I'm sure there's some small percentage of people out there that like to fuck bunnies but

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.520
there hardly seems like a very profitable demographic

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.740
I mean I put it to you

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.340
have you ever seen a bunny that you actually had the hots for?

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.460
that doesn't count!

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.600
ahahahahaha

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:42.580
okay so aside from promoting bestiality to kids the film also has the worst camera shots in the entire world

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.880
that is to say they're all extreme close ups

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.780
seriously, I feel like all the characters in this movie are about to french me

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.100
these shots are so close I keep thinking the camera's gonna hit them in the face

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.460
like in the opening of Alladin

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.780
too close, a little too close

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.280
so all the Looney Tunes characters:

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.720
Bugs, Duffy,  Taz, Ho and so forth

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.320
pretty much get their animated asses handed to them

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.620
and trust me when I say no one is spared

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.180
dude did they just beat the shit out of Granny?

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.840
they did! They just beat the shit out of Granny!

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.900
they actually tackled, punched and kicked an innocent old lady

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.880
who never harmed anyone in her life

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.080
can I see it again?

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.240
one more time

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.140
oh my god I could watch that forever

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.900
but unfortunately the movie continues

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.180
and  turns out that Michael Jordan

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.240
and his Looney Tunes are actually short one player

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.100
who could they possibly get?

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.400
dun dun dun dun dun dun.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.640
aaa no Bill! what're you doin?

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.740
you still got a career to lose!

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.820
perhaps I can be of some assistance

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.400
go! get out! there's still time!

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.160
look, you made it through Larger than life and you made it through The man who knew too little

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.220
but I just don't think you can survive this

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.720
this is why I was born

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.660
ok I'm gonna give you the name of a director here

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.440
Sofia Coppola

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.060
she's kind of a newcomer but she has a lot of promise

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.700
just just think about it

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.740
very funny

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.340
of course it comes down to a tied game

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.640
and it's up to Michael Jordan to score the final point

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.520
but in a stunning turn of events they actually don't win

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.200
they lose the game

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.360
defying all cinematic conventions

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.020
Michael Jordan finds out that he is an imperfect human being, a fallen hero

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.400
he discovers the burden of responsibility that having such great power requires

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.060
but he also finds that strength comes from the mind and soul

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.340
and not just from athletic accomplishments

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.800
though not the happiest ending,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.840
the film teaches children that even in their darkest moments

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.140
you can always find unity

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.400
in yourself

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:52.400
and that my friend is the essence of all mankind..naah i'm just kidding, he makes the basket and wins

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.580
oooooh

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.980
so the Looney Tunes get Michael back home, give the players back their talent

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.400
and return to being their phenomenally unfunny selves

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.700
But Jordan still has one last thing to settle

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.160
no you know he doesn't play basketball anymore

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.700
you know he probably doesn't even have it anymore guys

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.340
there's only one way to find out

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.860
welcome back, Michaeeel Jordaaaan!

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:25.120
oh I see, it's because of the Looney Tunes that Michael Jordan came back to basketball  Ahahahahahahahaha

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.560
God this movie sucks!

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.820
I mean what were they thinking?

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.300
in what insane asylum could this movie possibly be considered good?

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.320
and you wanna know what the amazing thing is?

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.320
this movie actually had four writers!

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.260
four writers!

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.660
and not one of them knew that they were writing intergalactic pig shit

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.540
i mean can you imagine what the writing section with these four morons was like?

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:54.300
I see aliens. I also see Michael Jordan...being sucked down a golf hole...to win a

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.900
basketball game against Bugs Bunny

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.840
actually that explains a lot

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.260
that's it, we're out of here

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.120
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.420
god, what a bad movie!
