00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.529
If you line up 
the entire text of "Moby Dick,"

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:11.978
which was published in 1851,

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:13.771
into a giant rectangle,

00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:16.776
you may notice some peculiar patterns,

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:18.126
like these words,

00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:21.828
which seem to predict the assassination
of Martin Luther King,

00:00:21.828 --> 00:00:27.548
or these references to the 1997 death
of Princess Di.

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:31.764
So, was Herman Melville a secret prophet?

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:33.317
The answer is no,

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:37.697
and we know that thanks to a mathematical
principle called Ramsey theory.

00:00:37.697 --> 00:00:41.330
It's the reason we can find geometric
shapes in the night sky,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.391
it's why we can know without checking

00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:45.389
that at least two people in London

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:49.672
have exactly the same number 
of hairs on their head,

00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:54.397
and it explains why patterns can be found
in just about any text,

00:00:54.397 --> 00:00:56.646
even Vanilla Ice lyrics.

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:58.939
So what is Ramsey theory?

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:03.417
Simply put, it states that given enough
elements in a set or structure,

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:09.688
some particular interesting pattern
among them is guaranteed to emerge.

00:01:09.688 --> 00:01:13.201
As a simple example, let's look at
what's called the party problem,

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:15.933
a classic illustration of Ramsey theory.

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:19.021
Suppose there are at least six people
at a party.

00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:21.404
Amazingly enough, we can say for sure

00:01:21.404 --> 00:01:25.202
that some group of three of them
either all know each other,

00:01:25.202 --> 00:01:27.455
or have never met before,

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:30.035
without knowing a single thing about them.

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:34.029
We can demonstrate that by graphing
out all the possibilities.

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:35.921
Each point represents a person,

00:01:35.921 --> 00:01:38.919
and a line indicates 
that the pair know each other.

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:44.007
Every pair only has two possibilities:
they either know each other or they don't.

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.099
There are a lot of possibilities,

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:49.640
but every single one has the property 
that we're looking for.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.411
Six is the lowest number of guests
where that's guaranteed to be the case,

00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:57.166
which we can express like this.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.167
Ramsey theory gives us a guarantee

00:01:59.167 --> 00:02:03.225
that such a minimum number exists
for certain patterns,

00:02:03.225 --> 00:02:05.380
but no easy way to find it.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.571
In this case, as the total number
of guests grows higher,

00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:10.848
the combinations get out of control.

00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:15.037
For instance, say you're trying
to find out the minimum size of a party

00:02:15.037 --> 00:02:19.799
where there's a group of five people
who all know each other or all don't.

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.856
Despite five being a small number,

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:24.662
the answer is virtually 
impossible to discover

00:02:24.662 --> 00:02:27.391
through an exhaustive search like this.

00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:30.774
That's because of the sheer 
volume of possibilities.

00:02:30.774 --> 00:02:38.757
A party with 48 guests 
has 2^(1128) possible configurations,

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:41.658
more than the number of atoms 
in the Universe.

00:02:41.658 --> 00:02:43.232
Even with the help of computers,

00:02:43.232 --> 00:02:46.099
the best we know is that the answer
to this question

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.604
is somewhere between 43 and 49 guests.

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:53.064
What this shows us 
is that specific patterns

00:02:53.064 --> 00:02:55.531
with seemingly astronomical odds

00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:58.709
can emerge from a relatively small set.

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.223
And with a very large set,
the possibilities are almost endless.

00:03:03.223 --> 00:03:06.410
Any four stars where no three lie
in a straight line

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.469
will form some quadrilateral shape.

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.458
Expand that to the thousands 
of stars we can see in the sky,

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:16.290
and it's no surprise that we can
find all sorts of familiar shapes,

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.155
and even creatures if we look for them.

00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:22.983
So what are the chances of a text
concealing a prophecy?

00:03:22.983 --> 00:03:25.498
Well, when you factor in 
the number of letters,

00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:28.263
the variety of possible related words,

00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:31.779
and all their abbreviations 
and alternate spellings,

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:33.704
they're pretty high.

00:03:33.704 --> 00:03:35.091
You can try it yourself.

00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:36.503
Just pick a favorite text,

00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:38.115
arrange the letters in a grid,

00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:40.459
and see what you can find.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.439
The mathematician T.S. Motzkin 
once remarked that,

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.421
"while disorder 
is more probable in general,

00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:49.443
complete disorder is impossible."

00:03:49.443 --> 00:03:53.790
The sheer size of the Universe guarantees
that some of its random elements

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.977
will fall into specific arrangements,

00:03:56.977 --> 00:04:01.966
and because we evolved to notice patterns
and pick out signals among the noise,

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:07.210
we are often tempted to find intentional
meaning where there may not be any.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.395
So while we may be awed by hidden messages
in everything from books,

00:04:11.395 --> 00:04:12.817
to pieces of toast,

00:04:12.817 --> 00:04:14.332
to the night sky,

00:04:14.332 --> 00:04:19.380
their real origin 
is usually our own minds.
