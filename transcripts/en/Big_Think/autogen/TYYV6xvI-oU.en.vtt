stuff but I actually find myself kind of

stuff but I actually find myself kind of
 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.030

somewhat intermediate in this in this

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040
somewhat intermediate in this in this
 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.440
somewhat intermediate in this in this
argument and with a little bit of an

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450
argument and with a little bit of an
 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.850
argument and with a little bit of an
urge to push back in both directions

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860
urge to push back in both directions
 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.080

listening to Bob I have a little bit the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090
listening to Bob I have a little bit the
 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.540
listening to Bob I have a little bit the
reaction you know planes crash and we

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550
reaction you know planes crash and we
 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.920
reaction you know planes crash and we
get the aviation industry and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930
get the aviation industry and
 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.870
get the aviation industry and
investigate may explain how there was

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880
investigate may explain how there was
 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.250
investigate may explain how there was
this problem in the guidance system and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.260
this problem in the guidance system and
 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.900
this problem in the guidance system and
there's bit of pilot error in this bit

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910
there's bit of pilot error in this bit
 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.729
there's bit of pilot error in this bit
of this and you know okay well that

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739
of this and you know okay well that
 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:36.930
of this and you know okay well that
makes sense and you guys really are the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940
makes sense and you guys really are the
 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.570
makes sense and you guys really are the
experts if a lot of planes crash and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580
experts if a lot of planes crash and
 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.420
experts if a lot of planes crash and
they keep crashing at a certain point

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430
they keep crashing at a certain point
 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.280
they keep crashing at a certain point
you kind of want to step back and take a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290
you kind of want to step back and take a
 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.380
you kind of want to step back and take a
look at the aviation industry and how

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390
look at the aviation industry and how
 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.490
look at the aviation industry and how
they're approaching it and what the

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500
they're approaching it and what the
 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.680
they're approaching it and what the
paradigm is and I I think we got I think

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690
paradigm is and I I think we got I think
 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.450
paradigm is and I I think we got I think
we're kind of at that point with respect

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460
we're kind of at that point with respect
 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.880
we're kind of at that point with respect
to financial engineering a bit above and

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890
to financial engineering a bit above and
 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.650
to financial engineering a bit above and
I think that's something that's one's

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660
I think that's something that's one's
 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.150
I think that's something that's one's
got to recognize on your side of the

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160
got to recognize on your side of the
 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.670
got to recognize on your side of the
argument on the other side of this I

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680
argument on the other side of this I
 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.220
argument on the other side of this I
think there is this slightly Luddite

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230
think there is this slightly Luddite
 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.180
think there is this slightly Luddite
tendency to suppose that this is all

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190
tendency to suppose that this is all
 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.820
tendency to suppose that this is all
associated with financial engineering

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830
associated with financial engineering

there being a big mess that wasn't about
 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.499
there being a big mess that wasn't about
financial engineering and it wasn't

financial engineering and it wasn't
 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.550
financial engineering and it wasn't
about derivatives there was a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
about derivatives there was a
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.350
about derivatives there was a
traditional financial institution seen

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360
traditional financial institution seen
 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.929

Mac when I was a graduate student bob
 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.920
Mac when I was a graduate student bob
was talking about how if you think about

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930
was talking about how if you think about
 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.920
was talking about how if you think about
it right the government's got a put

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930
it right the government's got a put
 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.859
it right the government's got a put
option with respect to Fannie Mae and

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869
option with respect to Fannie Mae and
 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.410
option with respect to Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac because it's guaranteeing

all the liabilities and somebody ought

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459
all the liabilities and somebody ought
 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.039
all the liabilities and somebody ought
to be valuing that put option rather

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049
to be valuing that put option rather
 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.400

than pretending it doesn't exist but

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410
than pretending it doesn't exist but

than pretending it doesn't exist but
there was for a variety of reasons

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500
there was for a variety of reasons
 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.690
there was for a variety of reasons
financial and the engineers were kept

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700
financial and the engineers were kept
 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.780
financial and the engineers were kept
entirely away from that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790
entirely away from that
 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.160
entirely away from that
exercise and so that put option was

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170
exercise and so that put option was
 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.039
exercise and so that put option was
allowed to grow with very serious

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049
allowed to grow with very serious
 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.309
allowed to grow with very serious
consequences for the ultimate economy so

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319
consequences for the ultimate economy so
 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.380
consequences for the ultimate economy so
I guess where I would hope people would

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390
I guess where I would hope people would
 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.339
I guess where I would hope people would
come down with a sense that financial

come down with a sense that financial
 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.080
come down with a sense that financial

engineering wars too important to leave
to generals and financial engineering is

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370
to generals and financial engineering is
 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.949
to generals and financial engineering is
much too important to leave to finish

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959
much too important to leave to finish
 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.259
much too important to leave to finish
leave only to financial engineers and

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269
leave only to financial engineers and
 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.600
leave only to financial engineers and
that there are going to need to be some

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610
that there are going to need to be some
 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.210
that there are going to need to be some
important paradigmatic changes but at

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220
important paradigmatic changes but at
 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.199
important paradigmatic changes but at
the same time let's not forget that

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209
the same time let's not forget that
 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.390
the same time let's not forget that
there's sort of been greed and fear and

there's sort of been greed and fear and
