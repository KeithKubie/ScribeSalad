Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab this hour talking about [inaudible] bird's lots of words. So once words into your head, once they tickle in there and we've just explained how that happens sort of, then they are, you know, they're always, they're like, well, what if they're not? What would happen if that who that throng that is in your head.

Speaker 2:          00:24          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:27          What if all of that stuff, whatever is in your head suddenly went

Speaker 1:          00:33          get yanked right out of your head. [inaudible] what would be left? Hello. This got us thinking about a very famous time at probably one of the Ted conferences I grew up the study of the brain talk given by an euro anonymous named Jill bolty. Is it bolty or bulte? Bowtie Taylor. Yeah, and all you really need to know is that one morning in December of 1996 Dr. Taylor woke up and she had, she had a headache.

Speaker 3:          00:57          I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye and it was the kind of pain, caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me and then it released me and it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of of pain. And so I thought, okay, I'll just start my normal routine. So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider, which is a full body full exercise machine and I'm jamming away on this thing and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive Claus grasping onto the bar. And I thought, Whoa, I am a weird looking thing. So I get off the machine and I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and now I lost my balance and I'm propped up against the wall and I'm asking myself, what is wrong with me? What is going on? And in that moment, my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side.

Speaker 1:          01:55          In fact, a blood vessel in the left hemisphere of Jill's brain had popped up and that part of your brain was starting to shut down and it was the shutdown that really caught our attention.

Speaker 3:          02:06          In that moment. My brain chatter went totally silent,

Speaker 3:          02:12          just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button. So here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to my, my job, it was gone and I felt lighter in my body. And then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me, hey, having a stroke and we got to get some help. And I'm going, oh, I got a problem, I've got a problem. So it's like, okay, okay, I got a problem. But then I immediately drifted right back out. And I affectionately refer to this space as la La land. But it was, I'm just watching my brain become more and more, uh, I'm incapable of at is Jill both detailer herself. Hi Robert. We actually got her into a studio. Hello Dad. Hello. Cause we wanted to ask you some questions about that moment when her inner voices went away.

Speaker 3:          03:10          So let's, let's talk about brain chatter for a moment in the story that we've told so far, you're still asking yourself questions. Know did that stop it on the morning of the stroke? I was doing this wafting dance between the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere. So language would come back on. But once I got to the emergency room and I passed out, when I woke later that afternoon, I had absolutely no language. Did you know your name? No. Did you know your address? No. Did you know about your summer from 1983 you know like my mom is so and so. Any of them? None of it. I didn't know any of that.

Speaker 1:          03:51          Just imagine she's lying in her bed. Her head is shaved, wrapped in bandages. She's had hours of brain surgeries, got tubes coming out of her mouth, however knows she's lost her career. She's lost her language.

Speaker 3:          04:01          I lost all my memories and yet she says, sitting there in that suddenly wordless space, I had found a peace inside of myself that I had not known before. I had pure silence inside of my mind. Pure silence, pure silence. Hear silence. What you know, not that little voice that that you know. You wake up in the morning and the first thing your brain says is, Oh man, the sun is shining. Well imagine that you don't hear that little voice saying, man, the sun is shining and you just experience the sun and the shining

Speaker 1:          04:37          does. Is this the absence of reflection of any kind? Is it just central intake and

Speaker 3:          04:45          that is exactly what it was. It was. It was all of the present moment. Did you have FOBTs I had joy. I had, I just had joy. I had, I had this magnificent experience of I'm this collection of these beautiful cells. I'm organic. I'm this, this organic entity. You have a period by any chance. You know, I missed that by a few years, but I get a lot of that.

Speaker 1:          05:18          And the other thing that she told us is that lying in that bed with outwards, she says she felt connected to things, to everything in a way that she never had before.

Speaker 3:          05:27          Oh yeah. I lost all definition of myself in relationship to everything in the external world. You mean like you couldn't figure out where you ended [inaudible] how much of that was was about language of little part a lot. I mean, oh, I would say it was huge languages and ongoing information processing. It's the constant reminder I am, this is my name, this is all the data related to me are the my likes and my dislikes. These are my beliefs. I am an individual. I am a single. I'm a solid. I'm separate from you. This is Rudy as this may sound pin all of this on language. We have run into this idea before a couple of seasons ago. Uh, Paul Brock's remember him. Yeah. Neuro-Psychologist trust me about myself. He told me that there is a theory out there which she believes actually that all a person is in the end, like all the personhood of a person, the I or the you of a person. All that is in the end is a story. A story you tell yourself we normally think of when we think about ourselves is really a story. It's the story of what's happened to that body over time. I did not have that portion of my language centers that tells a story. Here he is little Jill, Jill Bolte Taylor, climbing the Harvard ladder through language loves does section cutting up thing. That language was gone. I got to essentially become an infant again.

Speaker 3:          06:58          This is the problem here. What do you mean when you drop out of the ins of yourself or the story of yourself, then you are left. She says that piece, I could argue that that's just stranded. That's stranded in the sunshine with the wind in the now. But I mean it's not like she stayed there. That's to me wouldn't be a dog to her if she had, and as she started to recover, she ran into something kind of interesting, which sounded to me sorta like what? Maybe the rats and the babies go through in the white room. She would have these disparate thoughts and then go back and remissed all out. Like she couldn't bring them together. When, when people would speak to me, I would, I remembered in pictures. So, um, if somebody would ask me, who is the president of the United States of America? This is a huge question. So for the next several hours I'd be pondering president, president, president wants a president.

Speaker 3:          07:59          And then I would get a picture in my mind of a president as a leader, a picture of a specific guy. It's, it was actually, it still flashes into my mind. It's, it's a picture of a, of a silhouette of a male presidential profile. Like maybe the idea of a president basically. So that was our president and then I had to figure out a United States then. So yeah, eventually I come up with this map in my mind, this picture of the United States and like the line drawings. Now she's got this map, she's got the silhouette of a guy and she said, after hours, president United States, President United States. And I was like, oh my God. She still couldn't somehow bring him together. I didn't have the road that I had to travel in order to come up with. Um, I think it was Clinton at the time. Yeah, it was Clinton at the time. No, as Jill starts to get better, this is after eight years of hard work and recovery. And finally the words start to trickle back. And when they did, she says that silence that she loved so much got pushed out. That was one of the sacrifices for me. That was one of the sacrifices. Wow. Oh Wow.

Speaker 1:          09:09          We're doing a, we're doing a language show here a year. The auntie queen of our language. So you're like same Clooney, it's it.

Speaker 3:          09:16          No, no, no, no, no, no. But what I am saying is that in order for us to communicate with language, we pull ourselves away from a different kind of experience. I do believe that there are times when you need to let your, your brain chatter be quiet.

Speaker 1:          09:31          But is it fair to say this is like, please agree or disagree with this statement? I think that words and language and grammar are necessary, but not half as good as wind in my hair as smelling my nose and that old right brain sensual immediacy.

Speaker 3:          09:52          Yeah. You know, if, um, if I had to choose, which is essentially what you're saying, if I had to choose, um, that would be really, really, really tough decision.

Speaker 2:          10:10          [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          10:10          Jill Bolte Taylor is the author of, uh, what's it called? The book my stroke of insight. Yes. Check our website, radiolab.org for any details, and if you subscribe to our podcast, there is a bonus video that goes along with this hour and it's pretty great.
