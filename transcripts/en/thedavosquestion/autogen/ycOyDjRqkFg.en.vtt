hello im sue siski I'm with the
 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.940
hello im sue siski I'm with the
automotive council I represent Ford

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950
automotive council I represent Ford
 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.769
automotive council I represent Ford
Motor Company and one of the things that

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779
Motor Company and one of the things that
 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.009
Motor Company and one of the things that
we've been talking about is the

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019
we've been talking about is the
 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.570
we've been talking about is the
challenges we have about emissions and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580
challenges we have about emissions and
 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.400
challenges we have about emissions and
fuel economy having different standards

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410
fuel economy having different standards
 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.440
fuel economy having different standards
around the world and how we could make

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450
around the world and how we could make
 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.150
around the world and how we could make
that more efficient if we could

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
that more efficient if we could
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.400
that more efficient if we could
standardize that at the same time we

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
standardize that at the same time we
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.720
standardize that at the same time we
know that congestion is going to be a

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
know that congestion is going to be a
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.120
know that congestion is going to be a
big issue so we're looking at how we can

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130
big issue so we're looking at how we can
 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.400
big issue so we're looking at how we can
use interconnectivity to help with

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
use interconnectivity to help with
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.009
use interconnectivity to help with
congestion and look at new models of

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
congestion and look at new models of
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.779
congestion and look at new models of
what we can do for electrification and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789
what we can do for electrification and
 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.580
what we can do for electrification and
other things that could improve both

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
other things that could improve both
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.450
other things that could improve both
congestion and co2 around the world
