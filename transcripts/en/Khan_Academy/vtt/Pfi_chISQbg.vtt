00:00:00.324 --> 00:00:03.670
- [Instructor] A bag has more
green balls than blue balls,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.175
and there is at least one blue ball.

00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:08.721
Let b represent the number of blue balls

00:00:08.721 --> 00:00:12.109
and let g represent the
number of green balls.

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:16.234
Let's compare the
expressions 2b and b plus g.

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:18.079
Which statement is correct?

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:21.554
So they make a bunch of comparisons
between 2b and b plus g.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:23.269
Is it greater than, less than, equal,

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.783
or is there just not
enough information to tell?

00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:27.578
And so like always, pause this video

00:00:27.578 --> 00:00:29.581
and see if you can
figure it out on your own

00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:31.551
before we work through it together.

00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:32.713
Alright, let's work through it together,

00:00:32.713 --> 00:00:35.454
and let's see what information
they are giving us.

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:37.865
So this first sentence they say,

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:41.610
a bag has more green
balls than blue balls.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.896
So we can translate that in math language

00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:46.695
as the number of green balls

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:50.748
is greater than the number of blue balls.

00:00:50.748 --> 00:00:54.425
It also says, there is
at least one blue ball.

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:56.012
So just translating that mathematically,

00:00:56.012 --> 00:01:00.486
we know that b is going to be
greater than or equal to one.

00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:02.941
There is at least one, but maybe more.

00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:05.503
So b is greater than or equal to one.

00:01:05.503 --> 00:01:09.028
So now let's see if we can
somehow manipulate these

00:01:09.028 --> 00:01:11.650
so we can get to some reasonable sense

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.233
of how b plus g compares to 2b.

00:01:15.984 --> 00:01:17.783
Well, there's a bunch of different ways

00:01:17.783 --> 00:01:18.763
that you could approach it.

00:01:18.763 --> 00:01:20.050
And you might find a way to approach it

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.828
that is different than my way.

00:01:22.828 --> 00:01:24.634
But the one that jumps out at me is,

00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:27.273
well, I know that g is greater than b,

00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:29.456
and if I add a b to both sides,

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:32.605
on the left-hand side I'm
gonna have a b plus g,

00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:35.305
and on the right-hand side
I'm gonna have a b plus b.

00:01:35.305 --> 00:01:38.134
And this right over here is 2b.

00:01:38.134 --> 00:01:41.272
So just like that, I know
I can keep the inequality

00:01:41.272 --> 00:01:44.199
if I'm doing the same thing to both sides,

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:47.653
if I'm adding or subtracting
the same thing to both sides.

00:01:47.653 --> 00:01:50.559
And so just from g is greater than b,

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:52.698
if you add b to both sides of that,

00:01:52.698 --> 00:01:54.948
we can deduce that b plus g

00:01:56.288 --> 00:01:59.124
is going to be greater than b plus b,

00:01:59.124 --> 00:02:02.080
or it's just going to be greater than 2b.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.339
And that's all we need to do.

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:05.810
And let's see which of these
choices match up to that.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.227
So let's see, all of these
have 2b on the left-hand side.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:13.149
So we could rewrite this as
2b is less than b plus g,

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.566
and that is that choice right over there.
