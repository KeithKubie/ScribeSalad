Congratulations.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.770
You're on your way to getting
your product in front of users.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.150
&gt;&gt; To prepare for the next lesson on
design sprints, let's take some time to

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.600
make sure you have some basics of user
experience and user interaction down.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.070
You'll hear from experts
about user experience and

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.000
see examples of what to do and
what to avoid.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.690
&gt;&gt; You will also learn
how user experience and

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.140
user interaction fits
into product development.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.620
&gt;&gt; By the end of this lesson,
you'll have the background knowledge and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.210
techniques to dream up flows and
features for your users.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.010
&gt;&gt; Let's get started by hearing
from one of Google's experts.
