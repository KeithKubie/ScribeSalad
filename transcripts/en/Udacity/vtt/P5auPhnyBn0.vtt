00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.370
We have an awesome course planned for you.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.650
&gt;&gt; We're going to facilitate learning and discussion on

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.790
different biological concepts, as well as some social issues.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.520
&gt;&gt; But before we jump in, we want to take a brief moment

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.600
to mention our course expectations for you, as well as give you

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.700
a little orientation on how to interact with us here. Now first

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.230
and foremost this course is going to require a time commitment. So, be prepared.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.490
&gt;&gt; But the joy of online learning means you

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.800
can take the course however you're the most confortable.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.610
&gt;&gt; Hey guys.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.480
What you want to do tonight? Oh, sure. We can do class.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.810
&gt;&gt; no. I'm actually working.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.370
&gt;&gt; This course is 12 lessons long. And each lesson is going to vary in the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.600
time commitment required, and level of difficulty.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.302
And that brings us to our second expectation:

00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:43.608
[CROSSTALK]

00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:44.814
Interactions.

00:00:44.814 --> 00:00:45.720
[SOUND]

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.740
You may think that our lessons are confined to this video screen.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.220
But in reality you can interact with us through this screen too.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.310
&gt;&gt; Stopping to think and answering

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.280
questions can really facilitate future learning.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.030
We want you to click to respond or type in a short response.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.160
&gt;&gt; Now, it's important for you to remember that these interactions are

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.890
not graded. We want you to think of these as learning opportunities.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.970
&gt;&gt; Now, if anything's

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.810
unclear, check out the solution video for help. Or

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.410
you can go back and re-watch videos. For example, we

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.980
might ask who are the coolest genome guides ever?

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.960
Go ahead and pick which answer you think is best.
