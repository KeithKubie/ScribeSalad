00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:03.838
We use the stairs
as a place of just going up,

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:07.050
getting somewhere
or leaving from something

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.635
and not spending any time.

00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:15.683
It’s not a place
that usually artworks are presented.

00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:19.561
This is a space of transition.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.648
I was interested in placing
work there for this reason.

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:26.820
How can a transitional space
become a place of pause?

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.798
So, the movement on the stairs

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:50.385
has a very forward
direction to it.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.136
It's falling forward.

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:56.098
The choreography
goes back and forth

00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:58.435
between this very secure place

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:01.228
to completely falling
down and apart.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.690
Because it has so much to do
with this transferring

00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:07.443
from one place to another
and how it gets articulated.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.280
So every little thing,
even just turning the head,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.823
becomes a movement.

00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:20.248
You hold positions
for a long time,

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:22.958
that makes the physicality
also more fragile.

00:01:25.503 --> 00:01:29.048
Your muscles start weakening
and shaking and all of that.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:32.010
So, you're constantly
dealing with this—

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.223
it's not fear—but

00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:39.725
chance of falling,

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.436
chance of everything
getting destroyed in a way.

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:46.190
Your body, the choreography
the aesthetics and all of that.
