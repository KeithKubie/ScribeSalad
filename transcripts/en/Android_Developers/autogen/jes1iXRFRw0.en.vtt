Roman Nurik hey guys it's Adam Kashia
and over in London we have so today we

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120
and over in London we have so today we
 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.509
and over in London we have so today we
have a special episode dedicated

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519
have a special episode dedicated
 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.880
have a special episode dedicated
entirely to the action bar design

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890
entirely to the action bar design
 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.220
entirely to the action bar design
pattern we unfortunately don't have any

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
pattern we unfortunately don't have any
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.650
pattern we unfortunately don't have any
redesigns to do today or kind of you

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
redesigns to do today or kind of you
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.550
redesigns to do today or kind of you
know we're not going to look at any

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560
know we're not going to look at any
 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.400
know we're not going to look at any
specific apps but we will talk in depth

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
specific apps but we will talk in depth
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.790
specific apps but we will talk in depth
about the action bar so with that I

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
about the action bar so with that I
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.750
about the action bar so with that I
guess we should just jump right in

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760
guess we should just jump right in
 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.859
guess we should just jump right in
because we have a lot of content to go

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
because we have a lot of content to go
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.420
because we have a lot of content to go
through Adam do you wanna kick things

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
through Adam do you wanna kick things
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.639
through Adam do you wanna kick things
off yeah sure so one quick thing before

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649
off yeah sure so one quick thing before
 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.990
off yeah sure so one quick thing before
we get started

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
we get started
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.060
we get started
Nick may potentially be coming through

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
Nick may potentially be coming through
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.860
Nick may potentially be coming through
on one audio channel only so if you've

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
on one audio channel only so if you've
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.540
on one audio channel only so if you've
got one ear but in here maybe switch the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550
got one ear but in here maybe switch the
 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.160
got one ear but in here maybe switch the
other one if you can't hear it in case

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170
other one if you can't hear it in case
 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.500
other one if you can't hear it in case
you can't hear in case UK potentially is

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
you can't hear in case UK potentially is
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.479
you can't hear in case UK potentially is
yes so let's get started we wanted to do

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
yes so let's get started we wanted to do
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.170
yes so let's get started we wanted to do
a deep dive on the action bar today so

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180
a deep dive on the action bar today so
 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.150
a deep dive on the action bar today so
the action bar had a couple of quotes

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
the action bar had a couple of quotes
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.920
the action bar had a couple of quotes
here from the design guide so I'm just

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
here from the design guide so I'm just
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.630
here from the design guide so I'm just
gonna quickly read them out the action

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640
gonna quickly read them out the action
 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580
gonna quickly read them out the action
bar is a dedicated piece of real estate

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
bar is a dedicated piece of real estate
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.110
bar is a dedicated piece of real estate
at the top of each screen that is

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120
at the top of each screen that is
 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.609
at the top of each screen that is
generally persistent throughout the app

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
generally persistent throughout the app
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.500
generally persistent throughout the app
and the second quote which actually

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
and the second quote which actually
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.850
and the second quote which actually
liked better the action bar is one of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860
liked better the action bar is one of
 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.859
liked better the action bar is one of
the most important design elements you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869
the most important design elements you
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.810
the most important design elements you
can implement and will go a long way

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820
can implement and will go a long way
 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.070
can implement and will go a long way
toward making your apps interface

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
toward making your apps interface
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.859
toward making your apps interface
consistent with the core Android apps so

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
consistent with the core Android apps so
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.780
consistent with the core Android apps so
I think you know people ask why should i

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
I think you know people ask why should i
 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.820
I think you know people ask why should i
implement the action bar I'd rather go

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
implement the action bar I'd rather go
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.830
implement the action bar I'd rather go
off and do some other design pattern I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
off and do some other design pattern I
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.810
off and do some other design pattern I
think consistency is just really really

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
think consistency is just really really
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.850
think consistency is just really really
important so that when users pick up

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
important so that when users pick up
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.190
important so that when users pick up
your application they instantly kind of

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
your application they instantly kind of
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.420
your application they instantly kind of
know how to use it because they're so

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
know how to use it because they're so
 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580
know how to use it because they're so
used to the system apps so it's just a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
used to the system apps so it's just a
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.230
used to the system apps so it's just a
really really important design pattern

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
really really important design pattern
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.640
really really important design pattern
if you've been listening to a show and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
if you've been listening to a show and
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.510
if you've been listening to a show and
hopefully you've been looking at the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520
hopefully you've been looking at the
 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.660
hopefully you've been looking at the
design side hopefully you already notice

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670
design side hopefully you already notice
 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.859
design side hopefully you already notice
yeah and the action bar through all of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
yeah and the action bar through all of
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.359
yeah and the action bar through all of
the designs that we've done ourselves

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369
the designs that we've done ourselves
 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.010
the designs that we've done ourselves
we've always included an action bar

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
we've always included an action bar
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.170
we've always included an action bar
there some cases where you know an

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
there some cases where you know an
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.999
there some cases where you know an
action bar it may not be necessarily for

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
action bar it may not be necessarily for
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100
action bar it may not be necessarily for
example Google now does not actually

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
example Google now does not actually
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.780
example Google now does not actually
have an action bar and it's top level

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
have an action bar and it's top level
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.609
have an action bar and it's top level
screen but if you notice you once you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
screen but if you notice you once you
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.230
screen but if you notice you once you
get into the detail screens once you get

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240
get into the detail screens once you get
 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.789
get into the detail screens once you get
it's like the settings screen or or

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
it's like the settings screen or or
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.990
it's like the settings screen or or
things like that there is an action bar

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
things like that there is an action bar
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.240
things like that there is an action bar
so there's some kind of edge cases where

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
so there's some kind of edge cases where
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.649
so there's some kind of edge cases where
you may not need one but almost

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659
you may not need one but almost
 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.810
you may not need one but almost
certainly 99%

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820
certainly 99%
 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.520
certainly 99%
we should include our you know I

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530
we should include our you know I
 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.260
we should include our you know I
consider it's one of those cases of

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270
consider it's one of those cases of
 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.780
consider it's one of those cases of
deviate with purpose like and this is a

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790
deviate with purpose like and this is a
 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.190
deviate with purpose like and this is a
really good reason you probably want to

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200
really good reason you probably want to
 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.610
really good reason you probably want to
be using one definitely alright let's

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620
be using one definitely alright let's
 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.830
be using one definitely alright let's
move along here so the general

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840
move along here so the general
 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.360
move along here so the general
organization again hopefully you're

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370
organization again hopefully you're
 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.590
organization again hopefully you're
familiar with this already but we just

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600
familiar with this already but we just
 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.030
familiar with this already but we just
sort of thought we'd cover it again the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040
sort of thought we'd cover it again the
 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.280
sort of thought we'd cover it again the
basics so on the left portion of the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290
basics so on the left portion of the
 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.930
basics so on the left portion of the
action bar you know you have your

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940
action bar you know you have your
 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.910
action bar you know you have your
navigational elements and then on the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920
navigational elements and then on the
 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.440
navigational elements and then on the
right side the action so it's pretty

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450
right side the action so it's pretty
 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.330
right side the action so it's pretty
clearly split between the two sides I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340
clearly split between the two sides I
 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.010
clearly split between the two sides I
think that's it's a very important

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020
think that's it's a very important
 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.270
think that's it's a very important
pattern to follow this this sort of

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280
pattern to follow this this sort of
 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.920
pattern to follow this this sort of
general layout if you do sort of decide

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930
general layout if you do sort of decide
 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.500
general layout if you do sort of decide
to deviate in some way shape or form you

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510
to deviate in some way shape or form you
 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.270
to deviate in some way shape or form you
should just always keep this in mind and

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280
should just always keep this in mind and
 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.500
should just always keep this in mind and
try and stick to this if you possibly

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510
try and stick to this if you possibly
 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.160
try and stick to this if you possibly
can

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170
can
 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.990
can
yeah and actually one minor comment is I

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000
yeah and actually one minor comment is I
 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.580
yeah and actually one minor comment is I
think in earlier versions of honeycomb

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590
think in earlier versions of honeycomb
 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.250
think in earlier versions of honeycomb
the search button in some apps was

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260
the search button in some apps was
 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.560
the search button in some apps was
actually on the left and then we moved

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570
actually on the left and then we moved
 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.180
actually on the left and then we moved
that over to the right as an action

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190
that over to the right as an action
 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.800
that over to the right as an action
because that was really just a more

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810
because that was really just a more
 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.240
because that was really just a more
common place and we really wanted to

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250
common place and we really wanted to
 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.550
common place and we really wanted to
standardize as search being an action

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560
standardize as search being an action
 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.500
standardize as search being an action
rather than a navigational element it

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510
rather than a navigational element it
 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.699
rather than a navigational element it
can be portrayed to me if you think

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709
can be portrayed to me if you think
 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.199
can be portrayed to me if you think
about it logically you can you can

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209
about it logically you can you can
 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.960
about it logically you can you can
probably argue either way for search but

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970
probably argue either way for search but
 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.479
probably argue either way for search but
certainly the platform convention is to

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489
certainly the platform convention is to
 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.710
certainly the platform convention is to
keep it as an action so we've got a bit

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720
keep it as an action so we've got a bit
 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.120
keep it as an action so we've got a bit
more detail here around the general

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130
more detail here around the general
 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.060
more detail here around the general
organization of the action bar a very

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070
organization of the action bar a very
 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.770
organization of the action bar a very
very important piece the app icons so

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780
very important piece the app icons so
 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.150
very important piece the app icons so
here you've sort of got your branding

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160
here you've sort of got your branding
 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.699
here you've sort of got your branding
their identity and also it gives you

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709
their identity and also it gives you
 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.319
their identity and also it gives you
sort of sense of place with this sort of

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329
sort of sense of place with this sort of
 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.390
sort of sense of place with this sort of
up affordance that shows when you're at

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400
up affordance that shows when you're at
 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.420
up affordance that shows when you're at
the not at the top level screens so

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430
the not at the top level screens so
 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.729
the not at the top level screens so
personally I think people should always

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739
personally I think people should always
 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.380
personally I think people should always
take advantage of the branding piece of

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390
take advantage of the branding piece of
 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.420
take advantage of the branding piece of
this not only because it sort of tells

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430
this not only because it sort of tells
 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.830
this not only because it sort of tells
the user which application they're in

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840
the user which application they're in
 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.560
the user which application they're in
when they're using it but also you know

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570
when they're using it but also you know
 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.940
when they're using it but also you know
if they love the app they're going to

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950
if they love the app they're going to
 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.250
if they love the app they're going to
start to identify that that branding

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260
start to identify that that branding
 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.900
start to identify that that branding
with your application next time they're

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910
with your application next time they're
 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.009
with your application next time they're
flicking through their home screen on

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019
flicking through their home screen on
 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.800
flicking through their home screen on
there there's sort of all apps list

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810
there there's sort of all apps list
 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.780
there there's sort of all apps list
they'll see that icon there there hey I

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790
they'll see that icon there there hey I
 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.250
they'll see that icon there there hey I
haven't used app that happened a while

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260
haven't used app that happened a while
 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.780
haven't used app that happened a while
and I really really like it up and

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790
and I really really like it up and
 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.460
and I really really like it up and
they'll come back to it so I think it's

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470
they'll come back to it so I think it's
 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.440
they'll come back to it so I think it's
just really important sometimes I see

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450
just really important sometimes I see
 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.940
just really important sometimes I see
people do custom implementations or a

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950
people do custom implementations or a
 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.800
people do custom implementations or a
custom kind of action bar but they don't

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810
custom kind of action bar but they don't
 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.449
custom kind of action bar but they don't
include that branding personally I feel

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459
include that branding personally I feel
 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.450
include that branding personally I feel
very strongly that it's important

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460
very strongly that it's important
 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.770
very strongly that it's important
a variation on that I'd like to just

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780
a variation on that I'd like to just
 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.470
a variation on that I'd like to just
mention here is it quite commonly an

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480
mention here is it quite commonly an
 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.210
mention here is it quite commonly an
application might have a single accent

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220
application might have a single accent
 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.950
application might have a single accent
color which you strongly associate with

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960
color which you strongly associate with
 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.960
color which you strongly associate with
that brand so you know dribble all might

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970
that brand so you know dribble all might
 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.690
that brand so you know dribble all might
be pain for example and so forth and so

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700
be pain for example and so forth and so
 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.300
be pain for example and so forth and so
there's also the opportunity to take the

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310
there's also the opportunity to take the
 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.010
there's also the opportunity to take the
accent color as your action bar color

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020
accent color as your action bar color
 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.620
accent color as your action bar color
altogether and in that case I think it

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630
altogether and in that case I think it
 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.210
altogether and in that case I think it
works really really nicely to have a

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220
works really really nicely to have a
 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.880
works really really nicely to have a
differentiated logo from icon so it's

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890
differentiated logo from icon so it's
 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.280
differentiated logo from icon so it's
entirely plausible and absolutely

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290
entirely plausible and absolutely
 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.140
entirely plausible and absolutely
encouraged to have a different like

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150
encouraged to have a different like
 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.700
encouraged to have a different like
launcher icon that you might have in the

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710
launcher icon that you might have in the
 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.440
launcher icon that you might have in the
launch tray then the icon that which

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450
launch tray then the icon that which
 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.180
launch tray then the icon that which
appears in the and the top left of the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190
appears in the and the top left of the
 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.070
appears in the and the top left of the
action bar you might go for inverted

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080
action bar you might go for inverted
 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.900
action bar you might go for inverted
color or maybe you know a single white

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910
color or maybe you know a single white
 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.390
color or maybe you know a single white
and you know simplified version of your

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400
and you know simplified version of your
 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.640
and you know simplified version of your
icon and then use the branding color in

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650
icon and then use the branding color in
 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.620
icon and then use the branding color in
as the actual background of the action

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630
as the actual background of the action
 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.420
as the actual background of the action
bar rather than having it compete for

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430
bar rather than having it compete for
 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.430
bar rather than having it compete for
the same color as long as long as the

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440
the same color as long as long as the
 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.010
the same color as long as long as the
core icon itself is the same as long as

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020
core icon itself is the same as long as
 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.380
core icon itself is the same as long as
the the shapes and the forms are really

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390
the the shapes and the forms are really
 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.790
the the shapes and the forms are really
kind of the same thing as the launcher

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800
kind of the same thing as the launcher
 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.170
kind of the same thing as the launcher
icon you can you can definitely do that

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180
icon you can you can definitely do that
 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.060
icon you can you can definitely do that
and of course the the YouTube app kind

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070
and of course the the YouTube app kind
 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.740
and of course the the YouTube app kind
of does this with it's a it's launcher

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750
of does this with it's a it's launcher
 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.360
of does this with it's a it's launcher
icon being different to the to the

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370
icon being different to the to the
 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.400
icon being different to the to the
action bar app icon up there yeah and

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410
action bar app icon up there yeah and
 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.500
action bar app icon up there yeah and
actually the the I think they use a logo

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510
actually the the I think they use a logo
 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.750
actually the the I think they use a logo
as well so you don't necessarily have to

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760
as well so you don't necessarily have to
 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.670
as well so you don't necessarily have to
use an icon there if you have enough

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680
use an icon there if you have enough
 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.110
use an icon there if you have enough
horizontal space available where you

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120
horizontal space available where you
 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.340
horizontal space available where you
don't need other items like view

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350
don't need other items like view
 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.100
don't need other items like view
controls you can absolutely show a wider

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110
controls you can absolutely show a wider
 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.780
controls you can absolutely show a wider
version that for developers that's

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790
version that for developers that's
 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.210
version that for developers that's
called the Android colon logo for the

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220
called the Android colon logo for the
 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.090
called the Android colon logo for the
action bar but both the icon and the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100
action bar but both the icon and the
 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.470
action bar but both the icon and the
logo those should be sufficient to

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480
logo those should be sufficient to
 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.180
logo those should be sufficient to
convey the brand name now that works

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190
convey the brand name now that works
 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.530
convey the brand name now that works
pretty well so if you have one natural

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540
pretty well so if you have one natural
 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.360
pretty well so if you have one natural
homepage like a newsfeed of thing which

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370
homepage like a newsfeed of thing which
 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.860
homepage like a newsfeed of thing which
is the natural home of the content you

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870
is the natural home of the content you
 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.810
is the natural home of the content you
might want to provide greater branding

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820
might want to provide greater branding
 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.790
might want to provide greater branding
let's say a larger logo which takes up

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800
let's say a larger logo which takes up
 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.830
let's say a larger logo which takes up
more width and on subsequent pages you

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840
more width and on subsequent pages you
 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.630
more width and on subsequent pages you
might want to collapse that back down to

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640
might want to collapse that back down to
 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.030
might want to collapse that back down to
say a square aspect ratio icon which

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040
say a square aspect ratio icon which
 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.370
say a square aspect ratio icon which
will give you more room to display some

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380
will give you more room to display some
 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.960
will give you more room to display some
kind of title information or you can

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970
kind of title information or you can
 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.750
kind of title information or you can
draw exactly and that segues perfectly

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760
draw exactly and that segues perfectly
 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.860
draw exactly and that segues perfectly
into the second part of the action bar

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870
into the second part of the action bar
 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.900
into the second part of the action bar
which is the view control you know it

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910
which is the view control you know it
 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.280
which is the view control you know it
can be used for navigation something

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290
can be used for navigation something
 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.320
can be used for navigation something
like a spinner but also as as Nick

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330
like a spinner but also as as Nick
 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.610
like a spinner but also as as Nick
mentioned it can be used for sort of a

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620
mentioned it can be used for sort of a
 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.190
mentioned it can be used for sort of a
title of the particular screen as well

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200
title of the particular screen as well
 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.720
title of the particular screen as well
the view control also encompasses tabs

the view control also encompasses tabs
 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.120
the view control also encompasses tabs
so in some cases especially on phones

so in some cases especially on phones
 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.100

and we'll talk about this in a bit but

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110
and we'll talk about this in a bit but
 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.320
and we'll talk about this in a bit but
tabs can go in that area but in some

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330
tabs can go in that area but in some
 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.360
tabs can go in that area but in some
cases they actually drop into a second

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370
cases they actually drop into a second
 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.580

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.060
lower area below that action bar is a
stacked version but tab spinner and

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.040
action followed by what we call the
action overflow menu so this is where

than the on-screen affordance yep good

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360

later on to to sort of show how that

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.330
later on to to sort of show how that

works no worries so the other nice thing

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:46.820
works no worries so the other nice thing

about the action bar is it's it's very

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.050
about the action bar is it's it's very
 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.810
about the action bar is it's it's very
good at adapting to different screen

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:49.820
good at adapting to different screen
 

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.790

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.330
the screen it's very very good at
 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.030
the screen it's very very good at
adapting that so it does a few things to

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:55.040
adapting that so it does a few things to
 

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.950
adapting that so it does a few things to
help with the variation in screen sizes

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960
help with the variation in screen sizes
 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.120
help with the variation in screen sizes
and actually I think it's the next slide

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.130
and actually I think it's the next slide
 

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.740
and actually I think it's the next slide
one particular thing that you can do is

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.750
one particular thing that you can do is
 

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.540
one particular thing that you can do is
is engage this mode called split action

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:04.550
is engage this mode called split action
 

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.390
is engage this mode called split action
bar mode and actually from a developer

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:07.400
bar mode and actually from a developer
 

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.730
bar mode and actually from a developer
standpoint it's a it's it's a flag

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:09.740
standpoint it's a it's it's a flag
 

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.409
standpoint it's a it's it's a flag
called split action bar when narrow so

00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:11.419
called split action bar when narrow so
 

00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:13.210
called split action bar when narrow so
it sort of says when the screen width

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:13.220
it sort of says when the screen width

it sort of says when the screen width
gets down to a certain point we're going

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:15.980
gets down to a certain point we're going
 

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.350
gets down to a certain point we're going
to go into this split action bar mode

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360
to go into this split action bar mode
 

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.480
to go into this split action bar mode
instead so in split action bar mode

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:19.490
instead so in split action bar mode
 

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.100

different bars that you can have here

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:22.669
different bars that you can have here
 

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.130
different bars that you can have here
you've got the main action bar at the

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:24.140
you've got the main action bar at the
 

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.800
you've got the main action bar at the
top you've got the top bar which Roman

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:26.810
top you've got the top bar which Roman
 

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.090
top you've got the top bar which Roman
was talking about before is where the

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:28.100
was talking about before is where the
 

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.580
was talking about before is where the
tabs could potentially fall down to and

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:30.590
tabs could potentially fall down to and
 

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.659
tabs could potentially fall down to and
then at the bottom of the screen you've

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:31.669
then at the bottom of the screen you've
 

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:33.700
then at the bottom of the screen you've
got the bottom bar very creatively named

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:33.710
got the bottom bar very creatively named
 

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.219
got the bottom bar very creatively named
here at the bottom bar top bar and

here at the bottom bar top bar and
 

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:38.950
here at the bottom bar top bar and
you'll see that at the bottom bar in the

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:38.960
you'll see that at the bottom bar in the
 

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.360
you'll see that at the bottom bar in the
bottom bar you've got the action items

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:40.370
bottom bar you've got the action items
 

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.159
bottom bar you've got the action items
which have now moved down there along

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:42.169

more points on on this screen you'll

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.030
more points on on this screen you'll
 

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.150
more points on on this screen you'll
notice that the the concept of like

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160
notice that the the concept of like
 

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.400

I wanted to mention was actually on the

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560
I wanted to mention was actually on the
 

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.670
I wanted to mention was actually on the
previous screen not only is the is the

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680
previous screen not only is the is the
 

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.100
previous screen not only is the is the
scalability like the the stretchiness of

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:15.110
scalability like the the stretchiness of
 

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.540
scalability like the the stretchiness of
the action bar important on different

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:16.550
the action bar important on different
 

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.280
the action bar important on different
devices but you'll also notice that on

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:18.290
devices but you'll also notice that on
 

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.380
devices but you'll also notice that on
on tablets the action bar is actually

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:20.390
on tablets the action bar is actually
 

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.480
on tablets the action bar is actually
slightly taller the app icon is

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:22.490
slightly taller the app icon is
 

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.060
slightly taller the app icon is
displayed slightly larger and the action

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.070
displayed slightly larger and the action
 

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.240
displayed slightly larger and the action
bar buttons are slightly wider so an

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:28.250
bar buttons are slightly wider so an
 

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.890
bar buttons are slightly wider so an
action bar button on a phone maybe

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:29.900
action bar button on a phone maybe
 

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.140
action bar button on a phone maybe
something like 56 dips wide

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:32.150
something like 56 dips wide
 

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.480
something like 56 dips wide
how about I think it's about 64 dips and

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:34.490
how about I think it's about 64 dips and
 

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.100
how about I think it's about 64 dips and
then the action bar height I think it's

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:36.110
then the action bar height I think it's
 

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.560
then the action bar height I think it's
something like 48 and then on tablets

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:38.570
something like 48 and then on tablets
 

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.000
something like 48 and then on tablets
it's 56 or something like that

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.010
it's 56 or something like that
 

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.740
it's 56 or something like that
but again this stuff changes you know

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:41.750
but again this stuff changes you know
 

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.260
but again this stuff changes you know
this stuff may change so I'm just using

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:44.270
this stuff may change so I'm just using
 

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.880
this stuff may change so I'm just using
the standard action bar it gives you all

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:45.890
the standard action bar it gives you all
 

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.400
the standard action bar it gives you all
of this for free yeah and if potentially

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:48.410
of this for free yeah and if potentially
 

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.110
of this for free yeah and if potentially
some huge tablet comes out in the future

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:50.120
some huge tablet comes out in the future
 

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.610
some huge tablet comes out in the future
or something like that you know the

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:51.620
or something like that you know the
 

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.750
or something like that you know the
action bar may have a different size

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:52.760
action bar may have a different size
 

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.220
action bar may have a different size
again a different way of formatting but

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:54.230
again a different way of formatting but
 

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.570
again a different way of formatting but
as long as you stick to using the action

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:55.580
as long as you stick to using the action
 

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.580
as long as you stick to using the action
bar your applications should still sort

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:57.590
bar your applications should still sort
 

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.230
bar your applications should still sort
of look and display fine here mom all

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240
of look and display fine here mom all
 

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.090
of look and display fine here mom all
right yep

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:04.100
right yep
 

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.650
right yep
context to action bar Nick you want to

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:05.660
context to action bar Nick you want to
 

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.270
context to action bar Nick you want to
you want to discuss that a little bit

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:07.280
you want to discuss that a little bit
 

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.310
you want to discuss that a little bit
yeah definitely so the conditional

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320
yeah definitely so the conditional
 

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.510
yeah definitely so the conditional
action bar is one of my favorite tricks

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:10.520
action bar is one of my favorite tricks
 

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.120
action bar is one of my favorite tricks
and so it has the ability to track

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.130
and so it has the ability to track
 

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.820
and so it has the ability to track
transform its appearance to give you

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:14.830
transform its appearance to give you
 

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.200
transform its appearance to give you
contextual actions to level what's on

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.210
contextual actions to level what's on
 

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.360
contextual actions to level what's on
screen so in this screenshot here we can

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:19.370
screen so in this screenshot here we can
 

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.340
screen so in this screenshot here we can
see examples of select some text or

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:21.350
see examples of select some text or
 

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.860
see examples of select some text or
selecting an email message and where the

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:23.870
selecting an email message and where the
 

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.410
selecting an email message and where the
same physical spec it's kind of like

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:25.420
same physical spec it's kind of like
 

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.730
same physical spec it's kind of like
animates and rotates around and offers

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:27.740
animates and rotates around and offers
 

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.550
animates and rotates around and offers
alternate alternate actions and the

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560
alternate alternate actions and the
 

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.750
alternate alternate actions and the
contextual action bar really is a

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760
contextual action bar really is a
 

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.270
contextual action bar really is a
first-class citizen like the like the

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:34.280
first-class citizen like the like the
 

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.560
first-class citizen like the like the
standard action bar and you can still do

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:35.570
standard action bar and you can still do
 

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.390
standard action bar and you can still do
things like the split action bar so you

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:37.400
things like the split action bar so you
 

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.370
things like the split action bar so you
know if you have a plethora of options

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:39.380
know if you have a plethora of options
 

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.510
know if you have a plethora of options
that you want to have immediately

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:40.520
that you want to have immediately
 

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.980
that you want to have immediately
available on-screen without having to

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:41.990
available on-screen without having to
 

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.510
available on-screen without having to
dip down into the overflow you can go

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:43.520
dip down into the overflow you can go
 

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.180
dip down into the overflow you can go
into that split mode like the mail app

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:46.190
into that split mode like the mail app
 

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.190
into that split mode like the mail app
is there and show you those things

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200
is there and show you those things
 

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.990
is there and show you those things
immediately and if you want to know more

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000
immediately and if you want to know more
 

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.220
immediately and if you want to know more
about contextual action well we actually

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:51.230
about contextual action well we actually
 

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.930
about contextual action well we actually
did a deep dive on this a couple of

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:52.940
did a deep dive on this a couple of
 

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.670
did a deep dive on this a couple of
couple of months back so you can go back

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680
couple of months back so you can go back
 

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.560
couple of months back so you can go back
through the archives into the video

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:56.570
through the archives into the video
 

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.720
through the archives into the video
messaging that come up yeah and it's

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:58.730
messaging that come up yeah and it's
 

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.040
messaging that come up yeah and it's
worth knowing that generally it's

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.050
worth knowing that generally it's
 

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.590
worth knowing that generally it's
engaged by long-pressing on a particular

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600
engaged by long-pressing on a particular
 

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.360
engaged by long-pressing on a particular
element of the screen so in this example

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:04.370
element of the screen so in this example
 

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.190
element of the screen so in this example
I think we have browser and then Gmail

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.200
I think we have browser and then Gmail
 

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.670
I think we have browser and then Gmail
email in some cases though there can be

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680
email in some cases though there can be
 

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.590
email in some cases though there can be
a UI element that you could touch upon

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600
a UI element that you could touch upon
 

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.170
a UI element that you could touch upon
to engage it so in this case in Gmail

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:14.180
to engage it so in this case in Gmail
 

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.180
to engage it so in this case in Gmail
it's a it's a checkbox that you could

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:16.190
it's a it's a checkbox that you could
 

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.680
it's a it's a checkbox that you could
touch that checkbox and the contextual

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:17.690
touch that checkbox and the contextual
 

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.960
touch that checkbox and the contextual
action bar triggers at that point the

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:19.970
action bar triggers at that point the
 

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:20.800
action bar triggers at that point the
other important thing to note about

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:20.810
other important thing to note about
 

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.210
other important thing to note about
contextual action bars is that

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:22.220
contextual action bars is that
 

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.280
contextual action bars is that
conceptually and just logically they're

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:24.290
conceptually and just logically they're
 

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.290
conceptually and just logically they're
they're a mode right so when you select

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:26.300
they're a mode right so when you select
 

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.790
they're a mode right so when you select
something you're basically entering into

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800
something you're basically entering into
 

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.860
something you're basically entering into
a UI mode and that mode is you know

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:29.870
a UI mode and that mode is you know
 

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.230
a UI mode and that mode is you know
something is selected so what happens is

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240
something is selected so what happens is
 

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.180
something is selected so what happens is
you know the the context of the screen

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:34.190
you know the the context of the screen
 

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.920
you know the the context of the screen
you know the the layout of the screen

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:35.930
you know the the layout of the screen
 

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.380
you know the the layout of the screen
doesn't really change like for example

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:38.390
doesn't really change like for example
 

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.120
doesn't really change like for example
in Gmail's case the list items are still

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.130
in Gmail's case the list items are still
 

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.430
in Gmail's case the list items are still
there but the action bar basically kind

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.440
there but the action bar basically kind
 

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.150
there but the action bar basically kind
of like that

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160
of like that
 

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.550
of like that
chrome around the content changes to

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560
chrome around the content changes to
 

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.309
chrome around the content changes to
reflect what mode you're in and then

00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:48.319
reflect what mode you're in and then
 

00:11:48.319 --> 00:11:49.930
reflect what mode you're in and then
once you kind of cancel out of that mode

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:49.940
once you kind of cancel out of that mode
 

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.730
once you kind of cancel out of that mode
by either pressing the back button or

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:51.740
by either pressing the back button or
 

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.889
by either pressing the back button or
pressing the the check mark and in the

00:11:53.889 --> 00:11:53.899
pressing the the check mark and in the
 

00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:57.009
pressing the the check mark and in the
top left that and that cancels the mode

00:11:57.009 --> 00:11:57.019
top left that and that cancels the mode
 

00:11:57.019 --> 00:11:58.780
top left that and that cancels the mode
that exits the mode and then you're back

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:58.790
that exits the mode and then you're back
 

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.550
that exits the mode and then you're back
to kind of what the screen normally was

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560
to kind of what the screen normally was
 

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:07.379
to kind of what the screen normally was
so just think of it as a UI mode almost

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:07.389
 

00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:09.850
so moving on to the second portion of

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:09.860
so moving on to the second portion of
 

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:10.809
so moving on to the second portion of
the action bar that were talking about

00:12:10.809 --> 00:12:10.819
the action bar that were talking about
 

00:12:10.819 --> 00:12:13.059
the action bar that were talking about
the view controls so one possible option

00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:13.069
the view controls so one possible option
 

00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:14.379
the view controls so one possible option
to show there in the view control

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:14.389
to show there in the view control
 

00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:16.389
to show there in the view control
section are tabs and there's sort of two

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399
section are tabs and there's sort of two
 

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:18.189
section are tabs and there's sort of two
main categories of tabs there's fixed

00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:18.199
main categories of tabs there's fixed
 

00:12:18.199 --> 00:12:20.019
main categories of tabs there's fixed
tabs and scrollable tabs and there's a

00:12:20.019 --> 00:12:20.029
tabs and scrollable tabs and there's a
 

00:12:20.029 --> 00:12:21.369
tabs and scrollable tabs and there's a
couple of examples there on the slides

00:12:21.369 --> 00:12:21.379
couple of examples there on the slides
 

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:23.740
couple of examples there on the slides
that you can see I personally really

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:23.750
that you can see I personally really
 

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.420
that you can see I personally really
like fixed tabs you know where they're

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:25.430
like fixed tabs you know where they're
 

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.160
like fixed tabs you know where they're
appropriate just because it's really

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:27.170
appropriate just because it's really
 

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.540
appropriate just because it's really
really quick and easy to flip between

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:28.550
really quick and easy to flip between
 

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.269
really quick and easy to flip between
the different views obviously they're

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279
the different views obviously they're
 

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:32.590
the different views obviously they're
only appropriate when you've got maybe

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:32.600
only appropriate when you've got maybe
 

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.629
only appropriate when you've got maybe
two three maybe four items

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639
two three maybe four items
 

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:36.280
two three maybe four items
sorry different views that you want to

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:36.290
sorry different views that you want to
 

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.490
sorry different views that you want to
flip between and obviously you should

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:39.500
flip between and obviously you should
 

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.559
flip between and obviously you should
always enable swipe to navigate between

00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:41.569
always enable swipe to navigate between
 

00:12:41.569 --> 00:12:44.259
always enable swipe to navigate between
those different tabs then you've also

00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:44.269
those different tabs then you've also
 

00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:46.660
those different tabs then you've also
got scrollable tabs where you could

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:46.670
got scrollable tabs where you could
 

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.340
got scrollable tabs where you could
potentially have any number of different

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:48.350
potentially have any number of different
 

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.439
potentially have any number of different
views that you're switching between it

00:12:50.439 --> 00:12:50.449
views that you're switching between it
 

00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:52.059
views that you're switching between it
could be a known number but larger

00:12:52.059 --> 00:12:52.069
could be a known number but larger
 

00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:54.009
could be a known number but larger
number than say the four three or four

00:12:54.009 --> 00:12:54.019
number than say the four three or four
 

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:56.319
number than say the four three or four
that fixed tab support or it could be an

00:12:56.319 --> 00:12:56.329
that fixed tab support or it could be an
 

00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:57.670
that fixed tab support or it could be an
unknown number that you don't know how

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680
unknown number that you don't know how
 

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.040
unknown number that you don't know how
many sort of gonna trail off there so

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.050
many sort of gonna trail off there so
 

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.420
many sort of gonna trail off there so
here's an example from a Play Store yeah

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:04.430
here's an example from a Play Store yeah
 

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.340
here's an example from a Play Store yeah
so one thing to note is that if you're a

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:06.350
so one thing to note is that if you're a
 

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.259
so one thing to note is that if you're a
developer and you're trying to implement

00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:08.269
developer and you're trying to implement
 

00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:09.999
developer and you're trying to implement
this it's actually called a pager title

00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:10.009
this it's actually called a pager title
 

00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:11.650
this it's actually called a pager title
strip it's a little kind of a misnomer

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:11.660
strip it's a little kind of a misnomer
 

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.420
strip it's a little kind of a misnomer
we call them scrollable tabs in the

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:13.430
we call them scrollable tabs in the
 

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.179
we call them scrollable tabs in the
design side because logically and from

00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:16.189
design side because logically and from
 

00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:17.559
design side because logically and from
from a kind of a mental model

00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:17.569
from a kind of a mental model
 

00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:19.569
from a kind of a mental model
perspective they they serve the same

00:13:19.569 --> 00:13:19.579
perspective they they serve the same
 

00:13:19.579 --> 00:13:21.160
perspective they they serve the same
purpose as tabs it's just like from an

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:21.170
purpose as tabs it's just like from an
 

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.269
purpose as tabs it's just like from an
interaction standpoint they're slightly

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:22.279
interaction standpoint they're slightly
 

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:24.579
interaction standpoint they're slightly
different so one of the key differences

00:13:24.579 --> 00:13:24.589
different so one of the key differences
 

00:13:24.589 --> 00:13:25.960
different so one of the key differences
is that you know you don't see them all

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:25.970
is that you know you don't see them all
 

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.629
is that you know you don't see them all
at once and they're slightly thinner so

00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639
at once and they're slightly thinner so
 

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:29.889
at once and they're slightly thinner so
they're not really a touch target

00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:29.899
they're not really a touch target
 

00:13:29.899 --> 00:13:32.079
they're not really a touch target
they're really more an indicator but

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:32.089
they're really more an indicator but
 

00:13:32.089 --> 00:13:33.370
they're really more an indicator but
usually they're they are coupled with

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:33.380
usually they're they are coupled with
 

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.769
usually they're they are coupled with
touch so in case the user touch does

00:13:35.769 --> 00:13:35.779
touch so in case the user touch does
 

00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:37.809
touch so in case the user touch does
touch that area you know that indicates

00:13:37.809 --> 00:13:37.819
touch that area you know that indicates
 

00:13:37.819 --> 00:13:39.850
touch that area you know that indicates
the next page is a previous page you

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:39.860
the next page is a previous page you
 

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.290
the next page is a previous page you
should still kind of swipe over or

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:41.300
should still kind of swipe over or
 

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.059
should still kind of swipe over or
switch over yeah and in terms of how it

00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:43.069
switch over yeah and in terms of how it
 

00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:45.009
switch over yeah and in terms of how it
fits in with the action bar you know in

00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:45.019
fits in with the action bar you know in
 

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:47.829
fits in with the action bar you know in
that split action bar mode these fixed

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839
that split action bar mode these fixed
 

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:49.210
that split action bar mode these fixed
tabs will actually take up the whole

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:49.220
tabs will actually take up the whole
 

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.100
tabs will actually take up the whole
width below the main action bar and so

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:51.110
width below the main action bar and so
 

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.840
width below the main action bar and so
all the scroll tabs but when there's

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:52.850
all the scroll tabs but when there's
 

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:54.830
all the scroll tabs but when there's
more room for example in a lance

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:54.840
more room for example in a lance
 

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.320
more room for example in a lance
mode or on a tablet those fixed tabs can

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:57.330
mode or on a tablet those fixed tabs can
 

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:58.760
mode or on a tablet those fixed tabs can
actually fall in line with the main

00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:58.770
actually fall in line with the main
 

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.440
actually fall in line with the main
action bar whereas the scrollable tabs

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:00.450
action bar whereas the scrollable tabs
 

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.240
action bar whereas the scrollable tabs
really need to take up the entire width

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:02.250
really need to take up the entire width
 

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.120
really need to take up the entire width
of the screen and then another option

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:05.130
of the screen and then another option
 

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.100
of the screen and then another option
when we're talking about the different

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:07.110
when we're talking about the different
 

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.840
when we're talking about the different
bars you can have so you can have your

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:08.850
bars you can have so you can have your
 

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.430
bars you can have so you can have your
main action bar your top bar and a

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440
main action bar your top bar and a
 

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.590
main action bar your top bar and a
bottom bar it's in some cases having a

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600
bottom bar it's in some cases having a
 

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.480
bottom bar it's in some cases having a
top action bar as well as the the

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:14.490
top action bar as well as the the
 

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.130
top action bar as well as the the
stacked tab bar doesn't add anything so

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:16.140
stacked tab bar doesn't add anything so
 

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.750
stacked tab bar doesn't add anything so
it's entirely valid to hide the top

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760
it's entirely valid to hide the top
 

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.100
it's entirely valid to hide the top
action but it's not really add anything

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:19.110
action but it's not really add anything
 

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.870
action but it's not really add anything
to your design and you want to free up

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880
to your design and you want to free up
 

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.370
to your design and you want to free up
some more content area of your apps if

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380
some more content area of your apps if
 

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.600
some more content area of your apps if
you take a look at for example at the

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:23.610
you take a look at for example at the
 

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.070
you take a look at for example at the
dialer application or contacts

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:25.080
dialer application or contacts
 

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.190
dialer application or contacts
applications and that ship with ICS the

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:28.200
applications and that ship with ICS the
 

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.570
applications and that ship with ICS the
personal devices you can see there

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:29.580
personal devices you can see there
 

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.920
personal devices you can see there
they've hidden the top action managers

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:30.930
they've hidden the top action managers
 

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.840
they've hidden the top action managers
have the free fixed tabs right at the

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:32.850
have the free fixed tabs right at the
 

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.330
have the free fixed tabs right at the
top to free up some room another example

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:35.340
top to free up some room another example
 

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.120
top to free up some room another example
of that from the third-party space is a

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.130
of that from the third-party space is a
 

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.010
of that from the third-party space is a
Pinterest and I wouldn't say that they

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:40.020
Pinterest and I wouldn't say that they
 

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.800
Pinterest and I wouldn't say that they
exactly use tabs I mean they look and

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:42.810
exactly use tabs I mean they look and
 

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.270
exactly use tabs I mean they look and
feel like tabs you know you can swipe

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:44.280
feel like tabs you know you can swipe
 

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.790
feel like tabs you know you can swipe
between them and there's you know there

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800
between them and there's you know there
 

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.050
between them and there's you know there
are three of them so they kind of

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:48.060
are three of them so they kind of
 

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.670
are three of them so they kind of
represent tab they're very similar to

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680
represent tab they're very similar to
 

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.620
represent tab they're very similar to
like you know the People app tabs or

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:51.630
like you know the People app tabs or
 

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.260
like you know the People app tabs or
such that's another example so there's

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:54.270
such that's another example so there's
 

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.760
such that's another example so there's
an example of where you know the the

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:55.770
an example of where you know the the
 

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.250
an example of where you know the the
widths aren't equal you know the thus

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260
widths aren't equal you know the thus
 

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.800
widths aren't equal you know the thus
the Home tab on the pincher and the

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:00.810
the Home tab on the pincher and the
 

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.520
the Home tab on the pincher and the
Pinterest app is default selected so

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:04.530
Pinterest app is default selected so
 

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.320
Pinterest app is default selected so
it's it's a slight variation but again

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:06.330
it's it's a slight variation but again
 

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.600
it's it's a slight variation but again
it's a deviation with a purpose they

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:08.610
it's a deviation with a purpose they
 

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.100
it's a deviation with a purpose they
wanted to simplify things I think that

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.110
wanted to simplify things I think that
 

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:15.970
wanted to simplify things I think that
it's a it's a fairly good execution

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:15.980
 

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.009
so moving on view controls you can also

00:15:18.009 --> 00:15:18.019
so moving on view controls you can also
 

00:15:18.019 --> 00:15:20.559
so moving on view controls you can also
have spinners and drawers I don't think

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:20.569
have spinners and drawers I don't think
 

00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:21.519
have spinners and drawers I don't think
we're gonna spend too long in here

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:21.529
we're gonna spend too long in here
 

00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:22.689
we're gonna spend too long in here
because we know there's a lot of

00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:22.699
because we know there's a lot of
 

00:15:22.699 --> 00:15:23.889
because we know there's a lot of
discussion about drawer still and the

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:23.899
discussion about drawer still and the
 

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:25.389
discussion about drawer still and the
the patterns still not finalized on the

00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399
the patterns still not finalized on the
 

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:27.309
the patterns still not finalized on the
design side but just to quickly mention

00:15:27.309 --> 00:15:27.319
design side but just to quickly mention
 

00:15:27.319 --> 00:15:27.759
design side but just to quickly mention
it

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:27.769
it
 

00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:29.920
it
both of them are sort of ways to switch

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:29.930
both of them are sort of ways to switch
 

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.439
both of them are sort of ways to switch
between views a spinner is a drop-down

00:15:32.439 --> 00:15:32.449
between views a spinner is a drop-down
 

00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:35.079
between views a spinner is a drop-down
pop-up kind of dialog that that's that

00:15:35.079 --> 00:15:35.089
pop-up kind of dialog that that's that
 

00:15:35.089 --> 00:15:36.610
pop-up kind of dialog that that's that
drops down from the top of the action

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:36.620
drops down from the top of the action
 

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.439
drops down from the top of the action
bar which allows you to switch between

00:15:38.439 --> 00:15:38.449
bar which allows you to switch between
 

00:15:38.449 --> 00:15:41.079
bar which allows you to switch between
views the navigation drawer slides out

00:15:41.079 --> 00:15:41.089
views the navigation drawer slides out
 

00:15:41.089 --> 00:15:44.800
views the navigation drawer slides out
from the side and the YouTube app is

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:44.810
from the side and the YouTube app is
 

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.069
from the side and the YouTube app is
sort of the main example of how to

00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079
sort of the main example of how to
 

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:49.569
sort of the main example of how to
implement a navigation drawer at this

00:15:49.569 --> 00:15:49.579
implement a navigation drawer at this
 

00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:51.249
implement a navigation drawer at this
point in time I don't know if you guys

00:15:51.249 --> 00:15:51.259
point in time I don't know if you guys
 

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:52.420
point in time I don't know if you guys
want to mention anything more about this

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:52.430
want to mention anything more about this
 

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.559
want to mention anything more about this
we could probably talk about drawers

00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:53.569
we could probably talk about drawers
 

00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:56.110
we could probably talk about drawers
versus spinners for much longer than a

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.120
versus spinners for much longer than a
 

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.300
versus spinners for much longer than a
half note at a high level I'd say just

00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:58.310
half note at a high level I'd say just
 

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.619
half note at a high level I'd say just
you know looking at the different

00:15:59.619 --> 00:15:59.629
you know looking at the different
 

00:15:59.629 --> 00:16:02.319
you know looking at the different
options you know tabs spinner navigation

00:16:02.319 --> 00:16:02.329
options you know tabs spinner navigation
 

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:04.780
options you know tabs spinner navigation
jar when you look at these elements I

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:04.790
jar when you look at these elements I
 

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.400
jar when you look at these elements I
mean they're very they're functionally

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:06.410
mean they're very they're functionally
 

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.040
mean they're very they're functionally
somewhat equivalent there are some minor

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.050
somewhat equivalent there are some minor
 

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.569
somewhat equivalent there are some minor
differences in in terms of when you

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:10.579
differences in in terms of when you
 

00:16:10.579 --> 00:16:12.009
differences in in terms of when you
should use a spinner versus navigation

00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:12.019
should use a spinner versus navigation
 

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:13.900
should use a spinner versus navigation
drawer as well as you know when it's

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:13.910
drawer as well as you know when it's
 

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.309
drawer as well as you know when it's
appropriate to use tabs versus spinner

00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:15.319
appropriate to use tabs versus spinner
 

00:16:15.319 --> 00:16:17.110
appropriate to use tabs versus spinner
but you know functionally they're their

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120
but you know functionally they're their
 

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.850
but you know functionally they're their
lateral navigation element so they let

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:18.860
lateral navigation element so they let
 

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.069
lateral navigation element so they let
you navigate across sibling elements or

00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:21.079
you navigate across sibling elements or
 

00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:23.740
you navigate across sibling elements or
sibling screens and then you know it's

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:23.750
sibling screens and then you know it's
 

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.179
sibling screens and then you know it's
kind of interesting to look at the

00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:25.189
kind of interesting to look at the
 

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:26.949
kind of interesting to look at the
action bars navigational components as

00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959
action bars navigational components as
 

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:29.559
action bars navigational components as
both ancestral navigation and lateral

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:29.569
both ancestral navigation and lateral
 

00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:31.629
both ancestral navigation and lateral
navigation so the UP button which which

00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639
navigation so the UP button which which
 

00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:33.819
navigation so the UP button which which
we made brief mention of lets you

00:16:33.819 --> 00:16:33.829
we made brief mention of lets you
 

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:35.740
we made brief mention of lets you
accomplish ancestral navigation lets you

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:35.750
accomplish ancestral navigation lets you
 

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.960
accomplish ancestral navigation lets you
walk up the structure of an app versus

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:37.970
walk up the structure of an app versus
 

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:39.790
walk up the structure of an app versus
you know tabs or spinners navigation

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:39.800
you know tabs or spinners navigation
 

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.790
you know tabs or spinners navigation
drawers they let you navigate laterally

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800
drawers they let you navigate laterally
 

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.949
drawers they let you navigate laterally
across the structure of your app so when

00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959
across the structure of your app so when
 

00:16:44.959 --> 00:16:46.090
across the structure of your app so when
you're when you're planning out you know

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:46.100
you're when you're planning out you know
 

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.889
you're when you're planning out you know
how do how do you design an app that

00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:47.899
how do how do you design an app that
 

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:49.269
how do how do you design an app that
uses you know all these different

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279
uses you know all these different
 

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:51.069
uses you know all these different
navigational elements think about your

00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079
navigational elements think about your
 

00:16:51.079 --> 00:16:53.050
navigational elements think about your
your app in terms of a screen map or

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:53.060
your app in terms of a screen map or
 

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.629
your app in terms of a screen map or
think about it in terms of you know a

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639
think about it in terms of you know a
 

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:57.129
think about it in terms of you know a
structure a tree almost a hierarchical

00:16:57.129 --> 00:16:57.139
structure a tree almost a hierarchical
 

00:16:57.139 --> 00:16:58.840
structure a tree almost a hierarchical
structure and see where you can

00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:58.850
structure and see where you can
 

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.549
structure and see where you can
introduce elements to better convey that

00:17:00.549 --> 00:17:00.559
introduce elements to better convey that
 

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:04.390
introduce elements to better convey that
structure to your users yeah one thing I

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400
structure to your users yeah one thing I
 

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.399
structure to your users yeah one thing I
will quickly say is it a very much

00:17:06.399 --> 00:17:06.409
will quickly say is it a very much
 

00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:09.250
will quickly say is it a very much
dislike it when a drawer has three items

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:09.260
dislike it when a drawer has three items
 

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
dislike it when a drawer has three items
in it because it could much eat much

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:11.270
in it because it could much eat much
 

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.760
in it because it could much eat much
much better be represented by something

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:12.770
much better be represented by something
 

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.360
much better be represented by something
like like regular tabs and you know it

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:16.370
like like regular tabs and you know it
 

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.750
like like regular tabs and you know it
gives the user the on-screen visuals

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760
gives the user the on-screen visuals
 

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.640
gives the user the on-screen visuals
immediately there I can swipe it to them

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:21.650
immediately there I can swipe it to them
 

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.559
immediately there I can swipe it to them
it's just so much easier so yeah it's

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:23.569
it's just so much easier so yeah it's
 

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:24.850
it's just so much easier so yeah it's
one pet peeves but one of the other

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:24.860
one pet peeves but one of the other
 

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.710
one pet peeves but one of the other
things since we're on the topic of that

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720
things since we're on the topic of that
 

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.500
things since we're on the topic of that
we're gonna get stuck on this important

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:29.510
we're gonna get stuck on this important
 

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.789
we're gonna get stuck on this important
one of the things that's different

00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799
one of the things that's different
 

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:32.799
one of the things that's different
between Android and other platforms is

00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:32.809
between Android and other platforms is
 

00:17:32.809 --> 00:17:35.020
between Android and other platforms is
tabs aren't persistent so this is one

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:35.030
tabs aren't persistent so this is one
 

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.250
tabs aren't persistent so this is one
thing that I have seen you know some

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:36.260
thing that I have seen you know some
 

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.799
thing that I have seen you know some
folks get caught up caught up with they

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:38.809
folks get caught up caught up with they
 

00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:40.659
folks get caught up caught up with they
keep tabs visible throughout the entire

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:40.669
keep tabs visible throughout the entire
 

00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:43.149
keep tabs visible throughout the entire
app so the action bar is really you know

00:17:43.149 --> 00:17:43.159
app so the action bar is really you know
 

00:17:43.159 --> 00:17:44.399
app so the action bar is really you know
the one thing that should really be

00:17:44.399 --> 00:17:44.409
the one thing that should really be
 

00:17:44.409 --> 00:17:46.450
the one thing that should really be
present throughout the entire app

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:46.460
present throughout the entire app
 

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.070
present throughout the entire app
because it gives you access to the UP

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080
because it gives you access to the UP
 

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.049
because it gives you access to the UP
button as well as things like settings

00:17:50.049 --> 00:17:50.059
button as well as things like settings
 

00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:53.770
button as well as things like settings
and whatnot but tabs are really a per

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:53.780
and whatnot but tabs are really a per
 

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.680
and whatnot but tabs are really a per
screen type thing so if your top level

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:55.690
screen type thing so if your top level
 

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.690
screen type thing so if your top level
screen has tabs once you get into a

00:17:58.690 --> 00:17:58.700
screen has tabs once you get into a
 

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.100
screen has tabs once you get into a
detail screen from within one of those

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:00.110
detail screen from within one of those
 

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.539
detail screen from within one of those
tabs like let's say you touch a list

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:01.549
tabs like let's say you touch a list
 

00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:04.029
tabs like let's say you touch a list
item in tab one you should hide those

00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039
item in tab one you should hide those
 

00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:05.860
item in tab one you should hide those
tabs and then to get back to those tabs

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:05.870
tabs and then to get back to those tabs
 

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.080
tabs and then to get back to those tabs
users should press up to get to the the

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.090
users should press up to get to the the
 

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.539
users should press up to get to the the
top level screen that has those tabs so

00:18:10.539 --> 00:18:10.549
top level screen that has those tabs so
 

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:12.190
top level screen that has those tabs so
that's one thing to make sure that you

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200
that's one thing to make sure that you
 

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.380
that's one thing to make sure that you
don't do is have hierarchy and and

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:14.390
don't do is have hierarchy and and
 

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.890
don't do is have hierarchy and and
history within a tab the tab is really

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:17.900
history within a tab the tab is really
 

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.419
history within a tab the tab is really
just like a segment of the screen almost

00:18:19.419 --> 00:18:19.429
just like a segment of the screen almost
 

00:18:19.429 --> 00:18:22.180
just like a segment of the screen almost
yeah yeah action bar is the anchor of

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.190
yeah yeah action bar is the anchor of
 

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.890
yeah yeah action bar is the anchor of
the application it should be visible all

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:23.900
the application it should be visible all
 

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.000
the application it should be visible all
the time and the other element should

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.010
the time and the other element should
 

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.789
the time and the other element should
sort of come and go as needed yeah all

00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799
sort of come and go as needed yeah all
 

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:29.380
sort of come and go as needed yeah all
right let's let's get on can't get away

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:29.390
right let's let's get on can't get away
 

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:33.580
right let's let's get on can't get away
from this before we get action buttons

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:33.590
from this before we get action buttons
 

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:36.730
from this before we get action buttons
neat you know yeah so action button is

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:36.740
neat you know yeah so action button is
 

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.470
neat you know yeah so action button is
at the right hand section of the the

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480
at the right hand section of the the
 

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.180
at the right hand section of the the
action bar which allow you to perform

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:40.190
action bar which allow you to perform
 

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.220
action bar which allow you to perform
actions which are contextual to the

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:42.230
actions which are contextual to the
 

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:46.810
actions which are contextual to the
content on screen we kind of use this

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:46.820
content on screen we kind of use this
 

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.220
content on screen we kind of use this
fit rule which you can see on screen

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:48.230
fit rule which you can see on screen
 

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.000
fit rule which you can see on screen
here to determine which actions should

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.010
here to determine which actions should
 

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.470
here to determine which actions should
appear like front and center right on

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480
appear like front and center right on
 

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.330
appear like front and center right on
the action bar and which ones are less

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:55.340
the action bar and which ones are less
 

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.799
the action bar and which ones are less
important and should be like tucked away

00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:56.809
important and should be like tucked away
 

00:18:56.809 --> 00:19:00.549
important and should be like tucked away
under the overflow menu so the fit

00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559
under the overflow menu so the fit
 

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:02.649
under the overflow menu so the fit
scheme it refers to something which is

00:19:02.649 --> 00:19:02.659
scheme it refers to something which is
 

00:19:02.659 --> 00:19:05.680
scheme it refers to something which is
frequently important or typical so if

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:05.690
frequently important or typical so if
 

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.240
frequently important or typical so if
you know just some examples that

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.250
you know just some examples that
 

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.100
you know just some examples that
frequently if you in an image

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:09.110
frequently if you in an image
 

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.210
frequently if you in an image
application image viewing application

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:10.220
application image viewing application
 

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.680
application image viewing application
like the gallery for example you

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:11.690
like the gallery for example you
 

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.289
like the gallery for example you
frequently want to share that so we have

00:19:14.289 --> 00:19:14.299
frequently want to share that so we have
 

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:17.049
frequently want to share that so we have
the share action button right front and

00:19:17.049 --> 00:19:17.059
the share action button right front and
 

00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:18.640
the share action button right front and
center in the action bar so it's very

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:18.650
center in the action bar so it's very
 

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.909
center in the action bar so it's very
easy to do that a cheaper and something

00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919
easy to do that a cheaper and something
 

00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:23.980
easy to do that a cheaper and something
which is important say in an email

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:23.990
which is important say in an email
 

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.480
which is important say in an email
application we have the send button in

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:25.490
application we have the send button in
 

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:26.890
application we have the send button in
the action bar it's right there at the

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:26.900
the action bar it's right there at the
 

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.480
the action bar it's right there at the
top of screen as the most important

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:28.490
top of screen as the most important
 

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.610
top of screen as the most important
thing and one more thing is one single

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:30.620
thing and one more thing is one single
 

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.470
thing and one more thing is one single
like very the most important action on

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480
like very the most important action on
 

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.760
like very the most important action on
the screen try and keep it to the left

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:33.770
the screen try and keep it to the left
 

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.919
the screen try and keep it to the left
most action because that's more likely

00:19:35.919 --> 00:19:35.929
most action because that's more likely
 

00:19:35.929 --> 00:19:37.590
most action because that's more likely
to be shown on

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600
to be shown on
 

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.690
to be shown on
the action bar and not tucked away under

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:39.700
the action bar and not tucked away under
 

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.070
the action bar and not tucked away under
the overflow if there is an exhibition

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.080
the overflow if there is an exhibition
 

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.270
the overflow if there is an exhibition
room and last the rules is typical so

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280
room and last the rules is typical so
 

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.710
room and last the rules is typical so
something like searches we touched on

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720
something like searches we touched on
 

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.480
something like searches we touched on
slightly earlier on you're gonna always

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:48.490
slightly earlier on you're gonna always
 

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.310
slightly earlier on you're gonna always
look to the top right to look for the

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320
look to the top right to look for the
 

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.540
look to the top right to look for the
search action because it's typically

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:51.550
search action because it's typically
 

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.100
search action because it's typically
found there so you wouldn't want to

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.110
found there so you wouldn't want to
 

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.380
found there so you wouldn't want to
follow that rule and one one thing I

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:55.390
follow that rule and one one thing I
 

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.640
follow that rule and one one thing I
just like to kind of clarifying that is

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:56.650
just like to kind of clarifying that is
 

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.110
just like to kind of clarifying that is
there we've caught out at the bottom

00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.120
there we've caught out at the bottom
 

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.270
there we've caught out at the bottom
here saying that items in the action bar

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280
here saying that items in the action bar
 

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.130
here saying that items in the action bar
needs to be unambiguous as to what

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:02.140
needs to be unambiguous as to what
 

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.830
needs to be unambiguous as to what
they're going to apply to so if there's

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840
they're going to apply to so if there's
 

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.090
they're going to apply to so if there's
something like an edit action in the

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:06.100
something like an edit action in the
 

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.290
something like an edit action in the
action mark but there's actually a

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:07.300
action mark but there's actually a
 

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.940
action mark but there's actually a
couple of distinct groups of content on

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:08.950
couple of distinct groups of content on
 

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.430
couple of distinct groups of content on
the screen and so it's unclear and you

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440
the screen and so it's unclear and you
 

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.290
the screen and so it's unclear and you
want to basically put that action inline

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:13.300
want to basically put that action inline
 

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.570
want to basically put that action inline
in the content area so there's no

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:15.580
in the content area so there's no
 

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.100
in the content area so there's no
ambiguity you want to either do that

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:17.110
ambiguity you want to either do that
 

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.990
ambiguity you want to either do that
inline or you can perhaps is the context

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000
inline or you can perhaps is the context
 

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.850
inline or you can perhaps is the context

mention was don't feel like you have to
 

00:21:37.649 --> 00:21:39.919
mention was don't feel like you have to
put actions necessarily in the action

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:39.929
put actions necessarily in the action
 

00:21:39.929 --> 00:21:41.299
put actions necessarily in the action
well you can't put them in line as well

00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:41.309
well you can't put them in line as well
 

00:21:41.309 --> 00:21:42.710
well you can't put them in line as well
like that's definitely an alternate

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720
like that's definitely an alternate
 

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.690
like that's definitely an alternate
option if it's relevant to the content

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:44.700
option if it's relevant to the content
 

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.340
option if it's relevant to the content
or it sort of fits better with the flow

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:46.350
or it sort of fits better with the flow
 

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.659
or it sort of fits better with the flow
of the screen you could possibly put

00:21:47.659 --> 00:21:47.669
of the screen you could possibly put
 

00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:49.310
of the screen you could possibly put
something in line you know it's

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320
something in line you know it's
 

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.930
something in line you know it's
definitely not our option but you know

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940
definitely not our option but you know
 

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.330
definitely not our option but you know
if that's not what you want if you want

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:53.340
if that's not what you want if you want
 

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.200
if that's not what you want if you want
to stick to this sort of standard

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:54.210
to stick to this sort of standard
 

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.080
to stick to this sort of standard
pattern put them in the action bar all

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:57.090
pattern put them in the action bar all
 

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.810
pattern put them in the action bar all
right so we've touched on this earlier

00:21:59.810 --> 00:21:59.820
right so we've touched on this earlier
 

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.200
right so we've touched on this earlier
on as well about the you're not actually

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:03.210
on as well about the you're not actually
 

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.690
on as well about the you're not actually
saying this item you must must must sure

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:05.700
saying this item you must must must sure
 

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.610
saying this item you must must must sure
I think the whole point of the action

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:07.620
I think the whole point of the action
 

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.649
I think the whole point of the action
bar is it really helps you to build on

00:22:09.649 --> 00:22:09.659
bar is it really helps you to build on
 

00:22:09.659 --> 00:22:11.269
bar is it really helps you to build on
this responsive design technique that we

00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279
this responsive design technique that we
 

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:13.159
this responsive design technique that we
were always talking about you know

00:22:13.159 --> 00:22:13.169
were always talking about you know
 

00:22:13.169 --> 00:22:15.200
were always talking about you know
Android is designed Android is designed

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:15.210
Android is designed Android is designed
 

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.730
Android is designed Android is designed
to scale and you don't necessarily know

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740
to scale and you don't necessarily know
 

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.950
to scale and you don't necessarily know
at design time how wide the eye that the

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960
at design time how wide the eye that the
 

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.389
at design time how wide the eye that the
device is going to be which your app is

00:22:20.389 --> 00:22:20.399
device is going to be which your app is
 

00:22:20.399 --> 00:22:21.740
device is going to be which your app is
running on you know is it in landscape

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:21.750
running on you know is it in landscape
 

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.299
running on you know is it in landscape
there's been portrait is it like a

00:22:23.299 --> 00:22:23.309
there's been portrait is it like a
 

00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:26.029
there's been portrait is it like a
tablet size device and so the action bar

00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039
tablet size device and so the action bar
 

00:22:26.039 --> 00:22:27.529
tablet size device and so the action bar
is really built with that in its

00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539
is really built with that in its
 

00:22:27.539 --> 00:22:30.289
is really built with that in its
underpinnings and so the way you define

00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299
underpinnings and so the way you define
 

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:32.509
underpinnings and so the way you define
your actions you actually you can say if

00:22:32.509 --> 00:22:32.519
your actions you actually you can say if
 

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:34.190
your actions you actually you can say if
you should always show up in the action

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200
you should always show up in the action
 

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.320
you should always show up in the action
bar and never kind of go under under the

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:36.330
bar and never kind of go under under the
 

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.470
bar and never kind of go under under the
overflow menu if it should or conversely

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480
overflow menu if it should or conversely
 

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.759
overflow menu if it should or conversely
never so something like settings you

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:40.769
never so something like settings you
 

00:22:40.769 --> 00:22:42.590
never so something like settings you
would say never show this as a front and

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600
would say never show this as a front and
 

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.990
would say never show this as a front and
center action papasan the overflow and

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000
center action papasan the overflow and
 

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.279
center action papasan the overflow and
the last one the most interesting once

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:46.289
the last one the most interesting once
 

00:22:46.289 --> 00:22:47.629
the last one the most interesting once
you probably want to use for most of

00:22:47.629 --> 00:22:47.639
you probably want to use for most of
 

00:22:47.639 --> 00:22:50.690
you probably want to use for most of
your actions is just to say if room so

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700
your actions is just to say if room so
 

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.700
your actions is just to say if room so
what they will say is that if there's

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:52.710
what they will say is that if there's
 

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.499
what they will say is that if there's
room please display this and I've always

00:22:54.499 --> 00:22:54.509
room please display this and I've always
 

00:22:54.509 --> 00:22:56.269
room please display this and I've always
tuck it under and the system will go

00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:56.279
tuck it under and the system will go
 

00:22:56.279 --> 00:22:57.350
tuck it under and the system will go
through in the order of which you've

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360
through in the order of which you've
 

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.840
through in the order of which you've
defined your actions and and kind of try

00:22:59.840 --> 00:22:59.850
defined your actions and and kind of try
 

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.519
defined your actions and and kind of try
to show as many as it can and then any

00:23:01.519 --> 00:23:01.529
to show as many as it can and then any
 

00:23:01.529 --> 00:23:03.350
to show as many as it can and then any
it doesn't have room for get tucked

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360
it doesn't have room for get tucked
 

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.590
it doesn't have room for get tucked
under the overflow and so it really kind

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600
under the overflow and so it really kind
 

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.360
under the overflow and so it really kind
of you want to be thinking about your

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:08.370
of you want to be thinking about your
 

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.649
of you want to be thinking about your
actions and say you know something like

00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:09.659
actions and say you know something like
 

00:23:09.659 --> 00:23:11.450
actions and say you know something like
an email application send should always

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:11.460
an email application send should always
 

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.190
an email application send should always
be on the screen but these other things

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200
be on the screen but these other things
 

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.899
be on the screen but these other things
are less important and they can they can

00:23:14.899 --> 00:23:14.909
are less important and they can they can
 

00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:16.789
are less important and they can they can
go underneath a and their flow need be

00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799
go underneath a and their flow need be
 

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:18.980
go underneath a and their flow need be
and so don't get hung up on thinking

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:18.990
and so don't get hung up on thinking
 

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.330
and so don't get hung up on thinking
these two things are always going to be

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.340
these two things are always going to be
 

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.470
these two things are always going to be
on the screen these things are always

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480
on the screen these things are always
 

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.240
on the screen these things are always
going to be off screen try and work with

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:23.250
going to be off screen try and work with
 

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.950
going to be off screen try and work with
the if room and try and like have this

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960
the if room and try and like have this
 

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.100
the if room and try and like have this
kind of stretchable design as you can I

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:27.110
kind of stretchable design as you can I
 

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.450
kind of stretchable design as you can I
really like this because it forces you

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460
really like this because it forces you
 

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.129
really like this because it forces you
to think about the fit pattern that we

00:23:31.129 --> 00:23:31.139
to think about the fit pattern that we
 

00:23:31.139 --> 00:23:32.749
to think about the fit pattern that we
were talking about before and just

00:23:32.749 --> 00:23:32.759
were talking about before and just
 

00:23:32.759 --> 00:23:34.789
were talking about before and just
really prioritize which acts and actions

00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799
really prioritize which acts and actions
 

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:36.499
really prioritize which acts and actions
you think are most important you know

00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:36.509
you think are most important you know
 

00:23:36.509 --> 00:23:38.210
you think are most important you know
for user has the Nexus S and they can

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.220
for user has the Nexus S and they can
 

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.799
for user has the Nexus S and they can
only fit two items up there then as long

00:23:39.799 --> 00:23:39.809
only fit two items up there then as long
 

00:23:39.809 --> 00:23:40.999
only fit two items up there then as long
you were always going to have the two

00:23:40.999 --> 00:23:41.009
you were always going to have the two
 

00:23:41.009 --> 00:23:42.019
you were always going to have the two
you know

00:23:42.019 --> 00:23:42.029
you know
 

00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.980
you know
items that you think we're most

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:42.990
items that you think we're most
 

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.379
items that you think we're most
importantly visible to you to the user

00:23:45.379 --> 00:23:45.389
importantly visible to you to the user
 

00:23:45.389 --> 00:23:47.299
importantly visible to you to the user
so I think I think it's a good way of

00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:47.309
so I think I think it's a good way of
 

00:23:47.309 --> 00:23:49.850
so I think I think it's a good way of
decluttering your UI almost like it sort

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:49.860
decluttering your UI almost like it sort
 

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.440
decluttering your UI almost like it sort
of forces you to tackle that problem

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:51.450
of forces you to tackle that problem
 

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.610
of forces you to tackle that problem
rather than just say how throw

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:52.620
rather than just say how throw
 

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.960
rather than just say how throw
everything on the screen I hope the user

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:53.970
everything on the screen I hope the user
 

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:59.450
everything on the screen I hope the user
can work out what's happening all right

00:23:59.450 --> 00:23:59.460
can work out what's happening all right
 

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.190
can work out what's happening all right
we better get moving here guys yeah so

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200
we better get moving here guys yeah so
 

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.049
we better get moving here guys yeah so
I'll just quickly jump through the key

00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059
I'll just quickly jump through the key
 

00:24:03.059 --> 00:24:04.730
I'll just quickly jump through the key

throughout this show but the key things

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940
throughout this show but the key things
 

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.100
throughout this show but the key things
that you should think about when styling

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:10.110
that you should think about when styling
 

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.570
that you should think about when styling
the action bar and outside of adjusting

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580
the action bar and outside of adjusting
 

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.649
the action bar and outside of adjusting
a picking color schemes you can

00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:12.659
a picking color schemes you can
 

00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:14.389
a picking color schemes you can
obviously also apply you know patterns

00:24:14.389 --> 00:24:14.399
obviously also apply you know patterns
 

00:24:14.399 --> 00:24:18.139
obviously also apply you know patterns
or subtle gradients and and yes just

00:24:18.139 --> 00:24:18.149
or subtle gradients and and yes just
 

00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:20.359
or subtle gradients and and yes just
solid colors to these you should really

00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:20.369
solid colors to these you should really
 

00:24:20.369 --> 00:24:21.950
solid colors to these you should really
be thinking about the action bars core

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960
be thinking about the action bars core
 

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.330
be thinking about the action bars core
background that's a kind of the number

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340
background that's a kind of the number
 

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.249

00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:27.269
you're if you're Yahoo which probably be
 

00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:30.139
you're if you're Yahoo which probably be
purple or something like that for the

purple or something like that for the
 

00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:31.850
purple or something like that for the
stacked bar background you probably want

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:31.860
stacked bar background you probably want
 

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.869
stacked bar background you probably want
to use a very similar a similar shade or

00:24:35.869 --> 00:24:35.879
to use a very similar a similar shade or
 

00:24:35.879 --> 00:24:38.210
to use a very similar a similar shade or
a similar hue but a slightly darker or

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220
a similar hue but a slightly darker or
 

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.039
a similar hue but a slightly darker or
slightly lighter version the reason you

00:24:40.039 --> 00:24:40.049
slightly lighter version the reason you
 

00:24:40.049 --> 00:24:41.930
slightly lighter version the reason you
don't want to do something too crazy is

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:41.940
don't want to do something too crazy is
 

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.690
don't want to do something too crazy is
that again in landscape your tabs can

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:44.700
that again in landscape your tabs can
 

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.869
that again in landscape your tabs can
actually stack up into the top bar and

00:24:47.869 --> 00:24:47.879
actually stack up into the top bar and
 

00:24:47.879 --> 00:24:50.899
actually stack up into the top bar and
so the tabs may not have enough contrast

00:24:50.899 --> 00:24:50.909
so the tabs may not have enough contrast
 

00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:52.489
so the tabs may not have enough contrast
if there's a completely different color

00:24:52.489 --> 00:24:52.499

pallet between action bar background and
 

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:55.639
pallet between action bar background and
it's stacked background you can probably

00:24:55.639 --> 00:24:55.649
it's stacked background you can probably
 

00:24:55.649 --> 00:24:57.259
it's stacked background you can probably
make it work through some tricks here

00:24:57.259 --> 00:24:57.269
make it work through some tricks here
 

00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:58.879
make it work through some tricks here
and there but it's generally easiest if

00:24:58.879 --> 00:24:58.889
and there but it's generally easiest if
 

00:24:58.889 --> 00:25:00.440
and there but it's generally easiest if
you if you just make a slight variation

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:00.450
you if you just make a slight variation
 

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.200

Google Maps on the right there and you
 

00:26:23.729 --> 00:26:24.889
Google Maps on the right there and you
can see you know the map is obviously

00:26:24.889 --> 00:26:24.899
can see you know the map is obviously

still have a hard menu button and so in

00:28:31.889 --> 00:28:31.899
still have a hard menu button and so in
 

00:28:31.899 --> 00:28:33.539
still have a hard menu button and so in
that case the overflow menu actually

00:28:33.539 --> 00:28:33.549
that case the overflow menu actually
 

00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:35.700
that case the overflow menu actually
doesn't show in the action bar and

doesn't show in the action bar and
 

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.190
doesn't show in the action bar and
