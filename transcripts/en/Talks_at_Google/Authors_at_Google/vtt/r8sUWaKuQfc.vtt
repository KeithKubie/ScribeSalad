JONATHAN: Good afternoon,
and welcome to Talks

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.420
at Google in Cambridge, Mass.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.890
Today, it's my great pleasure
to introduce Bernard Carlson.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.330
Dr. Carlson is here to discuss
his acclaimed biography,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.900
"Tesla-- Inventor of
the Electrical Age."

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.450
Tesla certainly needs
no introduction here.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.770
Bernie Carlson might,
but rest assured,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.450
he is also a major dude.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.830
Here are a few highlights
from his extensive CV.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.000
He is the Joseph L. Vaughan
Professor of Humanities

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.420
and chair of the Department
of Engineering and Society

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.320
at the University of
Virginia, where he also

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.930
holds a joint appointment
with the History Department.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.410
As an historian of
technology, Bernie

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.580
has written widely on
invention and entrepreneurship

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.910
as well as on the
role of technology

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.350
in the rise and fall
of civilizations.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.850
His publications
include "Innovation

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.610
as a Social Process--
Elihu Thomson and the Rise

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.770
of General Electric,
1870 to 1900"

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.570
and "Technology in World
History," in seven volumes.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.270
In 2008, the latter was awarded
the Sally Hacker Prize--

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.990
great name-- from the Society
for the History of Technology,

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.630
as the best book aimed
at a broad audience.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.050
And among many other
accomplishments,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.370
he recently completed
a five-year term

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.170
as executive secretary
of the Society

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.640
for the History of Technology.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.610
Please join me in
welcoming Bernie Carlson.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.496
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.344 --> 00:01:48.344
BERNARD CARLSON: Thanks.

00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:54.870
Well, thanks for coming out,
and thank you, Jonathan,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.180
for that kind invitation.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.530
It's a great pleasure be
back in Massachusetts.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.730
While I now live in Virginia,
I spent much of my youth

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.180
and education up here.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.410
I studied at Holy Cross
College, about 40 miles

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.535
away in Worcester.

00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:15.000
I did my post-doc at the
Harvard Business School--

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.850
yes, that school, the business
school across the river.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.750
And more importantly, just
around the corner from here,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.539
I did my sabbatical in
1994 and lived at Eastgate.

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.580
Practically, you can see
it right out the window.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.650
So it's a great
pleasure to be back here

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.070
and to talk to you
about Nikola Tesla.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.030
And part of my
purpose today is this,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.040
as I was saying to Jonathan,
is to insert ideas about Tesla

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.090
into the conversations,
into the thinking,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.650
into the work that you have to
do every day here at Google.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.200
I am a historian in
technology by criminal trade,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.120
but I spend my life
in engineering schools

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.540
and run the largest
non-technical department

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.670
in the engineering school
at, as I like to say,

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.010
Mr. Jefferson's Vo
Tech and University.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.610
And I am really interested
in that interplay

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.094
between technology and
the rest of society.

00:03:11.094 --> 00:03:13.260
That's why it's called the
Department of Engineering

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.890
and Society.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.710
But I'm really interested in
how we make the next generation

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.130
of outstanding innovators.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.900
How do we train people
to do the magic that

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.880
is so important for our society
and for the global economy?

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.530
So Tesla is an ideal
subject for that

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.990
because he's not somebody
who's just a mythic character.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.010
He's an individual who
has, as you'll see today,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.210
important things to tell us
about how technology gets done,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.990
whether we're talking
in the 19th century

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.000
or we're talking in
the 21st century.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.470
But let's just talk for a moment
about Tesla in popular culture.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.920
You can summarize where he
sits in popular culture.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.530
He is, indeed, a figure
in popular video games,

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.010
like the "Dark Void," but
he has had a whole range

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.780
of roles in popular culture.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.380
Some people say he's a genius.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.234
He is the Leonardo of
the 20th century who

00:04:09.234 --> 00:04:11.900
invented everything-- everything
that has to do with electricity

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.180
and electronics.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.770
There are other people who sort
of say, oh, he's not a genius.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.020
He's really kind of a lunatic.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.459
He's a nutcase.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.160
He had all sorts of
wonderful dreams,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.750
but he never
finished 3/4 of them.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.080
And, in fact, in his dying days
in the late 1930s and 1940s,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.910
he spent most of the time in the
park behind the New York Public

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.500
Library feeding pigeons.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.230
Or if you don't like either
of those two explanations,

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.750
he's a space alien who, indeed,
came to Earth from Venus

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.960
on the wings of a giant
dove to save mankind

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.040
from the horrors of
atomic armageddon.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.170
Needless to say, this is a book
that was published in 1951,

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.890
and I always trust all books
that are published and printed

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.750
in green ink.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.850
And, indeed, the book
where that idea comes from

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.890
is titled, "On the
Wings of a Dove,"

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.890
published by Margaret
Storm, and the book

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.060
is printed in green ink.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.310
I'm not sure how many books
are printed in green ink,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.400
but this one, when I saw
that, I sort of said, ooh,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.480
that's a really
authoritative source.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.990
OK, so that's Tesla in
the popular culture.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.860
My argument for
you today is this.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.340
Tesla is valuable if we're
stand in engineering schools

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.690
where I work, or we're
standing in business schools,

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.830
or we're operating
in companies today.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.390
Why?

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.190
He invented two
disruptive technologies.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.530
One is the
alternating-current motor

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.130
that he worked on in the 1880s
which completely revolutionized

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.170
how we consume energy in our
lives today all over the world.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.370
If that was not enough, for
a second act, in the 1890s

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.170
he worked on wireless
transmission of power.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.020
He had a vision that radio
waves or electromagnetic waves

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.880
should be used not just
first for broadcasting

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.950
or for communication
purposes, but should

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.730
be used to actually
transmit power from point A

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.270
to point B. In a
certain sense, and this

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.310
is why I let the
publisher title the book,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.110
"Tesla-- Inventor of
the Electrical Age,"

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.860
he is one of the few
guys who contributed

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.030
to both electric power and
to electronic communications.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.030
So Tesla is an
interesting individual

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.520
because he had one great
success and he had one, well,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.660
un-success, shall we say?

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.360
So he allows us to
look at what makes

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.250
for big, breakthrough
technologies

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.350
and what doesn't make for great,
breakthrough technologies.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.080
He has a success and a failure.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.160
And we can do so
through Tesla's career

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.590
without resorting to the
standard explanations, which

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.900
is we often sort of say, oh,
breakthrough technologies.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.000
Amazing things-- it's genius.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.480
You've got to be Steve Jobs.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.440
Or they say, it's
just dumb bunny luck.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.300
You've got to be Steve Jobs.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.990
OK, and I want to get away
from-- with my students,

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.730
with you-- thinking about
breakthrough technologies

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.440
as a result of genius or luck.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.960
To underline where I'm
going with this, some of you

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.890
are probably familiar
with how economists

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.170
look at technological
change over the long haul.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.400
And they often,
based on work done

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.150
by a Russian economist
in the 1920s,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.160
talk about Kondratieff
curves, which

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.550
is that there's an ebb and flow
over a long period of time,

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.520
from the 1700s to
the 21st century.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.880
And there are waves of
technological change.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.200
OK, now, most people,
they look at this

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.360
and they say, oh,
well, if it was 1880,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.170
it's time for that wave that's
electricity and chemistry.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.700
If it's 1910, it's time
for the automobile.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.540
And they don't
really stop and think

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.440
that the arrival of those
different waves and the shape

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.720
of those waves and the
timing of those waves

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.410
is so dependent on individuals.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.160
Submitted for your
consideration--

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.960
what's behind that
curve is not just

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.500
big, structural
changes in the economy

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.000
or the availability
of technology,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.620
but individuals who shape
the technology to match up

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.640
to the social and cultural
opportunities of the time.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.170
Tesla is one of those guys.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.940
George Westinghouse is another.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.320
Thomas Edison is a third,
and you could, indeed,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.050
argue about the automobile.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.040
It's somebody like Henry
Ford or Alfred P. Sloan.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.810
So I'm after big
fish here in terms

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.710
of talking about Tesla
and disruptive innovation.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.470
Now, I spent 15 years
working on Tesla.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.290
And you might sort
of say, oh, my God.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.040
I heard the laugh in
the back of the room.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.070
Oh, he spent 15
years on this guy.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.920
Why?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.659
Because he was an intriguing
character to deal with.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.919
I had to figure out
how to weave together

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:41.809
several different social
roles that are not normally

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:43.240
juxtaposed.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.010
First off, he is an inventor.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.990
He is somebody who worked
in the technological realm

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.530
and did successful,
cutting-edge technology.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.650
At the same time, he
functioned a little bit more

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.520
like an artist than a scientist.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.110
A lot of people sort of
say, oh, Tesla, inventor

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.070
and then scientist.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.280
I'm like, slow down.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.670
Slow down, there, dude.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.340
I'm not sure about
this science thing.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.470
He is definitely like an
artist, and in particular

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.370
because he's more intuitive.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.640
If you asked Tesla what-- or
you went to his laboratory

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.650
in the 1890s and you watched
him work, what you would see

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.812
is you wouldn't see a lot
of tinkering and working

00:09:19.812 --> 00:09:21.770
with wires and messing
around with stuff, which

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.170
is what you would see if you
want to Edison's laboratory

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.300
in the same time period.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.910
Edison was a
tinkering kind of guy.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.300
Tesla, on contrast,
was what you might

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.070
call a theoretical inventor.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.310
It all happened up here.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:39.260
And it all turned much more less
on the hands-on experimentation

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.210
than on intuition,
on having an idea

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.540
and then imposing it on reality.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.370
In that sense, he's
more like an artist

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.905
and less like a scientist.

00:09:48.905 --> 00:09:50.280
Now, lots of people
would sort of

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.666
say, oh, Tesla-- world's
worst businessman.

00:09:53.666 --> 00:09:55.040
Submitted for your
consideration,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.706
one of the things I
want to convince you

00:09:56.706 --> 00:09:59.500
in the next few minutes is
this, that Tesla was actually

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.650
a pretty smart entrepreneur,
that he had a business

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.160
strategy for making money.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.100
We don't appreciate
it, necessarily,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.120
because it doesn't
conform to what

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.530
we think are the standard
ways that we believe inventors

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.460
in the 19th century operated.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.900
So Tesla kept me busy for 15
years because I had to move,

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.960
weave together inventor,
artist, entrepreneur.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.150
Now, to pull those
things together,

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.745
I developed a set of themes.

00:10:26.745 --> 00:10:28.620
And, indeed, I actually
thought that the book

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.760
ought to be called,
"Ideal and Illusion."

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.416
And my publisher said,
oh, don't do that,

00:10:33.416 --> 00:10:34.790
because everybody
will think it's

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.081
some sort of theological tract.

00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:38.210
Nobody will buy any
copies, and there you go.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.290
So I said, OK, but at
the heart of the book

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:47.370
are two dueling ideas about
Tesla's style as an inventor.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.870
And I think inventors,
like artists, have a style.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.750
They have a way of doing things.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.820
They have a way of making
sense of the world,

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.340
of making meaning.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.440
Tesla's was a tension
between ideal and illusion.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.670
Tesla believed, based on
his religious background--

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.130
his father was a priest in
the Serbian Orthodox Church--

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.820
that behind everything in
the world, whether it was

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.230
made by God, i.e. animals
and plants and minerals,

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.590
or made by man, there was a
fundamental principle that

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.440
was behind it and that
the job of an inventor

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.256
was to find the perfect
way to make an invention.

00:11:26.256 --> 00:11:27.630
And if you could
glean, you could

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:31.830
discern that perfect
idea, then you

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.820
would have a great invention.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.500
Now, this is very
platonic, as in the sense

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.230
of what Plato had to
say in his dialogs,

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.000
particularly the
analogy of the cave.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.870
And you may remember
that only the philosopher

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.580
king or the philosopher
can actually see the truth.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.480
Everybody else is
trapped down in a cave,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.309
looking at flickering
lights and debating

00:11:54.309 --> 00:11:55.850
the nature of those
flickering lights

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.090
that they see on the
walls of the cage.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:03.040
Mere mortals are stuck trying
to deal with approximations

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.920
of the true, illusions.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.610
Tesla believed that you had
to develop illusions, stories,

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.990
values, metaphors, that
allowed people to begin

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.370
to see where the ideal was.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.800
And he was willing to
put a lot of effort

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.255
into capturing
people's imagination.

00:12:22.255 --> 00:12:23.630
And then one of
the things that's

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.870
really important about
him for the young people,

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.620
the undergraduate
engineers that I teach,

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.900
is to remind them
that it's not just

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.790
about getting the code right.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.880
It's about the
story that you tell

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.790
about your software that engages
the imagination of people.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:45.520
So where did Tesla develop
this mix of ideal and illusion?

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.190
Tesla was born in 1856
to a Serbian family who

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.190
was living in what is
today Croatia but back then

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.920
was the Austrian Empire.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.210
It was a section of the
Austrian Empire that

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.160
was kind of a military
zone, a buffer

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.340
zone between the
Austrian heartland

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.290
and the Ottoman
or Turkish Empire.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:12.280
And the Austrians, to manage
that zone, mixed Muslims

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.520
and Christians, i.e.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.400
Catholics, and Serbian Orthodox
people and bundled them

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.250
all together so
that nobody really

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.980
controlled the entire area.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.390
And sadly, the
history of Yugoslavia

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:26.010
is a result of that mixing
up of all of these people.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.920
And, indeed, where
Tesla was born

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.920
is still a very contested,
complicated place.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.090
I've not been to his birthplace,
have no particular desire to go

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:34.630
there.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:41.160
OK, now, as a child, Tesla
had, as I said in the book,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.960
he had an interesting
childhood, way

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.700
more interesting than certainly
I had and I'm not sure

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.650
that I want my daughters
to ever have had.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:53.860
He had a problem
with his imagination

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:54.780
and with nightmares.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.830
So if you said to
Tesla, juicy apple,

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.514
he'd see out there in sort
of a three-dimensional space,

00:14:01.514 --> 00:14:02.930
he'd see this
beautiful red apple.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.138
And it would be all juicy,
and he'd start salivating.

00:14:05.138 --> 00:14:07.775
And he'd say, oh,
apple, apple, apple.

00:14:07.775 --> 00:14:10.300
I mean, he's a little
kid, and he could not

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.440
get rid of that vision
of that juicy apple.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.650
It would haunt him all through
the day, once you started down

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:18.510
this path with that particular
image, all through the night.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.010
OK, and needless to say,
this was a troubling thing

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.880
when you're a little kid.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.640
About 10, 11, 12,
somewhere in that zone,

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.350
preadolescence,
he reads a novel.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:33.930
And the novel basically talks
about an individual who's

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.900
kind of a
good-for-nothing prince

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.200
but proves himself
to his monarch-- it's

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.250
set in the Austrian Empire--
and proves himself to his king

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.840
and becomes a hero because
he develops discipline.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.300
He develops willpower.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.760
And young Tesla decided that he
was going to develop willpower.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.460
And the willpower that
he needed to develop

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.400
was all around getting
control of these images.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.390
So instead of just being
overwhelmed by the images,

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.590
he imposed an order on them.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.070
And he began to go,
in his imagination,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.620
on fabulous journeys.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.280
He developed entire cities.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.010
He developed imaginary friends,
indeed, imaginary societies.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.660
And to go from one place to
another in his imaginary world,

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.270
he flew.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.770
Well, along the way, he decides
that there shouldn't only

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.712
be flying in his
imaginary world.

00:15:22.712 --> 00:15:24.420
There should be flying
in his real world.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.270
So he decided, when
he was about 12 or 13,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.120
to build for himself a flying
machine, which probably

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.890
consisted of some sort of
pump or machine on his back,

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.370
like a backpack, with
a helicopter up there.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.310
That's about as much as
I know, but it was based

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.600
on some vacuum-pump principle.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.760
And he built a prototype.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:49.370
And lo and behold, the
prototype moved a little bit.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:53.550
And Tesla was elated
because it confirmed

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.650
that what he could
imagine in his mind

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.380
could happen out there
in the real world.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.100
And that set him on the
path to being an inventor.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.530
If I can imagine it up here, and
it happens in the real world,

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:12.520
then there's some rationality or
meaning to all of these things

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.270
that I can imagine.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:19.230
It sets Tesla up, however,
in a complicated, tricky way,

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:24.260
because he's always looking for
the upside of his discoveries.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.015
He's always looking, as Karl
Popper the famous philosopher

00:16:27.015 --> 00:16:29.850
would say, for
confirmatory evidence.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.390
But more on that
in a little bit.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.930
Tesla goes to
engineering school,

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.650
kind of violates
the family norms.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.257
Both his father and
all of his uncles

00:16:39.257 --> 00:16:41.090
were priests in the
Serbian Orthodox Church.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:42.631
He didn't want to
go into the church.

00:16:42.631 --> 00:16:46.050
He convinced his father that
he ought go study engineering,

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.500
and he studied engineering
in Graz, Austria.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.960
There, in a story
that's interesting

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.190
but I'm going to just
kind of pass over,

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:57.430
he decides after watching a
demonstration in his physics

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.980
lecture that he should invent
a better electric motor,

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.300
a motor that is sparkless.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.730
To develop that idea,
he thinks that it's

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.750
going to use a rotating
magnetic field.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.990
I'll explain that in a moment.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.310
To get more
information about how

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.380
all sorts of electric motors
and electric machines work,

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.349
he worked for several Edison
companies in different cities.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:25.849
First in Budapest, where helps
install a telephone exchange,

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:28.465
then he goes to Paris, helps
install electric lights.

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:29.840
He does such a
good job that he's

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.790
transferred to the New York
offices of the Edison company.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.840
But that really, if you
will, is his graduate school

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.360
in electrical engineering.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.700
That's where he really learns
the technical business.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.376
He leaves the
Edison organization.

00:17:43.376 --> 00:17:44.750
And after a number
of adventures,

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.250
he teams up with a pair of
individuals, Charles Peck

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.020
and Alfred Brown, who
allow him to develop

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.850
his alternating-current motor.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.050
Now, there are two
physics lessons

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.140
in this particular class.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.110
I probably don't need to
apologize for this audience,

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.690
but sometimes I
often have to say,

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.152
you know, there's going to
be a little science here.

00:18:05.152 --> 00:18:07.110
You know, just bear with
the historian teaching

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.110
a little bit of science.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:14.110
In 1887, Tesla perfects an
alternating-current motor.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:17.710
Now, all motors, whether
they be DC or they be AC,

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:22.020
work on the principle
that there are two pairs

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.920
of magnets in the motor.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.460
There's a stationary
pair, called the stator,

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.230
and there's a moving
pair, called the rotor.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.330
As long as those
two pairs of motors,

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.970
the stator and the rotor,
have different poles,

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.871
that is to say a north pole--
or they have the same poles,

00:18:40.871 --> 00:18:41.370
excuse me.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.340
The north pole and
a north pole meet,

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.634
they push away from each other.

00:18:45.634 --> 00:18:47.300
Because if it was a
north to south pole,

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.140
they'd be attracted
to each other.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.730
So as long, at any
given moment, as you

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.360
have one set of magnets
moving around, that

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.640
is to say rotating, those
always have a north pole.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.400
When they meet
another north pole,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.320
then they'll push
away from each other.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:08.390
So Tesla's big idea, if we look
at this diagram from his 1887

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:12.510
patent, is the
doughnut is the stator.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.540
And it has four coils,
four electromagnets.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.900
And this rectangle that you
see in the middle is the rotor.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.760
So every time this piece
of the rotor gets up there,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.970
it has to have a north pole so
it's repelled by the stator.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:33.600
Now, before Tesla, everybody who
was in the electrical business

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.310
said, the part of
the motor where

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:42.360
you change the magnetic
field is the rotor.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.280
In other words, you change
the magnetic field in this,

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.880
and you leave the magnetic
field and the stator stationary.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.905
Tesla said, no, no, no.

00:19:50.905 --> 00:19:53.570
I'm going to do this entirely
backwards to everybody else.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.320
I'm going to be a maverick.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.940
We're going to induce a
magnetic field in the rotor,

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.500
and we're going
to have a rotating

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:05.860
magnetic field in the stator.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.210
So the rotating magnetic
field goes around and around

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.876
in the doughnut.

00:20:08.876 --> 00:20:10.140
Why?

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.670
Through the magic of alternating
current, which I am not

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.720
going to explain to you
here-- if you feed two

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.620
alternating currents
into the doughnut,

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.600
into those four coils, and if
the two alternating currents

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.430
coming off of the
generators, this

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:28.040
is the generator over here,
are 90 degrees out of phase,

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.100
you can create a
rotating magnetic field.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.957
In other words, if we
start here at noon,

00:20:31.957 --> 00:20:33.040
this is going to be north.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.270
And then the north pole
is going to go here.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.280
The north pole is
going to go here.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.390
The north pole is
going to go here.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.348
And it's going to go
round and round and round,

00:20:38.348 --> 00:20:44.800
and it's going to induce an
opposite magnetic and electric

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.520
field in the rotor.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.190
Science lesson number
one is now concluded.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.770
OK, this was an amazing thing.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.800
It allowed for Tesla
to patent and develop

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.520
the first practical
alternating-current motor,

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.700
which allowed electricity
for the first time

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.430
not just to be used
for lighting, that's

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:04.350
what Edison
developed, but indeed

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.750
be used for all sorts
of power applications--

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:12.420
elevators, fans, machine
tools, moving assembly lines.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:17.560
When Tesla develops
this configuration

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.780
of the motor in 1887.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.750
It essentially looks like this,
but instead of that rectangle

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.480
there, what he did to basically
get proof of concept is he

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.190
took one of those
shoe polish tins,

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.380
the Kiwi shoe polish tins.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.171
Do you all know it?

00:21:30.171 --> 00:21:31.260
It's kind of like this.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.750
And he basically, he had
no shoe polish in it.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.330
And he basically
in the middle of it

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.477
put a thumb tack so
it was on a pivot.

00:21:37.477 --> 00:21:39.560
And he dropped that in the
middle of the doughnut.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.332
And the whole tin
can went, whee.

00:21:43.332 --> 00:21:44.290
And Tesla went, eureka.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:50.777
So he brings in one of his two
backers, [INAUDIBLE] Brown,

00:21:50.777 --> 00:21:53.110
who is a little more technically
minded than the lawyer,

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.810
Charles Peck.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:59.790
And he shows to Brown that
the tin can is spinning around

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:00.690
in this coil.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:05.360
And I have this vision of Brown
kind of peeking into the motor,

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.020
looking into the
doughnut, and seeing

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.720
this tin can go spinning around
and then looking at Tesla,

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:17.240
going, you brought me over here
to show me a spinning tin can?

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.615
Isn't that special.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.550
And Brown, basically, went back
to Peck and said, I don't know.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.890
This guy is not really
getting with the program.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.765
I'm not sure whether
it's worth all the money

00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:29.990
we're spending on him.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.080
So Tesla realizes that
he's got to convince,

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.010
he's got to come up
with the right illusion

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:39.600
for his technical backers,
for Peck and Brown.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.670
And so he waits a couple
days, and he goes back

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.600
to their offices, which
are around the corner.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.690
All of this is taking place
in downtown Manhattan,

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.540
in and around where the
World Trade Center was, right

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.180
around ground zero.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.410
And he walks into Peck
and Brown's office,

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.530
and he says to Peck
and Brown, so, you

00:22:55.530 --> 00:23:01.780
know how Christopher Columbus
got the money for the Nina,

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.370
the Pinta, and the Santa Maria.

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.780
And then Peck and Brown
go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.340
They got it from Queen
Isabella, and Queen Isabella

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.500
hawked her jewels.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.100
And Tesla says, ah,
but what did Columbus

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.630
do to convince Queen Isabella?

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:20.570
And as the legend
goes, Columbus was

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.600
in the court of Queen
Isabella and basically

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.940
was trying to convince
all of the experts, all

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.774
the scholastics that
were around the court,

00:23:29.774 --> 00:23:31.190
that, indeed, the
world was round.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.340
And they were arguing
with him, and they

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.423
were going back and forth.

00:23:33.423 --> 00:23:35.460
And finally, I'm
from New Jersey.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.630
I apologize.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.950
Columbus, who was Genovese,
he probably did this.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.880
He had had it up to here.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.480
And he said to the scholastics,
this is Columbus speaking,

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.100
he says, can you make
an egg stand on end?

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.892
And the scholastics
went, oh, I don't know.

00:23:47.892 --> 00:23:48.433
I don't know.

00:23:48.433 --> 00:23:48.980
I don't know.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.410
They're like
promotion and tenure

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.575
committees in engineering
schools, but that's an aside.

00:23:53.575 --> 00:23:57.480
You know, terribly unfair to
my colleagues, but I apologize.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.800
But they say, oh,
we can't do that.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.750
And Columbus says,
bring me the egg.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.300
And I imagine this
egg comes out,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.145
you know, with a little
flunky on a purple,

00:24:05.145 --> 00:24:06.880
you know, like, a
nice little pillow.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.294
And there's the egg.

00:24:08.294 --> 00:24:09.710
Columbus says,
bring me the spoon.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:11.293
And he grabs the
egg, takes the spoon,

00:24:11.293 --> 00:24:14.250
whacks off the bottom of
the egg, stands the egg up.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.740
And the scholastics are
like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.190
And Queen Isabella
says, I like that guy.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:21.990
I'm going to give him money.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:26.500
So Tesla repeats this whole
story to Peck and Brown

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.090
and says, if I can make
the egg stand on end

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.971
and go one step further
and make the egg spin,

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.970
will you give me the money
to patent this thing?

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.090
And they say, OK.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.340
So the next day, a
couple days later,

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.500
and only in New York, Tesla
runs home and on the way home

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.180
finds where he can
buy a copper egg.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.320
OK, it must have been about
the size of an ostrich egg.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.060
And he basically
puts the egg on top,

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.430
as you can see in the
picture, of the doughnut coil.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.090
Peck and Brown come
in, and they say, OK.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.910
Tesla turns on the
electric current.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:03.530
The rotating magnetic field
is created in the doughnut.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.260
And the egg starts
off on its side

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.550
and starts spinning and spins
fast enough that it comes up

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:14.470
and winds up spinning around
its vertical axis, like that.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.119
Peck and Brown look at each
other and say, he's our guy.

00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:18.410
We're going to spend the money.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.430
We're going to get
this puppy patented.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:25.390
And as a result, Peck and Brown
put together a set of patents,

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.890
and Tesla becomes famous.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.960
Now, Peck and Brown taught
Tesla an important lesson.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.710
They said, look.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.452
The way we're going to make
money is we're going to patent.

00:25:36.452 --> 00:25:37.410
We're going to promote.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.250
We're going to sell.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.970
So first we're going to
get the very best patent

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.630
lawyer in town, and he's
going to get you outstanding

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:50.040
patents for this design-- a mix
of specific patents and system

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.390
patents.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.910
Next, they said, you're going
to do a series of lectures.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.400
You're going to do a
series of newspaper.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.160
We're going to get
everybody excited.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.670
We're going to have
them go, oh, my God.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.390
This is the greatest
thing since sliced bread.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:06.560
And then when the
hype peaks, we're

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.360
going to sell to
the highest bidder.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.380
In this case, it was
George Westinghouse,

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.427
and Tesla basically
walked away with the cash.

00:26:14.427 --> 00:26:16.510
This is a strategy that's
very different than what

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.000
we attribute to most inventors.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.020
Most inventors, like
Edison, we assume

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.220
made their money because they
actually integrated forward

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.340
and decided that they had to
manufacture their inventions.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:31.090
If you look at the self-help
literature in the 19th century,

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.640
essentially, the
self-help literature says,

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.390
manufacturing is for suckers.

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.840
What you want to do is
get control of your idea,

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.620
sell it to somebody who actually
has the industrial capability

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.570
to manufacture your invention.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.750
You don't want to get
into manufacturing

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.430
if you can humanly help it.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.330
That's what Tesla did.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:57.260
So Tesla goes to Westinghouse,
spends about nine months

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.230
at Westinghouse, working on the
routine engineering problems,

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:03.110
and basically says,
this isn't for me.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.680
So what do you do?

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.470
There's no Disneyland,
so what do you do?

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.712
Well, if you're Tesla you go,
in 1889, to the Paris World's

00:27:09.712 --> 00:27:11.170
Fair, which is,
indeed, the World's

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.400
Fair where the Eiffel
Tower is unveiled.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.320
And there he, depending on how
you want to think about it,

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.320
he drinks absinthe or he drinks
coffee with graduate students

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.380
in physics and
electrical engineering.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.000
He meets one who studied
with [INAUDIBLE],

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.640
got his PhD with
[INAUDIBLE] in Paris, and is

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.500
on his way to study with this
guy, Heinrich Hertz in Germany.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.470
And Tesla says to the
graduate student, so what

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.665
are you going to work with
when you get to Hertz?

00:27:35.665 --> 00:27:38.250
And the student says, I'm
going to work with Hertz

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:43.510
because Hertz has figured
out that there are, indeed,

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.450
electromagnetic waves
that are invisible.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.260
James Clerk Maxwell,
in the late 1860s,

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.830
does for electricity
and magnetism and light

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.180
what Newton did for mechanics.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.850
That is to say, he
developed a series

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.770
of laws, a set of
principles, that

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.610
organized the whole darn thing.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.550
Maxwell says that if you
look at my equations,

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.440
they predict that there
are waves that are not

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.890
visible to the human eye.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.930
And everybody says,
well, that's nice.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.340
So where are they?

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.350
Hertz, probably the
best experimentalist

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.720
of the late 19th century,
student of Helmholtz,

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.755
basically says at his laboratory
in the University of Bonn,

00:28:26.755 --> 00:28:27.380
he says, right.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.030
Bring on the toughest problem.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:33.210
And Hertz figures out how
to detect those radio waves,

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.090
those electromagnetic waves.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.050
And he does so
using an apparatus

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.670
that you see up there.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:43.660
And most of this apparatus,
all this stuff up here,

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:51.760
is a telegraph key
and a Ruhmkorff coil,

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.450
a transformer with two
windings on the same core.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.430
And down here, this thing
that looks like an earring,

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:58.560
is the receiver.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.190
And Hertz walked around his
laboratory with this ring,

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.690
and he basically
detected radio waves

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:10.810
because whenever there
was a spark here at h,

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:15.330
there was a spark here
at l in the receiver.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.080
So Tesla finds out
about all of this.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.250
Now, you're a good inventor.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:22.320
What do you do when you see a
scientific discovery like this?

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.280
Well, you want to soup it up.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.290
And that's exactly
what Tesla did,

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:30.590
is the Tesla coil that
we all know and love.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:33.910
And depending on how I
travel, I often bring,

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:35.957
for demonstrations like
this, a Tesla coil.

00:29:35.957 --> 00:29:38.040
But I wasn't sure whether
I'd ever actually get it

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:38.800
in the building.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.260
I probably could have gotten
it in the building here today.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.340
But this is a Tesla
coil down here,

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.670
which is essentially a
high-frequency, high-voltage

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.840
transformer, all
the parts of which

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.900
are tuned to get maximum, high
voltage, high frequency out

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:53.400
of it.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:58.605
And it's all based on souping
up the Hertz apparatus.

00:29:58.605 --> 00:30:00.480
So what do you do with
electromagnetic waves?

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.521
Now, notice, I'm calling
it electromagnetic waves

00:30:02.521 --> 00:30:04.970
because radio is a
term that only comes

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.570
into use about 1903 or 1904.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.640
So if we're talking
before that period,

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.326
we've got to talk about them
either as Hertzian waves or E

00:30:12.326 --> 00:30:14.080
and M waves.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.240
Tesla says, hey,
I'm a power guy.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.310
I made motors.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.220
I'm going to do something
on the power side.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.580
I'm not really worried about
this communication stuff.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.420
And everybody else
in this time period

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.750
that knew about Maxwell's
work and Hertz's work

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.490
was also interested
in power applications.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.870
Tesla says, here's
what we're going to do.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:37.610
If you have a Tesla coil and you
have a Geissler tube near it,

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.914
it instantaneously goes off.

00:30:39.914 --> 00:30:41.830
It starts lighting up,
all by its little self.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.140
Every time the Tesla
coil discharges,

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.030
you get a flash in
the Geissler tube.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.220
And the Geissler tube
is basically filled.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.867
It's a tube that you basically
take all the air out of it.

00:30:53.867 --> 00:30:56.200
And then you put a little
bit, a little bit of something

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.690
like argon or neon gas inside.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.440
So it's like a neon tube.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.370
So Tesla said, I'm going to
make an entire wireless lighting

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.390
system around that.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.560
And here, he's
demonstrating it in New York

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.970
at Columbia College in 1891.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:14.780
He's got two big zinc
plates on either side.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.460
They're connected to a
Tesla coil that's over here.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.550
He's about to take these tubes
that are about, like, this

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.770
long, and the lights
are going to go out.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.930
And he's going to step
between those two plates.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:27.890
The plates are
charged, and he's going

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:30.450
to start waving
these giant tubes.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.770
And they're going to
light up, wirelessly.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.760
In other words, you're
not going to need

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.210
any of these annoying wires.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.660
You could have a wireless
lighting system in your home.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.680
And Tesla's vision was that you
would have metallic wallpaper.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.320
And you would basically
have your lights on stands.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.800
And you would just
rotate the light

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.150
so it was aligned with
the electromagnetic field

00:31:55.150 --> 00:32:00.450
of the two plates or the two
sides of your living room.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.490
So he thought it was
a pretty good idea.

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:04.490
He goes on ahead
in the mid 1890s.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.740
He patents it, and
he promotes his ideas

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.320
through a series of lectures,
private demonstrations.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.440
He invites people, good
friends like Mark Twain,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.660
to come and play
with the apparatus.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.960
And that, indeed,
is Twain, holding

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.800
about a hula-hoop-sized coil
over a Tesla transformer.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.920
And there's a little light
bulb right about right

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.170
where his belly button is.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:28.000
And the electricity that is
translated to the hula hoop

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.020
that you can see
causes that light bulb

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.650
to basically illuminate.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.520
But he's got the right
idea in the wrong moment.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.160
In the 1890s, there
is a major recession

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.270
following the panic of 1893.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:48.080
Nobody is able to raise money
for any new high-tech ventures,

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.570
and nobody comes forward
to develop this idea.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:54.350
Tesla experiments with a couple
of other ideas, with x-rays,

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:58.430
with radio-controlled
boats, but finally realizes

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.460
that he's got to
rethink wireless power.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.730
OK, now, you've
all seen pictures

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.430
of radio waves or radio towers.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:13.180
And they that at the
top of the radio tower

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.980
there's these concentric
spheres radiating out that

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.130
show you that the energy comes
off the top of a radio tower

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.134
and it goes in all directions.

00:33:23.134 --> 00:33:24.800
And we really do mean
in all directions.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.760
So it goes to the left.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.635
It goes to the right.

00:33:26.635 --> 00:33:28.090
It goes up.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:28.930
It goes down.

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:29.880
It goes to Mars.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.700
It goes to Jupiter.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.522
It goes everywhere.

00:33:31.522 --> 00:33:33.480
This annoyed the living
daylights out of Tesla.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:38.680
He said, boys, girls, 99% of
the energy goes off into space.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:42.550
And only maybe 1% ever
gets to your receiver.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.070
This is a bad idea.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.160
Tesla said, no, no, no, no.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.990
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:52.710
to reconfigure our
transmitter circuits

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.030
so that we minimize the
amount of energy that goes up

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:59.565
to the antenna, and
we maximize the energy

00:33:59.565 --> 00:34:02.690
that goes into the earth,
the ground current.

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.270
So what was Tesla thinking?

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:08.659
OK, on the top is how
Marconi, Lodge, everybody else

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:12.620
in electrical
engineering in the 1890s

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.759
thought about how radio worked.

00:34:15.759 --> 00:34:16.800
So you got a transmitter.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.880
You pump all the
energy up the antenna.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.570
It goes across through the
ether, beep, beep, beep,

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:26.710
beep, from the transmitter's
antenna to the receiver

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:31.550
and is there converted into
music, into voice, whatever.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:35.360
And both the receiver and
the transmitter are grounded,

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.360
so you have a complete
circuit that runs like this.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.770
Thinking like a true maverick,
Tesla said, everybody's

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.790
got so hung up on the details.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.909
This actually works
the other way.

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:49.310
As my English wife would
say, it's not clockwise.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.294
It's anticlockwise.

00:34:51.294 --> 00:34:52.960
What you want to do
with the transmitter

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.210
is you want to pump energy,
oscillating electric currents,

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:57.690
into the ground.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.340
The energy goes
from the transmitter

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.881
through the ground,
beep, beep, beep,

00:35:00.881 --> 00:35:04.610
beep, to the ground connection
underneath the receiver.

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:09.030
The receiver processes it,
either for voice or messages

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:11.540
or for power applications.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.650
And you have some
sort of circuit

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.620
that is completed in
the high atmosphere,

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.340
as far as Tesla was concerned.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:23.510
To prove this idea he goes
in 1899 to Colorado Springs.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:27.780
And while he's there, he becomes
convinced that this whole thing

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.690
is actually going to work.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.040
On the left-hand
side, you see there

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.570
his transmitter, which
consisted of a giant Tesla coil.

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:39.470
The primary, or the
coil, was basically

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.850
at the top of this
fence right here.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.630
And it constituted a circle.

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.610
It was almost 50
feet in diameter.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:49.920
The secondary of the
Tesla coil was over here,

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.249
and it basically
generated energy

00:35:52.249 --> 00:35:53.540
that was pumped into the earth.

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.470
Now, because you
couldn't see anything

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.220
when the energy was
pumped into the earth,

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.020
they adjusted the coils
so that for the purposes

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:06.200
of these publicity photographs,
all the energy comes up,

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.470
goes to the ball.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:13.910
And basically the
electrical voltages

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:17.120
are so high that
you ionize the air.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.190
And you get these
sparks across the way,

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.750
and they're picked up by
a coil that you can't see.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:24.190
It's just outside the
frame of this picture.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:28.310
Now, Tesla thought that this
would give people a good idea

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.800
of how much power is involved.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.580
By the way, Tesla tells
us in his notebooks

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:39.240
that this photograph here
is a trick photograph.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.460
That is to say it was
made on a glass plate

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.550
and was done with two exposures.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:46.680
The first exposure is, before
any of the electrical machinery

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.080
was turned on, Tesla sits there
and very calmly reads the book,

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.730
you know, probably
Maxwell's equations.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:56.410
Then, he gets out of the chair.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.040
And before they crank it up
and have hundreds of thousands

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.520
of volts going through the
air, he's out of the way.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.060
So this is a trick
photograph, but the point

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.510
is he wanted to create the
illusion of the power that

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:12.800
was being moved or manipulated
at Colorado Springs.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.200
Out in the pastures,
out in the fields right

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.760
next to Colorado Springs, this
was a typical sort of receiver.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.220
This is a great
big coil, and you

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.150
can see that energy is
wireless, truly, transmitted.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.510
And it makes this little light
bulbs light up down there.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.260
Curious thing about
Colorado Springs

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.220
is every time Tesla
got evidence that

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.990
confirmed that energy
passed through the earth,

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.860
he was happy.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.960
He never tried to torture
test his experiments

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.920
and disconfirm his hypothesis.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:48.070
1900, Tesla returns to New York
City and announces to the world

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.960
that he is going
to transmit energy

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:54.490
and messages across the Atlantic
Ocean in eight months time.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.680
He basically
publishes an article

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.880
in the equivalent of
today's "New Yorker,"

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.324
"The Century Magazine,"
that explains

00:38:01.324 --> 00:38:02.990
that he has invented
everything you ever

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:04.823
need to know about
energy and how it's going

00:38:04.823 --> 00:38:07.460
to change human civilization.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.370
He lives the life of a winner.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:12.640
He moves into the
Waldorf Astoria Hotel.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.040
He wears the best clothes.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.570
He strides down Fifth
Avenue like a peacock.

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:21.100
He eats dinner at
the best restaurants.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:24.320
And to some extent, I would
say as a biographer, what's

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.229
going on in his mind
is the following.

00:38:26.229 --> 00:38:28.770
If you say all the right things,
you do all the right things,

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:31.400
you're interviewed, you're
seen with all the right people,

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.570
then everything will
fall into place.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:35.770
If you get the illusion
that you're a winner,

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:39.529
then you will be a winner.

00:38:39.529 --> 00:38:41.070
The scheme works to
a certain extent.

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:44.520
In 1901 he secures
from JP Morgan,

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:49.730
the most powerful banker on
Wall Street, a loan of $150,000.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:54.420
And to secure the loan,
Tesla offers and signs off

00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:00.410
on giving Morgan 51%
of the patent rights.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:04.590
Tesla fills in and
says, I'll give you 51%.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:06.080
Morgan doesn't ask for this.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.870
Tesla decides to give it to him.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:08.410
Why?

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:11.270
In part, because he's
hoping that Morgan

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.650
will be the good
business partner

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:18.340
that Peck and Brown were
a decade or so earlier.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:22.180
With that money, Tesla
builds, out on the North Shore

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.280
of Long Island, about 60
miles from New York City,

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.980
a new experimental
station at Wardencylffe.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.380
This building is still standing.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.046
This is the building
that if some of you

00:39:32.046 --> 00:39:35.170
know that the oat meal
did a Kickstarter campaign

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:40.110
a few years back in 2012.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.100
This is the building
that they rescued.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.480
This is the tower.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.980
And the important
thing is everybody

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.750
gets all worked up
about the power.

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:51.980
What's actually important is
there was a 120-foot-deep shaft

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.450
underneath the tower, which is
where Tesla anticipated he was

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:58.040
going to pump the energy in.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.210
And as he said, Tesla
often said, in order

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:03.160
to get a grip on the
earth and shake it.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.440
So what happens?

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:09.400
Everybody says that Tesla and
Edison had a terrible rivalry.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.070
My friends, the rivalry
that really counted

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:18.320
was between Tesla and Marconi.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.650
Tesla thought Marconi
was a Johnny-cone-lately,

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:25.522
good-for-nothing, low-life punk.

00:40:25.522 --> 00:40:26.980
And those are just
the things I can

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.600
repeat in a public audience.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.550
Marconi watches
Tesla like a hawk.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:40.200
Marconi begins working on
basically his idea for wireless

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.950
telegraphy, sending
dots and dashes

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:47.220
using electromagnetic
waves, beginning in 1895.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.625
Marconi does it by
first sending it a mile,

00:40:49.625 --> 00:40:53.320
5 miles, 50 miles,
eventually, 100 miles.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:58.770
By 1901, Marconi realizes
that if he's going to win,

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:01.560
he's going to have to
beat Tesla in getting

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.510
a message across
the Atlantic first.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:08.190
And in December of 1901,
Marconi and his assistant

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:12.610
George Kemp are sitting,
freezing their butts off,

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.590
in Saint John's, Newfoundland.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:18.430
And they hear,
faintly, the Morse code

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:21.600
signal for the letter S,
which Marconi had arranged

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.570
for his station on the
other side of the Atlantic,

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:30.060
in Cornwall, England, to
send at regular intervals.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.770
December 12, they
hear the signal.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:37.540
On December 14,
December 12's a Friday.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.930
Sunday is, hence, the 14th.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.990
Its front page new in
"The New York Times."

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:48.170
Pardon me, Marconi is regarded
as the new inventor of radio.

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:50.560
Tesla is a has-been.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:56.360
Now, you took $150,000
from the most powerful man

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.220
on Wall Street.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.930
You promised to be the
first to cross the Atlantic,

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:06.080
and this Italian
punk beats you to it.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.230
What are you going
to say to JP Morgan?

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.980
How are you going
to deal with this?

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:18.800
Most of us would probably run
and hide behind the nearest

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.320
thing we could find.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:25.500
Tesla had a unique mix
of bravado and courage

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.780
that fascinates me every
time I tell this story.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:37.160
In February of 1902, Tesla says,
we're going to one up Marconi.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:42.260
And he says, Mr.
Morgan, don't worry

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.260
about what Marconi is up to.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:49.510
The major opportunity is
a world telegraphy system.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:53.810
Imagine, if you will,
that outside every city

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.970
is a transmission plant
like Wardenclyffe.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.740
And at those plants,
you send out,

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:04.250
by wire or by other means,
all the telegrams that you

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.930
need to send, all of the
stock quotations, all

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:11.850
of the telephone messages,
all of the fax messages

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:15.920
that you want to send, all of
the electronic information.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:20.380
You tag it with
different frequencies,

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.820
and you pump it into the earth.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:29.180
Everybody around the world
will have their own receiver

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:33.537
in their pocket, no bigger
than a pocket watch,

00:43:33.537 --> 00:43:35.620
and they will be able to
receive the messages that

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.150
are relevant to them.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.307
The whole Earth is like
a brain, as it were,

00:43:40.307 --> 00:43:42.140
and the capacity of
this system is infinite.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.700
You see, Mr. Morgan, the
revolutionary character

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.800
of this idea, it's
civilizing potency,

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.780
it's tremendous
money-making power.

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:59.610
Tesla had a vision in 1902
of an information revolution,

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.330
but not an
information revolution

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:02.580
that was business to business.

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:04.710
That's what everybody
else was talking about.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:07.040
This was going to be an
information revolution

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:12.330
about individual
consumers, that everybody

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:16.860
would benefit by having access
to vast amounts of information.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:22.580
Now, Tesla did not have
any idea about smartphones,

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:25.810
about the world wide web,
about search algorithms.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:28.800
He didn't understand
that, but he had a vision

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.830
that the 20th century, and
indeed the 21st century,

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:36.260
was going to be about
information for everyone.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:41.270
Consider this newspaper
story that comes from 1904.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:43.130
There's his Wardenclyffe Tower.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:46.000
Now, the author is
taking some liberties

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.500
in showing that radio
waves or signals are

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.120
going from the tower,
not through the earth,

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.059
but to individuals.

00:44:52.059 --> 00:44:53.350
But look what's happening here.

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:55.230
You could be out
on a camping trip,

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:56.680
and you could take
your tent pole,

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.910
hold it up, and get information.

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:02.370
You could be out on your yacht.

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.782
This is a middle class or
upper middle class vision.

00:45:04.782 --> 00:45:06.490
You'd be out on your
yacht, and you could

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:09.380
get signals via your mast.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.950
Or my all time favorite
is the one in the middle.

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:16.930
You could be a lady on vacation
in the Berkshires, Saratoga,

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:18.990
and you want to know
the latest social news

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:21.040
from New York City or Boston.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.160
You just hold up
your parasol, and you

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.500
can collect the information
on some sort of receiver

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.280
that you've got in your pocket
or your purse or somewhere

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.830
else.

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:38.010
Tesla saw a consumer revolution
in 1902 for information.

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:42.210
Now, Tesla fully understood that
you weren't going to make money

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.380
selling the information.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.230
The information was
going to be for free.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:48.370
You folks in this room know
all about dual-sided business

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:48.870
models.

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.020
You give away the
information for free,

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.010
and you collect the
money somewhere else.

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.594
Google does it
through advertising.

00:45:54.594 --> 00:45:56.510
Morgan and Tesla thought
that they would do it

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:58.730
by basically selling
the receivers,

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:00.930
manufacturing and
selling the receivers.

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:03.630
Morgan, up to a point,
agreed with all of this.

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:07.630
And then something
happened on Wall Street.

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:11.900
A series of low
lives, particularly

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:15.300
Lee de Forest and Abraham
White, set up their own radio

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:15.890
companies.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.990
And de Forest was the first
guy to use the word radio.

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:21.700
And they basically
created companies,

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.360
promised to build
technological systems,

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.620
and never delivered on
the systems that they had.

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.350
So, basically, it was
a stock market scam.

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:35.130
They'd sell the stock, and then
they'd run away with the money.

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:39.090
This created a crisis on
Wall Street, a small crisis.

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:43.430
And Morgan and other financiers
said, in Tesla's own words,

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:46.350
that they would not
touch wireless companies

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:51.560
with a 20-foot pole, that
they were just bad news.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:54.090
And in 1903, Morgan
pulls out of the deal

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:55.830
that he has with Tesla.

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:59.550
Tesla continues to
look for other support,

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:03.220
but we have to go
back to that 51% deal.

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.290
Tesla basically had
given Morgan 51%.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:14.930
Morgan said, if you get money
from anybody else, that's fine.

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:19.060
But I still get
51% of the revenue.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.920
So other investors
who were looking

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.956
say, why are we going to put in
money if half the money or more

00:47:24.956 --> 00:47:26.830
than half the money is
going to go to Morgan,

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:28.400
and he's a silent partner?

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.580
We're not interested.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.430
Because he structured
the deal the wrong way,

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:37.230
Tesla was out of luck.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:42.280
In the meantime, the press,
newspapers, technical journals,

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:47.710
had celebrated Tesla as the
second wizard, only second to

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:51.490
maybe Edison, or equal to
Edison, all through the 1890s,

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:52.900
all through the early 1900s.

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:59.030
Around 1904, 1905, the
press flips and decides

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:01.440
that he's a has-been.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.210
He's a visionary and a poet.

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:10.558
In this time period--
1904, 1905-- Tesla

00:48:10.558 --> 00:48:14.420
continues to fire off absolutely
crazy letters to Morgan.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:16.657
Some of them are
just so sycophantic.

00:48:16.657 --> 00:48:17.990
They just make your flesh crawl.

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:19.360
You go, oh, don't say that.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.943
And then there's
others, like, I can't

00:48:20.943 --> 00:48:23.374
believe you're not helping me.

00:48:23.374 --> 00:48:24.790
You know, and
Morgan just decides,

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:26.380
I'm not going to
deal with this guy.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:27.545
This guy is a nutcase.

00:48:27.545 --> 00:48:30.460
At the same time,
Tesla's closest friend,

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:35.430
Richmond Hobson, that he's
really, really close to,

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:38.310
decides, yes, he's going to
marry a woman named Grizelda.

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:40.440
Sorry.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.410
And Hobson wants to
run for Congress,

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:48.670
and so he needs to basically
be an upstanding, married guy.

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:53.190
And so Hobson
basically leaves Tesla.

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:57.020
And Tesla writes letters to
friends that basically indicate

00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.540
that he's probably suffering
from mental depression

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:04.420
and nervous breakdown, and
he signs them Nikola Busted.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.780
The last part of Tesla's
life is fairly sad.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.580
He dies in 1943.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.730
And he works on a couple
of things in the 1910s,

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:15.040
such as a bladeless
steam turbine

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.230
and some other minor inventions.

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:20.590
In the 1930s, he gets a
certain amount of publicity.

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:23.130
He announces that he's
developed a particle beam

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:27.520
weapon that can protect America
from long-range bombers.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.750
And that results in,
shortly after his death,

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:33.230
that the FBI spends a brief
amount of time checking

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:35.970
his papers, decides that there
is, really, no particle beam

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:37.530
weapon.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:43.460
But it sets up conspiracy
fans unto this day

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:46.140
that are convinced that there
was a particle beam weapon.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:50.650
And in the 1950s, his papers
go to the people of Yugoslavia

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:53.550
as a gift from
the US government.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.120
As I said in the
beginning, Tesla,

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.910
inventor, entrepreneur, artist.

00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:59.900
He was an inventor.

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.910
One great success,
one great vision--

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:05.870
the alternating current
motor, wireless power--

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.340
in looking at these
things, whatever made him

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:12.310
a success also contributed
to his problems

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:13.640
with wireless power.

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:16.420
The mix of ideal and illusion--
he's an entrepreneur.

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:18.550
I want you to walk
away and sort of say,

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:20.360
this is a guy who
really understood

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:23.359
the strategy of patenting,
promoting, and selling.

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:24.400
And where do we see this?

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:29.450
We see this time and again when,
basically, people do IPOs out

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:30.430
in Silicon Valley.

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:32.010
They get good
intellectual property.

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:33.070
They promote it.

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:36.500
And they do the IPO,
and they sell it out.

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.260
He's an artist, not a scientist.

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.960
He's concerned
about the meaning.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.600
What are people going to
think about my inventions?

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.020
How are they going to use it?

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:48.570
And his inventions came,
back to those dreams,

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:51.530
from an inner
ideal that he hoped

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:55.590
to impose on the world, a very
different sort of strategy

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:58.340
than most engineers or
other inventors use.

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:02.590
Tesla was a visionary leader.

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:06.950
We often say that necessity
is the mother of invention.

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:09.510
But I say to you,
breakthrough technologies

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:13.940
don't come with well-defined,
preexisting needs.

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.940
The connection
between the design

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:20.930
of the technology and this
ultimate social or economic use

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:24.700
is brokered, is
shaped, by inventors,

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:28.180
by the ability for
inventors or entrepreneurs

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.850
to tell powerful
stories that locate

00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:35.210
that device with a
set of uses or wishes

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:39.280
that individual consumers have.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.710
And that process is
often complicated.

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:44.660
And as Arthur C. Clarke said,
any sufficiently advanced

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:47.260
technology will appear as magic.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.940
The connections that
individuals like Tesla make

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:57.940
are not always easy to discern.

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.430
Let me stop at this slide.

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:02.804
What's Tesla's legacy?

00:52:02.804 --> 00:52:04.220
If you look at a
picture like this

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:07.800
that shows electric lights
on all over the world,

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:14.290
probably 99%, if not 99.99%,
of all the energy that's

00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:17.540
used to power those electric
lights is done by alternating

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:21.190
current, is done by
using multi-phased power,

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:23.140
all of which Tesla invented.

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:24.540
I appreciate your time.

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:28.120
I suspect I've gone on
a little bit longer,

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:31.420
and I'd be happy to answer any
questions that you might have.

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.844
And thanks so much.

00:52:33.844 --> 00:52:36.736
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.170
Questions?

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:45.269
AUDIENCE: So why aren't
we ever transmitting power

00:52:45.269 --> 00:52:46.060
through the ground?

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:49.240
Was he just completely
wrong about the ground part,

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:53.810
or did we just get
distracted and, you know?

00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:55.422
BERNARD CARLSON:
OK, so one version

00:52:55.422 --> 00:52:57.630
would sort of say that we
didn't just get distracted,

00:52:57.630 --> 00:53:01.100
but it wasn't a good
business proposition

00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:06.020
for fat-cat capitalists,
like Morgan or Edison,

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:09.560
to basically get rid of
the copper-wire systems.

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:14.160
Now, I don't buy the business
explanation for this.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:18.579
And to explain what
actually happened--

00:53:18.579 --> 00:53:20.370
and there are still
people working on this.

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:23.930
There are people--
just bear with me here

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:27.090
as I find t he right slide.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:31.590
Let's be clear that wireless
power works in certain ways.

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:36.340
So, for example,
through the 1990s,

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:41.200
the US Navy used extremely
low-frequency radio waves

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.560
that could travel
through what's called

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.690
the Schumann cavity,
which is the cavity that

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:51.080
is between the ionosphere and
deep into the Earth's crust.

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.000
And the waves would bounce
through that cavity,

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.580
and you could be
in radio contact

00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:00.180
with nuclear subs that
were deep in the ocean.

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.350
And you could send
them a happy signal

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:05.440
so that they could be in touch.

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.440
And, indeed, where I lived
in Northern Michigan,

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.460
I taught for a few
years at Michigan Tech.

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:11.870
And about 100 miles to
the west of Michigan,

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:15.180
they built this huge,
110-mile antenna array

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:17.920
at Clam Lake, Wisconsin.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:21.510
And it, indeed, was
the way that the navy

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:23.470
kept in touch with the subs.

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:27.190
So you can send radio
waves, you can send energy,

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:30.940
through the earth, and
that's what this illustrates.

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:33.420
A company that's
actually got roots here

00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:38.830
in Cambridge and at MIT
actually uses a wireless system,

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:41.960
at least over short
range, to, as you can see,

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:47.080
charge up cell phones that
are parked on a little tray.

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.520
And there's a coil, which is
the transmitter, in the tray,

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.210
and then there's a coil
that's in a substitute

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:56.650
back on the phone that
allows you to charge it up.

00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:58.880
The vision is that
you'll be able to walk

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.000
into your office or
your home at some point,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.500
and you won't even have to take
the phone out of your pocket

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.198
or out of your purse.

00:55:05.198 --> 00:55:06.656
The phone will just
sense that it's

00:55:06.656 --> 00:55:09.960
in an electromagnetic field,
and it will charge itself.

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:14.380
So over short distances,
there's probably wireless power

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:19.900
applications that we'll see used
more widely in our lifetime.

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.690
Now, could you do this
all over the world?

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:27.890
All right, now, the
answer, I think, is no.

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:30.200
But remember, I'm a historian.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:33.850
I'm not an engineering guy.

00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:40.110
The problem is, as I say, is
the Earth like a water balloon

00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:40.980
or like an ocean?

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:44.620
Tesla thought that the Earth
was like a water balloon, which

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:47.520
it was filled with an
incompressible fluid.

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:51.160
And if you pumped, like he
shows on the left-hand side,

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:56.360
at a certain frequency, i.e. the
resonant frequency of the Earth

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.000
or the water
balloon, eventually,

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.400
you'd reach the point where
with each subsequent stroke

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:06.850
of the little pump, you'd
have water popping out

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:08.330
of these one-way valves.

00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:10.816
Now, we're using a
hydraulic analogy here.

00:56:10.816 --> 00:56:12.690
Tesla, of course, is
talking about doing this

00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:14.410
with electrical energy.

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:20.790
The problem is, how
does the Earth respond

00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:23.100
to that electrical energy?

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.200
Is the Earth like an
incompressible fluid,

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.960
or is it like a
compressible fluid?

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.580
In other words, is
the situation such

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.170
that if you threw a
rock into the ocean,

00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:34.880
the waves don't
travel from where

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.850
I grew up in New Jersey
all the way to Spain?

00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:42.510
Eventually, through
friction in the fluid, i.e.

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:44.910
the ocean, the waves peter out.

00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:48.360
And that's how the
Earth actually responds

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.940
to electromagnetic waves.

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.810
OK, so that's my understanding.

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:56.040
Now, you've hopped up in the
middle of this, my good sir.

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.497
You've got a great
question for me.

00:56:58.497 --> 00:57:00.080
AUDIENCE: OK, so
you've studied Tesla.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:03.400
You must have come across
this article, well, interview

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.085
transcription, from
1899 with John Smith.

00:57:06.085 --> 00:57:06.960
BERNARD CARLSON: Yes.

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.918
AUDIENCE: OK, so it sounds
to me like he really

00:57:08.918 --> 00:57:14.130
conflates electromagnetism
and spirituality to an excess.

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:15.560
He sounds like a nut case to me.

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.160
What would be your
assessment of that?

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:21.590
BERNARD CARLSON: OK, so the
musical composer, Phil Klein,

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:23.750
within the last, like,
two or three weeks,

00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:24.950
sent me this article.

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:29.770
So I've only skimmed it, and
I am trying to figure it out.

00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:38.330
But my gut reaction is
this article is a hoax.

00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:42.800
I don't think it's the real deal
because I've spent 15 years,

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:46.830
and I'm pretty sure I've seen
most of the critical stuff

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:47.680
on Tesla.

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:52.500
And there is no provenance
associated with this article.

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.980
It's not like, oh, it came
from "The New York Times"

00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:57.560
and it was published on
such and such a date.

00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.840
But I have to say,
I haven't actually

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:03.150
done all, as the lawyers would
say, the due diligence on this.

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:09.670
Now, there is a certain amount
of interesting interweaving

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:13.790
of different things if you go
back to that "Century" article

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:17.970
that Tesla published in
1900 about the future

00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:20.710
of electrical energy
and human civilization.

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:23.850
And when I actually do this,
sort of the Smith article,

00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:26.550
if you will, the
Smith interview is

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:29.330
as I'm going to be looking
at it in parallel with what

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:33.050
Tesla says and how Tesla
says things in the "Century"

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:34.720
article.

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.310
So I'm not convinced.

00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:39.740
Tesla had a big vision,
but I'm not sure

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:41.450
that I'm convinced
that the Smith

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:43.440
interview is the real deal.

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:45.010
Sir, I got you warmed up.

00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:47.770
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks, so
Tesla must have been aware

00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:50.450
of the inverse square law
because Maxwell's equations had

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:52.470
already been published.

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:54.320
But you were also
noting how he was more

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.050
of an artist than a tinkerer.

00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:57.640
So when thinking
about things like,

00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:59.390
I'm going to transmit
to the entire Earth,

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:00.554
was he thinking about that?

00:59:00.554 --> 00:59:02.220
Or did he just think
he could, you know,

00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:04.580
think his way beyond it?

00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:06.560
BERNARD CARLSON: OK,
an absolutely spot on

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:11.250
question-- he didn't believe
that the inverse square law

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:13.550
applied to the
propagation of the waves

00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:16.380
that he was generating.

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:22.690
Now, his big idea
was he was going

00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:25.500
to set up in the Earth,
if you're at Colorado

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.560
Springs, stationary waves.

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:30.560
In other words, you'd hit
the resonant frequency

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:31.101
of the Earth.

00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:33.130
And this room is perfect.

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:34.800
You know, I can see it.

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.200
I apologize if you have
to turn around and back.

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.810
But he imagined that there would
be a wave travelling through

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:43.890
the Earth, much like the way
the lighting is on that wall.

00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:48.030
If, he figured, I set
up this stationary wave,

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:52.010
there are minimal energy
losses as the energy moves

00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:53.590
through the crust of the Earth.

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.720
So he thought that
the inverse square law

00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.560
didn't apply in his situation.

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.775
Obviously, it does, and that
was one of the problems.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:06.470
Tesla was an individual
who actually worked out

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:07.630
all of this stuff.

01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:10.500
He thought that what
he was observing

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:14.270
in electromagnetic waves was
not transverse waves, again,

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:16.590
like you see, or
which is approximated

01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:18.320
by the lights on the wall.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.800
But he actually
thought that you had

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.240
the waves that were
longitudinal waves like you

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.370
have in a slinky.

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:27.360
In other words, they're
like sound waves.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.960
And Tesla was so sure of this
that he actually went to Hertz

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.160
and visited him and hold
Hertz that Hertz was wrong.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.970
Now, where this gets really
deep and complicated,

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:44.910
and I'm about to, you know,
basically put on my water wings

01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:46.180
to say this.

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:49.110
If you get into a big
discussion with people

01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:53.930
about electromagnetic
propagation,

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:57.360
they will tell you that
Maxwell's equations--

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.380
some will tell you that
Maxwell's equations predict

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:04.030
that there are two parts
to the propagation.

01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:06.840
There is the
transverse wave, which

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.850
is what we think about
most of the time,

01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:14.060
but there is also a scalar
wave that goes with it.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.830
And depending on
who you talk to,

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:18.970
some people would say
that Tesla had it right,

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:24.360
that more of the electromagnetic
propagation phenomenon

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.440
is about scalar waves and
not electromagnetic waves.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.820
Sadly, these people
then immediately go off

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.510
onto this sort of
conspiracy thing

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:36.280
which is, once again, that RCA
and Marconi and other people

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:41.170
had basically suppressed the
truth about scalar waves.

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:45.659
Now, every time I
want to know-- I'm

01:01:45.659 --> 01:01:47.200
a professor in an
engineering school.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.990
Every time I want to know
about scalar, the scalar

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:52.399
dimension of
electromagnetic propagation,

01:01:52.399 --> 01:01:54.440
I go see my friends in
the electrical engineering

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:54.940
department.

01:01:54.940 --> 01:02:02.440
They kind of look at me
like, I don't know, dude.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:07.830
We're talking, like, serious
electrical engineering

01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:08.519
theology.

01:02:08.519 --> 01:02:10.560
I don't know whether we're
going to actually talk

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.420
to you about this.

01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:17.790
There may be something
to this, but it

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:20.390
is beyond the scope
of what I understand.

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:23.122
But you hit it spot on, and
I appreciate you bringing up

01:02:23.122 --> 01:02:24.080
the inverse square law.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.660
Tesla did not believe
the inverse square law

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.210
applied to him.

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:35.120
Great, all righty, let me
turn around and say to you,

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.700
I think this is a guy that
talks about the information

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.264
revolution.

01:02:38.264 --> 01:02:40.430
This is somebody who's
talking about the information

01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:48.960
revolution in ways that Google
is acting on, day in, day out,

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.710
this notion that
information should

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:53.540
be broadly available to
lots and lots of people.

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:57.080
And how are you
going to deliver it

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.300
in ways that are
good for the people

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:03.730
but also profitable
for the company?

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:08.280
I mean, does this
resonate with you folks,

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.490
or am I saying something
that's like, dude, it's

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:16.400
like the water we swim in,
nothing really to say about it?

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.930
But I kind of want to stick
him in there, you know,

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:23.820
that he's about a
different sort of story

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:28.370
about how electrical and
electronic technologies are

01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:29.460
going to change our lives.

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.030
He's not an Edison character.

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:33.820
And there's reasons
why he's often

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:36.040
thrown into contrast
with Edison because Tesla

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:41.780
had a very different
social vision than Edison.

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:44.880
But you all have
day jobs to go to.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.690
I'm doing my day
job, as a teacher,

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:47.720
so thank you very much.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.636
Thanks for coming out.

01:03:48.636 --> 01:03:50.190
I'm happy to sign some books.

01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:53.240
[APPLAUSE]
