- [Voiceover] Hey grammarians,

00:00:01.362 --> 00:00:03.262
I want to talk about prepositions

00:00:03.262 --> 00:00:06.712
but before I do I'm going to
draw you a little hamster.

00:00:12.348 --> 00:00:13.179
Is it a hamster?

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.097
Is it a tiny bear?

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:15.281
Who knows?

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:16.426
We're just going to call it a hamster,

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:19.843
a little rodent type creature.

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:22.765
Now I'm going to use
this critter to establish

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.015
what prepositions are and what they do

00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:28.454
because in addition to
there being a hamster

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:32.193
there's also going to be this box.

00:00:34.777 --> 00:00:35.961
So what prepositions do

00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:39.612
is they establish
relationships between stuff

00:00:39.612 --> 00:00:43.444
in place and time so it can show us

00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:48.444
where things are, when things
are, and how things are.

00:00:52.336 --> 00:00:53.791
Let me demonstrate.

00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:57.610
So, okay, using just
this hamster and this box

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.886
we can move this box around

00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:04.367
and talk about how the hamster
relates to the box, right.

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:07.760
So right now the box is under the hamster,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.511
let's write that down.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:13.958
Right, the box is under the hamster,

00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.188
that word under is a preposition

00:01:16.188 --> 00:01:19.728
because it's establishing
this relationship of where.

00:01:19.728 --> 00:01:22.271
It's connecting the box to the hamster.

00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:26.108
The box is under the hamster.

00:01:30.015 --> 00:01:31.257
But if I move it up like so,

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:35.384
now we can say the box
is over the hamster.

00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:40.033
But let's get rid of the
box and let's imagine

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:44.316
that our hamster is
having a midlife crisis.

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.115
And our hamster decides
it's going to go out

00:01:47.115 --> 00:01:50.795
and it's going to splurge
on a fabulous, new hat,

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:55.795
just an enormous top hat, a
little band in the center,

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:59.074
just a big, old, silly, Abe Lincoln style,

00:01:59.074 --> 00:02:01.984
stove pipe, top hat.

00:02:03.354 --> 00:02:06.100
Now, another use for
prepositions is we can talk about

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.899
when things are in relation to each other.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.899
So I could say, "Before
the hamster got the hat

00:02:14.716 --> 00:02:18.925
"and after the hamster got the hat."

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:21.723
Right, and these words after and before

00:02:21.723 --> 00:02:24.347
express relationships in time.

00:02:24.347 --> 00:02:26.518
But another interesting thing
that prepositions can do

00:02:26.518 --> 00:02:30.186
is they can also help
express how something is

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:33.122
or how it's, what it's
for, what its use is.

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:38.122
So we could say that
this hat is for parties

00:02:39.407 --> 00:02:41.957
or is for wearing at parties.

00:02:41.957 --> 00:02:45.702
Oh, and at, also, is a preposition.

00:02:45.702 --> 00:02:48.171
This hat is for wearing at parties.

00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:53.171
So this is the how and
this part is the where.

00:02:54.964 --> 00:02:56.450
So what's the purpose of the hat?

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.563
Well, we established
that with the word for,

00:02:58.563 --> 00:03:00.195
the hat is for wearing.

00:03:00.195 --> 00:03:02.563
The where is it supposed
to be worn, at parties,

00:03:02.563 --> 00:03:04.335
that's the where.

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:08.409
We can also use a word like of to express

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.409
the how relationship and
that's just sort of to say

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:15.840
what belongs to whom.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.556
So we could say, "That is
the hat of the hamster."

00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:23.556
That is the hat of the hamster.

00:03:25.746 --> 00:03:27.868
So that's what prepositions are

00:03:27.868 --> 00:03:30.256
in the most basic sense they can

00:03:30.256 --> 00:03:32.938
help you figure out
what the relationship is

00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:37.079
between two things in time and space

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.845
or how one thing relates to another.

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:41.609
So you can figure out

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.948
when, where, and how using prepositions.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.576
You can learn anything, David out.
