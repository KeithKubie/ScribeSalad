each other the other thing you could
 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.150
each other the other thing you could
imagine happening is if say general

relativity was not quite right you could

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250
relativity was not quite right you could
 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.980

imagine that the clock rates of the

imagine that the clock rates of the
 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.080
imagine that the clock rates of the
different clocks depended upon we're in

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090
different clocks depended upon we're in
 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.089
different clocks depended upon we're in
the orbit around the Sun we work I mean

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099
the orbit around the Sun we work I mean

what you're talking about is testing

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900
what you're talking about is testing
 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.540
what you're talking about is testing
some of these like absolutely most

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550
some of these like absolutely most
 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.339
some of these like absolutely most
fundamental basic assumptions about how

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349
fundamental basic assumptions about how
 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.409
fundamental basic assumptions about how
the universe works right and the reason

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419
the universe works right and the reason

we want to do that with clocks is that

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729
we want to do that with clocks is that
 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.040
we want to do that with clocks is that
fundamentally these are the most

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050
fundamentally these are the most
 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.140
fundamentally these are the most
accurate measurement devices we've ever

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150
accurate measurement devices we've ever
 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.520
accurate measurement devices we've ever
built so we can make more accurate

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530
built so we can make more accurate
 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.219
built so we can make more accurate
measurements this way and really precise

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229
measurements this way and really precise
