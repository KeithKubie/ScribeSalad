00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.750
I want to tell you a quick story about when Uncle Jake was a kid and when uncle

2
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:13.251
Jake learned some things that were very important to him and

3
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.740
that really helped him begin to lead a better life.

4
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.890
So there's a lesson to this story.
It's like a fable.

5
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.440
And so pay attention and see if you can learn what the lesson is.

6
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.760
So here's the story from Uncle Jake.
When I was a little kid,

7
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.580
I was running in a race.
It was a pretty long race for kids.

8
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.290
My Dad had taken me to another town to run the race because I liked running.

9
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.530
The race was about four miles long.

10
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.860
Adults and kids were both running at the same time,

11
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.480
so it was kind of crowded and it was hard to even see with all the people around

12
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.720
it was the biggest race I had ever been in.

13
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.240
As soon as it started,
I ran really hard,
as hard as I could,

14
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:06.120
and it seemed like I was winning the race,

15
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.710
at least it seemed like I was winning for all the kids that were in the race.

16
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.160
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.180
<v 0>But I didn't look back.
I kept looking ahead and focused on winning.</v>

18
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.230
I didn't look back at all because I knew that looking back slows you down.

19
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.520
I just ran and ran and ran and I was really,

20
00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:27.880
really tired.
But I kept running as hard as I could

21
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.670
even when I felt tired,
I kept pushing.

22
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.170
And finally I got towards the end of the race and I started to recognize where

23
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:44.850
the finish line was going to be and I turned the last corner

24
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.520
<v 1>okay.</v>

25
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.070
<v 0>And saw the finish line in Ireland headed for it.</v>

26
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.830
And once I turned the corner and I started getting closer to the finish line,

27
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.770
the crowd started to cheer.
They started to cheer loud.

28
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.180
They must be cheering from me.
I thought,
I must be winning.

29
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.040
I am going to win this race.
I will be the champion.
I thought to myself,

30
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:11.510
as I picked up my pace,

31
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.910
the closer I got to the finish line,
the louder everyone got.

32
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.480
They were screaming and cheering and I was running so hard,

33
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:23.960
I was looking straight ahead,
just bounding towards the finish line.

34
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.380
Then they were screaming and it was like I was famous.

35
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.120
And finally I sprinted across that finish line and I was so proud of what I had

36
00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:42.920
done.
Can I slow down?

37
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:47.921
And then I came to a stop and then I looked up to see all of my adoring fans,

38
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.970
but they weren't looking at me.

39
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.010
<v 0>They were looking at someone else</v>

41
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.700
<v 1>and they kept cheering and now they were cheering even louder and I could</v>

42
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:08.080
suddenly tell that they hadn't been cheering for me at all.

43
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:11.260
And I looked behind me to see what they were cheering at

44
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.490
<v 0>and then I saw what they were cheering at.</v>

45
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.930
<v 0>I saw a father who was pushing his daughter in a wheelchair</v>

47
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.060
and she must've had a very bad disease because she couldn't really even hold her

48
00:03:29.061 --> 00:03:33.380
head up.
But as our dad pushed her and the crowd cheered loud,

49
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.470
she did her best to wave to the crowd and she smiled and waved at her.

50
00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:41.720
Dad pushed her across the finish line.

51
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.400
He looked very tired.

52
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

53
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.430
<v 0>And she looked very happy.
And I,</v>

54
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.070
I felt embarrassed.

55
00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.990
I felt embarrassed because I'd been so proud of myself thinking I had done such

56
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:02.254
a great thing.

57
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.320
Not knowing that there was someone right behind me that was doing something even

58
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:11.410
better,
something even harder,

59
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.790
something that took more courage than what I had done.

60
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.680
And I went over to the girl and her father and I smiled and I said,

61
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:25.150
nice job on the race.

62
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.740
And her mouth moved and it looked like she was trying to say thank you because I

63
00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:33.120
don't think she could talk,

64
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.900
but the dad said,
thank you young man,
you ran a good race too.

65
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.020
Thanks sir.
I said,

66
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.260
<v 1>yeah.</v>

67
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.540
<v 0>Then he pushed her away to get some water</v>

68
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.940
and I realized two very important lessons.

69
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

70
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.990
<v 0>The first one is that even when I'm doing something very challenging,</v>

71
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.350
there's always someone that is doing something even more challenging.

72
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

73
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.820
<v 0>And more important than that,</v>

74
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.110
I realized that the world doesn't revolve around me.

75
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.840
I thought everyone was cheering from me and that made me feel good.

76
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.730
I thought I was the center of the world.

77
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

78
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.320
<v 0>But that is seldom the case.</v>

79
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

80
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.210
<v 0>There's a big world out there and I'm only part of it.</v>

81
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

82
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.520
<v 0>And I needed to stay humble and think about other people.</v>

83
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.240
And not only of myself.
