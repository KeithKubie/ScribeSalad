Speaker 1:          00:00          All right. So today we're going to talk about everything is illuminated and Eli has actually agreed to stand next to me for the whole lecture and translate my lecture into Ukrainian dialect. Thank you, Eli. I'll call you up in a minute for anyone visiting the class today, what we are doing is talking about a Jonathan Safran fours. Everything is illuminated. This book was chosen by the class as the last book of the syllabus. And Eli here gave a wonderful presentation, a reading from it in a very, uh, funny Ukrainian accent. Um, and I think that's why everybody chosen. Um, God knows if there would be another reason. No, just kidding. Um, now when you meet a new novel, when you meet a new novel, uh, there are various things you need to do, uh, after you've decided whether you like it or not. If that is, if you're either a professor in an English class having to teach it or you are a student having to talk about it or write about it in your papers.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Uh, beyond that, even beyond vocational necessity, there is the desire. Uh, I hope that many people have to understand how new work fits into the body of existing literature. And especially, I think that's the case when an author is as openly ambitious as Jonathan Safran Foer is. It is very clear the minute you open this up and you start reading a, that four is aiming at a conversation with literature that has proceeded him. Uh, it's also clear from his interviews and, uh, I was particularly struck by something he said in an interview about his second novel, um, extremely loud and incredibly close, which is about nine 11. And I'll, I'll say a little bit more about that novel, which I haven't read, but I've read enough reviews of it, uh, to know a few facts about it, which I think are relevant to this novel. Um, he said about it, he was asked by an interviewer, well, doesn't it seem risky to take on nine 11 as a, as a subject?

Speaker 1:          02:24          And he said, well, what seems risky to me is not taking on the important subjects of your time. That seems like the risk for a writer. And he says in another place, you know, you have to justify the fact that you're sitting alone in a room writing all day. What you do has to be somehow world changing. So, uh, for a 20 something year old writer, this is a, a heavy task and I think you can feel the heaviness of it in, in the novel, um, partly in its formal ambition and partly in the subjects that, uh, it takes on. It doesn't take on nine 11, uh, but it does take on the Holocaust. So I will have a whole argument about that aspect of the novel and how it fits into literature of the post 45 period because, uh, lucky you, I happen to have written a book on this.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Uh, I'm, Vic came out in 2000 to three, uh, about genocide and literature. So this is actually perfect novel for me to lecture on. Uh, in that respect, when you first meet a novel of this kind with these ambitions, there are certain things that you do. And for me, those things include noticing just about everything I possibly can about the novel and then thinking about what other things that I've read seem to be speaking to it or it seems to be speaking to those things. Um, now I promised that I would not conduct this entire lecture in Q and a, but I did not promise that I wouldn't ask any questions. So here goes, um, what novels seem related to this novel from our syllabus to you? Well, you can see, you can go outside our syllabus. That's okay. Did you have another idea? Yes. Yes. That's, that's certainly in dialogue with this novel. Yes. And four talks about that as a novel that really was important to him. Okay. What else? What from our syllabus seems to be related to this novel.

Speaker 2:          04:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:36          You've never seen anything like this before?

Speaker 2:          04:40          Yes.

Speaker 1:          04:41          Lolita. Why? What in Lily too. Okay. Yes. Some of that humor. Yes. What else? What else from our syllabus? Yes. Also. Oh, I was going to get shuffled on Lolita. Yes, sure. Experiment. Did the 80 fine. Speeding through the voice over character. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Inhabiting a voice that seems very foreign to the writer. Yes. What else?

Speaker 2:          05:10          Yes. All right. Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:12          Yes. And what was it about Barth that you think for learned from,

Speaker 2:          05:17          I think I've writing about writing. Yes.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Yeah, absolutely. Yup. Definitely. What else?

Speaker 2:          05:30          Roth.

Speaker 1:          05:32          Did anyone not see Rothan this novel. Okay. Um, Roth is certainly here. Um, pension is very strongly here. If you think about the episodes in crying of lot 49 with the paranoids, those all those funny jokes and their songs, uh, far learned a lot from pension and even more from pensions, other novels. Gravity's rainbow I think particularly. Um, then from crying flop 49, which doesn't because of its leg, doesn't quite go to the operatic playful lengths that a pension, longer pension novel can go to. Um, pigeon is also very interested in the 18th century. And so that interest is something that for our shares in this novel, um, for is someone who learned a lot from the group of writers that we would call postmodernist and that I would call late modernist. Um, he learned to be very self conscious about his language and to make that evident on the surface of the novel. He also learned though from Toni Morrison come on in. He learned from Tony Morrison in particular, I think he learned the value of time travel in an novel. This was something that I brought up with respect to Edward P. Jones as well. Um, but it's certainly here and there's one very, very clear, um, reference to two Morrison. This is on page 51 when, when they're talking, he's talking about the name of the, of the shuttle and how it was, how it was called. Now, uh, my, my Ukrainian is not very premium, so I will butcher this name.

Speaker 1:          07:31          Of course, no one in some, uh, suffuse called, it's called, it's a Fucca until it had such a disagree, uh, until it had such a disagreeable official name, no one felt the need to call it anything. But now there was that, there was an offense that the shuttle should be called that shitheads namesake. The citizens had to, had to a name not to go buy some, even called the Shtetl, not see a sofa and would continue to do a to even after the new name was chosen. Um, in Song of Solomon written in 1979, I think, um, Toni Morrison has a street that's called not doctor street because it was called, uh, it was given an official name at odds with what the black community, uh, called it. Um, and so they call it head called it doctor street. The town Christen did something else, I think main street or something.

Speaker 1:          08:29          And so then they called it not doctor street. So this, this little teeny piece is lifted directly from Morrison. You can see her footprints on here in that sense. Tony Morrison was of course a teacher, uh, at Princeton when four was there. I don't know if he took courses with her. He certainly studied with Joyce, Carol Oates. Um, but Morrison was around and I'm sure he has read that novel. It would be surprising to me if he has not. Um, so the other thing that he takes from Morrison is that sense of collective history, that history is something passed down in oral tradition in an intensely verbal culture. So the Jewish shtetl culture that far imagines and the black community that Morrison imagines are both intensely verbal cultures. Now the Jewish community of forest novel is also intensely literary in the sense of literate. They write everything down also. Um, so that's a slight difference between Morrison's vision and force.

Speaker 1:          09:42          I want to go into some detail about what I think for has learned from Roth because Roth is the person I see most strongly behind his writing. We didn't see the playful metaphysical side of Roth very much in the human stain. Roths work is straddling both sides of that line between realism and very hyper metaphysics banality. So some of his novels have alternate endings. Um, he has several novels that, uh, feature Philip Roth. So four takes the, um, conceit of naming himself, uh, in naming character after himself directly from Roth. So there are ways that he is on the surface sighting Roth, but there's a more profound way that he's working in Ross terrain. And that is in the terrain of desire. So thinking back to Roths, first novel Portnoy's complaint, which is all about masturbation, Alex Portnoy's masturbation, we see that he's taken the name Alex, uh, Alexander Portnoy. Alex appears in this novel as well. And then we have saffron who is this a sort of love machine. So he is a double of, um, Alex Portnoy with a difference though. So instead of masturbation, it's sex with the needy, essentially sex with the love starved virgins, older women, a widows, et cetera. So the immediate difference that four is pointing to is the difference between something like solipsism or narcissism, desire as the fuel for that narcissism versus desire as the fuel for community and connection.

Speaker 1:          11:47          This is not without trouble though. And it's the trouble that interests me. And that I think he takes from Roth. And that's the impossibility of ever actually making that connection of it ever finally coming home. And you see that, uh, in the story of saffron, just in the fact that by the time he finally gets married and finally has a proper orgasm, what he falls in love with as that at that moment is not his wife, but the baby that he is in gendering in that moment. And of course it's a baby, uh, that is, doesn't even exist yet. So the very absence at the heart of desire, the blankness or the impossibility is demonstrated even in those moments of overwhelming connection.

Speaker 2:          12:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:48          And I think it's telling that for imagined sexual energy as light rather than some other kind of a phenomenon. So everything is illuminated. Remember, there's that image of the world being lit up by people making love, that it actually generates light that you can see from space. It's not a concrete in gendering act. Even when it is, it creates something else. And that's something else seems to be related to knowledge. How can you know your past? This is a problem in the novel and it's a feature of the quest element. And I'll say more about that in my second lecture on the novel. Um, but I think it has to do with a vague understanding that is imagined to illuminate the world as a result of desires, fulfillment. We're almost fulfillment. But that theme of sex and desire is abstracted into lots of other forms. And the couple that I want to look at, um, one is a sort of religious, this is on one 40.

Speaker 2:          14:17          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:18          Here we're learning about the veneration of broads husband, the Kulchar who is then bronzed and made into a, uh, a statue in the town after he dies. I'm still with the saw blade embedded in his head. Um, and this is at the bottom of one 40.

Speaker 2:          14:42          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:42          Those who prayed came to believe less and less in the god of their creation and more and more in their belief, the unmarried kissed the dials, battered lips, although they were not faithful to their god, but to the kiss, they were kissing themselves. And when the bride knelt, it was not the God they believed in. It was the Neal, not the God's bronze knees, but their own bruised ones. This little moment of reflection on religious ritual or quasi religious ritual is related to some, um, things that I want to say about the role of Judaism in my next lecture. But as a practice, it is a practice of negativity, of acknowledging the impossibility of connection to that God and the impossibility of fulfillment from that God. But nevertheless, it is committed to the fulfillment of the effort to make that connection. So it's belief in belief.

Speaker 1:          15:51          And in fact, the book that I'm writing right now is all about belief and belief. And so this confirms my sense that this is an important way of imagining how belief works in the current moment. Uh, you, you believe in the act of belief. So that's one kind of negativity. Then there's a visual image that we get over and over again, and that's of the whole, the empty hole. There are a couple of examples here. Um, on one 35, this is after broad and the Colker have separated themselves with a wall because the coker keeps beating her up. He's uh, uh, deranged in part part saying part d arranged by his, a saw blade embedded in his head. And so they have this whole, between them, uh, through which they can communicate. But the wall protects broad from his rages. So he won't beat her up.

Speaker 1:          16:52          They lived, this is only 35. They lived with the whole, the absence that defined, it became a presence that defined them. Life was a small negative space cut out of the eternal solidity. And for the first time it felt precious. Not like all of the words that had come to me, nothing but like the last breath of a drowning victim. So here were offered two versions of negativity. One is all the words that had come to me, nothing. And the other is this physical emptiness, the hole. So the words that mean nothing. Our an emptiness that ar is a frustrating a blockage, but the emptiness that is the space, the visual space comes to be a space of imagination that gets filled with imagination. So they see each other from a distance for the first time and are overwhelmed by the connection that can then be formed between them. So it's the very absence of the physical presence ones, distance from it. That becomes the fulfillment for this couple.

Speaker 2:          18:08          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:09          So this, I hope you can see the structural similarity or the logical similarity between believing in belief and were told of broad. Remember also on page 83 that she was constitutionally unable to love anyone.

Speaker 1:          18:34          Uh, this is at the top of 83 when she said, father, I love you. She was neither naive nor dishonest, but the opposite. She was wise and truthful enough to lie. They reciprocated the great and saving lie that our love for things is greater than our love for our love, for things willfully playing the parts they wrote for themselves, willfully, fully creating and believing fictions necessary for life. So if this is the lie that our love for things is greater than our love for our love for things, the truth is that our love for our love is greater than our love for actual things or actual persons. It's the same structure as the belief in belief. Of course, that story of broad and her father telling each other stories both about their love for each other. And in her father's case, your uncle's case about her mother, her fictional mother who he says died before. Uh, she was, uh, old enough to remember her. All the stories that your uncle makes up become the fullness of his life with broad. So they replace the loss of his first wife who abandoned him. And so this gives fiction a very powerful brief in the world.

Speaker 2:          20:08          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          20:09          This is not unlike the structure that I was pointing out in the human stain where the blankness of Coleman and Fanya allows Nathan to re inhabit life by imagining onto them all the dynamics of their desire, all the facts of their life, all the details of their biography. So likewise for uses blankness as a way of pumping up the power of fiction. It plays this role despite the threat. It will always pose to fiction that you get here, uh, in or on that little, um, in that little passage I just quoted before about the, not the, the nothingness of words. So the nothingness that gives fiction, it's blank space to inhabit also can seep into. And in fact a words as in the repetition of a word like, um, Malcovich it is an infection that bothered critics about this novel. They felt that the postmodern play of the novel was essentially trivial because these kinds of play had been conducted in novels 30 years, 40 years before, and many more than that.

Speaker 1:          21:40          If you count Tristram Shandy in the 18th century. Um, but took powerful hold in American fiction in the 60s, they felt that far was simply taking out those tools and deploying them again, but not for any new sort of payoff. So fiction, some critics were frustrated with this. Now, this brings me to a second kind of context that I would bring to this novel, uh, or I do bring to this novel. As I think about it. In 2001, Jonathan Franzen's novel, the correction won the national book award. The corrections attempted to make a marriage between the postmodern novel as he understood it, the novel filled with those kinds of verbal play and Franzen, uh, modeled his novel on William goddesses novel, the recognitions, which is about an art forger. It's about 900 pages of incredibly experimental pros. Um, it's extremely hard to read, but for friends in that novel had enough in it of character development and human investment to go along with its verbal playfulness that it made him want to keep reading it.

Speaker 1:          23:10          So in Omaj to that novel, he called his novel the corrections and tried to give us a story where the verbal play would not drain the sentiment from the novel. So he described it as the social novel coming to meet the postmodern novel. He announced this to great fanfare in an essay. Uh, and of course the novel then became famous and he became infamous when he was invited by Oprah to go on Oprah's book club with the corrections and he refused. It was quite a, uh, a scandal in the literary world. And then he tried to go back on it and say, oh, okay, Oprah. I really wasn't being a snob all come on your show. But then she was like, no, sorry, we're scheduled for that week now. Um, it was really a, uh, a mistake on Franzen's part, but it also demonstrated his own ambivalence about the very project he had set out to accomplish, which is to make a novel that people really want to read that has some sentimental purchase on you that has characters you could care about as well as being extremely ambitious in this way, in this formal way.

Speaker 1:          24:31          Now that novel, the way it tried to get sentiment and verbal play to line up was in part by making one of the central characters and Alzheimer's patient. So it's about a man, it's about a family in Midwestern family. And the two parents gets extended treatment in the novel as do the three children in the grown children in the family. And the father has Alzheimer's. And so there's a very pinching esque scene. When, uh, his actually his, his, uh, shit starts talking to him and this is taken right out of, uh, gravity's rainbow. There's a scene very similar to this in gravity's rainbow, so France and tried to make that poignant by making it something that the modernist tried to do, which is the representation of the actual workings of a human mind in a daily situation. And the terror of it for that character. I thought when I read the novel came across quite powerfully. So for me in part it worked

Speaker 1:          25:44          far is doing something that is related. He is trying to have both sentiment and formal play. How many of you felt for these characters, how many of you felt that they were really inaccessible to you? Flat, uh, on emotionally interesting to you? Okay. Just one. So he, I think he succeeded, uh, probably two greater degree. If you read the critics and you can read that in this incredibly bulked up blurb section, uh, in the packaging of this novel. Um, a lot of critics did really like this novel and I think that's why that it for most readers, he did succeed. Now I have a things to say about that, but in a minute, uh, I want to say that there is another kind of context that I think you could attend to productively. And that is the quality of this novel as a campus novel. Now that's probably not exactly what you were thinking of when you read this novel. It's a canvas novel because it was written on a campus and it's also a campus novel because it is in part a coming of age novel about someone who goes from needing a lot of help with his writing to kind of writing on his own.

Speaker 2:          27:16          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          27:17          So what you see is the displacement of a narrative that looks very much like fours development or you would imagine the development of a writer and a writing program at Princeton over time, at first needing suggestions from a mentor. And a lot of the way that we come to know the character, Jonathan Safran Foer in the beginning through Alex's letters has to do with things that he has said to Alex about how to write suggestions he's made. So Jonathan Safran Foer remains as a sort of shadowy presence for much of this novel. But we see his wise sayings to Alex about writing. It's an interesting inversion of the situation that the author was in fact in, he was in the class taking the class, not teaching the class when he was an undergraduate. And this was written when he was, I think it was published when he was 21 the bar is not high, don't know. The bar is very high. Let me say that the bar is very high, but don't worry. Um, life is long. You have plenty of time. Um,

Speaker 2:          28:40          okay.

Speaker 1:          28:41          This is not just about Jonathan Safran Foer, the man and his particular biography of being a student in the writing program at Princeton. It is also about a, an institutional history of writing in the second half of the 20th century. If you remember way back when, when I lectured on Flannery O'connor, I mentioned to you a critic named Mark Mcgill at Ucla who uh, is writing a book called the program era or has written, I think it's, it should be out very soon, called the program era. And it's an analysis of how writing programs leave their mark on the fiction of the last 50 years. Because what's particularly striking and knew about writing in this period is that a lot of it happens on campuses and a lot of authors are writing for campus audiences.

Speaker 1:          29:35          So far is novel, is a version of that kind of fiction. And we can read it that way, I think quite easily. It fits in that story that Mark McGrail tells about the development of this period. So just as when I read it, I see that notation about belief and belief and the love of love, and it fits into a story that I'm telling about the evolution of religion and literature in this period. So you can ally it to other arguments that are made about the period two and that help you to see why certain things might be in the novel and what kind of work they do there. And finally, there's a last content context that I um, saw pointed out, I think it was in the review in the nation and that's of trips of Americans to post communist Europe and post communist Russia.

Speaker 1:          30:32          Apparently there is a whole spate of novels that came out right about the same time where Americans almost invariably young men went to the former Soviet republics and had coming of age experiences. So this certainly fits that genre. I don't personally have a lot to say about that. I think it's interesting to see it as being aligned with a group of novels that do that. Um, it doesn't for me provide any particular onsite, but that's not because it's because it wouldn't, it just happens that I'm not, uh, that didn't strike a chord with me or lead me to other points of analysis. This is another point that I want you to take away from my engagement with this novel that is that no matter what context can be brought to it, you as a reader bring your own particular one, your own particular set of knowledge, your own particular training, your own life experience.

Speaker 1:          31:32          So we're getting to the end of the course and in a way, uh, you have now the opportunity to approach these novels, any new novel that's written with several kinds of stories about the period in your mind because now you have read, I hope you've read many novels in this period and you can see where the connections are. So you're starting to draw those. You'll need to do that on the exam. But far more importantly, I hope that you will continue to do it when you read on your own outside of class, a lot of you are seniors. You may not have a lot of time after you leave school to read novels. When you do, I hope it will be part of your pleasure to approach them with a sense of empowerment that you can know where they fit in the history of the art form. They're engaging apart from your own pleasure in reading them, which will, I'm sure be the primary reason you'd pick up a novel to read it. But there is that intellectual pleasure that you now can have. I went to, to encourage you to feel that you can do that.

Speaker 1:          32:48          It doesn't mean that it will always produce insight for you. So I've been thinking about this novel for approximately two weeks. Most novels that I lecture to you about, I've been thinking about for at least two years.

Speaker 2:          33:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:04          Your insights over time change and you notice different things and it's nice to allow time for that. And that's the value of rereading in a few years, what you read before as a student. So I hope you'll maybe return to some of these novels as well. Now, look, that was my little digression about after college reading or an outside of the class reading, but let me return to this question of sentiment.

Speaker 2:          33:32          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          33:33          far wants it both ways. And one of the ways he has it both ways is by internalizing in the novel a reader figure who is our double. There's actually a couple of, uh, there are actually three doubles for us, at least. One is Alex who is reading Johnathan's story as he sends it to him, embedding a critical reader within the novel as we've seen with Barth and in pension where Eto was, that double allows a certain set of metta fictional tricks. One of the most reliable functions for that internalized reader is to cue you, me, the actual human readers to notice or feel certain things. Or if you are a off to be misled in certain ways. Think of the prologue from John Ray Jr, which misleads us in reading that novel. He's our double, but he's there to trick us. I don't think that Alex is here to trick us and just to note how he cues us. Let's look on one 40, uh,

Speaker 2:          34:53          two

Speaker 1:          34:54          and three. This is um, one of the letters where the Alex is less busy with self presentation by this point in the novel and he's really responding to what Jonathan has sent him.

Speaker 1:          35:13          This is in the middle of one 43 those things that you wrote in your letter about your grandmother made me remember how you told me on Augustine steps about when you would sit under her dress and how that presented you. Safety and peace. I must confess that I became melancholy then and still am melancholy. I was also very moved. Is this how you use it by what you wrote about how impossible it must've been for your grandmother to be a mother without a husband is amazing. Yes. How your grandma father survived so much only to die when he came to America. It is as if after surviving so much, there was no longer a reason to survive. When you wrote about the early death of your grandfather, it helped me to understand in some manners the melancholy that grandfather has felt since grandmother died and not only because they both died from cancer.

Speaker 1:          36:05          I do not know your mother of course, but I know you and I can tell you that your grandfather would have been so, so proud. It is my hope that I will be a person that grandmother would have been so, so proud of. We're being cued to be moved to be moved by the story in these particular ways to take his reflections on his grandmother, which are indeed very lovely and to be moved by them. But one reservation I guess I have about the success of this move is just it's baldness. I guess I'm being told that I should be moved by these passages.

Speaker 2:          36:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:55          There are also moments when we get reflections that seam.

Speaker 2:          37:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:05          Like they would never stand if they were not embedded in Alex's voice. And this is on 69 68 69 this is Alex talking about how he came upon little Igor, his brother crying.

Speaker 1:          37:29          I knew why he was a little less than crying. I knew very well and I wanted to go to him and tell him that I had a little less than cried too, just like him. And that no matter how much it seemed like he would never grow up to be a premium person like me with many girls and so many famous places to go, he would. He would be exactly like me and look at me a little Igor. The bruises go away and so does how you hate and so does the feeling that everything you receive in life is something you have earned and then I'm going to skip down so he starts to laugh then at his brother and he's not quite sure why he's laughing. I attempted to rise that I could walk to my room, but I was afraid that it would be too difficult to control my laughing.

Speaker 1:          38:15          I remained there for many, many minutes. My brother persevered to a little less than cry, which made my silent laughing even more. I am able to understand now that it was the same laugh I had in the restaurant and loads the laugh that had the same darkness as grandfather's laugh and the heroes laugh. I ask leniency for writing this. Perhaps I will remove it before I post this part to you. I am sorry. As for Sammy Davis Junior, junior, she did not eat her piece of the potato. Those reflections on laughing and crying. I think they might sound quite modeling if they were not in Alex's voice. That a writer needs to judge very carefully whether to reflect in those direct ways about big themes like laughter and crying or how you hate.

Speaker 1:          39:16          So these are the topics that we'll be a pitfall for any new writers sitting down to say, I am going to write about love. I used to, I used to teach creative writing and one of the, um, one of, one of the exercises that I did was I would sit my students down and I would say, okay, we're going to have a little in class writing today. Um, here's some topics that I want you to write about just for 10 minutes. And I would give them love your childhood. Um, what else? Death. Uh, can't remember what else. And so then they'd very earnestly do it. And then I'd say, okay, now, now I want you to, uh, take your paper and I want you to underline every single cliche that you wrote. And they would come up with papers full of cliches and it was a little exercise just to get them to understand that choosing a topic, uh, can get you into trouble if you choose a very abstract, big important question. Of course we want books that move us and tell us about death and love and separation and desire. But how do you get there and how do you talk about those things? So I think that for has, um, taken a risk of some of the sort here he can do it because it's in Alex's voice is the distance achieved the self distancing achieved by inhabiting a foreign voice with its little funny jokes that come up because of its incorrect usages. Is that enough to prevent sentimentality rather than Centamin?

Speaker 1:          41:09          Is it powerful enough language in the abstract that it moves us as a discourse on laughter and loving is the detail of Little Igor and Alex's love for him enough? Now remember, we know nothing about Igor as a character, his brother as a character. Do we feel that the relationship between the two is earned for us as readers? Maybe we do. Sometimes I did. Other Times I didn't. So this is something that I'm still thinking about. Does it succeed at what Franzen too was trying to do, which is to infuse intellectual wordplay with human resonance? Does it succeed? If you look at the dedication to the novel, I think you learned something too. This is under the acknowledgements. Did anybody read this?

Speaker 2:          42:24          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          42:25          these are the acknowledgements at least once every day since I met her, I have felt blessed to know Nicole Roggie. She inspires me not only to try to write more ambitiously, but to smile more widely and have a fuller, better heart. I am so, so grateful and you hear that. So, so again, uh, from the passage I just read and it is my pleasure and honor to think of the wonderful people at Ho Houghton Mifflin as family, so on and so on, whose advice in literature and life seems always to boil down to feel more, which is always the best advice. So feeling is very much on the surface of the effort here. What would it mean to read this as a sentimental novel?

Speaker 1:          43:22          Does the playful treatment of Shtetl life disable our connection with those characters. One of the things that I think succeeds wonderfully about this novel is broad as a character. I think you do want her to have a good life as Alex does and you feel the tragedy of the life she gets. And I think you get that payoff because she is developed, she has time to develop in the course of the story. So for all its time travel back and forth for all it's playfulness for all the jokes and rifts broad has time to develop, especially in relation to her father and in relation to the coker, her husband. And we learn things that may occur more complex over time. And so when we finally learn what she asked the coker to do after she was raped and before she agreed to be his wife, when we learned that, and I won't reveal it cause I don't know if you're all there yet, it gives us, uh, a much more complex version of what she is as a person of who she is as a person. So I think he earns it with broad.

Speaker 2:          44:52          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          44:53          That to me is a kind of achievement because of the role that riffing plays in the development of that story. Riffing on Jewish behavior in a novel by a Jewish writer is certainly well trodden ground Roth has been treading that ground for many decades. I think what four does that Roth didn't do is fully identify with the community in a convincing way while he's doing it, and this is related to what I will say about his use of the Holocaust, uh, in my next lecture, I'm going to stop there and I hope you will be sure to finish the novel by, by Wednesday.
