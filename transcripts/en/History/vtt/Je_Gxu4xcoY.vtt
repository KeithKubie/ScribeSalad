- Hi.
My name is John-Francis Ellis.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.330
I'm here in my shop
near Jewett, Ohio.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.420
I'll give you guys a tour.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.620
This piece of rusty metal here

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.920
is the forge I actually bring
out to, like, fairs

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.000
and demonstrations and stuff.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.330
It'll burn coal or charcoal.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.960
You just run air through there,
and it works really good.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.830
This is actually
a blower I made.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.880
It's got, I think,
a half-horsepower motor there.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.880
I've experimented with
different kinds of forges

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.290
that ran on, like, diesel
and stuff,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.040
I need a bigger blower,
so I built that.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.170
And then this is where I have
some of the stuff I've made

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.830
hanging up--
tomahawks I made,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.380
some knives, a spearhead.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.580
This is a crappy sword
that I made a long time ago.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.210
Not my proudest piece of work,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.830
but hey, I made it,
so I'm hanging it up in here.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.920
- I'm JD.
This is my home forge

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.960
in Elmira, New York.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.790
This is kind of
my main forging area--

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.710
anvils and hammers
and all that.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.460
My forge right there
is just fire brick

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.830
with a ceramic liner,
running off propane,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.330
that way with the fire brick,
I can move things around

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.620
how I want.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.040
Just a work table
out here for hot work,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.670
or whatever I need to do.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.580
- Right here is actually
a flamethrower that I built.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.880
It runs off diesel.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.880
You pressurize it with like

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.120
a bike pump through here.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.420
It's made out of
a fire extinguisher,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.750
so it's kind of ironic,
I guess.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.420
But it actually works
pretty well.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.250
Usually I can get, like,
a 20-foot flame or so with it.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.420
And then moving on
to the belt grinder.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.920
This is--

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.670
I actually built
this belt grinder myself.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.750
It's got a motor off--

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.460
I believe,
it's an old air compressor.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.790
It's like a one-horsepower
electric motor.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.000
I can untighten that

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.210
and put
different attachments in

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.920
if I need, like,
a wheel out front

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.710
and this also goes up and down
so I can adjust everything.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.250
Definitely speeds up the work
here in the shop.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.500
I think that's pretty much it,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.250
so there you go.
That's my shop.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.750
- On the same wall I try to
keep all my grinding stuff.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.170
So I have a chop saw.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.000
That speeds up
metal cutting a lot,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.420
compared to cutting it by hand,
which I used to do.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.420
My belt grinder--
I was gonna buy one,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.460
but they're stupid-expensive,
so I made one.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.880
Then a smaller belt grinder.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.710
Couple bench grinders.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.040
And then over on this wall

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.420
I have all the woodworking
equipment;

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.040
wood lathe, band saw,
drill press,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.460
and then my metal lathe
I just got a year or two ago

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.790
and restored that.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.960
So that's my forge.
Thanks for coming by.
