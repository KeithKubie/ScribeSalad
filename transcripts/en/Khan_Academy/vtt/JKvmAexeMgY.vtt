00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.750
f of x is equal to 7x minus 5.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.340
g of x is equal to x to
the third power plus 4x.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.550
And then they ask us to find f
times g of x So the first thing

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.860
to realize is that this
notation f times g of x

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.790
is just referring
to a function that

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.820
is a product of f
of x and g of x.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.872
So by definition, this notation
just means f of x times g of x.

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:32.330
And then we just
have to substitute

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.020
f of x with this definition,
g of x with this definition,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.010
and then multiply out these
algebraic expressions.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.340
f of x is right over there.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.920
And g of x, is right over there.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.200
So let's do it.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.570
So this is going to be
equal to-- switch back

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.776
to the orange color.

00:00:49.776 --> 00:00:51.400
It's going to be
equal to f of x, which

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.790
is 7x minus 5
times g of x, and g

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.790
of x is x to the
third power plus 4x.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.209
And you could-- we're
multiplying two expressions

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:08.250
that each have two terms.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.050
You could use FOIL if you like.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.570
I don't like using
FOIL because you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.260
might forget what
it's even about.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.290
Foil is really just using the
distributive property twice.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.870
So for example, you
take this expression.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.600
Whatever you have out here,
if you had a 9 out here,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.070
or an a, or an x, or anything.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.570
Now you have 7x minus 5.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.640
If you're multiplying it
times this expression,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.610
you would multiply this
times each term over here.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.790
So when you multiply 7x
minus 5 times x to the third,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.930
you get-- I'll
write it this way.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.470
You get x to the third times--
actually, let me write it

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.010
the other way.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.300
You get 7x minus 5
times x to the third.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.480
And then you have plus
7x minus 5 times 4x.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.240
And now we can do the
distributive property again.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.616
We're not normally
used to seeing

00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:05.614
the things we distribute
on the right hand side.

00:02:05.614 --> 00:02:06.740
It's the same exact idea.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.669
We could put the x to
the third here as well.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.169
And when we distribute,
you multiply

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.300
x to the third times 7x
and times negative 5.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.820
x to the third times 7x
is 7x to the fourth power.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.012
X to the third times negative
5 is minus 5x to the third.

00:02:24.012 --> 00:02:25.220
And then you do it over here.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.070
You distribute the
4x over the 7x.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.750
4x times 7x is plus 28x squared.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.827
4x times negative
5 is minus 20x.

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:41.410
And let's see if we
can simplify this.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.130
We only have one fourth degree
term, one third degree term,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.982
one second degree term,
and one first degree term.

00:02:46.982 --> 00:02:48.690
Actually, we can't
simplify this anymore.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.610
And we're done.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.700
This is the product of those
two function definitions.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.440
This is f times g of x.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.530
It is a new function created
by multiplying the other two

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.080
functions.
