00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.710
The new i-limb Ultra revolution from touch
bionics is the first upper limb prosthesis

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.720
that can be controlled with an App.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.500
And students in India created "SHE", or, Society
Harnessing Equipment, lingerie that delivers

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.560
82 electric shocks and contacts the local
police in order to ward off attackers.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.970
Vsauce! Kevin here, this is Mind Blow.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.910
After four years, Micromagic systems is finally
ready to reveal "Mantis," the biggest all-terrain

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.420
operational hexapod in the world that walks
on six ground-sensing hydraulic legs. The

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.789
British robotics firm says the two-ton hexapod
has the ability to manipulate objects, such

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.399
as this trailer, automatically level while
riding, and load easily by folding itself

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.960
onto a truck bed.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.469
The BIQ house is powered by algae. Created
by design firms Splitterwerk, Arup, and SSC

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.510
when used as a "bio-skin" during summer the,
algal growth speeds up providing a cooling

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.430
effect for the residents while transferring
that extra heat to hot water systems. Algae

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.500
is also harvested and sent to the technical
room where it is fed into a bio mass fuel

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.250
converter which provides the remainder of
the building's energy needs - making it self-sufficient.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.170
A new study creates the illusion of having
a phantom limb in non amputee people. Neuroscientists

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.250
at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden set up the
experiment by having the participants right

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.230
arm hidden, and then they touch that arm with a
brush and imitate the same movements with

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.530
another brush in mid air within full view
of the participant. They discovered that within

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.090
a minute most participants transferred the
sensation of touch to the area of empty space

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.300
where they only see the brush move and thereby experience
a phantom limb. In order to prove the experiment

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.360
worked, the scientists would make a stabbing
motions towards the phantom limb and measure

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.120
the participants sweat response to the threat
which was increased during the illusion.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.120
And they hope it leads to insight into future
research on phantom pain in amputees. World record 30 skiers holding hands and doing a flip...

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.069
New fossil dinosaur embryos suggest that baby
dinosaurs grew at record rates, and also had

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.799
the ability to flex their muscles in preparation
for the outside world. The bones had blood

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.730
vessels which meant that the tissues were burning
oxygen and growing rapidly, and the structure

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.909
of the bones gives researchers reason to believe
the embryos were flexing their legs to strengthen

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:29.709
their muscles.

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:30.069
Wolrd Record 30 skiers holding hands and doing
a flip. Yay.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.260
Fujitsu Laboratories created a touchscreen
interface that connects the real world with

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.260
the virtual. It can accurately detects the
user's fingertips creating an interactive touchscreen

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.290
for the real world. This allows you to manipulate
paper using a webcam and a commercial projector.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.389
With this ability information can be imported
as data from any document by just using your

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:56.090
fingers to select it. And they're aiming to develop
a commercial version of this by 2014.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.040
Students at Virginia Tech College of Engineering
made a life-like autonomous robotic jelly

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.969
fish the size and weight of a grown man. At
5 foot 7 inches and 170 pounds, it's being

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:11.489
developed for the US navy and the goal is
to have the robotic jellyfish in waters around

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.930
the world, with the ability to leave it in
the ocean for weeks or even months. Eventually

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.040
they may have the ability to clean oil spills,
monitor the environment, or conduct surveillance.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.329
After 4 years Micromagic Systems is finally
ready to reveal MANTIS - the biggest all-terrain

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:22.579
operational hexapod in the world that walks
on six ground sensing hydraulic legs. The

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:22.579
British robotics firm says the 2-tonne hexapod
has the ability to manipulate objects such

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:22.579
as this trailer, automatically level while
riding, and load easily by folding itself

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:22.579
onto a truck bed.

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.419
The Cave Automatic Virtual Environment is
a fully immersive six-sided room that projects

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:32.779
3-D environments on its walls. It was created
by the team at UW-Madison and gives users

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:38.209
the ability to move virtual objects using
muscle activity, a projector, and virtual

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.879
reality glasses. This allows users to exert
forces against things that are created in

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.879
front of them. The hope is that this will
have rehabilitation applications for those

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.260
suffering from injuries, strokes, or certain
disabilities.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.169
Finally Festo created BionicOpter - a robotic
dragonfly that has mastered the complex flight

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.909
characteristics of its real life counterpart.

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:06.909
I'm going to leave you with a biped robot
that stabilizes its balance if you push it

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.510
- and as always thanks for watching...
