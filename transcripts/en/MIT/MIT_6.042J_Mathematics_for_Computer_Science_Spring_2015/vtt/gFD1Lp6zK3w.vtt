00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.080
PROFESSOR: So in
this short segment,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.871
we'll talk about some
relational properties

00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:05.700
that I call mapping properties.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.260
They can also be referred to
as archery [? on ?] relations.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.450
This segment is
mostly vocabulary.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.050
There are a half
a dozen concepts

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.660
and words that are
standard in the field

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.780
and that one needs to know to be
able to do discrete math and so

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.280
on.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.510
The applications will come
in the next short segment

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.120
where we start applying
these properties to counting.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.830
Although, there'll
be a punchline

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.210
about counting at the
end of this segment.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.350
So let's go back or proceed.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.240
And remember that
a binary relation

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.070
is a thing with three parts.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.270
It's got a domain
illustrated as A here,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.330
a codomain
illustrated as B here,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.810
and relationship's
an association

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.540
between domain elements and
codomain elements indicated

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.760
by the arrows, the
arrows being called

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.840
the graph of the relation.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.880
And we already observed one
aspect of archery and arrows

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.460
that the concept
of a function could

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.680
be captured by saying
that there was less than

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.480
or equal to 1 arrow out of
every element in the domain.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.300
That implied that there
was a unique other end

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.980
of an arrow out
of a domain point

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.430
called the value of that
point under the relation

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.260
which is in fact a function F.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.670
So F of green
equals magenta where

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.680
there is an arrow out
of a green element.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.580
But in this picture--
as is typical--

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.070
not every domain element--
not every green dot--

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.970
has an arrow out if it.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.970
So this would be an illustration
of a partial function

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.800
where F of a green element
isn't always defined

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.430
if there's no arrow out.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.700
Well, the general idea
of archery relations

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.290
pursues this function
idea that basically we're

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.610
going to classify relations
according to-- first,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.420
how many arrows come
out of domain elements?

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.680
Really, in three categories.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.890
The relations where
there's at most

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.840
one arrow out of
every domain element,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.890
there's exactly one arrow
out of every domain element,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.320
or there's at least one arrow
out of every domain element.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.560
And symmetrically, we're going
to classify codomain relations

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.450
with respect to codomain
in the same way-- relations

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.510
where every codomain element
has greater than or equal to 1.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.900
Arrow in has exactly
one arrow in,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.600
or at most, one arrow
in is the other part

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.780
of the classification.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.060
And various combinations
of these things

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.110
have standard name,
which it turns out

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.550
that you'll need to know.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.920
So we'll lead you through them.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.720
OK.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.890
So let's begin with the
idea of a total relation.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.140
Total relation means there's
at least one arrow out

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.140
every domain element.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.810
So if you look at this
picture, it's not quite total

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.780
yet because there are
two green domain elements

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.440
with no arrows out of them.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.660
So I've just
highlighted them in red,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.560
and we can fix this by
making them disappear.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.070
Now I'm left with
a total relation.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.660
Every domain elements has at
least one arrow coming out

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.350
of it.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.980
So that's what makes it total.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.930
Another way to say
total is to say

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.340
that if you look at the
inverse image of the codomain,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.310
it is equal to the domain.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.300
That means if you take all
the arrows that are coming out

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.210
of the domain and
you turn them around

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.810
and you look at all the things
that have arrowheads into them,

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.390
it's the entire domain.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.300
So that's what R inverse
of B-- a nice, slick way

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.340
to say it using relational
operators and sets related

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.840
to applying relations.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.050
So total and function means that
there's exactly one arrow out,

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.130
and that's probably the most
familiar case of functions.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.370
And lots of fields just assume
that functions are total,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.035
but the truth is that
there often is not total.

00:04:14.035 --> 00:04:16.070
And people aren't careful about.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.620
So let's look at a
calculus-like example.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.660
Here's a function g that
takes a pair of reals

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.685
and returns a real.

00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:25.440
It maps the real plane
into the real line.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.820
And the definition of it is g
of x, y is 1 over x minus y.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.050
Now, the domain
of this function g

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.690
is in fact all the
pairs of reals.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.680
That's what it means to say
that it goes from R cross R--

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.520
shorthand R squared--
to the codomain R.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.170
The codomain is the
set of all reals.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.430
But this g is obviously
not total because 1 over 0

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.100
is not defined, which means
that on the 45 degree line,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.090
g is not defined.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.650
g of r, r is not defined.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.840
So g in fact, is
not a total function

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.950
even though it's familiar.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:09.382
And you'd not worry about
partial functions normally.

00:05:09.382 --> 00:05:11.090
You wouldn't notice
that this was partial

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.060
because you're not used to
paying attention to that.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.950
OK.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.780
Let's look at a
slight variation.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.802
This is function g 0 that goes
from some unspecified domain.

00:05:19.802 --> 00:05:21.510
I'll specify it in a
minute to the reals.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.620
It has exactly the same formula
g of x, y is 1 over x minus y.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.070
But now, I'm going to tell
you that the domain-- instead

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.980
of being all the reals-- is the
reals except for that 45 degree

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.770
line.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.570
I just want to get
rid of the bad points

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.920
and not worry about them.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.090
The minute I do that, I
have these two functions

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.980
relations that have the same
graph but different domains.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.350
And the result is that I've
removed from the domain of g

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.360
all the bad points.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.230
I'm left with a
total function g 0.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.450
OK.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.730
Let's keep going.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.490
The next concept
is of a surjection,

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.290
and that's a
relation where there

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.520
is at least one arrow into
every point in the codomain.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.810
There's at least one arrow
into every point in B.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.060
Well, again this is a picture
where that doesn't quite

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.559
work because there's at least
one bad point there-- there it

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:20.930
is in red-- that doesn't
have an arrow in.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.130
So let's fix things again
by making it disappear.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:29.430
Now I'm left with a surjective
relation, or a surjection,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.050
because in fact, everything
in the codomain in B

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.710
has at least one arrow coming.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.150
Everything's the
endpoint of an arrow.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.370
So likewise, we can say
in terms of set operations

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.280
that R is a surjection if and
only if the image of the domain

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.480
is the codomain.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.100
Or still another way
to say it is-- if

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.640
and only if the
range of the function

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.296
is its entire codomain.

00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:53.670
Remember, the
range of the points

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.960
that are hit--
that's R of A-- it's

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.730
not always equal
to the codomain.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.640
But when it is, that is
what makes it a surjection.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.960
All right.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.720
Injections-- another variation
on the theme-- an injection

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.800
is a relation where
there is at most one

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.830
arrow into every
element in the codomain.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.280
So looking at this picture now,
this is not quite an injection

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.190
because there are at
least two points here

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.080
that have more than one
arrow coming into them.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.510
That's what keeps it
from being an injection.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.240
So let's fix that by deleting
a couple of those edges

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.260
that are crowding up
points, and now I'm

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.670
left with a situation where,
in fact, everything in B

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.530
has at most one an
arrow coming in.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.410
And so I'm showing you a
picture of an injection.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.100
And the final
concept is when you

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.650
have all the good properties.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:58.020
A bijection is when you
have exactly one arrow out

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.470
and exactly one arrow in.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.550
It's a total function that is
an injection and a surjection

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.070
because it's got greater
than or equal to 1

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.370
and less than or equal
to 1 and equal to 1

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.480
for all of the
domains and codomains.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.854
Now, there's an obvious thing
though about bijections,

00:08:16.854 --> 00:08:18.270
which we'll wrap
up with, which is

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.180
why they're useful
in counting theory

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.930
because it's clear that since
there's exactly one arrow out

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.760
of every element in A--
the number of arrows

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.670
is the same as the size of A--
and since there's exactly one

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.059
arrow coming into every element
of B, the number of arrows

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.700
is the same as the size of B.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.830
And guess what.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.080
That means that where
there's a bijection,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.490
the sets are of equal size.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:47.110
If there's a bijection between
two finite sets A and B,

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.345
that means that
they're the same size.
