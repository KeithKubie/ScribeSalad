00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:03.233
- [Voiceover] What I have
here are three numbers

00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:04.800
plotted on the number line.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.767
We have the number a, the
number c, the number b.

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:11.100
And then we have three -- (laughs)

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.133
we have four inequalities, actually.

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.900
Four inequalities that
involve absolute value.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.199
And what I want to do is figure out

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.900
which is these inequalities are true,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.233
given where a, c and b
are on the number line.

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.017
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:29.240
and try to think through it on your own.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.667
All right, let's look at this first one.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:33.166
It says that, "a is less than b."

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.766
So if we look at a and we look at b,

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:39.667
a is clearly to the left
of b on the number line.

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:42.933
So we know that this is true.

00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.333
Even more we know that a is negative,

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.400
it's to the left of zero,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.801
while b is positive.

00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:48.433
Which is, if one thing is negative and

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:49.333
the other thing is positive,

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.866
the negative thing is
definitely going to be

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.200
less than the positive thing.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.900
But even easier than that,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.401
a is to the left of b on the number line.

00:00:57.401 --> 00:00:59.366
If you're to the left of
something else on the number line

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.200
you're less than that other thing.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.133
Because the number line,

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.634
at least the way we've constructed it,

00:01:03.634 --> 00:01:07.113
it increases from left to right.

00:01:07.113 --> 00:01:08.233
All right, the next statement,

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:10.466
"The absolute value of a is

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.735
greater than the absolute value of b."

00:01:13.735 --> 00:01:14.433
Well, let's just think about

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:16.496
where these are on the number line.

00:01:16.496 --> 00:01:19.600
So we've already said
a is three hash marks

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.667
to the left of zero.

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:23.694
That is a.

00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:26.202
So what is going to be
the absolute value of a?

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:27.833
Well, the absolute value of a is the

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:29.800
distance that a is from zero.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.900
So the distance that a is from zero is

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.330
one, two, three hash marks.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.984
So the absolute value
of a is just going to be

00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:41.000
that same distance on the positive side.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.467
So the point that we marked as c

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:47.333
is also the absolute value of a.

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:49.866
So that is also the absolute value of a.

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.366
The absolute value of a -- sorry,

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:52.934
a is three to the left of zero.

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:56.167
Absolute value of a is going
to be three to the right.

00:01:56.167 --> 00:02:00.800
It's just a measure of, how
many hash marks is it from zero?

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.466
Well, it's three hash marks from zero

00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:04.766
so we put it right over here.

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:07.133
So is the absolute value of a greater than

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:08.800
the absolute value of b?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.840
Or what's the absolute value of b?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.840
Well, b is one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:19.867
eight hash marks to the right of zero.

00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:21.933
And so the absolute value of b

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.033
is going to be on the eighth hash mark.

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:25.767
Because it's eight hash
marks to the right.

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:28.433
So this is also the absolute value of b.

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:29.533
And this is consistent with

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:32.033
what we've learned about absolute value.

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:33.732
Absolute value of a positive number

00:02:33.732 --> 00:02:35.400
is just going to be that number again.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.433
Absolute value of a negative number

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:40.466
is going to be the
opposite of that number.

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:43.333
And absolute value of zero
is just going to be zero.

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:44.600
So is the absolute value of a

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.596
greater than the absolute value of b?

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:47.367
Well, no.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.900
Absolute value of a is to the left

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.400
of the absolute value
of b on our number line.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.362
It is less than the absolute value of b.

00:02:55.362 --> 00:02:58.300
So this is not true.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.733
All right, next statement.

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:03.463
"Absolute value of a is less
than the absolute value of c."

00:03:03.463 --> 00:03:05.918
Well, we already know that
the absolute value of a

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:08.684
is the same value as c.

00:03:08.684 --> 00:03:10.525
So what's the absolute value of c?

00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:11.866
Well, the absolute value
of a positive number

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:13.234
is just going to be that number.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.000
So this point right over here is also

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.566
the absolute value of c.

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:19.266
So we see that the absolute value of a

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:22.166
is equal to the absolute value of c.

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:23.533
It's not less than.

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:26.900
So we are going to mark that off.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.133
We could have written,
"Absolute value of a

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:30.433
is equal to absolute value of c."

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:32.133
That would have been true.

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:34.433
All right, last one.

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:36.761
a is less than c.

00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:41.100
Well, once again a is to the
left of c on the number line.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.934
So that is true, because our
number line is increasing

00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:45.733
as we go from left to right.

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:47.267
If one number is to the
left of another number,

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:49.066
it is less than the other number.

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:52.467
So a is indeed less than c.

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:54.262
And we are done.
