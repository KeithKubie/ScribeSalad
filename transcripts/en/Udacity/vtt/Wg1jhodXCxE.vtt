[Homework Assignment #2] This is homework assignment #2 in CS 373,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and it's all about Kalman filters. [Kalman Filters]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
[Measurement Update] So question #1 is measurement update.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's start with 2 Gaussians and say they have identical variances. Let's multiple them.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We know that the resulting Gaussian's mean will be just at the center between those 2 Gaussians.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I wonder if the variance Σ² is now smaller, larger, or the same as either of the individual Gaussian.

00:00:41.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please check one of the three.
