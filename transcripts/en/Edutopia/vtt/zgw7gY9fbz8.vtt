00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:04.876
&gt;&gt;Jenny: But that's not the point.

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:06.286
The point isn't who's throwing it.

00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:08.976
The point is Charles feels
like it was a personal attack,

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:10.216
and that's why he got angry.

00:00:10.216 --> 00:00:12.946
&gt;&gt;Mackenzie: From my point of
view, Mitchell's not intending

00:00:13.256 --> 00:00:14.546
to hit you with the frisbee.

00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:19.086
&gt;&gt;Kianna: So you see how reacting in
the way you did affected Mitchell.

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:19.956
&gt;&gt;Charles: Yeah, I can see that.

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:23.316
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Because we practice Restorative
Justice, we are teaching students

00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:26.256
to take personal responsibility
for their actions.

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:31.606
Students learn conflict resolution and
learn how to resolve their own issues.

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:32.976
&gt;&gt;Mackenzie: Mitchell said
all he wants is an apology.

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:44.506
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Restorative Justice in schools
is the idea that you have done something

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:48.486
to hurt the community, and you
need to fix it to make it right.

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:54.106
This is opposed to a traditional
discipline system which says,

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:57.226
"You did something wrong, and
now you must be punished for it."

00:00:57.226 --> 00:01:01.256
At our school Restorative Justice
dovetails with the traditional system.

00:01:01.876 --> 00:01:04.746
So the students can go
to the Justice Committee,

00:01:04.746 --> 00:01:06.606
instead of getting suspensions
and detentions.

00:01:07.136 --> 00:01:10.276
We offer it as an alternative way
for students to resolve issues

00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:11.846
with each other or with teachers.

00:01:14.176 --> 00:01:17.956
&gt;&gt;Jenny: The Justice Committee is
made up of students and faculty

00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:22.386
that help teach students
how to mediate conflict.

00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:23.556
&gt;&gt;Jenny: We have like perception--

00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:27.076
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Today we were training
our new Justice Committee members.

00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:32.076
We do mock mediations and play out a
scenario that could happen in school.

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:36.446
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: I was very frustrated
because we weren't doing it on purpose.

00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:40.766
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: The roles in Justice
Committee as the Teacher-Mediator,

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:43.526
they're there to have an
adult present in the room.

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:44.976
&gt;&gt;Mackenzie: Either of
you can answer this.

00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:47.176
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Then there
is Facilitator 1 and 2.

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:50.196
They go back and forth
between asking the questions

00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:51.406
and helping solve the issue.

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:56.456
Then you have the Affected Party
and the party that caused the issue.

00:01:57.426 --> 00:02:00.536
&gt;&gt;Kianna: J.C. is here to help both
parties reach an understanding.

00:02:00.756 --> 00:02:03.226
We are not here to determine
who is right or wrong.

00:02:03.476 --> 00:02:07.816
&gt;&gt;Kianna: The mock mediation gave
me and Mackenzie an opportunity

00:02:07.816 --> 00:02:09.426
to practice being a Facilitator.

00:02:09.426 --> 00:02:14.886
And it also gave our new members
an opportunity to see a meeting.

00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:18.036
&gt;&gt;Jenny: We start off
following a script.

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:20.216
We start with the Affected Person.

00:02:20.216 --> 00:02:22.676
And then move to the Responsible Party.

00:02:22.956 --> 00:02:24.486
We try and get their stories heard.

00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:27.316
&gt;&gt;Mackenzie: Mitchell, could you
please tell us what has been happening?

00:02:27.756 --> 00:02:29.866
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Charles was
getting annoyed with the fact

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:32.006
that we kept interfering
with his basketball game.

00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:34.356
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Mitchell was playing
the role of the Affected Party.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.716
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: One time when
my frisbee crossed the line

00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:39.616
and he got a little aggravated and
he ended up throwing it on the roof.

00:02:39.886 --> 00:02:43.766
&gt;&gt;Kianna: So Charles, can you
tell us your side of the story?

00:02:44.046 --> 00:02:45.196
&gt;&gt;Charles: I told him to leave us alone.

00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:48.646
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Charles is playing the
role of the Responsible Party.

00:02:48.706 --> 00:02:50.626
&gt;&gt;Charles: I mean, he
lost his frisbee, so what?

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:51.316
It's a frisbee.

00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:53.796
&gt;&gt;Jenny: And then it
moves into the discussion.

00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:56.146
And it's the discussion
and the probing questions

00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:58.106
that takes the most work
in training students.

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:00.126
&gt;&gt;Jenny: I want to just
stop for a second.

00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:03.446
So what's going on with
Charles' body language right now?

00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:04.926
&gt;&gt;Kianna: Nonchalant, doesn't care.

00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:05.726
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Yeah.

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:09.256
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Some of the
challenges that we have is the fact

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:11.476
that not everyone wants to participate

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:12.996
and see the other person's
point of view.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.656
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Charles agreed to come here.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.656
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: We get around
that by reminding them

00:03:16.656 --> 00:03:18.206
that they agreed to be here.

00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:21.076
&gt;&gt;Kianna: Charles, can
you take your earbuds out?

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:25.006
&gt;&gt;Rebecca: The Facilitators were
really good at finding positive ways

00:03:25.626 --> 00:03:28.756
to say what needs to be said.

00:03:28.836 --> 00:03:29.716
&gt;&gt;Jenny: Jump back in.

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:35.326
We need to figure out what Mitchell
needs, and we need to get Charles

00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:38.006
to understand Mitchell's perspective.

00:03:38.956 --> 00:03:42.226
&gt;&gt;Kianna: Mitchell, what do you need
to feel better about this situation?

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:44.386
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: I would feel
better if I got an apology.

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:47.996
&gt;&gt;Jenny: It's not about
punishing the person responsible.

00:03:48.226 --> 00:03:50.976
It's about giving the person
who's affected what they need.

00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:52.836
&gt;&gt;Kianna: Do you think you overreacted?

00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:54.396
&gt;&gt;Charles: Yeah.

00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:58.476
&gt;&gt;Mackenzie: And Mitchell, do you
understand why Charles got frustrated?

00:03:58.756 --> 00:04:00.136
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Yeah, I honestly do.

00:04:00.526 --> 00:04:04.286
&gt;&gt;Charles: Having both parties see
each other's sides is important

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:05.666
for resolving the issue.

00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:06.626
&gt;&gt;Mitchell: Apology accepted.

00:04:07.406 --> 00:04:08.526
&gt;&gt;Charles: No one wants
to be in a fight.

00:04:09.076 --> 00:04:11.376
But they don't always know
how to fix the problem.

00:04:11.736 --> 00:04:14.136
So Justice Committee is a way

00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:17.706
to help them realize what
they need to do and to do it.

00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:18.886
&gt;&gt;Jenny: I give you a lot of credit.

00:04:19.386 --> 00:04:21.076
This is really hard stuff.

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:22.386
So thank you, everyone!

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:22.896
&gt;&gt;Mackenzie: That was fun!
