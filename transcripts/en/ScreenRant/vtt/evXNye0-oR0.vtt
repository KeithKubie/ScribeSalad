Intro

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.460
They say that heroes live forever, but legends
never die – but in the world of franchise

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.720
filmmaking and television, the rules are a
little different.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.730
Ask a comic book fan, and they’ll tell you
that no superhero stays dead for long.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.400
Ask any action movie buff and they’ll tell
you the biggest stars will always find a way

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.439
to survive even impossible odds.

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.390
And on TV, even shows that claim no character
is safe rarely commit to killing off a regular?

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.450
But what’s the real reason that audiences
have started viewing character deaths with

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.620
rolling eyes or scoffs, instead of genuine
heartbreak?

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.320
There was definitely a time when a favorite
character meeting their end could make worldwide

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.879
news, whether on film, TV, or comic books.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.670
But these days, heroes hardly ever die.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.270
And for the most beloved, or profitable, even
death can’t hold them back.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.340
And the real reason is even more depressing
than you’d think, and the subject of our

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.339
latest Docu series: The REAL Reason Heroes
Never Die.

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:04.339
The Problem

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.790
On the surface, it shouldn’t be so tough
to understand: in life, people die all the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.790
time.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.161
Usually the bigger the hero, the more glorious
and unforgettable their final sacrifice, in

00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:15.790
real life or fiction.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.790
So why is that NOT the case in modern entertainment?

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.250
For starters, the amount of movies and TV
shows based on existing, fan-favorite or critically

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.470
acclaimed books, comics, or previous versions
is bigger than ever.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.110
But oftentimes, memorable character deaths
or horrible trauma is the reason they’re

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.840
acclaimed in the first place.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.840
But unlike TV shows or movie franchises, authors
write their story from start to finish before

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.860
releasing it – which means fans never got
a chance to pick a favorite, or threaten to

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.990
stop reading if the story took a turn they
hated.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.460
Add in things like franchise potential for
future spin-offs, lengthy actor contracts

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.560
the studios don’t want to waste, and good
old fashioned laziness, and it isn’t even

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.570
hard to find proof that the more recognizable
the hero, and the more devoted the fan following,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.160
the less death is even a concern – but that
doesn’t stop famous examples from still

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.890
trying to fool their audiences.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.890
The Walking Dead

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.950
Robert Kirkman’s comic series became famous
for pulling no punches, showing a zombie apocalypse

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.580
as nowhere near as ugly or horrible as the
ways people would react to it.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.260
TV had never seen a story that dark – with
the pilot episode showing its hero Rick executing

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.770
a zombified little girl – and it became
an overnight hit for AMC.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.010
Make that an overnight moneymaker for AMC.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.120
You see, what made the comic such a cruel,
unquittable horror show was the fact that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.350
no one was safe, and Kirkman’s love of especially
twisted deaths or unsettling violence scarred

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.600
the readers as much as the survivors.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.840
And almost immediately, the TV showrunners
started tailoring the show to keep fans watching,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.380
straying from the award-winning material.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.100
In the comics, Shane died in just the sixth
issue, showing how bad things had gotten,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.100
and how fast.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.270
But actor Jon Bernthal and his constant macho
head-butting with star Andrew Lincoln was

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.620
too good to end so soon, meaning Shane lived
well into the second season.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.700
And no Walking Dead fan will ever forget the
crew’s run-in with the menacing “Governor,”

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.110
who cut off Rick’s shooting hand, and murdered
Lori Grimes along with her newborn baby Judith.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.370
Unless you watched the show.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.819
In that case, Rick losing a hand was ruled
too expensive, despite Andrew Lincoln begging

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.690
them to stay true to the comic, and killing
a baby was too much for the network.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.160
But the best example came when Glen, a geeky
survivor grew into a hardened survivor, winning

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.980
over fans for his sense of humor, and awkward
romance with Maggie.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.420
It opened old wounds for comic fans, since
– SPOILER – they knew for years that Glen

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.250
would meet his end when the cast finally met
Negan (“Nee-ginn”) and his baseball bat,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.250
Lucille.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.010
Well, it might not actually be a spoiler,
since plenty believe that there’s no chance

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.020
the show will kill off a fan-favorite star.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.569
Pulling punches is one thing, but The Walking
Dead TV show has been pulling the teeth out

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.680
of the source material for years.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.959
The Dark Knight

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.090
Not every faked, hero-death comes from keep
fans happy.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.110
Sometimes, it’s just too hard for a creator
or director to NOT give his hero a happy ending.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.810
In lots of ways, Christopher Nolan’s Dark
Knight Trilogy was set up to have Bruce Wayne

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.040
sacrifice himself to save Gotham City – achieving
in death what he tried to accomplish in life.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.040
And in The Dark Knight Rises, that’s exactly
what happened… or so we thought.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.030
In hindsight, it doesn’t even make sense
for Bruce Wayne to say his goodbyes, even

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.949
revealing his true identity before heading
out of town with a nuclear bomb.

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.960
Thanks to some careful planning, he faked
out everyone, showing that he was completely

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.509
aware that his death would save the city – even
if he just pretended, and ran off to live

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.639
happily in Europe with Catwoman.

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.389
Ask a comic book fan, and they’ll tell you
that isn’t really Batman’s style, and

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.900
getting a happy ending at all isn’t really
true to the character.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.210
But did the fans mind?

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.210
Not at all.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.529
They watched Bruce spend his life being awesome,
and just like Christian Bale and Chris Nolan,

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:56.190
wanted to see him retire.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.159
Sequels didn’t even enter the equation – but
when you’re wrapping up a story that saw

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.249
you torture a poor little orphan, why not
let him live happily ever after?

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:07.939
It undoes his sacrifice completely, but...
hey, to each their own.

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:12.740
Game of Thrones

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.220
Yes, even one of the most kill-crazy TV shows
in history can’t help but hit the Undo button

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.120
when it really counts – but to make things
even sillier, the death of Jon Snow lacked

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.810
any meaning at all, if you noticed the completely
obvious and foreshadowing clues the showrunners

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.370
couldn’t help but include.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.849
When the audience watched as a dead man was
brought back to life by the Lord of Light

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.270
(S3E5) – a fact soon shared with the Red
Priestess – and the revelation went absolutely

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.759
nowhere, plenty of fans saw it as a clear
sign that the next death wouldn’t be what

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:44.939
it seemed.

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.659
Especially when a popular fan theory claimed
that if anyone was going to survive the show’s

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.699
murders, it was Jon Snow.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.150
At long last, Jon met his end at the hands
of the Night’s Watch.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.280
We want to say that it was a cruel, trolling
moving by the showrunners knowing Jon would

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.979
be revived in the next season, but they COULDN’T
EVEN KEEP FROM SHOWING the Red Priestess arrive

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.069
the scene before his death!

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.869
Actor Kit Harrington even had to pretend to
say his goodbyes to the cast, shedding tears

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:12.089
for their adopted brother, every bit in the
dark as viewers.

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:16.199
But George R.R. Martin has resurrected even
more dead characters in the books, so maybe

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:22.169
we’re lucky.

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.339
The Man of Steel

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:27.780
Fans always knew that no matter how bad the
fight between Batman and Superman got in Dawn

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.050
of Justice, the heroes would wind up on the
same side – even if it took Wonder woman

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.330
to get them to smarten up.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.009
But even when Doomsday – the creature who
killed Superman in the comics – was revealed

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:42.210
to be in the movie, it was obvious Zack Snyder
wouldn’t KILL Superman in just his second

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.389
movie… right?

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.979
Shockingly, the scene played out with even
more action and sentiment than in the comics,

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:52.780
with Superman finally killing the abomination
by shoving the beast’s own bone spear into

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.139
his chest so they would EACH die.

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:59.249
And with his death, the Justice League started
to form.

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:03.360
In the comics, the Death of Superman made
news around the world, and even though DC

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.550
always planned to bring him back, undercutting
the entire event, and forever rendering death

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.379
meaningless in comics books, they didn’t
tell people at the time.

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:18.449
But as the face of an entire universe of movie
franchises, Snyder and Warner Bros. had sequels

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:20.830
to think about, not just stunning their audience.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:30.099
So with a bit of levitating dirt over Superman’s
coffin in the final shot, audiences are told

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:34.240
that the death, just minutes old, wasn’t
actually what they figured.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.469
It still carries weight, since it’s the
sacrifice that matters.

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:41.860
But it’s a clear example of just how little
weight death can carry when the risk of turning

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.099
off millions of movie-goers is on the minds
of the studio.

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:47.490
Marvel’s Civil War

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.399
The Russo Brother admitted from the start
that their movie version of Marvel’s Civil

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:56.409
War would be different from the comics – not
only would hundreds of people NOT be killed

00:07:56.409 --> 00:08:01.479
in order to pit Cap and Iron Man against eachother,
since a dozen would do – but the comic event

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:05.149
that was packed with tons of shocking deaths,
reveals, or injuries was stripped of all of

00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:06.149
them.

00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:09.569
And the reason is obvious: you can’t murder
a hero without bringing the entire audience

00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:11.241
down, or scaring young viewers.

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:16.809
You can’t show Johnny Storm being beaten
by a mob for… a few reasons, and most of

00:08:16.809 --> 00:08:21.210
all, you can’t end the movie by killing
your cash cow, Captain America – even though

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.300
that was the final moment that drove home
just how important the comic event really

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.270
was, seeing the mantle pass on to his sidekick,
Bucky.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.979
Where DC went through with killing Superman
in a pretty gruesome death scene before revealing

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:38.529
he was actually totally fine, don’t worry
about it, Marvel never even came close.

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:42.360
Bucky loses an arm he’s already lost, but
when you have two billion-dollar heroes fighting

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.310
to the death… it’s pretty obvious the
studio needs both of them to walk away – since

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:51.000
the actors are either still under contract,
or pre-production on their next movie is already

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
underway.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.290
We’d like to say that Captain America stopping
the fight was a brilliant ending, and it might

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.389
still be, but it’s really the only one that
results in more movies – and a potential

00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:01.139
team-up when all is forgiven.

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:05.259
But one thing is clear: fans hoping to see
Captain America’s death play out in the

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:07.579
MCU shouldn’t hold their breath.

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:12.090
Not until Chris Evans starts asking for too
much money, anyway.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.090
So what do you think?

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.769
Do you agree that Hollywood’s need to keep
bankable characters alive will always win

00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:20.699
out, even if those character’s deaths are
what got the stories adapted in the first

00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:21.699
place?

00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:24.670
Or do you think studios are right to give
their fans more of the characters and actors

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.450
that they love, and rewrite the story along
the way?

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.399
We won’t have to make up our minds any time
soon, since more adaptations are already on

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:35.459
the way, but let us know your thoughts in
