00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So the answer is we should use the "add<u>page</u>to_index" procedure we just defined,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and we should pass in the index.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We should pass in the page, that's the URL that identifies the location,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we should pass in the content.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And that's all we need.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So we're done with our web crawler.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
&gt;From a seed, we can find a set of pages.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Following that seed, following all the links that we find on the pages that we find starting from that seed,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
for each page, we're going to add the content that we find on that page to an index,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and we're going to return that index.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And we've already written a code that given the index, can do a lookup.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So for any word we want to look up, we'll find the list of URLs for the pages that contain that word.
