00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.200
We're on problem 145.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:21.130
It says, is 1/p greater than
r/r squared plus 2.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.580
That's their question.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.900
Statement number one-- I realize
I go on these tangents

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.410
before even looking at the
statement; I should look at

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.410
the statements first--
p is equal to r.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.560
So let's see if we can
simplify this.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.770
So if p is equal to r, then we
get 1/r-- instead of a p,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.340
right?-- is greater than
r/r squared plus 2.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.460
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by r.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.150
Well, we don't know that r is
necessarily greater than 0.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.400
That's the problem.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.890
So if r is greater than 0--
well, it's going to change the

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.990
inequality one way
or the other.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.620
So let's just assume r
is greater than 0.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.040
So if we multiply both sides of
the equation by r, then we

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.595
don't have to switch the
inequality, because we're

00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:13.760
assuming r greater than 0.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.220
That's an assumption.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.390
Then you get 1 is greater
than r squared over r

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.310
squared plus 2.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.330
And then if r is greater than
0, then r squared plus 2--

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.080
actually, r squared plus 2 is
always going to be greater

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.480
than 0, because r squared
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.920
positive.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.170
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by r

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.180
squared plus 2.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.880
And you get r squared plus 2
is greater than r squared.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.410
You could subtract r squared
from both sides, and you get 2

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.040
is greater than 0,
which is true.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.425
But remember, I had to make
this assumption that r is

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:40.580
greater than 0.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.360
If you assume that r less than
0, then all of this is going

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.080
to break down.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.610
Because when you multiply both
sides by r, you have to switch

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.150
the inequality to get 1 is less
than r squared over r

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.620
squared plus 2.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.600
And then, eventually, you're
going to end up with r squared

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.010
plus 2 is less than r squared.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.920
Or that 2 his less than
0, which is false.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.090
So this statement alone
isn't enough.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.640
We have to know whether
or not r is greater 0.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.153
Statement two-- well, there you
go; I really should look

00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:20.480
at the statements first--
r is greater 0.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.320
And just so you know, statement
two by itself is

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.420
insufficient, because if you
know that r is greater than 0,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.950
you have no idea what p is.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.420
So you can't answer it yet.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.710
But both statements combined
are sufficient

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.960
to answer this question.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.400
Next question.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.680
146.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.065
Is n an integer?

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.700
Statement one says n squared
is an integer.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.290
Well, that doesn't help us.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.070
I mean, what if n was equal
to the square root of 2?

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.290
And then n squared
would be equal to

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.050
2, which is an integer.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.260
But this is clearly
not an integer.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.460
But on the other hand, n could
be equal to 2, in which case n

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.740
squared would be an integer.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.120
So whether or not n squared is
an integer, both of these are

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.910
cases where n squared are
integers, but one ends up

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.490
where n is an integer, one is
where n isn't an integer.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.630
So this, by itself, is not
enough to tell me whether n is

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.460
an integer.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.700
Statement two tells
us, the square

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.450
root of n is an integer.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.550
OK.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:48.360
So that essentially tells us
that n is equal to some

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.640
integer squared, right?

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.110
You could take the square
root of both sides.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.380
You'd get the square root of
n is equal to some integer.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.160
So you take any integer, you
square it, you're going to get

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.050
an integer.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.320
So statement two alone
is sufficient

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.590
to answer this question.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.350
That was a strangely
easy question.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.650
They they were getting a
little bit hairy and

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.780
confusing, but that was a nice
little rest question, I think.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.850
147.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.930
If n is a positive integer--
so n is a positive integer.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.300
Well, n is greater than 0.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.870
It's an integer.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.130
Well, I didn't write
that down.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:32.040
Is n to the third minus
n divisible by 4?

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.080
Fascinating.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.290
Let's see.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.110
So my initial reaction is to see
if I can simplify this as

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.150
a product of simpler
expressions.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.030
I look already at statement
number one.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.150
Let me look at statement
number one.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.486
Statement number one says, n is
equal to 2k plus 1, where k

00:04:50.486 --> 00:04:51.330
is an integer.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.150
I don't feel like taking 2k
plus 1 and cubing it.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.230
That's not an easy
thing to do.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.360
It'll take some time.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.550
So my intuition is that maybe
we should simplify this a

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.410
little bit.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.020
So if we factor out an n, that's
equal to n times n

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.670
squared, minus 1.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.560
And that's equal to n times--
what's n squared minus 1?

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.870
That's n plus 1, times
n minus 1.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.490
And now this is something
that's much easier to

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.006
substitute this into.

00:05:18.006 --> 00:05:19.010
So let's do that.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.730
Let's substitute n equals
2k plus 1 into this.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:28.830
So if n is equal to 2k plus 1,
you get 2k plus 1, times 2k

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.960
plus 1, plus 1.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.560
So that's 2k plus 2.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.660
That's this one.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.990
And then you have 2k
plus 1, minus 1.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.440
So that's just 2k.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.070
And then what does
that simplify to?

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.540
You get 2k plus 1.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.990
Remember, in the back my mind, I
want a 4 to show up, because

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.620
I want this thing to
be divisible by 4.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.850
2k plus 1, times 4k
squared plus 4k.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:57.730
Interesting.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.860
So now I can factor out a 4.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:07.680
So it's 2k plus 1, times k
squared plus k, times 4.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.530
And we know that this is an
integer, because they told us

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.600
that k is an integer.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600
We know that this
is an integer,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.850
because k is an integer.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.010
And we know 4 is an integer.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.420
So we've essentially kind of
factored n cubed minus n.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.950
And 4 is one of it's factors.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.360
So it's definitely
divisible by 4.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.320
I mean, we can divide
it by 4 right now.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.890
If we divide it by 4, we'd be
left with this, which is

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.890
clearly an integer, because
k is an integer.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.020
So n to the third minus n is
divisible by 4 if we can

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.910
assume that n is equal
to 2k plus 1,

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.170
where k is some integer.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.240
Now, what do they tell
us in statement two?

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.420
Statement two tells us,
n squared plus n is

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:59.010
divisible by 6.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.400
Well, I don't see how that's
helpful at all.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.180
n squared plus n is
divisible by 6.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.980
You can't even relate
that to that.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.270
I mean, n squared--
I could try to do

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.070
something fancy here.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.420
No.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.286
This is so different than this.
n squared plus n is so

00:07:21.286 --> 00:07:23.660
different from n to the third.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.750
I could factor out an n.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.650
I could say n times n plus
1 is divisible by 6.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.180
Well, I guess that's
interesting.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.450
That tells us that this part
is divisible by 6.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.550
n times n plus 1 is
divisible by 6.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.480
Do they tell us that n is
a positive integer?

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.420
Yeah, they do tell us that
n is a positive integer.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.440
So this could be 2 and 3.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.550
If this is 2 and 3, then
this would be 1.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.180
This could be 2 and 3.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.790
In fact-- well, this could be
2 and 3, but it could also

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.580
be-- well, actually, that's the
only numbers it could be.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.890
It could be 2 and 3, in which
case this is 1, in which case

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:19.620
this whole thing-- if you say
this, then n could be 2.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.870
n is equal to 2.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.355
n plus 1 is equal to 3.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.722
And then n minus 1 would
be equal to 1.

00:08:31.722 --> 00:08:32.400
And let me see.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.386
Is that the only case?

00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:36.167
I'm looking at the answer right
now, just because I want

00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:37.049
to make sure.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.419
They say that this
isn't sufficient.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.210
But, once again, kind of like
problem 142, actually--

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:48.210
because if you say that n is a
positive integer and that n

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:55.990
times n plus 1 is divisible by
6, I can't think of any other

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.000
numbers where you multiply one
number times the next number,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.030
and their integers, where
you get a multiple of 6.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.190
No, I take that back.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.500
It could be 3 and 4.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.920
There could be 3 and 4.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.590
It could be-- yeah, there's
actually a bunch of them.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:17.310
This could be 3, this could be
4, because it's a multiple 6,

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.470
and then this would be 2.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.020
So that's right.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.420
This is not enough
information.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.030
So that's good.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.590
Because by this information, n
could be 2, n plus 1 could be

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.370
3, in which case, this number
would be actually 6.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.930
But that still doesn't help
us, because 6 isn't

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:31.860
divisible by 4.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.280
But then I could come up with
the situation where this

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.800
number right here, where n is 3,
n plus 1 is 4, and n minus

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.270
1 is 2, where this does
become divisible by 4.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.260
So this doesn't give us
enough information.
