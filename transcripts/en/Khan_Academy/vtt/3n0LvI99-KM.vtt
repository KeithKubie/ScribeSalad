00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.330
So we're told that quadrilateral
ABCD is a square, which

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.220
tells us that the four
sides have equal length

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.830
and that all the interior
angles are 90 degrees.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.182
We also know that FG is a
perpendicular bisector of BC.

00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:20.140
So we've already shown
that it's perpendicular,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.570
that this is a 90-degree angle.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.540
But it also bisects
BC, so this length

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.270
is equal to that length
right over there.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.520
Then they tell us that arc AC--
that's a curve on top-- arc AC

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.200
is part of circle B. So this
is a circle centered at B.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.220
So if this is the
center of the circle,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.220
this is part of that circle.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.400
It's really kind of the bottom
left quarter of that circle.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.020
And then given that
information, they

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.260
want us to find what the
measure of angle BED is.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.252
So what is BED?

00:00:54.252 --> 00:00:56.190
So we need to figure
out the measure

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.920
of this angle right over here.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.550
And I encourage you to
pause it and try it out.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.707
And you might
imagine-- well, you

00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:04.540
could pause it and try
it without any hints.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.410
And now I will give you a hint
if you tried it the first time

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.659
and you weren't able to do it.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.330
And you should pause again
after this hint-- try

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.660
to draw some triangles
that maybe split up

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.740
this angle into a couple
of different angles.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.240
And it might be a
little bit easier.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.160
You might be able to use some
of what we know about triangles.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.920
Now, with that said, I
will try to solve it.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.430
And you should
pause at any point

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.420
where you think that you know
exactly how to do this and try

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.030
to do it yourself.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.730
So the trick here to realize
that this is a circle.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.590
And so any line that goes
between B and any point

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.470
on this arc is going to be equal
to the radius of the circle.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.900
So AB is equal to the
radius of the circle.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.272
BE is equal to the
radius of the circle.

00:01:43.272 --> 00:01:44.980
And we can keep drawing
other things that

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.563
are equal to the
radius of the circle.

00:01:46.563 --> 00:01:49.689
BC is equal to the
radius of the circle.

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.230
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.650
If we were to draw it-- and
a lot of trickier geometry

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.470
problems really all revolve
around drawing the right lines

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.190
or visualizing the
right triangles.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.040
And I'll do one right here that
might open up a lot for you

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.740
in terms of thinking about
how to do this problem.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.500
So let me draw segment EC.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.050
I'll draw that as
straight as possible.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.120
I can draw a better job
of that, so segment EC.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.600
Now something
becomes interesting.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.700
Because what is the relationship
between triangle EBG

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.170
and triangle ECG?

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.510
Well, they both definitely
share this side right over here.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.810
They both share side EG.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.814
And then BG is equal
to GC, and they both

00:02:36.814 --> 00:02:37.730
have 90-degree angles.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.320
You have a 90-degree angle here.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.060
You have a 90-degree
angle there.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.980
So you see by side-angle-side
that these two triangles

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.620
are going to be congruent.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:59.380
So we know that triangle EBG is
congruent to triangle ECG-- I

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.310
should emphasize
the C, not the E--

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.045
by side-angle-side congruency.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.720
And that also tells us that
all of the corresponding angles

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.610
and sides are going
to be the same.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.565
So that tells us right there
that EC is equal to EB.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.770
So we know that
EB is equal to EC.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.855
And what also is
equal to that length?

00:03:34.855 --> 00:03:36.980
Well, once again, this is
the radius of the circle.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.050
BE is one radius of the
circle going from the center

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.130
to the arc.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.230
But so is BC.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.790
It is also a radius of the
circle going from the center

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.860
to the arc.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.700
So this is also equal to BC.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.559
So I could draw the
three things right here.

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.350
I'm referring to the
entire thing, not just

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.970
one of the segments, all of BC.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.720
So what kind of a
triangle is this right

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.630
over here, triangle BEC?

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.450
Triangle BEC is equilateral.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.610
And we know that because
all three sides are equal,

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.310
so that tells us that all
of its angles are equal.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.100
So that tells us that
the measure of angle

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.680
BEC-- we're not done yet, but it
gets us close-- is 60 degrees.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.199
So the measure of angle BEC
right over there is 60 degrees.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.740
So that gives us
part of the problem.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.160
BEC is part of the angle BED.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.521
If we can just figure out
the measure of angle CED now,

00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:36.520
if we can figure out this
angle right over here,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.050
we just add that to 60
degrees, and we're done.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.150
We've figured out
the entire BED.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.850
Now, let's think about how we
can do this right over here.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.770
So there's a couple
of interesting things

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.640
that we already do know.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.280
We know that this
right over here

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.730
is equal to the
radius of the circle.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.290
And we also know that this
length down here-- this

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.810
is a square-- we know that
this length down here is

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.590
the same as this length
up here, that these

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.610
are the exact same length.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.754
And this is equal to the
radius of the circle.

00:05:08.754 --> 00:05:10.420
We already put these
three slashes here.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.930
BC is the same as that length
is the same as that length.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.700
And so all four sides are
going to be that same length

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.730
because this is a square.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.500
So let me write this down.

00:05:25.674 --> 00:05:26.840
I'll just write it this way.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.600
Because it's a square,
we know that CD

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.666
is equal to BC,
which is equal to--

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:36.040
and we already
established this--

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.691
is equal to EC, which is equal
to EB, which is equal to EC.

00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:42.440
But the important thing
here is to realize

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.950
that this and this
are the same length.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.940
And the reason why
that is interesting

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.890
is it lets us know that this
is an isosceles triangle.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.120
So isosceles triangle, if
you have your two legs of it,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.610
the two base angles are
going to be congruent.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.220
So whatever angle
this green angle is,

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.270
this angle is going
to be as well.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.550
So if somehow we can figure
out this angle right over here,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.400
we can subtract that from
180, and then divide by 2

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.400
to figure out these two.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.983
Because we know that
they're the same.

00:06:10.983 --> 00:06:12.630
So how can we figure
out this angle?

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.870
Well, we know all the
angles of this thing.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.480
We can figure out the angles of
all of this larger one up here.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.610
We know this is an
equilateral triangle.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.350
So this over here has to
be 60 degrees, as well.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.630
That's 60 degrees.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.430
And that is also 60 degrees.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.000
In fact, I could
write over here,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.035
which is equal to the
measure of angle BCE.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.464
So if this is 60
degrees, we know

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:42.880
we're dealing with a square,
so this whole angle over here

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.390
is a right angle.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.417
What is the measure
of angle ECD?

00:06:47.417 --> 00:06:48.875
What is this angle
right over here?

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.720
Let me do this in a new color.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.510
This right over here is going
to have to be 30 degrees,

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.790
so that is going
to be 30 degrees.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.660
And now, we're ready to solve
for these two base angles.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.260
If we call these x-- and we
know they have to be the same--

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.730
we have x plus x
plus 30 degrees.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.260
x plus x plus 30
degrees is going

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.720
to be equal to 180 degrees.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.640
That's the sum of all of the
interior angles of a triangle.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:25.580
So you get 2x plus 30
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.790
Now, you can subtract
30 from both sides.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:33.470
And we are left with
2x is equal to 150.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.650
Divide both sides by 2,
you get x is equal to 75.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.190
So we've figured out
that x is equal to 75.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.720
And now we're at
the home stretch.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.453
We need to figure out angle BED.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.470
So x is equal to the
measure of angle CED.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:08:00.040
So BED is CED plus BEC, so the
60 degrees plus 75 degrees.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.270
So it's going to be-- ready for
the drum roll-- this is going

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:08.250
to be equal to 75 degrees
plus 60 degrees, which

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.660
is equal to 135 degrees.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.340
And we are done.
