- [Comedian] And I can see at this point,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.720
that not wearin' pants

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.837
(laughing)

00:00:05.837 --> 00:00:09.320
holdin' my shirt down over my dick,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.415
and I push through the door into

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:12.936
the lobby of a five-star hotel.

00:00:12.936 --> 00:00:14.675
(laughing)

00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:18.342
(pumping electronica music)

00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:31.663
- [Ari] Welcome to This is Not Happening

00:00:31.663 --> 00:00:33.300
presents "One Crazy Night".

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.328
So this is what we do.

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:35.926
We're a bunch of comedians,

00:00:35.926 --> 00:00:37.575
tell stories about a similar subject.

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:38.967
So this is just one crazy night.

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:40.003
Give it up for my friend and yours,

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:41.228
Mr. John Huck, everybody!

00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:44.728
(cheering and applauding)

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:48.876
- Keep it goin' for Ari.

00:00:48.876 --> 00:00:52.855
(cheering and applauding)

00:00:52.855 --> 00:00:54.392
You know, I'm like every other kid.

00:00:54.392 --> 00:00:55.401
My parents were alright.

00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:57.381
They weren't well off, but they did okay,

00:00:57.381 --> 00:00:59.351
and I got a bunch of
money when I graduated.

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:00.184
And I was like, "oh, you know what I wanna

00:01:00.184 --> 00:01:01.527
"do with this money?

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:03.337
"I wanna go to the biggest party

00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:05.360
"that serves the most beer

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.694
"in the entire world."

00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:07.604
And my friend goes, "Yeah.

00:01:07.604 --> 00:01:09.359
"That's Munich, Germany, for Oktoberfest."

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.501
And I'm like, "Yeah, I wanna do that.

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:12.334
"I wanna do that.

00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:13.426
"I wanna go to Munich, Germany,

00:01:13.426 --> 00:01:14.784
"I wanna go to Oktoberfest,

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:16.242
"and I wanna drink all
the beer that's there.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.087
"That's what I wanna do.

00:01:17.087 --> 00:01:18.119
"That's my plan."
(laughing)

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.555
Eventually we got to Oktoberfest

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:21.810
for the very last weekend
in Munich, Germany.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.096
We don't have any real money,

00:01:23.096 --> 00:01:24.294
so we get a campsite,

00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:25.812
we go to a campsite, pay the money.

00:01:25.812 --> 00:01:28.134
We find a little space
we can call our own.

00:01:28.134 --> 00:01:30.230
We set up a tent, and it starts to rain.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.063
(laughing)

00:01:31.063 --> 00:01:32.219
So we're like, "Oh, it's raining."

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:33.669
It's startin' to get really cold,

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:36.395
and the only place you can get shelter

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:38.779
in the whole campsite was at this

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:42.839
little cement slab picnic
table, had the roof.

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:44.792
And then it had a vending machine

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:47.355
that sold liter bottles of Lowenbrau.

00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:48.930
(laughing)

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.216
Yeah.

00:01:50.216 --> 00:01:51.720
Pretty fucking awesome.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.464
And I'm, you know, I can drink 12

00:01:53.464 --> 00:01:55.841
Miller Lites, no problem.

00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:57.128
There's like 12 Miller Lites in every

00:01:57.128 --> 00:01:58.414
liter bottle of Lowenbrau.

00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:00.664
(laughing)

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.771
I have like three, four, five

00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:06.064
of these liter bottles of Lowenbrau,

00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:09.357
and all of a sudden, like, a bus pulls up.

00:02:09.357 --> 00:02:10.190
And they're like, "Yep,"

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.023
(honking)

00:02:11.023 --> 00:02:12.281
"time to go to the festival!"

00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:13.114
And I'm like, "What are you,

00:02:13.114 --> 00:02:14.485
"what are you talking about?

00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:16.826
"This is the festival right here!

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:17.659
"We're not leaving this.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:18.922
"The beer comes outta here,

00:02:18.922 --> 00:02:20.399
"why would we leave this?"

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:21.953
(laughing)

00:02:21.953 --> 00:02:23.520
"I wanna be with this machine

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.687
"for the rest of my life."

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.673
But they're like, "No, no, no,

00:02:27.673 --> 00:02:28.530
"you can bring the beer with you.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.062
"Get another one and bring it on the bus."

00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:30.934
I'm like, "Oh, yeah!

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:31.871
"We drink on the bus.

00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:33.579
"Fuck it, no laws, alright."

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:34.598
Germany, no laws?

00:02:34.598 --> 00:02:35.431
A lotta laws.

00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:36.953
(laughing)

00:02:36.953 --> 00:02:38.036
A lotta laws.

00:02:39.356 --> 00:02:40.439
Serious laws.

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:45.477
But I get on the bus with
my two idiot friends,

00:02:45.477 --> 00:02:46.592
and we're drinkin' beers,

00:02:46.592 --> 00:02:48.342
and it's like I said,
a 30 minute bus ride.

00:02:48.342 --> 00:02:49.353
And we're like, "Yay, alright,

00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:50.632
"the festival's great.

00:02:50.632 --> 00:02:52.440
"Whoo, bus ride!"

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.248
Get to the actual festival,

00:02:54.248 --> 00:02:55.778
and me and my friends just kinda

00:02:55.778 --> 00:02:57.874
tack on to this group that we're with

00:02:57.874 --> 00:02:59.090
that was from our campsite.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.474
And we just follow them

00:03:00.474 --> 00:03:02.499
right to the Hofbrauhaus tent.

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.768
And it was everything you'd ever expect.

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:06.928
There was an oompah band is playing.

00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:08.529
There's tiny women with huge boobs

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:09.969
running around with a lotta steins.

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.418
Everyone's got a sausage.

00:03:11.418 --> 00:03:13.226
Fuckin' french fries are everywhere.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:16.510
It's a good time, it's fun, right?

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.745
And we kinda get a table,

00:03:17.745 --> 00:03:19.110
and we just started cheersing

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.821
and singing and drinking beers.

00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:22.783
We do this for a couple of hours.

00:03:22.783 --> 00:03:26.471
We're havin' the best time
as far as I know, right?

00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:28.568
At about 11 o'clock at night,

00:03:28.568 --> 00:03:30.341
all the lights in the tent go up.

00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:31.546
And they're like, "Welp,

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:33.912
"festival's over, gotta get out."

00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:34.786
And this is when I decide

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:37.989
to turn into a super classy American guy.

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.620
I'm like, (slurring) "11 o'clock?

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.967
"you guys are fuckin' pussies,

00:03:40.967 --> 00:03:42.045
"this is how you drink?

00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:42.878
(blowing raspberry)

00:03:42.878 --> 00:03:43.711
"Uh!"

00:03:43.711 --> 00:03:45.509
(laughing)

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.631
Making fun of everybody I see.

00:03:47.631 --> 00:03:48.965
And so security's like,

00:03:48.965 --> 00:03:51.449
"Get him outta here."

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:52.788
So my friend's like,
"Yeah, get outta here."

00:03:52.788 --> 00:03:55.280
So they shoved me kinda through the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.863
big giant flap of this circus tent

00:03:57.863 --> 00:04:01.257
that we're under, and I black out.

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:03.470
When I finally come to,

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.005
I'm slowly noticing that I'm

00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:10.180
in the middle of downtown
Munich by myself.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.568
(laughing)

00:04:11.568 --> 00:04:12.827
I don't know where my friends are.

00:04:12.827 --> 00:04:13.870
I don't where anybody
who I was drinking with.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.068
Nobody's around me, I'm by myself,

00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:18.776
and as I'm kinda coming to,

00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:20.207
I'm also noticing that

00:04:20.207 --> 00:04:22.727
I have to take the
biggest shit of my life.

00:04:22.727 --> 00:04:23.751
(laughing)

00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:25.290
I think I did what any of us would do

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.289
when you have to go to the bathroom.

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.323
I just started randomly banging on doors.

00:04:28.323 --> 00:04:30.573
(laughing)

00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:34.856
And I only know two German words,

00:04:34.856 --> 00:04:36.566
so I was yelling one of
the German words I know,

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:37.742
I'm like, "Scheisse!

00:04:37.742 --> 00:04:39.029
"Scheisse!

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.255
"Scheisse!"

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:43.151
Banging on the door, and oddly enough,

00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:46.175
nobody answered the door and was like,

00:04:46.175 --> 00:04:47.615
"Oh, strange American,

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:48.568
"you need to poop?

00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:50.026
"Alright...
(laughing)

00:04:50.026 --> 00:04:53.095
"bathroom's down the hall."

00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:53.928
So I'm bangin' on doors,

00:04:53.928 --> 00:04:54.958
nobody's opening the doors.

00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.541
I'm like, let's be honest,

00:04:56.541 --> 00:04:58.502
it's nature, it has to come out, right?

00:04:58.502 --> 00:04:59.646
It's not stopping.

00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:01.912
I can't hold it in any more.

00:05:01.912 --> 00:05:03.981
So I'm like, "Well, I need to fix this."

00:05:03.981 --> 00:05:06.150
So I kinda spy an alley.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.617
So I kinda run down the alley,

00:05:07.617 --> 00:05:09.130
and I'm like, "Alright, no one's around."

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.047
I haven't seen a human
being for a long time.

00:05:11.047 --> 00:05:12.477
I kinda drop trou.

00:05:12.477 --> 00:05:14.196
I don't kinda do anything, I drop trou.

00:05:14.196 --> 00:05:16.750
(laughing)

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.614
And I start to do my business

00:05:18.614 --> 00:05:20.430
all over a little pile of bricks there

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.741
that is just in the alley
for whatever reason.

00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:24.734
And it's angry business.

00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:26.401
It's angry business.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.213
(laughing)

00:05:28.213 --> 00:05:30.997
Like super angry business.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.839
Lowenbrau went in super fast

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.513
and it wants out even faster.

00:05:34.513 --> 00:05:35.346
Like, uh!

00:05:36.861 --> 00:05:37.969
I swear to God, that beer has a fist.

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:38.897
(laughing)

00:05:38.897 --> 00:05:41.730
That's all I'm gonna say about it.

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.014
So I'm full on in the
middle of my business,

00:05:46.014 --> 00:05:47.093
and as I'm like,

00:05:47.093 --> 00:05:48.884
you know you're sweating
with relief, like,

00:05:48.884 --> 00:05:49.984
"Oh, thank God, uh,

00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:51.502
"I'm getting this out of my body.

00:05:51.502 --> 00:05:53.140
"This is the greatest feeling ever."

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.733
And as I'm feeling relief

00:05:54.733 --> 00:05:56.749
but kinda look to my left,

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:58.065
and I notice a couple holding hands

00:05:58.065 --> 00:06:00.315
(laughing)

00:06:01.158 --> 00:06:03.424
on a nice leisurely stroll

00:06:03.424 --> 00:06:05.257
into the German night.

00:06:07.412 --> 00:06:08.941
And I can't stop what I'm doing.

00:06:08.941 --> 00:06:10.262
(laughing)

00:06:10.262 --> 00:06:11.911
The only way out of the alley

00:06:11.911 --> 00:06:13.178
is to walk past me.

00:06:13.178 --> 00:06:15.214
And the alley is like from me to you.

00:06:15.214 --> 00:06:16.912
It's not a big alley, it's an alley.

00:06:16.912 --> 00:06:19.974
(laughing)

00:06:19.974 --> 00:06:21.360
So, I'm like, "Oh my God,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.221
"what am I gonna do about this?"

00:06:23.221 --> 00:06:25.372
So I do, again, what any of us would do.

00:06:25.372 --> 00:06:27.253
I took the jacket that I had taken off

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:28.818
and I put it over my head.

00:06:28.818 --> 00:06:31.068
(laughing)

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.111
And all I'm thinkin' in my head is,

00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:40.679
"Please don't be from America,

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:41.512
"please don't be from...

00:06:41.512 --> 00:06:42.459
"just be from Germany,

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:43.629
"you'll think this is porn,

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:45.411
"I don't know what, this would be great.

00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:49.065
"You won't care, don't be from America."

00:06:49.065 --> 00:06:51.323
And I got the jacket over my head.

00:06:51.323 --> 00:06:54.678
I can hear them walking closer and closer.

00:06:54.678 --> 00:06:57.629
And then I can pinpoint the exact area

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:00.008
where they realize what
they were looking at.

00:07:00.008 --> 00:07:02.258
(laughing)

00:07:03.713 --> 00:07:05.630
And I hear the girl in a perfect

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.295
Naperville, Illinois, accent go,

00:07:07.295 --> 00:07:08.419
"Oh my God, that's the

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:09.967
"sickest thing I've ever seen!

00:07:09.967 --> 00:07:11.794
(laughing)

00:07:11.794 --> 00:07:12.627
The guy just goes,

00:07:12.627 --> 00:07:14.835
(retching)

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:18.669
And they run off down the
alley like freaking out.

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:19.945
And I've got my jacket over my head,

00:07:19.945 --> 00:07:21.142
and I'm still in the
middle of what I'm doin',

00:07:21.142 --> 00:07:22.240
and I just yelled out the only other

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.266
German word I know,

00:07:23.266 --> 00:07:24.301
"Nein!

00:07:24.301 --> 00:07:25.669
"Nein!

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:27.037
"Nein!"

00:07:27.037 --> 00:07:28.430
Because I figure they're gonna think

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.376
I'm German and, "Oh,
that's just German people.

00:07:30.376 --> 00:07:31.572
"Hey, poopin' in the alley.

00:07:31.572 --> 00:07:32.590
"Whaddya gonna do?"

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.071
(laughing)

00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:36.439
So they're finally gone.

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:38.519
I take the jacket off my head.

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:41.838
I finish up, leave my
underwear as a DNA sample.

00:07:41.838 --> 00:07:43.646
(laughing)

00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:46.697
And I move on down the road.

00:07:46.697 --> 00:07:49.099
I think the only reason
I came out of my blackout

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:52.557
was because of that ferocious shit.

00:07:52.557 --> 00:07:55.238
And once it was gone, I blacked out again.

00:07:55.238 --> 00:07:56.406
(laughing)

00:07:56.406 --> 00:07:57.407
When I come to the next time,

00:07:57.407 --> 00:07:58.918
it's probably a couple hours later,

00:07:58.918 --> 00:08:02.364
I don't know, really, not
good with time obviously.

00:08:02.364 --> 00:08:05.055
I come to, I'm like, "What?"

00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:08.367
I'm standing in a beautiful bathroom.

00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:12.200
Marble countertops, gold
faucets, a waterfall.

00:08:13.457 --> 00:08:14.699
It's the best bathroom you could

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:16.346
ever hope to poop in.

00:08:16.346 --> 00:08:17.902
And at this point, I don't have to poop.

00:08:17.902 --> 00:08:19.101
(laughing)

00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:20.909
So I'm standing there and I'm like, "Why?

00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:23.599
"Where was this place like
an hour and a half ago?

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:24.664
"Come on, really?"

00:08:24.664 --> 00:08:26.638
And I get mad at myself for not

00:08:26.638 --> 00:08:28.331
finding the bathroom earlier.

00:08:28.331 --> 00:08:29.402
And then I'm like, "That's okay,

00:08:29.402 --> 00:08:30.670
"I have to find my campsite.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.415
"I need to find where my friends are.

00:08:32.415 --> 00:08:35.025
"I need to not end up in a German prison."

00:08:35.025 --> 00:08:37.050
These are the thoughts
running through my head.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.156
So I'm like, "Well, I don't know

00:08:38.156 --> 00:08:39.075
"how I got into this bathroom.

00:08:39.075 --> 00:08:40.487
"I don't know where this
bathroom is located,

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:41.720
"but I need to get out."

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.895
So as I'm pushing out
through the bathroom door,

00:08:44.895 --> 00:08:47.182
I catch a glimpse of myself
in a full length mirror.

00:08:47.182 --> 00:08:49.898
And I can see at this point

00:08:49.898 --> 00:08:51.131
that I'm not wearin' shoes.

00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:53.381
(laughing)

00:08:55.262 --> 00:08:58.089
I don't have any socks on.

00:08:58.089 --> 00:08:59.922
I'm not wearin' pants.

00:09:01.101 --> 00:09:03.251
And we all know where my underwear's at.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.501
(laughing)

00:09:06.788 --> 00:09:09.237
So I'm standin' there in
a long sleeve t-shirt,

00:09:09.237 --> 00:09:12.070
with my money belt around my neck,

00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:16.254
and a fuckin' Grateful Dead hat on.

00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:17.819
So I panic.

00:09:17.819 --> 00:09:19.466
I start lookin' around
the bathroom for my pants.

00:09:19.466 --> 00:09:20.970
I'm dumpin' over garbage cans.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.374
My pants aren't there.

00:09:22.374 --> 00:09:24.489
My shoes aren't there,
my socks aren't there.

00:09:24.489 --> 00:09:26.395
I have no idea what the
fuck happened to them.

00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:28.610
To this day, still don't know.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.172
But I did, again, what any
one of us would have done.

00:09:32.172 --> 00:09:33.630
Pulled my shirt down over my dick,

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.490
(laughing)

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.391
and I pushed through the door

00:09:38.391 --> 00:09:39.983
into the lobby of a five-star hotel.

00:09:39.983 --> 00:09:42.233
(laughing)

00:09:48.173 --> 00:09:50.430
It's about four in the morning
at this point, I think.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.788
I kinda just walked through the lobby.

00:09:51.788 --> 00:09:54.677
People are checking in
like, "What is this?!"

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:56.710
Getting very angry with
the guy at the desk.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.385
And the guy at the desk
is like, "Hey, hey!"

00:09:58.385 --> 00:09:59.418
And I'm just like, "No, no, no.

00:09:59.418 --> 00:10:00.609
"Just usin' the bathroom, thanks."

00:10:00.609 --> 00:10:02.003
(laughing)

00:10:02.003 --> 00:10:04.386
I walk out, push out
right onto the sidewalk.

00:10:04.386 --> 00:10:05.233
I'm out in the street.

00:10:05.233 --> 00:10:08.004
I'm like, "Okay, gotta
figure this out quick."

00:10:08.004 --> 00:10:09.481
My ass is in the breeze.

00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:11.513
I'm just barely covering my cock.

00:10:11.513 --> 00:10:12.872
I'm like, "This is not good."

00:10:12.872 --> 00:10:14.249
I'm like, "I have to get underground.

00:10:14.249 --> 00:10:15.391
"I have get under the metro station.

00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:16.956
"I have to get underground.

00:10:16.956 --> 00:10:18.893
"I cannot be on the public streets."

00:10:18.893 --> 00:10:20.648
So I go into the metro station.

00:10:20.648 --> 00:10:21.842
Train pulls up.

00:10:21.842 --> 00:10:23.174
Packed.

00:10:23.174 --> 00:10:27.340
Packed with people in
winter coats, winter hats,

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.554
goin' to work, miserable fuckin' people.

00:10:29.554 --> 00:10:31.300
Germany's not that different from here.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.901
Everyone hates their fuckin' job.

00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:34.817
"Uh, fuck this."

00:10:34.817 --> 00:10:36.961
I step onto the train.

00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:38.751
It was literally like
stepping onto a train

00:10:38.751 --> 00:10:40.092
of a thousand of my dads.

00:10:40.092 --> 00:10:41.828
It was like,

00:10:41.828 --> 00:10:44.078
(laughing)

00:10:46.669 --> 00:10:49.629
"Look at this fuckin' moron."

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:51.035
(laughing)

00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:52.176
I run off the train.

00:10:52.176 --> 00:10:53.731
I run up the escalator.

00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:55.510
I turn right, and it is a gravel path

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.524
with super tall grass on each side.

00:10:57.524 --> 00:11:00.022
I get to where I can
finally see my campsite.

00:11:00.022 --> 00:11:01.562
And it takes me another 40 minutes

00:11:01.562 --> 00:11:03.804
to find the tent that
I'm supposed to be in.

00:11:03.804 --> 00:11:05.638
And I'm talkin' 40 like, "Huh? Uh-uh.

00:11:05.638 --> 00:11:06.471
"Nope?
"Uh-uh.

00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:07.304
"Uh-uh.
"Huh?

00:11:07.304 --> 00:11:08.137
"Nope?
"Alright."

00:11:08.137 --> 00:11:08.970
(laughing)

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.812
Bothering the shit out of
everyone at this campsite.

00:11:10.812 --> 00:11:12.062
I find my tent.

00:11:13.007 --> 00:11:13.916
I open it up.

00:11:13.916 --> 00:11:15.410
My two idiot friends are in there like,

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.831
(snoring)

00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:18.289
sleeping like babies, right?

00:11:18.289 --> 00:11:19.817
And I'm like, "Oh, I hate you."

00:11:19.817 --> 00:11:21.412
I get into my sleeping bag, I go to sleep.

00:11:21.412 --> 00:11:23.932
And I'm like, "Oh,
thank God this is over."

00:11:23.932 --> 00:11:25.334
About an hour and a half later,

00:11:25.334 --> 00:11:27.125
I get woken up, my
friend's just shaking me.

00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:29.312
He's like, "Hey, hey, hey, hey!"

00:11:29.312 --> 00:11:31.003
"What happened to you last night, man?

00:11:31.003 --> 00:11:32.632
"We had the craziest time.

00:11:32.632 --> 00:11:34.640
"Jim fell asleep on the Lowenbrau bus,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.176
"and I almost lost my
shoe riding the swings."

00:11:37.176 --> 00:11:39.426
(laughing)

00:11:47.688 --> 00:11:49.611
I travel with classy, classy dudes.

00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:52.600
My buddy, Jim, has peed
his pants the night before.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.065
And he's taken his urine-soaked jeans,

00:11:55.065 --> 00:11:57.000
and he's draped them over the tent.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.278
(groaning)

00:11:58.278 --> 00:11:59.841
Exactly, and he, too, has left the tent.

00:11:59.841 --> 00:12:00.878
So now I'm in the tent,

00:12:00.878 --> 00:12:01.984
the sun is coming up.

00:12:01.984 --> 00:12:03.092
I'm in there by myself,

00:12:03.092 --> 00:12:03.929
it's hittin' the pee pants.

00:12:03.929 --> 00:12:05.484
The pee pants smell is
comin' into the tent.

00:12:05.484 --> 00:12:06.520
I'm like, "Ew, this is gross.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.562
"I gotta get outta of this tent."

00:12:07.562 --> 00:12:08.818
Both the flaps of the tent were closed.

00:12:08.818 --> 00:12:10.866
I get the screen flap open, okay?

00:12:10.866 --> 00:12:13.199
I get the second thing open.

00:12:14.052 --> 00:12:16.371
I get one hand out of the tent,

00:12:16.371 --> 00:12:17.664
and as I'm doing that,

00:12:17.664 --> 00:12:20.635
I hear a guy walk into
the middle of the circle.

00:12:20.635 --> 00:12:21.866
And they're like, "Oh
hey, man how ya doin'?"

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.955
He's like, "Hey, Dave, what's happenin'?"

00:12:23.955 --> 00:12:25.114
And he's like, "Aw, not much."

00:12:25.114 --> 00:12:26.516
"How was your night last night?"

00:12:26.516 --> 00:12:27.490
"Aw, it was pretty good."

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:28.323
"What'd ya do?"

00:12:28.323 --> 00:12:29.578
"Me and my girlfriend
went out for a walk."

00:12:29.578 --> 00:12:30.411
"What'd ya see?"

00:12:30.411 --> 00:12:33.554
"We saw the grossest fucking thing ever!"

00:12:33.554 --> 00:12:35.580
And he proceeds to describe me to a T.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.461
"There's this dude poopin'

00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:37.714
"all over a pile of bricks,

00:12:37.714 --> 00:12:40.438
"put a fuckin' jacket over his head.

00:12:40.438 --> 00:12:42.813
"Didn't think we noticed him."

00:12:42.813 --> 00:12:44.670
I was like, and zip.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.757
(laughing)

00:12:45.757 --> 00:12:48.105
And I stayed in that tent
all day playin' Game Boy.

00:12:48.105 --> 00:12:49.066
Guys, I'm John Huck.

00:12:49.066 --> 00:12:50.534
Enjoy the rest of the night.

00:12:50.534 --> 00:12:51.724
(applauding)

00:12:51.724 --> 00:12:55.771
(pumping electronic music)

00:12:55.771 --> 00:12:56.652
- John Huck, everybody.

00:12:56.652 --> 00:12:57.914
Keep it going for John Huck.

00:12:57.914 --> 00:12:59.478
