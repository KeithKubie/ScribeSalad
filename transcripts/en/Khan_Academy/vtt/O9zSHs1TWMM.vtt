00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.600
Now, let's do the exact
same addition problem

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.850
that we did in the last video.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.220
But I'm going to expand out
these numbers so that we really

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.810
understand what's
going on when we're

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.430
doing all of this carrying.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.490
So this 5 is in
the hundreds place.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.730
So it really represents
5 hundreds or 500.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.670
3 represents 3 tens because
it is in the tens place.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.150
So it represents 30.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.000
And the 6, well, it just
represents 6 ones or 6.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.940
Likewise, this 3 represents 300.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.180
This 9 is 9 tens or 90.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.240
And this 8 just
represents 8 ones or 8.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.590
And now we can add these two up.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.140
Now let's start in the
right-most column-- this ones

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.670
column.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.100
6 plus 8, we've
already figured out,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.780
is equal to 14, which is
the same thing as 10 plus 4.

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:55.480
So let's write the
part that's not

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.390
a multiple of 10 in
this ones column.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.650
So let's put that 4 there.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.530
And the part that
is a multiple of 10,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.708
we can now carry into
this tens column.

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:04.999
And that's just to keep track
of it-- just to make sure

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:06.600
that we don't lose
that 10, we're

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.230
putting it into the tens column.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.780
Now we can add all the tens.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.700
10 plus 30 plus 90, we've
already figured out is 130.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.220
Well the part that is
not a multiple of 100,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.357
we can write in this tens
column-- so the 30 part.

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:23.190
And then the part that
is a multiple of 100,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.810
we can put in the
hundreds column.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.730
So we could put the
100 right over here.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.600
Notice, we've just
carried the 1.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.110
But essentially, we've carried
100, because we put a 1

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.160
in the hundreds place.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.700
10 plus 30 plus
90 is 100 plus 30.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.120
This is equal to 100 plus 30.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.410
That's all we've done.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.300
Now we can add the hundreds.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.000
100 plus 500 plus 300 we've
already figured out is 900.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.520
So we can write it as 900.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.390
And we're done!

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.640
We've figured out that
500 plus 30 plus 6,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.060
plus 300 plus 90 plus 8, is
equal to 900 plus 30 plus 4,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.215
which is the same thing as 934.

00:02:05.215 --> 00:02:07.340
So hopefully this gives
you a little bit more sense

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.660
of what we're doing when we
"carry the 1" every time.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.520
6 plus 8 is 14.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.940
We carried the 1.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.347
That 1 represents 10.

00:02:14.347 --> 00:02:15.930
It represents this
10 right over here.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.380
Just so we don't
lose track of it.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.940
Then we say that 10 plus
30 plus 90 is equal to 130.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.190
So that's 30 plus 100.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.220
Then we add the hundreds
together and we get 900.
