00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.237
First up-- hacking Hillary.
Hacking Hillary.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.439
Cruella De Vil cosplayer
Hillary Clinton,

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.341
the candidate America's...

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.743
the candidate America's
settling on--

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.613
'cause let's face it,
we're not getting any younger--

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:14.515
has maintained a steady lead
at the polls

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:16.517
with her strategy
of not talking to the press

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.453
and waiting for Trump to just
finally say the "N" word. Uh...

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:23.056
-(laughter)
-But...

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.393
There, I said it.
I said it, okay?

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.362
But the far right
has been attacking her

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.063
over so-called health concerns,

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:32.165
and this coughing fit
at a campaign stop in Cleveland

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.735
is only going to fan
those conspiracy theory flames.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:35.936
Take a look.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.938
(Clinton coughing)

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.478
Every time I think about Trump,
I get allergic.

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.446
(laughter)

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.551
Uh, did anyone expect her
to go, "It's me, Bernie Sanders.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:52.052
It's me!"

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.320
Oh!

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.755
So, comedians, you're comedians.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.357
What's your Hillary quip
to explain her coughing fit?

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.392
Ron Funches.

00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:59.593
Oh, I'm sorry, y'all,

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.628
I was smoking on that strong...

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:03.397
HARDWICK:
All right.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.033
And unlike Bill, I did inhale.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.201
HARDWICK:
All right.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.236
(cheers and applause)

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:10.737
(bell dings)

00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:13.640
HARDWICK: I said Hillary's,
not yours, Ron, not your answer.

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:14.942
Tiffany.

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:17.678
Well, if you listened
really closely you can hear

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:18.745
what she's really saying.

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.080
And she's like,
(coughs)

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.114
"I'm all you got."

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:22.382
(coughs)

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:23.717
(laughter)

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.985
HARDWICK: Points.

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:26.887
Kyle Kinane.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.422
I think she's trying to say,

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.724
"(bleep) off, Bernie would
have had three strokes

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.427
and driven through
a farmers market by now."

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.229
(laughter)

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:45.305
HARDWICK:
Points, points for Kyle.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:55.315
HARDWICK:
Points, points for Kyle.

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:39.813
Send us your high school
in five words

00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:41.248
and tag those @midnight
to keep the game going.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.817
We'll be right back
with more @midnight.

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:46.220
HARDWICK: <i>Our Tweet of the Day
from our last #HashtagWar</i>

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:50.757
<i>was sent to us by at guil,
oh, uh, stevenson.</i>

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:52.259
<i>Well done!</i>
