00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.380
All right, bladesmiths,
the kill test.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.120
Doug?
[music playing]

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.540
The sword to see what
kind of lethal damage

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.210
your weapons will do.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.380
I will take your sword and
deliver lethal cuts and stabs

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.830
on this ballistics dummy.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.540
All right, Derek.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.880
Ready for this?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.620
I think so.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.710
I'm really looking forward to
see how the blade performs.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.170
But at the same time, I'm
nervous about the blade

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.580
catching in a rib and snapping.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.170
Come on, baby.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.670
My heart is in my
throat right now.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.040
[music playing]

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.040
Oh my gosh.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.380
All right, Derek.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.420
Let's talk about your
blade right here.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.420
It is light.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.170
It is pointy.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.500
It is sharp.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.580
Your weapon will kill.
DEREK: Thank you.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.540
Good job.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.420
Bob, it's quite something
to follow up with.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.460
You ready?

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.960
That's what I came for.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.120
My heart is just pounding.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.960
I mean, I have confidence, but
you don't really know because I

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.120
haven't done any tests.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.790
I didn't even stab a watermelon.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.580
[music playing]

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.790
Nice work.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.040
All right, Bob.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.290
The point is sharp
enough to deliver

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.960
a straight thrust all the way
through this ballistics dummy.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.830
Your weapon, sir, will kill.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.670
Thank you.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.120
Bladesmiths, welcome to our
strength test, the flex test.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.580
What I want to do is take
each of your smallswords

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.250
and bend them 45 degrees
in both directions.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.330
And if you nailed your
heat-treated construction,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.830
everything should stay true.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.500
How are you feeling, Derek?
- Go ahead.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.620
MAN: All right.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.880
Stood up.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.210
Well, Derek, I'm
very impressed.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.460
This sucker went 45
degrees both ways.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.710
Great job.
- Thank you.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.790
Bob, you ready?

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.120
Yeah, I think so.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.120
Now, I'm really worried.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.330
I had to forge it
out in one day.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.960
I had to assemble it
all in the same day

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.540
to get everything
put together just

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.330
so I could turn in a sword.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.790
I mean, I'd already broken one,
so I knew it could be brittle.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.040
[music playing]

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.080
Each degree that it's
going, I'm going,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.500
is it going to break here?

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.250
Is it going to break here?

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.750
Agonizing.
OK.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.750
Come back now.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.250
Then you go to the other side.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.540
[music playing]

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.120
Well, Bob, good news is
your blade didn't break.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.880
What a relief.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.380
Didn't spring back to true,
but it did come most of the way

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.460
back.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.460
Overall, nicely done.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.790
Thank you.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.290
Bob, Derek, both of
your finale weapons

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.540
were strong, deadly, and sharp.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.880
However, there can only be
one "Forged in Fire" champion,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.920
and that champion is--

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.460
Derek, congratulations.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.580
You are the "Forged
in Fire" champion.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.790
Bob, unfortunately,
your smallsword

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.210
did not make the cut.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.250
Bob, you made a
beautiful sword.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.460
But during that strength
test, your blade

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.290
took a bend that set that
didn't straighten out,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.000
and that's why we're
letting you go.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.290
I understand.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.500
Please surrender your blade.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.080
Oh, I absolutely agree
with the judges' decision

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.670
that Derek did have
the better blade.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.250
I may not have been called
"Forged in Fire" champion,

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.670
but I gained so much
more valuable experience

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.670
that it's immeasurable.
