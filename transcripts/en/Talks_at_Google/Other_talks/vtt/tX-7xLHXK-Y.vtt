00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.529
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Good afternoon everyone.
Welcome to another outstanding Authors@Google

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.710
presentation. The main thing that I can say
to preface today's talk is that I love the

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.509
'80s, born there, love the movies. It's just
a great time to be around. And it ushered

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.260
in the technological and cultural revolution
that, to a certain extent, continues to this

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.260
day.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.670
In this light, we're very pleased to welcome
David Sirota to our Mountain View office today.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.610
It's actually a return appearance for him.
He made another talk at our Boulder headquarters

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.620
as well. David is an author, commentator,
and radio host. And his books have been influential

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.290
and wide-reaching, ranging from subjects such
as his book "Hostile Takeover" to his penultimate

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.470
one called "The Uprising."

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.479
He'll be speaking to us today about his latest
book, which is called "Back to Our Future:

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:58.049
How the 1980s Explain the World We Live in
Now-- Our Culture, Our Politics, Our Everything."

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:02.600
Using the backdrop of five movies, he paints
a picture of our modern political and economic

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.600
scene.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.510
The DeLorean is still here and David is here
to tell us what it means. After the conclusion

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.320
of his presentation, we'll have time for some
questions and answers using the Q and A mic.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.320
And without further ado, please join me in
welcoming David to Google. Thank you.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.320
[applause]

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.420
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Thank you. Thanks

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.500
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: I'll plug this in. That's
right. There are a lot of cords up here. Thank

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.480
you. Thanks for coming. And thanks for having
me here. So, I have an audio/visual presentation

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.700
which I will go through and just to let you
know, there's gonna be some trivia questions

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.700
in here.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.360
And I'll give you the trivia answers at the
end. They're sort of interspersed. I wish

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.940
I had prizes to give out, but I don't. So,
I apologize. And just for some background

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:59.080
on me, I am a big child of the '80s. I'm 35
years old, which means that I was--I guess--in

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.260
6th grade in 1988.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.670
And a lot of the premise of this presentation
and the premise of my book is that we don't

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:17.030
appreciate as much how much cultural products
impact children in particular, cultural products

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.670
that you'll see in this presentation that
are not necessarily critically-acclaimed,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:32.420
[chuckles] but do have a huge impact on kids,
especially, I would argue, at that age somewhere

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.920
between,I dunno,second grade and ninth grade.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.490
But obviously throughout childhood. So, that's
basically the premise of the book. So, I start

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:49.080
out in the book. And I'm gonna take you through
basically three of the chapters, or the themes

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.771
of the book's chapters. And so, just to start
out to give you some background about why

00:02:54.771 --> 00:03:01.480
I wrote this book is because clearly the 1980s
are back right now, culturally.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.069
And here's some examples, some analogs, to
how the 1980s are back. So, we've got Top

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.459
Gun being remade. We have the Rambo remakes.
Wall Street was remade. Tron was remade. The

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:23.690
A-Team was remade. GI Joe. Hulk Hogan's now
a reality TV star. The Lakers and the Celtics

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.020
were playing in the championships.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.069
The Lakers and the Celtics are playing in
the championships. Apple, which was a huge

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.770
company in the 1980s, went out a little bit
between now. Obviously now it's back in a

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.989
big way. And what I argue in the book is that
the 1980s aren't just back in an entertainment

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:44.989
way.

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:52.920
The 1980s, what they taught us in the entertainment
of the 1980s is actually back in the real

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.050
world, or there are analogs to what the entertainment
archetypes were in the 1980s to actual real-world

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.680
figures. So, the first obvious one is, you
know, this is a picture of Maverick from Top

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.810
Gun.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:13.319
And we had a President who is basically dressing
up like Maverick for a very serious set of

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.209
issues:the Iraq War. We have Rambo III. It
took place in Afghanistan. Obviously, we're

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.490
still fighting a war in Afghanistan. Wall
Street. Greed is good. Gordon Gekko.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.740
These kind of figures become very, very real
world figures. That's a picture of Bernie

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:36.990
Madoff. The whole idea of master control.
One, giant computer company taking over the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.810
world. Luckily, my presentation had this guy,
not Google, but--

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.229
[laughter]

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.249
you get the point. [chuckles] The A-Team.
And we're gonna go into this a little bit

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:55.309
more in specific. The A-Team, this ideas of
mercenaries who solve problems. This has a

00:04:55.309 --> 00:05:01.879
very real world application in how we've privatized
the way we deal with National Security.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:07.789
And then, of course, stateless terrorism.
Cobra Commander, the faceless, stateless terrorist

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:15.539
as a fictional archetype became and turns
into Osama bin Laden. And not to say, very

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:24.779
quickly, not to say that all off of these
examples are designed to be in their own minds

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:31.610
connected to '80s entertainment archetypes,
but it is to say that some of them are.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.860
And it is to say that the others that aren't,
the way they are portrayed, the language with

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:43.660
which we talk about these figures in our real
world, are oftentimes talked about in the

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:53.710
language of 1980s and specifically 1980s'
entertainment. So, why was the 1980s so powerful?

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.460
Why is it back? Now, lemme just stipulate
and say there's kind of a trend where everything

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:06.899
that's old become new again. So yes, there's
nostalgia. Yes, there's retreading old brands.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:11.880
Yes, Hollywood directors and screenwriters,
it's easier to write the sequel to the sequel

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.129
to the sequel, than to actually write something
new.

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:21.180
But I also would argue that the 1980s, there
were some pretty unique things about the 1980s

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.349
that have made it stick around for as long
as it’s stuck around for. And the basic

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:30.699
thesis of my book is that in many ways we
are still living in the 1980s, that there

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:36.069
were distinct eras before the 1980s and that
we're still essentially living in the era

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:37.860
of the 1980s.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.860
And I think the reason is, there's a couple
of reasons I think the 1980s stuck around.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:49.869
First of all, the 1980s was the first decade
that most people had a TV, a VCR, and cable.

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:54.349
It was the first decade where there was that
much media saturation.

00:06:54.349 --> 00:07:00.399
And especially one-way media, broadcast media,
which is perfectly calibrated to propagandize

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:07.569
as opposed to two-way media. The second thing
that happened in the 1980s was integration,

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:16.679
which is the idea that as we became more media-saturated,
more of the messages were integrated around

00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:19.210
each other in a self-reinforcing way.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:25.119
And as an example, the rise of synergy, right?
And this is, synergy is the marketing technique

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:30.009
which I'm sure a lot of you know about, which
is basically cross-marketing a brand across

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:32.860
different products that in some cases have
nothing to do with the product.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.550
I mean, there's an ET Happy Meal. What does
a McDonald's Happy Meal have to do with ET?

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:42.389
What does Mr. T have to do with a cereal?
So, this was really the golden age of integration

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:52.270
and synergy in the 1980s. And then of course,
there was consolidation.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.960
And that word should be consolidation on there,
but,. Consolidation. By the mid-1980s, mergers

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.699
meant 50 companies controlled most newspapers,
magazines, TV stations, and movie studios.

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:10.469
And so, this allowed synergized marketing
to happen in a way that was repetitious, that

00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:15.080
we had never experienced before in our culture,
that yeah, there was TV and yeah, there was

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.089
radio and there was newspapers, but with more
independent ownership before the 1980s.

00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:26.779
It wasn't necessarily that the same messages,
the same brands, the same political ideologies

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:37.160
were so rapidly and repetitiously marketed.
And I say that this created a,. let me turn

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.960
the music up, here. [sounds of music in the
background] I need the music to be up but

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.140
I have the Phil Collins thing playing, but
it really did create a land of confusion,

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.210
I think, for a lot of people.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:56.830
And confusion, by which I mean, it encouraged,
I think, children and adults, people who were

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:03.690
becoming culturalized in the 1980s, to lose
the idea of where you should get the stories

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.300
about your world, how to see your world. And
this is just a quote from the Boston Globe

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.180
based on some sociological research.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.840
And it says, "TV and movie characters can
shape how we look at real world events. Fiction,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.380
in fact,--" and again, this was a story about
sociological research, "Fiction shapes our

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:23.800
perception of the world, even more than reality."
And one of the main reasons I think that happened

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.640
in the 1980s was because a lot of the entertainment
products of the 1980s were actually drawing

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.380
on real world events.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:38.520
And here's just a couple of examples. This
is a quote that I found in my research from

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.140
a maker of a video game,excuse me, a video
game maker who said, "Coin-op designers take

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.830
anything remotely in the news and make it
into a video game." Here's a couple of examples,

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:48.830
right?

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.790
This is Operation: Wolf, Contra, Guerrilla,
this was coming out at the time that there

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:59.350
really were guerrilla wars. There really was
a situation with the Contras.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:04.910
Now granted, Contra wasn't necessarily about
that, but the point of this is to say that

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:12.140
one of the reasons the 1980s entertainment
products continue to have traction in our

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:16.080
culture and continue, as I argue, to shape
the way we think about real world issues is

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.150
because the entertainment products themselves
were shaped in the 1980s around real world

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.150
issues.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.840
I mean, if you were a kid playing Contra,
you knew up up down down A B A B back right

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.780
back right to get all the free men [chuckles].
But what were you really being taught? You

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:38.620
were being taught that to be a hero is to
go and mow down people and to mow down the

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.340
Contras.
[music turns off]

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:49.380
All right. So, the first chapter of my book
is about how the 1980s redefined and created

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:54.451
the '50s and the '60s. Now, you'll notice
I use the numbers "1980s" there and I use

00:10:54.451 --> 00:10:58.620
the fifties and the sixties,I spelled them
out. And in the book, I've got a little TM

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:05.100
next to them to suggest that the '50s and
the '60s, quote-unquote, are really brands.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:14.500
We're not really talking about the actual
1960s:1960 to 1969, or 1950 to 1959. Typically,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:21.930
when we're talking about the '50s and '60s,
we're actually talking about a 1980s' version

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:29.680
of the '50s and '60s. And I use as examples
to explain how this happened. Michael J Fox,

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.850
playing two separate roles.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:37.631
I mean, on the left you have him from Back
to the Future, going back into the 1950s.

00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:42.230
On the right, you have him in the 1980s, the
archetype of the aspiring Yuppie. And I'm

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:49.940
gonna explain how that embodies how the 1980s
re-remembered the 1950s and 1960s.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:57.790
So, we'll start with the 1950s. So, this is
the key scene, the set-up, for what happens

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.790
in Back to the Future.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:59.790
[plays video clip]

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:00.790
[scary music]

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.790
&gt;&gt;Doc: Oh my God. They found me. I don't know
how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.790
&gt;&gt;Marty McFly: Who? Who?

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:03.790
&gt;&gt;Doc: Who do you think? The Libyans.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.790
[foreign language in background] [car screeches]

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:05.790
&gt;&gt;Marty McFly: [screaming] Holy shit.
[gun fire and tires squealing]

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.160
&gt;&gt;Marty McFly: You're telling you built a
time machine, out of a DeLorian?

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.930
[fifties guitar music plays]
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: This is one of the most ethnically,

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:22.300
racially offensive stereotype ever and I have
a whole chapter in the book about that. But,

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:28.420
where does Marty McFly, a teenager in the
1980s, flee to?

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:35.750
Or, he's being hunted by bazooka-wielding
Libyan terrorists in his suburban town, right?

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:41.370
This is the ultimate fear of every suburbanite,
right? My mom, "Oh, my God. The Libyans are

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:46.610
coming to kill us." So where, and again, I
have a whole chapter on how this is so wildly

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:47.740
racist and everything.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:54.510
But where does he flee? Where does this teenager
flee? Where do, when parents bring their kids

00:12:54.510 --> 00:13:03.230
to watch this movie, where are they so relieved
that their child is? That Marty McFly flees

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:04.230
into?

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:10.940
[song playing, Go Johnny Go]
[audience voices heard quietly in background]

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:19.420
Right? So he flees into the 1950s, this safe
place where the biggest threat to humanity

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:26.410
is Biff and a bald Vice Principal who calls
him "Slacker." This is like the idea that

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.930
the 1950s is this great time where there was,

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:36.210
Everybody was unified. Everything was safe.
America was on the way up. Written out of

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.080
the story, of course, is the fact that it
was basically America was an apartheid state

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.610
in the 1950s. There was all sorts of bigotry.
That's written out of the story. And the 1980s

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:51.060
really created this, not just through Back
to the Future, but through all sorts of other

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.060
products.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.940
I mean, that's Dirty Dancing. You had it in
music.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.940
[sound of tires squealing and car crashing
into truck]

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:01.220
You had it in, again, those are music examples.
Other movies. [sounds of an explosion]

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:08.550
That's the Outsiders. Billy Joel's songs.
Hoosiers. Superman. If you watched Superman,

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:14.510
think about this is a character from the 1950s.
So the 1980s was really, really big on saying

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:19.900
[punches sound] that the 1950s is a time that
we should all want to go back to.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:26.220
And of course, the ultimate avatar of this
was Ronald Reagan,a guy who that was his whole

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:32.160
career up until that point and throughout
the 1980s. Ronald Reagan first became a famous

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.640
political figure as the Governor of California,
[lightening and electricity sounds] who was

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.020
ripping on the hippies of Berkeley.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:49.920
And so, the flip side of this becomes[time
machine sounds]. So, that's the 1950s. Now

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.850
the 1980s. [clip ends][music stops] And I
go into all in the book about how the 1980s

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:54.930
built up the '50s.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:15:01.400
And at the same time, it was demonizing the
1960s. Here's a clip. Here's the beginning

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.040
of one of the top-rated shows in the 1980s,
Family Ties. And watch it very carefully.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.660
[plays clip]

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.710
[Family Ties theme song plays]

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:19.279
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: So, it's kind of cartoonish
images of the '60s of the parents as hippies.

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:24.310
And this show was set up, interestingly enough,
was set up to tell the story of the parents.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:27.960
[video clip ends] [music stops]
But they showed it to test groups, to focus

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:35.520
groups, and people liked Alex, the aspiring
Yuppie and how he was making fun of his parents'

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:41.220
hippiness. They liked that a lot more, so
ultimately the show was actually redeveloped

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.421
around Alex and around the idea of basically
making fun of the '60s.

00:15:45.421 --> 00:15:56.170
Now, here's an example of what I'm talking
about. Oh, and I'm screwing up my order here,

00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:02.540
but these are some other examples of the 1980s
making fun of the 1960s. Now listen to this.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.130
[plays clip]

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.320
&gt;&gt;Alex: Is this a permanent addition?

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.400
[laugh track]

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.690
Because if it is, I'm getting out my "Bombs
are people, too" throw pillows.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.860
[laugh track]

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:18.210
&gt;&gt;Dad: The banner's a surprise from Matt.
We had this hanging in our dorm room at Berkeley.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.990
&gt;&gt;Alex: It's a little outdated, isn't it?

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.920
&gt;&gt;Dad: Well, maybe the slogan is different
now, but the concept is the same.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.630
&gt;&gt;Alex: No, I meant the concept.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:28.630
[laugh track]

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.340
&gt;&gt;Dad: Alex. Don't you ever worry about the
fact that there are enough bombs in the world

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.779
to destroy every living creature and wipe
out life as we know it?

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:37.779
&gt;&gt;Alex: Hey. I got bigger things on my mind.

00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:38.779
[laugh track]

00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:41.740
Can I use the business section here, Mom?

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.740
[laugh track]

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.600
&gt;&gt;Mom: Why don't we just tell Matt he's one
of the neighbor children?

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.950
&gt;&gt;Alex: It's just so predictable, that's all.
Every time one of these ex-hippies goes prancing

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.220
in from yesteryear, we gotta get out the love
beads.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.220
[laugh track]
[end clip]

00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.130
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: OK. So, that's a good example
of, right? So the 1950s was this great time

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.959
that we should all want to go back to. And
the 1960s was this ridiculous time where none

00:17:04.959 --> 00:17:07.459
of the social progress happened.

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:12.740
It was all just about crazy hippies smoking
weed, ruining our country. Now, if this all

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.539
sounds familiar and here's a couple of other
examples of how that was epitomized. And if

00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:20.579
you really wanna watch, and I cite The Big
Chill here, and I love The Big Chill. It's

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:21.579
a great movie.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:26.100
But if you really, really wanna see how this
works, that's the one movie you should watch.

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:31.149
Really. The Big Chill is so unbelievable in
what it's really saying about the 1960s. The

00:17:31.149 --> 00:17:35.970
whole story is about how they're forgiving
themselves for abandoning who they were in

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:36.970
the 1960s.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.970
Anyway. So here's just a couple of other examples.
But you get the point. The 1950s was great.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:52.070
The 1960s was evil. This becomes a way that
we see our politics. This becomes a way that

00:17:52.070 --> 00:18:01.740
we see our world. So you have all sorts of
products that basically glorify the 1950s.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:08.880
And I should be clear. In the book, I define
the '50s as basically the beginning of World

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:14.530
War II until the JFK assassination that that
is what we think of when we think of the '50s.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:18.960
The great time. The greatest generation. And
then when we really think about the '60s,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.369
we're actually talking about after John F
Kennedy was killed all the way through much

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:24.519
of the 1970s.

00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:31.909
That's what the brand has become. And in the
1980s and subsequently after the 1980s, carries

00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:36.370
on into our politics. And here is just some
examples of how we glorified the '50s, how

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:41.889
we've made it into remembering and nostalgia
of the '50s into a brand.

00:18:41.889 --> 00:18:48.440
And the '60s,all of the great political progress,
the serious political progress of the '60s,

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.419
is basically written out of the story. And
the '60s has been commodified into like, Ben

00:18:52.419 --> 00:19:02.570
and Jerry's hippie ice cream, 1969 Gap jeans,
Phish shows, Cheech and Chong, even Whole

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.809
Foods,tries to glom on to this

00:19:04.809 --> 00:19:10.669
brand of the '60s was this crunchy, happy,
but not really serious decade. And all of

00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:17.929
the serious stuff out of the '60s gets written
out of the story. Now, what I show in the

00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:25.799
book is that this then becomes, starting in
the '80s, the way we see our politics. So,

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:30.809
let's just go through a couple of Presidential
campaigns to see how this works.

00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:39.710
So, here's the 1988 race. You got George H
W Bush, the ultimate aristocrat running for

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:46.360
President. Vice President, his dad was a Senator,
super wealthy. I mean this guy is the walking

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:55.059
avatar of American aristocracy versus a second-generation--.
I always forget how those work.

00:19:55.059 --> 00:19:58.970
The first generation. His parents were immigrants.
Michael Dukakis, was he first generation?

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:07.570
First generation American. A working class
guy and this campaign gets turned into,. No.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:12.059
George W Bush is not an aristocrat. He's the
hard-working guy from the 1950s.

00:20:12.059 --> 00:20:18.730
Go back and listen to his speech of the 1988
Republican Convention how this ultra-aristocrat

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:24.139
reimagines himself that he grew up in a shotgun
house. The 1950s is talking about how you

00:20:24.139 --> 00:20:29.440
go back to the Norman Rockwell America. And
he turns Michael Dukakis through the flag-burning

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:37.549
issue into this,a ridiculous 1960s guy, or
a guy who can't get by in the 1960s, kind

00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:38.549
of a cartoon.

00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:44.669
That's him in the tank, the famous picture.
OK, so then we get to 1992. George H W Bush,

00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:50.919
still this completely out of touch guy. Here
he is not knowing what a supermarket scanner

00:20:50.919 --> 00:20:56.970
is. And there's Bill Clinton. This is the
ultimate 1950,the '50s. I remember before

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:57.970
the JFK assassination.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:04.019
This is the good guy from the 1950s. This
race then gets turned into. No, no, no. George

00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:08.749
H W Bush is not an aristocrat, is not the
guy who doesn't know what a supermarket scanner

00:21:08.749 --> 00:21:14.080
is. He's the World War II hero. He's the hero
of that brand of the 50s.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:21.350
And through the whole thing about draft-dodging,
he tries to turn Bill Clinton into that. Now,

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.040
in fairness, that is Bill Clinton.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.040
[laughter]

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.379
But that's what he wanted us to remember about
Bill Clinton. Then we get to 1996. All right.

00:21:29.379 --> 00:21:34.350
Bob Dole, the ultimate Washington insider.
He's been a Senator for a thousand years.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:39.129
[audience chuckles]
Bill Clinton is this moderate Democrat. Basically,

00:21:39.129 --> 00:21:44.899
many people think that he's a very, very conservative
Democrat. Bob Dole tries to turn himself into,

00:21:44.899 --> 00:21:50.710
he's on the 1950s. He's a bridge to the past.
And he uses the idea that Bill Clinton is

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:56.500
some huge '60s liberal to try to turn Bill
Clinton into this,the second coming of George

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.649
McGovern.

00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:59.499
Now again in fairness, that is Bill Clinton.

00:21:59.499 --> 00:22:00.499
[laughter]

00:22:00.499 --> 00:22:07.019
But that's what he wanted us to remember.
And it continues. Here's George W Bush, the

00:22:07.019 --> 00:22:15.960
frat guy versus Al Gore, who enlisted in the
military, who went to Vietnam. And George

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:22.850
W Bush tries to turn it into no, no, no, he
was the guy serving his country loyally and

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.470
in that '50s, in that era of the '50s.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:31.710
And that Al Gore, using this idea of Al Gore's
environmentalism, tried to turn Al Gore into

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:39.200
this basically, the parents from Family Ties-,this
'60s guy who can't get by, can't get beyond,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:47.340
is just out of touch, an unreconstructed hippie.
And Al Gore, I think as much as I like Al

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:52.080
Gore, the whole Earth-tone thing did not help.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.999
All right. So here's some trivia. And we'll
get to the answers, but interspersed some

00:22:55.999 --> 00:23:01.740
trivia here just to make it fun. What was
the name of the song that Patrick Swayze performed

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.679
on the Dirty Dancing soundtrack? Don't shout
them out.

00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:08.919
I'll give you the answers at the end. "I've
Had the Time of My Life," "She's Like the

00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:20.720
Wind," "Baby in the Corner," or "Hungry Eyes?"
All right. Second question. 

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:26.429
What famous actor played the corpse in The
Big Chill? Christopher Reeve, Harrison Ford,

00:23:26.429 --> 00:23:34.990
Alec Baldwin, or Kevin Costner?

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:47.179
What city is The Outsiders set in? Omaha,
Tulsa, Amarillo, or Topeka? All right. So,

00:23:47.179 --> 00:23:54.409
my book then moves on after going through
how this creation of the '50s and the '60s

00:23:54.409 --> 00:24:01.159
on to the idea of how the 1980s really gave
us our views of the individual and hyper individualism.

00:24:01.159 --> 00:24:08.119
And the chapter and the section start with
a look at this.

00:24:08.119 --> 00:24:26.889
[sounds of plane taking off]

00:24:26.889 --> 00:24:32.909
That is, of course, Michael Jordan. And that
image basically becomes this, this iconic

00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:42.369
image of the single individual soaring over
everything. And it gets basically, it becomes

00:24:42.369 --> 00:24:49.809
decontextualized even from the image and it
becomes a silhouette.

00:24:49.809 --> 00:24:56.720
And just for some beginning context to understand
why Michael Jordan is so important to this.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.239
Michael Jordan obviously became the biggest,
most famous person, really, in the world.

00:25:01.239 --> 00:25:08.960
And I think you need to look at the rise of
individualism and narcissism in our culture

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.070
through the prism of Michael Jordan, because
he was such a powerful figure.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:18.139
And just here are some examples of how this
guy became really larger than life. And this

00:25:18.139 --> 00:25:21.869
is a fellow basketball player, Larry Bird,
saying, "I think it's God disguised as Michael

00:25:21.869 --> 00:25:26.639
Jordan." Chinese kids listed Jordan and communist
leader Zhao Ziyang as the two greatest men

00:25:26.639 --> 00:25:27.639
in history.

00:25:27.639 --> 00:25:28.910
[laughter]

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:33.710
The Washington Post called him the most famous
man on Earth. Fellow NBA players referred

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:40.700
to Jordan as quote "Jesus in Nike's." [laughter]
All right. So, to understand,and Michael Jordan

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:46.549
had probably, I don't think there's ever been
a study done about it, but more money in terms

00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:53.080
of advertising him, behind him, than probably
any Presidential candidate and probably all

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.869
the Presidential candidates combined during
his career.

00:25:55.869 --> 00:26:02.919
So this was a heavily obviously marketed guy.
And I argue in the book that he was marketed

00:26:02.919 --> 00:26:10.779
not just as a great basketball player, but
underneath that was his individual qualities.

00:26:10.779 --> 00:26:12.570
This was a guy who, if you were an NBA fan,

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:16.460
And I was a huge NBA fan and I hated Michael
Jordan's guts because I was into Charles Barkley

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.460
'cause I grew up in Philadelphia. And I can't
talk about Michael Jordan without getting

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.600
angry because I hated him so much because
he always beat The Sixers.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:31.200
But, he was marketed in particular as a guy
who pulled his entire team up. And if you

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.899
remember The Bulls in the 1980s and into the
1990s, most of their team kinda sucked. I

00:26:35.899 --> 00:26:41.460
mean, we can debate Scottie Pippen, but basically
the team sucked and Michael Jordan really

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.019
was a team unto himself.

00:26:43.019 --> 00:26:46.649
And I'm sorry if there's any Bulls fans here
that I've offended. But it's a great credit

00:26:46.649 --> 00:26:53.789
to Michael Jordan. And basically, that idea
even gets decontextualized from Michael Jordan

00:26:53.789 --> 00:27:02.470
himself. He becomes the individual, but that
image right there, becomes marketed everywhere.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:12.779
And the ethos behind it becomes marketed everywhere.
And it becomes, I think, a cult of the individual

00:27:12.779 --> 00:27:17.919
in the 1980s. And here, just some examples
of how individuals, and the individual's saving

00:27:17.919 --> 00:27:27.909
the world, the individual fixing all of our
problems, becomes the major thing that is

00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:31.909
sold to us in our culture,that you don't need
a team.

00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:36.059
You don't need to work together. The common
good isn't important. You just gotta get an

00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:43.409
individual or yourself, be an individual hero,
and all of our problems will be solved. This

00:27:43.409 --> 00:27:50.929
is my, And this is my, Sorry about that. I
clicked the wrong button, but, As an example

00:27:50.929 --> 00:27:54.441
of what this becomes, it becomes all these
one-liner movies, right?

00:27:54.441 --> 00:27:55.441
This is my favorite one-liner.

00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:56.441

like your ribs? [sounds of explosion]

00:27:59.029 --> 00:28:03.350
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Right? It's just like, this
is how to deal with the world. You get an

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:08.669
individual who violates all the rules, blows
people away, solves problems individually.

00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:10.080
Now, watch this ad.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.190
[plays clip]
[hip-hop music begins]

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:16.529
&gt;&gt;Mars: Yo, Mars Black in here with my main
man Michael Jordan. Yo, Mike. What makes you

00:28:16.529 --> 00:28:30.330
the best player in the universe? Is it the
vicious dunks?

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.749
&gt;&gt;Jordan: No, Mars.

00:28:31.749 --> 00:28:32.749
&gt;&gt;Mars: Is it the hair cut?

00:28:32.749 --> 00:28:33.749
&gt;&gt;Jordan: No, Mars.

00:28:33.749 --> 00:28:34.749
&gt;&gt;Mars: Is it the shoes?

00:28:34.749 --> 00:28:35.749
&gt;&gt;Jordan: No, Mars.

00:28:35.749 --> 00:28:36.749
&gt;&gt;Mars: Is it the extra-long shorts?

00:28:36.749 --> 00:28:37.749
&gt;&gt;Jordan: No, Mars.

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:38.749
&gt;&gt;Mars: It's the shoes then, right?

00:28:38.749 --> 00:28:39.749
&gt;&gt;Jordan: Nah.

00:28:39.749 --> 00:28:40.749
&gt;&gt;Mars: Is it the short socks?

00:28:40.749 --> 00:28:41.749
&gt;&gt;Jordan: No, Mars.

00:28:41.749 --> 00:28:42.749
&gt;&gt;Mars: C'mon, it's gotta be the shoes, shoes,
shoes, shoes, shoes; are you sure it's not

00:28:42.749 --> 00:28:43.749
the shoes?

00:28:43.749 --> 00:28:44.749
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Now, there's a lot to think
about in this ad.

00:28:44.749 --> 00:28:45.749
&gt;&gt;Jordan: Sure, Mars
&gt;&gt;Mars: What about the shoes?

00:28:45.749 --> 00:28:46.749
&gt;&gt;Jordan: No, Mars
&gt;&gt;Mars: C'mon it's got to be the shoes

00:28:46.749 --> 00:28:47.749
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: OK. So, think about the two
things that were said in that ad. And that

00:28:47.749 --> 00:28:48.749
was one of the most famous ads in the 1980s.

00:28:48.749 --> 00:28:49.749
One, it's Michael Jordan saying, "No, it's
not the shoes. It's just that I, individually,

00:28:49.749 --> 00:28:53.249
am God." Right? I mean, that's the first message
of that movie. And I guess in fairness, give

00:28:53.249 --> 00:28:56.799
Nike some credit, there's some honesty there.
It really wasn't the shoes. I put on some

00:28:56.799 --> 00:28:59.299
Nike's and I wasn't Michael Jordan.

00:28:59.299 --> 00:29:05.009
But secondly, what is the most interesting
part, I think, of that ad is that it was saying

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:15.479
that to worship an individual is a virtue.
Mars Blackman is a guy who is a super fan.

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:21.710
And I would argue that in the 1980s, that
became the idea that you should and could

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:29.779
and must worship individual deities and take
your cues from them,exclusively from them,is

00:29:29.779 --> 00:29:35.770
what that ad really was all about, that to
be a super fan is to be good, is to be something

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.820
that is celebrated, is to be Mars Blackman.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:49.059
And this, I think, transcends obviously sports.
We get all sorts of these huge iconic individual

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:55.679
deities, for lack of a better term, in the
1980s. You get the rise of individual televangelists

00:29:55.679 --> 00:30:01.440
that people create all sorts of movements
around. They look, in a top-down way, for

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.840
what these deities say.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:11.480
You had the CEO becomes a deity unto him or
herself in the 1980s. This was different than

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:19.590
in the 1970s, 1960s and before. The idea that
the CEO singularly turns a whole company and

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:26.009
with Lee Iaccoca was the whole economy around.
Donald Trump obviously, I don't know what

00:30:26.009 --> 00:30:27.009
you.

00:30:27.009 --> 00:30:28.929
Well, in the 1980s he was a businessman. I
don't know what you call him today, but he

00:30:28.929 --> 00:30:34.649
again, becomes this guy, this singular guy,
who can save economies, who can make huge

00:30:34.649 --> 00:30:43.909
vast sums of riches of wealth. Obviously,
Oprah Winfrey. Talk radio hosts, Rush Limbaugh,

00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:44.909
Howard Stern.

00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:51.159
These are people who don't just have fans,
they have I think in the truest sense of the

00:30:51.159 --> 00:31:03.970
word, followers. And the rise of the self-help
industry starts in the 1980s. Now, this has

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:08.379
obvious analogs to today 'cause that's what
my book argues, that we're still living in

00:31:08.379 --> 00:31:12.859
the 1980s with a 1980s mindset.

00:31:12.859 --> 00:31:20.191
And it lives in our politics. How we see the
President, for instance. Does the President

00:31:20.191 --> 00:31:24.720
work for us, or do we follow whatever the
President says? In the 1980s, this starts

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:30.169
becoming the unitary executive theory, of
Ronald Reagan saying anything a President

00:31:30.169 --> 00:31:33.739
does is in our national interest.

00:31:33.739 --> 00:31:42.840
And this becomes George W. Bush. "God want
me to become President." Another answer from

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.580
him, "I'm the Commander. I don't need to explain.
Maybe somebody needs to explain to me when

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.389
they say something, but I don't feel like
I owe anybody an explanation."

00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:58.559
This idea that the President dictates to all
of us where we go, what we do, who we are

00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:03.570
as a people. And this is not just coming from
the President because lots of people believe

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:10.729
this. A lot of people today, out of this culture
of the individual in the 1980s, see that whatever

00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:15.679
the President says, or the President's in
my party, I'm not gonna question it.

00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:20.519
And the attitude now, it's symbiotic. It comes
from the President and then it's reflected

00:32:20.519 --> 00:32:26.299
back onto the President. And it's not just
Republicans. President Obama, "I'm a better

00:32:26.299 --> 00:32:30.239
speech writer than my speech writers. I know
more about policies on any issue than my policy

00:32:30.239 --> 00:32:31.239
directors.

00:32:31.239 --> 00:32:35.090
And I'm gonna think I'm a better political
director than my political director." When

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:39.149
a staffer later sent him an email message
saying "you are more clutch than Michael Jordan,"

00:32:39.149 --> 00:32:45.279
Obama replied, "Just give me the ball." I
mean, this is straight out of the '80s, or

00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:49.491
at least referencing the '80s, referencing
what we learned in the 1980s.

00:32:49.491 --> 00:33:02.830
All right. This is more trivia. What film
was Spike Lee's first feature film? "She's

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:12.149
Gotta Have It," "Do the Right Thing," "Malcolm
X,” or "Colors?" 

00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:17.349
What's the name of Jack Burton's nemesis in
"Big Trouble in Little China?" David Lo Pan,

00:33:17.349 --> 00:33:25.499
Egg Chin, Wang, or Mr. Fuji?

00:33:25.499 --> 00:33:29.940
What famed singer performs an ode to American
right before Apollo Creed is killed by Ivan

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:35.909
Drago? Aretha Franklin, Tony Bennett, James
Brown, or Cher? OK.

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:23.820
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: All right. So, this ad comes
out in 1988 [music stops]

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:29.669
and what I've just told you before, or gone
through, is this idea that there are these

00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:36.230
great individuals that have super powers and
who can save the world singularly.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:42.130
But on top of being taught that in the 1980s,
I argue in the book that we were taught that

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:49.970
ultimately, we could all be the Michael Jordans.
We could all be the super heroes. And I cite

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:55.860
this ad as an example. Again, just one example.
But watch this ad, this part of the ad, slowed

00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:00.700
down to see what this ad is really saying.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:06.150
[plays ad]

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:14.130
So, that's a regular kid. Just a nobody kid,
who basically becomes Michael Jordan. And

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:18.070
if you actually watch that ad in slow-mo over
the course of the ad, that's what the ad is

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.070
doing.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:25.490
It's interspersing the greats, the great heroes,
with regular people playing sports. And this

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:30.190
becomes, obviously, Nike's "Just Do It" campaign.
And if you really think about what is Nike

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:33.550
really saying with its "Just Do It" campaign,
it's saying all of us can be Michael Jordan

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:38.440
if we just do it, whatever that actually means.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:49.900
And Nike marketed this 
and marketed this and this becomes a bigger

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:56.350
thing through all sorts of other echo chambers.
And I play this and I gave away the punch

other malfunctioned corporation called the

[end clip]

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:14.830
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Right. So, just doing it,
in some senses, means making as much money

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:22.580
as possible regardless of the consequences.
Just doing it means huge, huge sums of wealth.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:30.900
And this is echoed in all sorts of cultural
products. This idea of getting wealthy is

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:36.830
the way to just do it. And no just movies,
right? In all sorts of television shows.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:09.810
Just doing it means achieving enormous sums
of wealth. The American dream goes from a

middle class dream of wanting two and a half
kids, a white picket fence to I want Rick

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:28.660
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Now, just to show you how
this was all working in some social science

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:35.020
data, Just Do It. The individual. I can be
a great success if I make a huge amount of

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:43.990
wealth, don't think about my community, am
only focused on me, me, me. This is from some

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:45.380
data from the book, "Bowling Alone."

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:53.490
The percentage of Americans in a local club
or civic organization. 1985, 15% of Americans.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:59.950
By the mid-1990s, 8%. I mean, that's cutting
in half essentially, the number of Americans

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:03.780
who engage in one of the hallmarks that we
call community civic life.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:16.090
This is a really shocking and disturbing one.
The top goals of college freshmen. So, in

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:24.170
1980, 62% of college freshmen say that they
wanted to be very well off financially. That

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:33.300
was their top goal. 74%, by, excuse me. 72%,
by the end of the 1980s.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:38.980
A huge jump. Now what's really mind-blowing
about this is to put it next to the other

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:43.870
things that college freshmen were saying about
what they wanted to achieve, what just doing

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:54.210
it really meant. So you take that same graph.
OK. So, there's that line that we just saw.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:58.180
Now the other line there measures college
freshmen saying that they wanna develop a

00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.800
meaningful philosophy of life.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.300
[laughter]

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:10.010
OK. So, in 1980, at the beginning of the 1980s,
just doing it is shared basically, the same

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:17.320
goals, big goals, of college freshmen. Basically,
the same amount are saying, are listing as

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:22.340
a top goal being, getting a meaningful philosophy
of life. Basically, greed is good.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:28.020
And then, you see that drop precipitously
during the 1980s. So, this is how this message

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:33.870
is an example of how this message really got
through to people, and to kids in particular.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:38.420
All right. Another trivia question. Who hosted
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous?

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:46.080
Robin Colcourt, Robin Leech, Robin Ventura,
or Piers Morgan? Would you be surprised if

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.980
it was Piers Morgan? Which real-life tycoon
gave the speech that inspired Gordon Gekko's

00:39:50.980 --> 00:40:03.410
"greed is good" oration? Donald Trump, Ivan
Boesky, Michael Milliken, George Soros.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:11.800
What was the principal commodity being speculated
on in "Trading Places?" Wheat, soy beans,

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:21.641
pork bellies, or frozen concentrated orange
juice? What was Montgomery Brewster's job

00:40:21.641 --> 00:40:28.300
before he inherited $30 million? Minor League
baseball player, janitor, limousine driver,

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.870
or bartender?

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:41.080
All right. So the final section of my presentation
is about how this all became. So we went from

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.550
the great deities who have individual super
powers, to we can all be the great deities

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:50.020
who have individual superpowers. And all of
this was being in the 1980s, coming through

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:56.210
at a time in the nation's political moment
where we were being told the government is

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.210
evil.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:00.290
The Ronald Reagan speech, the nine scariest
words, "I'm from the government; I'm here

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:10.560
to help". And there needed to be a way in
the 1980s to explain how the government still,

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:16.820
even though it was supposedly evil, how it
was doing certain things it does indisputably

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:22.460
well. And out of that need comes the idea
of the rogue.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.660
[plays clip]

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:34.420
&gt;&gt;Charles Barkley: I am not a role model.
I'm not paid to be a role model. I'm paid

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:42.950
to wreak havoc on the basketball court. Parents
should be role models. Just because I dunk

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:47.720
a basketball doesn't mean I should raise your
kids.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.780
[end clip]

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:53.670
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: All right. So, this is an
ad that transcended advertising. I mean, there

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:59.130
were editorials about it. It became a,I think
The New York Times called it the first advertisement

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:03.280
as social commentary. This has a huge impact
and this right at the--.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.840
And I define, I should have mentioned this
earlier, I define "the '80s" in our mind as

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:14.080
the entire Reagan era, Reagan-Bush era. So,
into the early 1990s. This came out right

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:22.210
in the very, very early 1990s, but it was
the culmination of the idea that we should

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:30.810
love and trust and respect and venerate only
the rogues, the people who go rogue against

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:31.810
everything.

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:35.880
And this became an explanation for how the
government still did things right, is that

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:40.120
there were people inside the government who
said, "I'm not gonna listen to the rules put

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.210
on me inside the government. I'm gonna go
rogue." And we'll get into some examples of

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:44.210
that.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.930
But let's just say in the sports arena for
a second, Nike was quoted, well, a Nike executive,

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:53.520
was quoted in saying they wanted to market
quote-unquote "outlaws with morals." That's

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:59.430
the ultimate ethos of the good rogue, right?
And Nike started this. This was

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:06.460
Here are the examples of the icons that Nike
marketed, Steve Prefontaine, John McEnroe,

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:13.090
Charles Barkley obviously, Bo Jackson, Andre
Agassi, Deion Sanders. All of them came out

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:17.340
of that rogue spirit. They were doing something.
They were breaking barriers.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:22.351
They were breaking rules that were put on
them. And this was sold to us by Nike and

00:43:22.351 --> 00:43:29.450
it was also sold to us in all sorts of other
entertainment products. So, think about how

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:36.140
all of the major rogue characters of the 1980s.
And I can go through all of these, but let

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.380
me just get them all laid out here.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:47.450
You've got, here you've got Magnum PI. You
can't rely on the government to solve crimes.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:53.760
You've gotta hire a PI. You've got Highway
to Heaven. This guy, he's an angel who comes

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:59.020
down from Heaven to solve the problems, to
go rogue and solve the problems where society

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.540
and the government refuse to solve them. Hans
Solo.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:08.610
Think about the guy's last name: Solo. A loner.
He's gonna go rogue to basically overthrow

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:13.640
the empire. And all of these examples. I mean,
this one's my favorite actually. The Fall

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.230
Guy, right? I mean, the Fall Guy was a bounty
hunter who was a stunt man.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:21.830
And talk about selling to kids, he's on the
cover, the bounty hunter who was a stunt man,

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:26.060
he's on the cover of a children's magazine.
So, as just an example of how this was sold

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:34.340
to children in many ways, directly to children.
And it had real-world applications.

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:42.210
The 1980s was a time when the Guardian Angels
from New York City were making all sorts of

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.390
headlines and the New York City police officers,
they can't solve problems. We have to have

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:50.480
a vigilante. And it became the era of the
Bernie Goetz mythology.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.640
Bernie Goetz, if you don't know who Bernie
Goetz was, he was the guy who made the argument

00:44:53.640 --> 00:45:00.180
in court that he shot a couple of African
American, I think they were teenagers, in

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:05.060
a subway hall because he afraid that they
were gonna rob him and he was going rogue

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.720
essentially to protect New York.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:11.781
And more New Yorkers need to go rogue to re-establish
safety in New York City.

00:45:11.781 --> 00:45:13.470

into the dangerous world of a man who does

not exist.

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:44.951
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Listen to what the story of
Knight Rider is.

00:45:44.951 --> 00:45:47.070
&gt;&gt;Male Voice: Michael Knight. A young loner
on a crusade to champion the cause of the

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:49.050
innocent, the helpless, the powerless in a
world of criminals who operate above the law.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:53.560
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Now just think about what
this show is saying to children, right? You

00:45:53.560 --> 00:46:00.480
can't rely on your government. You can't rely
on your police force, but a right-wing foundation

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:07.830
called the Foundation for Law and Government--FLAG,
has hired Michael Knight, a young loner, to

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:10.960
save you if you can find him.

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:16.580
And he, not the government, not your community,
he will champion the cause of the innocent,

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:21.830
the helpless, and the powerless. And this
idea is not just in Knight Rider.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.570
ol' boys
Never meaning no harm

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:37.700
Beats all you never saw
been in trouble with the law

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.510
since the day they was born"

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:45.620
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: All right. So, what are they
in trouble with the law for? They're in trouble

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:52.450
with the law because they're trying to stop
bad things in society. So, it takes the Michael

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:59.500
Knight idea, The Dukes of Hazzard did, and
it doubles down on it and says that the people

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:04.440
who were trying to help you, they're actually
outlaws for trying to help you.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:10.090
They're being chased by the police because
they are trying to solve problems. The Dukes

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:18.650
of Hazzard, obvious rogue archetypes, again
sold to kids. And this then, of course, is

00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:23.740
the ultimate example, my favorite example
of all, my favorite part of the book to write,

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:28.280
which is about

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.970
So let's take a look at the A-Team. And before
we take a look in the A-Team, and this is

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:36.200
the last part of the presentation here, because
I've been criticized for this and some reviewers

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.490
have said, "Well, you know Sirota focuses
on cultural products that weren’t really

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:44.800
critically-acclaimed. In the 1980s, they really
didn't have much of an impact."

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:53.410
Just as one example, the A-Team was the highest-rated
program among children ages two through eleven.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:59.311
The highest rated program among pre-teens.
So, it's true. A lot of these cultural products

00:47:59.311 --> 00:48:05.050
may not have been reviewed very well, but
they had huge audiences among people who were

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:09.030
first developing the way they look at life.

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:13.000
And so, take a look at what the A-Team is
saying.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.940
[plays clip]

unit was sent to prison by a military court

promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:27.090
to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still
wanted by the government, they survive as

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:31.380
soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem
and if no one else can help, and if you can

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.030
find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.

[end clip]

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:38.501
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: All right. Let's break this
down a little bit. 'Cause remember, the biggest

00:48:38.501 --> 00:48:43.750
show among kids ages two to eleven, what is
it really saying? What's the story of the

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:48.930
A-Team? And kids saw that every single time
that the show came on, that introduction.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:54.850
So let's break down what is really being said
here.

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:59.760
&gt;&gt;Announcer: In 1972, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court for

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.290
a crime they didn't commit.

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:09.910
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: All right. So, the A-Team
is wrongly accused by the evil government.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:14.730
And the real story is, if you watch the first
episodes of the A-Team, classified, they were

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:20.610
ordered secretly by their government to rob
the bank of Hanoi to end the Vietnam war.

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:24.530
Now, I'm not really sure how robbing the bank
of Hanoi would've actually ended the Vietnam

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:32.050
war. And when their commanding officer is
killed, the government denies all responsibility

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:37.520
and says that just the A-Team was trying to
get rich. So, the A-Team goes to jail. So

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.490
the government is evil, sending our good heroes
to jail.

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:45.770
&gt;&gt;Announcer: These men promptly escaped from
a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:46.770
underground.

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:53.050
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: So the government is so utterly
incompetent that what else would you do but

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:56.990
promptly escape from a maximum security prison.
[audience chuckles] I mean, they just promptly

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.990
escaped.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:03.960
It's just that easy. And after prompt escape,
where else would you go than the thriving

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.920
lawless Los Angeles underground?

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:20.661
&gt;&gt;Announcer: Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:50:20.661 --> 00:50:24.460
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: All right. Now this is where
it really gets ridiculous. So, a government

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:31.250
that can't maintain a maximum security prison
or shut down a geographically confined underground,

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:38.550
obviously can't catch these guys. And the
A-Team is surviving solving problems that

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:41.670
the government refuses to solve, or cannot
solve.

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:48.403
Now, what are some of those problems that
the; Hold on. One more clip.

00:50:48.403 --> 00:50:49.403
&gt;&gt;Announcer: If you have a problem and no
one else can help, and if you can find them,

00:50:49.403 --> 00:50:50.403
maybe you can hire the A-Team.

00:50:50.403 --> 00:51:00.140
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: All right. So the A-Team.
No one else can help. The government can't

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:05.620
help. The military can't help. Here are some
of the services that the A-Team goes and achieves.

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:12.920
They conduct high-level military operations.
They rescue a high-jacked plane, for instance.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:18.170
They bring a rogue CIA unit to justice 'cause
the government can't do that. They protect

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:22.580
small businesses from larger, bullying, often
violent, competitors. That includes two sisters

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.070
who own a soda factory. [chuckles}

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:25.070
[laughter]

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:33.160
An up-start LA cab company [chuckles] and
a small construction company. And rescuing

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:45.640
the kidnapped. Now, here's the part that really
is mind-blowing. So, who can find the A-Team?

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:54.310
Farmers, old people, [audience laughs] church
groups, an African country looking for help

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:59.110
in finding their son, [audience chuckles]
Rick James can find the A-Team. [audience

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:00.110
laughs]

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:07.540
Hulk Hogan can find the A-Team. Boy George
can find the A-Team.

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.460
[loud laughter]

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:15.990
All right. So who can't find the A-Team? The
combined resources of the national security

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:22.170
state in the United States. And so what this
says is that the government is incompetent,

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:26.661
but the outsiders outside of the government
are the only ones who can help.

00:52:26.661 --> 00:52:32.120
And it ultimately ends up portraying the government
this portrayal, like this, which is the scariest

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.280
scene ever for a child.

image of the government to kids. A faceless

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:52.280
thing that is going to rip into your house
and try to steal the innocent alien, aka ET,

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.240
who you are trying to protect, of course,
from the government.

00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:03.260
Just watch this. I mean, this is a children's
movie. This is the image of the government

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:13.750
to kids. Looks like a Gestapo. I'm sure many
of you remember watching this as kids. I mean,

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:18.090
it was really horrifying. And if you think
about it, Steven Spielberg, you're gonna have

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:20.320
like people in spacesuits go zombie-busting.

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.880
Like, why don't you just knock on the door
of the house [audience laughs] instead of

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:29.160
going zombie into the house? And it's because
this was the idea of the government. And here's

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.230
the idea of how to solve problems.

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:01.270
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: It's like extortion.

00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:05.070
&gt;&gt;Man in Suit: Five thousand dollars? I had
no idea it'd be so much. I won't pay it.

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:08.650
&gt;&gt;Bill Murray: Well, that's all right. We
can just put it right back in there. We certainly

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:09.650
can, Dr. Venkman.

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:10.650
&gt;&gt;Man in Suit: No, no.

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:14.480
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: He's threatening to throw,
basically this intergalactic terrorist, back

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:21.720
into the hotel unless the hotel pays the private
contractor. Now, all of this is funny. And

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:29.200
I'm a huge fan of the Ghostbusters and of
ET. But it's not a coincidence that a generation

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.150
was brought up on things like this

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:35.050
is going to be a generation that asks relatively
fewer questions about, "Hey, wait a minute.

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:41.250
Why is our government hiring private contractors
at a higher cost than it would cost to do

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:46.670
things through the government itself for things
like the Iraq War, for things like Homeland

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:47.670
Security?"

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:51.680
It's because when you bring up a generation,
and these are just singular examples, if you

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:56.670
bring up a generation on this kind of thing,
that generation learns this is the way the

00:54:56.670 --> 00:55:02.250
world works, when in fact this way that the
world works is actually a radical vision,

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:05.950
is actually a departure from the way the world
had worked in our own country.

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:11.820
The story of the Ghostbusters literally, the
biggest city in the country is attacked by

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:16.460
intergalactic terrorists. The military, the
police force, the government leadership, can't

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:22.650
deal with it. They have to hire the private,
for-profit company. That was one solution

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:23.990
that the 80s posited to us.

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:32.230
The other solution was to go rogue from within.
And these are all the cultural products about

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:39.500
the people in the government who go up against
the bureaucracy in the government to try to

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:45.620
solve problems. Half of the problems in all
of these products is that the government won't

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:50.170
let them do what they need to do to solve
society's problems.

00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:52.520
And ultimately becomes one-liners like this.

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.400
[plays clip]

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.170
&gt;&gt;Old Man: Diplomatic immunity.

00:55:58.170 --> 00:55:59.170
[gunshot]

00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:04.770
&gt;&gt;Danny Glover: Has just been revoked.

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.660
[end clip]

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:13.690
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: So the idea is that, and then
this is of course, Lethal Weapon 2, the archetype

00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:20.030
of doing right and protecting us means letting
a lowly Sergeant in a police force gun down

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:25.910
an unarmed Ambassador and unilaterally revoke
that unarmed Ambassador's diplomatic privileges

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:27.680
as established by the law.

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:33.850
He's the hero. The guy who just shot the unarmed
man is the hero. And we get this, of course,

00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:38.110
the analog to this is our entire political
debate. That when you hear George Bush talk

00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:43.540
about warrantless wire-tapping, or Barack
Obama talk about how he should have the authority

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:51.020
to, without judge, jury, or trial, execute
American citizens through assassination orders.

00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:56.520
What they are really tapping into is what
we all learned in the 1980s that that's the

00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:03.890
way to solve problems, is to go rogue and
ignore the law and ignore civil institutions,

00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:10.940
because the law and civil institutions are
the problem, not the solution. And out of

00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:16.240
the 1980s, this starts becoming political,
as an example, through Oliver North.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:19.910
One thing that will blow your mind, go read
George Bush's speech on warrantless wire-tapping

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:26.640
and then go read Oliver North's speech to
the Senate committee about Iran Contra. It's

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:31.480
really, really creepy. All right. A couple
last trivia questions and then I'll take some

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.830
questions if you wanna ask me some questions.

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:36.990
What was Michael Knight's name before he was
shot in the face and then nursed back to health

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:42.660
by the Foundation for Law and Government?
Michael Smith, Michael Keaton, Michael Long,

00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:49.800
Michael Kitt? 
What college did both Charles Barkley and

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.220
Bo Jackson both attend?

00:57:53.220 --> 00:58:02.110
University of Alabama, Bob Jones University,
Auburn University, or Clemson University?

00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:09.460
What US state is the fictional Hazzard County
supposed to be in? Mississippi, Florida, Alabama,

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:18.520
or Georgia? And the final question. What famed
game show did Cliff Clavin appear on and then

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.520
lose?

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:24.770
Tic Tac Dough, Press Your Luck, Jeopardy,
or The Price is Right? Now, we'll just go

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:32.950
through the answers here. All right. Question
One, She's Like the Wind was the song that

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:41.860
Patrick Swayze performed. Kevin Costner played
the corpse in The Big Chill, but you never

00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:43.600
see his face.

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:50.370
The Outsiders took place in Tulsa. Spike Lee's
first film was She's Gotta Have It. David

00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:57.070
Lo Pan was the major nemesis in Big Trouble
in Little China. James Brown sang that song

00:58:57.070 --> 00:59:03.300
before Apollo Creed was killed. Robin Leech
was the host of Lifestyles of the Rich and

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.300
Famous.

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:10.160
Ivan Boesky gave the "greed is good" speech.
Frozen concentrated orange juice was the commodity

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:15.810
being traded in Trading Places. Minor League
baseball player was Montgomery Brewster's

00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:26.220
job. He was a pitcher for the Hackensack Bulls,
I think. Michael Long was his name before

00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:27.220
he was Michael Knight.

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:33.980
Auburn University. No, it wasn't Bob Jones
University. [laughter]Georgia is where Hazzard

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:40.320
County, the fictional Hazzard County was.
And Cliff Clavin lost on Jeopardy. That's

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.710
my presentation. If you have any questions,
I'd be happy to answer them.

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:44.710
[applause]

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:46.370
Anybody? Oh, yeah.

00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:57.070
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: So, I have a question
and it's probably covered in your book. What

00:59:57.070 --> 01:00:02.020
happened to the '90s if the '80s are still
so powerful? Because you saw in the '90s the

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:07.940
rise of several big things like environmentalism.
We did see like, in movies like Independence

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:13.700
Day, which is like a quintessential '90s film,
the hero of that movie is somebody from the

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:17.320
government. So, did the '90s just not count
or what happened?

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:24.300
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Yeah. I mean, look, one thing
with my book and my argument is I think it's

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:34.280
hard to. It's obviously hard to say any decade
epitomized a finite amount of things. Because

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.530
there's basically an infinite amount of things
that happen in a decade.

01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:49.210
What my book is concerned with is what you
might call the quote/unquote "mainstream cultural

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:54.870
products and messages" that were pumped out
in the 1980s. And what I think is there were

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:58.970
obviously. There were actually products and
messages in the 1980s that ran counter to

01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:02.920
all of this, as there were in the 1990s, as
there were in 2000.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:12.260
But what I would say is that we still live
in a 1980s world in the sense that the way

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:20.130
we look at the world and what majority culture
and mainstream culture tells us and embeds

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:25.330
in our culture and makes us assume. The stories
that we tell ourselves are still very much

01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:26.711
the stories of the 1980s.

01:01:26.711 --> 01:01:31.590
Now, I wanna be clear, I think that may be
changing in some ways. And I think that's

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:38.020
a good thing. But I think when you look at
a culture that is so focused on the individual

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:42.400
over the common good, when you look at a culture
that is still having our political debates,

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:47.850
are still framed as let's go back to the '50s,
the '60s and the progress of the '60s were

01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:49.650
good, and that's still the debate.

01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:54.920
And my book also goes into the whole idea
of militarism and how the 1980s told us that

01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:00.940
the major way to solve problems is to use
the military. I have a whole section on that.

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:04.030
It's not that I'm saying there were no 1990s.

01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:09.200
What I'm saying is, is that the things that
you mention out of the 1990s, I don't think

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:16.240
have yet become the new stories, the new dominant
stories that we tell ourselves and that direct

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.450
our public policy, for instance, just yet.

01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:25.130
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: So, Spielberg and
most of Hollywood are pretty much liberals

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:28.680
and still in good standing, I would assume.
And so, where do these messages come from?

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.230
'Cause they do seem to be contrary to liberal
world view.

01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:35.510
Are they coming from the corporate control,
or is this just reflecting what the audience

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:36.510
wants to hear?

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:39.220
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: I'm glad you asked that question
because I get asked this question a lot. Are

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:42.290
you saying, it's basically, are you saying
there's some sort of conspiracy, and I'm not

01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:45.000
saying you're saying there's a conspiracy.
[chuckles]

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.110
But did all these people get into a room and
say, "All right, listen. We're gonna sell

01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:54.310
America on the idea that the government is
that spaceman busting into people's homes."

01:02:54.310 --> 01:02:57.600
And I don't think that's the way it worked.
I did a lot of interviews with people who

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.400
created some of these products.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:07.450
And overwhelmingly what they say is that "Look,
our job was to sell tickets. Our job was to

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:14.350
get ratings. Our job was to fill seats at
the movie theater. So, when we sat down and

01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:20.230
came up with stories to create and tell people,
we weren't saying, 'I'm gonna sell this audience

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:22.240
that doesn't believe this already on a new
idea.'

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:32.790
It was, 'We need the quickest, shortest shorthand,storytelling
shorthand to get people to watch our product,

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:38.530
consume our product, buy tickets.' “And
so, I interviewed a good example is I interviewed

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:45.820
the creator of Family Ties, who was a hippie
in the 1960s. And I said, "You made this show

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:48.110
and a lot of this show is like, making fun
of hippies."

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:53.520
And he's like, "Well, you know, I was just
trying to tell the story of how my family

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.490
and I had a son and how it felt in our house."
And he's like, "I never really thought about

01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:03.890
the fact that we were really making fun of
the hippies." And he said it and he didn't

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:05.150
say it like he's ignorant.

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:10.900
It's just that it was never on their mind.
I was that in the midst of the Reagan era,

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:16.500
the backlash to the Civil Rights movement,
the military buildup of the Soviets, it was

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:22.660
what's the quickest point between A, the audience,
and B, the storyteller. And we're gonna default

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:25.040
basically to the lowest common denominator.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:31.841
And the lowest common denominator at that
point was this set of stories. And the reason

01:04:31.841 --> 01:04:35.921
I ultimately wrote this book was not to just
look back and say, "Hey, the 1980s is still

01:04:35.921 --> 01:04:42.610
today." It's to say those stories, the rogue
is the only one we can trust. We can't trust

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:45.360
civic institutions, the individual over the
common good, militarism.

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.810
And I have a whole chapter, by the way, on
the idea that we've become a post-racial society.

01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:56.410
That comes out of the '80s. Those stories
are radical departures from the stories we

01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:59.800
had been telling ourselves as a country. And
that,

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.730
I don't wanna give too much away about the
kind of conclusion of my book, but if we can

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:10.210
acknowledge that they were radical departures,
if we can acknowledge that they were manufactured

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:15.170
stories, then it means we have the capacity
to tell ourselves different stories.

01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:21.520
But that's gonna require an awareness that
the story lines here are not just mystical,

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.280
magical forces of nature. They were actually
artificially constructed.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:33.430
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Why did the audience's
preferences change?

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:37.720
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: I mean, that's a good question.
And I would say this. I would say that people

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:43.740
ask me a lot, "Well, did Ronald Reagan create
the 1980s or did the '80s create Ronald Reagan?"

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:49.410
And I just think it's a symbiotic. There was
a symbiotic relationship going on with the

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:54.190
politics of the moment that in the aftermath
of Civil Rights movement, Women's Rights movement,

01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:57.590
the end of the Vietnam War, and I have a whole
section in my book about the Vietnam War played

01:05:57.590 --> 01:06:01.180
into this and the whole idea that we lost
the Vietnam War because people opposed the

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.180
Vietnam War.

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:07.800
That was a huge thing that happened in the
1980s. The revisionist memory of what happened

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:16.250
in the Vietnam War. That I think there was
a perfect storm of people looking for answers

01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:22.210
to the tumult, perhaps, of the '60s and the
'70s. And these stories provided crystal clear,

01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:27.950
very simple and very, very ideological storylines
that seemed to explain the world.

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:34.880
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: So, I would like
to understand, I guess the fact that you said

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.430
that people, when they were born in the '80s
looked fondly on the '50s and then again,

01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:43.310
we still tell the stories of the '80s today
and a lot that we do. How much of that is

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:44.310
people in certain--.

01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:48.520
Obviously, people in the '50s having the Baby
Boomers coming into age, or coming of age,

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:53.260
and positions of power in order to be the
people who generated this content, made these

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:58.240
decisions in the '80s. Subsequently, people
who were born in the '80s and who are in those

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:02.490
positions today obviously remember fondly
on those stories and how does it perpetuate

01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:03.490
itself?

01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:09.330
And then this focus of going rogue, being
driven by having expansion in the American

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:13.640
family in the '50s due to Baby Boomers and
people trying to effectively maybe fight free

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:19.760
of that family unit and maybe now this culture
of individuality forcing people to achieve

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.170
at higher levels as individuals.

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:26.140
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Yeah, well, OK. So, two parts.
No, no, no. They're both good questions. The

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:33.350
first part is that I do think that the idealization
of the '50s that happened in the 1980s, you're

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:42.740
right, was naturally from storytellers who
grew up in the '50s and remembered their childhood.

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:48.340
And in some ways, for most people, I mean
there are very traumatic troubled childhood

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:53.520
among some people, but for most people you
naturally remember your childhood as this

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.310
time of innocence because for you it was.

01:07:57.310 --> 01:08:04.410
And so, a lot of Spielberg’s products, even
though they're not set in the '50s, that's

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:10.740
the perfect representation of that, is this
idea of innocence, childhood innocence. So

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:15.541
the '50s, among people who were children,in
the '80s, the people who were children in

01:08:15.541 --> 01:08:18.770
the '50s were looking at the '50s through
the lens of their own childhood.

01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:22.930
A good example of this, by the way, is the
movie Stand By Me. Stand By Me is looking

01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:27.130
back at the '50s as a very innocent time,
although there was obviously lack of innocence

01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:28.130
there as well.

01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:34.380
But I think that was a natural part of it,
but I also think, and we also can't negate

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:44.080
that the most revered and iconic political
figure of the moment was Ronald Reagan, who

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:51.440
was originally famous as an actor in the 1950s,
was a guy whose entire politics and a lot

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:58.900
of his speeches were about having to go back
to the '50s and we have to stand up to the

01:08:58.900 --> 01:08:59.900
'60s.

01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:05.750
We have to literally a war on the 1960s. Now
to your point about going rogue, some people

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:10.440
have said about this book, they said, "Well,
the '60s is a time of individuality and individual

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:18.250
expression and rebellion and going rogue against
society." And I think there's something to

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:19.600
that.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:28.440
And when I think some of the genius of the
1980s, especially in politics, was that conservatives

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:38.730
and Republicans stole the rhetoric of and
the zeitgeist of rebellion and turned it into

01:09:38.730 --> 01:09:43.750
"You don't need to rebel against society.
You need to rebel against specifically, the

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:44.750
government

01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:49.489
That the government, either through taxes
or regulation or anything else, is trying

01:09:49.489 --> 01:09:57.920
to keep you down." And I think one of the,.
There's a story in the book about Jerry Rubin

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:05.450
the Yippee. He was a protestor in the 1960s,
one of the leaders of the student movement.

01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:12.030
And in the 1980s he became a corporate guy.
And he was interviewed in the 1980s and he

01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:17.160
was talking about in the interview, and it's
in the book, he was talking about how he realized

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:23.040
that rebellion meant basically rebelling against
the government, not really rebelling against

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.550
the social mores of society.

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:29.870
And whether, again, it's not a conspiracy.
I don't think a bunch of people got in a room

01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:35.739
and said we're gonna do this, but I think
it's metastasized into not let's rebel and

01:10:35.739 --> 01:10:40.110
have a revolution of, a cultural revolution
in society. It became "let's rebel against

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:41.110
the government."

01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:45.930
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: I noticed in
your presentation that Oprah was the only

01:10:45.930 --> 01:10:51.489
female. I was just curious. Is this story,
was it also towards women, or was there a

01:10:51.489 --> 01:10:52.489
totally different message?

01:10:52.489 --> 01:10:53.790
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: In the book, or in--?

01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:54.790
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: In either.

01:10:54.790 --> 01:11:05.831
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Yeah. Well, there's two things
about that. One is that I think in the 1980s

01:11:05.831 --> 01:11:16.250
that the cause of women's rights actually
was a cause that was as successful or even

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:24.481
more successful than any other, I guess you
could call it, progressive cause in the 1980s.

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:32.520
And so, for purposes of my book, my book was
trying to raise what happened in the 1980s

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:39.880
that continue today that hold us down and
hold us back. And in the chapter that I have,

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.110
the last chapter, actually about the Cosby
Show.

01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:51.739
I have an entire discussion about how we foisted
upon us, maybe not foisted upon us, but the

01:11:51.739 --> 01:11:57.900
Cosby Show represented, and there was a big
debate about it in the 1980s, whether the

01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:03.150
Cosby Show was saying that there is no racism
anymore, or there is.

01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:10.400
As an example, the Cosby Show, some scholars
argue, that it substituted gender equity for

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:15.770
a discussion of race, for a discussion of
what was really going on in America at a time

01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:22.580
of institutional racism in the 1980s. And
the Cosby Show really, I think, represented

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:27.890
what was happening in the country in the 1980s
for women, that it was actually a

01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:34.510
I mean, I think the 1980s was economically
a bad time for most people, despite all of

01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:41.380
the, I mean, inequality got bigger, poverty
rose, etc., etc. But in terms of women's relative

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:47.310
place in society in the 1980s, and I'm happy
about this, was a time where women made real

01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:48.310
advances.

01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:56.880
And we're still not an equal society. So,
I guess what I would say is that a lot of

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:06.860
militarism, the 1950s, the 1960s, the individual,
it's, that happened to us all. And so, I guess

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:12.960
I didn't single out women and I didn't discriminate
against women and I'm not trying to make this

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:18.780
a defense of my book, I guess I'm giving a
long answer to a shorter question, which is

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:25.820
just basically that I really think that women
were one of the very few groups that managed

01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:31.850
to make, as a group, real progress at a very
reactionary time. Yes.

01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:39.070
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: So you mentioned
a lot of different tropes that were coming

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:44.860
out in popular media during the '80s and I
can think of times where widespread media

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.260
would focus on at least one of those.

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:49.620
So, you talk about Silver Spoons and I can
think of Little Orphan Annie and things like

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:53.541
it, or Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and the
guy going rogue inside the government.

01:13:53.541 --> 01:13:54.541
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Yeah, yeah.

01:13:54.541 --> 01:13:58.020
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: And those had a
lot of similar followers. So, you had these

01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:03.060
pockets in time of some of these things being
popular among most of America, but not all

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:04.060
of it together.

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:07.920
I can also think of times where a lot of this
was popular among a particular subculture,

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:12.230
a lot of black exploitation films had the
hero going rogue in a community where you

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:16.290
can't trust the government. I'm wondering
if these patterns that you're drawing for

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:20.460
all of America during the '80s, if you could
find pockets of those earlier or different,

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:28.960
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Yeah. Yes, absolutely. And
I'm glad you bring it up. None of this,I think

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:39.190
I can say none of it. Most of it is not exclusive
to the 1980s, but I think its traction in

01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:46.239
the world is exclusive to the 1980s. By that
I mean yes, you always had people in society

01:14:46.239 --> 01:14:48.500
who were saying that,

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:57.500
William F Buckley, Mr. Individual, Ayn Rand.
They were around but they didn't, they're

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:04.400
ideas didn't become the embedded assumption
in society until the 1980s. My book is actually

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.180
chock full of data to prove that point. And
I have a lot of data in there, especially

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:15.800
on the chapter by the way, of individualism
and narcissism and people's goals about OK,

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.300
in 1980, this is what polls said.

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:27.060
In 1990, this is what polls said. And polls
have subsequently not gone back to their pre-'80s

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:31.400
level. So I'll give you one example on a topic
that we didn't talk about in this presentation,

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:39.610
the one example that just is mind blowing.
In 1980, 50% of Americans said that they did

01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:43.860
not have confidence in the military and that
they had questions about our military posture,

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:46.230
how much we were spending on defense budgets.

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:52.380
So, a huge number of Americans saying basically,
"We're not comfortable with us being such

01:15:52.380 --> 01:16:01.051
a militarist country." By 1990, 85% of Americans
said they had full confidence in the military

01:16:01.051 --> 01:16:04.710
and the military was the most revered and
respected institution in the country, where

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:08.020
that number has basically stayed.

01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:13.440
And you have to ask yourself well, what intervened
in-between a time when the country was saying

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:18.431
"hey, maybe we gotta rethink this whole invade
everybody idea," to "we're not gonna question

01:16:18.431 --> 01:16:23.890
the military at all. The military is the central
organizing institution in our country."

01:16:23.890 --> 01:16:31.239
And what I did in the book was say there was
militarism in the 1940s, '50s, '60s. I try

01:16:31.239 --> 01:16:37.320
to look at areas where the '80s had an impact
and that the impact has remained and stayed.

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.320
Yes.

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:42.000
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: But it comes down
about the military, I think is a good example.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.050
It comes down to specific examples. I mean,
in 1980, it was just after the Vietnam War

01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:52.280
where people had some issue with the military.
But then in '79, of course, was the hostage

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.300
rescue fiasco.

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:57.580
So of course people were gonna be way down
on the military. And then,

01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:04.130
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: But just to give you some
context on that, I do agree with you. But

01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:07.500
that number was not a spike. In other words,
the number was not like, up here and then

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.690
was like boom, right?

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:14.940
It was a gradual decline and then a steep
incline, up to beyond where it had ever been

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:18.580
before that, or at least before that since
the end of World War II.

01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:22.130
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Sure. OK. So my
real question was more about do you think

01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:29.630
this is cyclical? So, is this, the 1980s and
then in X number of years, we're gonna go

01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:34.900
back to what the '60s were, the '50s, and
then sort of cycle through. I know that there's

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.260
a whole theory on history,

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:40.790
&gt;&gt;David Sirota: Right. That we keep repeating
ourselves, or the same themes come up every

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:48.630
30 years. Look, I think that there is something
cyclical about it, except for this point,

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:54.950
which I worry about which is that I cite a
study in there by Temple University which

01:17:54.950 --> 01:18:01.750
found that the 1980s was the first time in
any mass way that the media began presenting

01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:06.430
our politics through the lens of generations
and eras.

01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:09.970
That I know we think about with Generation
X and Generation Y and the '80s and there's

01:18:09.970 --> 01:18:14.770
the '50s and there's the '60s. Actually, Temple
University did this study looking at magazine

01:18:14.770 --> 01:18:21.400
covers and magazine copy over a hundred years.
And that the 1980s was the first time where

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:27.489
it started, where the media started defining
very clearly the '60s generation, the '70s,

01:18:27.489 --> 01:18:28.489
the '80s.

01:18:28.489 --> 01:18:36.600
And what I would say is that that was the
first time and if the 1980s, if so much of

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:46.001
the 1980s was a battle over previous eras,
or to define previous eras, then if it is

01:18:46.001 --> 01:18:53.920
cyclical, so much of the 1980s was about previous
eras that it's not, that we haven't stepped

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:55.860
forward into another era.

01:18:55.860 --> 01:19:01.210
So, what I fear is that it's all just gonna
be a derivative of the '80s. Right? That the

01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:07.090
cycle, because there hasn't been a new set
of storylines, is simply going to be more

01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:12.110
and more of the 1980s, even though we may
not call it the 1980s. I mean, we're still

01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:14.750
talking about the Tea Party folks.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:17.961
I quote a bunch of Tea Party folks. They're
still talking about the '50s. I mean, people

01:19:17.961 --> 01:19:21.460
who didn't live in the '50s. Like, the New
York Times did this great quote from this

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:26.300
guy that's "we gotta get back to the '50s,
life was better in the '50s." And they said,

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:27.940
"Well, what were your memories of the '50s?"

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:36.340
"Well, I was born in 1964." And so, what I'm
saying is that it's cyclical, but I don't

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:42.380
think it's gonna go back to what it was before
the 1980s until there are actually a new set

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:46.270
of storylines that actually challenge the
1980s.

01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:50.720
I mean, we haven't yet had a President, and
I lament this, I don't think, who has said,

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.150
"You know what? The common good is more important
than the individual." I mean, that just hasn't

01:19:55.150 --> 01:20:04.290
been the way we talk about our world in this
country. It used to be the way we talked.

01:20:04.290 --> 01:20:10.290
In the 1940s, everybody's gotta sacrifice
for the World War II. Everybody's put out

01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:13.710
the, my grandmother always tells a story.
Whatever they got at the supermarket, if they

01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:17.210
got tin, they had to put it out on their doorstep
and it got picked up and melted down for the

01:20:17.210 --> 01:20:19.110
munitions.

01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:25.480
Those are radical concepts. And nobody has
even presented a counter to what intervened

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:33.730
in the '80s. So, what I'm saying is it's cyclical,
but I think we're caught in an on-loop. So

01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:36.930
I just wanna thank you all for coming. I really
appreciate it and if you have any questions

01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:38.840
or you want me to sign a book, I'd be happy
to. Thanks again.

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:38.920
