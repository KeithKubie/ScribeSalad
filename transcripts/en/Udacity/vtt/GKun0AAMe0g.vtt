Alright. We noticed that all of these strings start with a lowercase a and S starts with capital A.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Why don't we have capital A goes to lowercase a just to get rid of this lowercase a at the beginning.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, we don't have to worry as much about it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, I noticed that there can be some number of b's: bb, bb, one b, so one or more b's here,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and then sometimes, we've got c, and sometimes, we've got c d at the end.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So, I'm going to make B C D be a list of one or more b's, and one way to do that is like this:

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
B C D goes to b, B C D. So here in the middle, after the a, we could either have no b's

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or we could loop as many times as we want and pick up more b's,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and now after that, it looks like we either need c, c d, or nothing.

00:00:44.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Well, we have c. We got nothing, so we could also have c d.
