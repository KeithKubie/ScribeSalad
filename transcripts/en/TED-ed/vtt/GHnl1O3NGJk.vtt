00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:20.846
Commas are tricky things,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:21.153
especially when subordinates

00:00:21.177 --> 00:00:23.015
and conjunctions are involved.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.492
If you can remember a few basic rules,

00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:26.731
a simple law of physics,

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:28.211
and some common scenarios,

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:31.552
you will be able to use commas correctly.

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:33.386
I like to think of the different parts

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.275
of our sentence as characters.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:37.108
Let's meet a few of them:

00:00:37.132 --> 00:00:39.030
the tiny conjunctions,

00:00:39.054 --> 00:00:40.897
the mighty subordinates,

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:43.032
and the clever comma.

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:45.697
Conjunctions are small and nimble.

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:48.211
They are words that connect clauses,

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:48.861
words,

00:00:48.885 --> 00:00:50.258
and phrases.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:52.309
You can easily remember the conjunctions

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.815
by remembering the acronym FANBOYS.

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:57.082
The conjunctions are

00:00:57.106 --> 00:00:58.108
for,

00:00:58.132 --> 00:00:59.228
and,

00:00:59.252 --> 00:01:00.253
nor,

00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:01.466
but,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.811
or,

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:03.940
yet,

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:05.507
so.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:07.145
Because they're so small,

00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:08.189
more often than not,

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:10.232
they require the help of a comma

00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:12.158
but not always.

00:01:12.182 --> 00:01:13.706
Subordinates, on the other hand,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.822
are the WWE heavyweight
champions of sentences.

00:01:17.846 --> 00:01:20.530
They are words that connect
two unequal things,

00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:23.113
dependent and independent clauses.

00:01:23.137 --> 00:01:25.272
Subordinates make it very clear

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:27.970
what is being prioritized in a sentence.

00:01:27.994 --> 00:01:30.239
Commonly used subordinates are

00:01:30.263 --> 00:01:31.316
although,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.322
because,

00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:33.366
before,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.601
however,

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:35.860
unless,

00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:37.812
and even though.

00:01:37.836 --> 00:01:40.061
Because subordinates are all about power,

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:42.578
they can do a lot of heavy
lifting by themselves.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.726
But, of course, sometimes
even the strongest among us

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.227
needs some help from our clever friends.

00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:50.366
Because our clever comma is so nice,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.121
she often roams her neighborhood

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.970
looking for some community service to do.

00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:57.198
Today, as soon as she leaves her house,

00:01:57.222 --> 00:02:00.437
she sees a subordinate lifting the weight

00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:02.248
of two complete sentences,

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:04.802
one on each arm.

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:08.088
Bartheleme loves engaging
in political debate

00:02:08.112 --> 00:02:09.077
even though

00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:11.085
he usually loses.

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:15.625
The comma asks the subordinate
if he needs help.

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:17.689
Well, we know that subordinates

00:02:17.713 --> 00:02:21.802
are the WWE heavyweight
champions of sentences.

00:02:21.826 --> 00:02:23.303
They can easily hold the weight

00:02:23.327 --> 00:02:24.804
of these two complete sentences

00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:27.683
because they are distributed
evenly on both arms.

00:02:27.707 --> 00:02:30.683
So, when the comma asks if it can help,

00:02:30.707 --> 00:02:32.022
the subordinate is appalled

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:33.762
at the idea of needing assistance.

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:37.829
No thanks, maybe next time!

00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:40.020
So, the comma continues on.

00:02:40.044 --> 00:02:41.992
Soon, she seems a couple of subordinates

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:43.397
attempting to lift the weight

00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:46.180
of sentences directly
in front of themselves.

00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:49.416
Even though Bartheleme loves to sing,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.691
he never sings in front of others.

00:02:51.715 --> 00:02:54.978
The comma asks the subordinates
if they need help.

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:56.970
They might not want to admit it,

00:02:56.994 --> 00:03:00.530
but this time the subordinates
do need help.

00:03:00.554 --> 00:03:03.661
Complete sentences weigh quite a bit.

00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:05.354
Simple physics tells us

00:03:05.378 --> 00:03:07.331
that it's easier to balance heavy objects

00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:09.734
if the weight is evenly distributed.

00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:11.597
So, while the subordinates
are quite capable

00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.406
of balancing two complete sentences

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.431
when carrying the weight on both sides,

00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:17.541
they're having trouble
picking just one up.

00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:20.634
The comma rushes over

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.623
to help the struggling subordinates,

00:03:22.647 --> 00:03:24.351
but how will she help?

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:26.216
When subordinates begin sentences,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.710
the comma will place herself

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:32.125
directly after the first
thought or complete sentence.

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:33.947
After helping the subordinates,

00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:36.350
our comma heroine continues on

00:03:36.374 --> 00:03:37.634
and spots a conjunction

00:03:37.658 --> 00:03:40.292
holding the weight
of two complete sentences.

00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:43.942
Bartheleme was accepted
into the University of Chicago,

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:44.520
and

00:03:44.544 --> 00:03:47.632
he is on the waitlist
for Stanford University.

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:50.356
The comma asks the conjunction
if he needs help.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.440
Of course he does! Hurry!

00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:56.007
The comma rushes and places
itself before the conjunction.

00:03:56.031 --> 00:03:58.897
Fanboys aren't as militant
as subordinates.

00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:00.021
For this reason,

00:04:00.045 --> 00:04:03.129
the commas don't have to fall
in line behind the fanboys.

00:04:03.153 --> 00:04:04.992
Fanboys are courteous creatures.

00:04:05.016 --> 00:04:08.305
They allow the comma to go ahead of them.

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.168
Helping others is hard work!

00:04:11.192 --> 00:04:12.138
On her way home,

00:04:12.162 --> 00:04:14.543
our comma sees a conjunction
holding up the weight

00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:15.709
of a complete sentence

00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:17.433
and a fragment sentence.

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:20.969
Bartheleme is going to major
in molecular biology

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:21.886
or

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.849
interpretive dance.

00:04:23.873 --> 00:04:26.938
The now-exhausted comma
asks the conjunction

00:04:26.962 --> 00:04:29.451
if he needs help lifting the items.

00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:31.095
This is one of the rare occassions

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:34.224
where a conjunction doesn't
need the help of a comma.

00:04:34.248 --> 00:04:35.820
The conjunction assures the comma

00:04:35.844 --> 00:04:37.204
that help isn't needed,

00:04:37.228 --> 00:04:38.535
which is good for the comma

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:39.331
because by now,

00:04:39.355 --> 00:04:41.501
all it wants to do is go home and rest up

00:04:41.525 --> 00:04:44.854
for another day of vigilant
sentence constructing.
