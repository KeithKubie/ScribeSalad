00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:02.720
OMAR ERLINGSSON: My
name's Omar Erlingsson.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.090
I'm in infrastructure security.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.160
I'm here to present the speaker
for today's special talk

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.760
with the Authors
at Google series.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.930
So our speaker is
Gudrun Johnsen,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.420
who is a statistician and
economist from University

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.790
of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and she
has worked for the Icelandic

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.050
Parliamentary Special
Investigation Commission

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.226
on investigating the causes
of the economic collapse that

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:33.664
happened in Iceland in 2008.

00:00:33.664 --> 00:00:37.800
So for me, it's quite
a personal subject.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.010
I'm originally from Iceland.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.670
My family and I moved
there in 2007 from here

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.080
in Silicon Valley, where
I've been working until then.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.310
And on a trip back,
one of my colleagues

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.420
asked me about what
were the underpinnings

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.762
of the Icelandic
economy, and I knew

00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:57.970
that there was a lot of fish.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.011
That's what had been there
when I was growing up,

00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:01.945
and I knew that there
was a lot of banking,

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:04.209
and I didn't exactly know what.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.310
There was some financing,
banking, stocks,

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.730
and so on, and very
soon after that,

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.250
it all came down with a bang.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.890
95% of the market value
of the stock market

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.574
vanished overnight.

00:01:21.574 --> 00:01:26.600
Three of the six-largest
bankruptcies in world history

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.610
are Icelandic banks, so
quite a large turn of events.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.770
As it turned out,
what really happened

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.530
behind all of this, and this
great, rapid rise in the banks,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.186
seems to be all kinds of
different shenanigans.

00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:48.220
And so Gudrun is here to tell us
about those shenanigans, which,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.090
because Iceland is
relatively small,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.310
and because of this
completely unprecedented

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.740
special commission set up by the
Parliament, which had basically

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.830
total powers of
investigative authority,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.925
able to see all data
everywhere, with no exceptions,

00:02:02.925 --> 00:02:05.310
we actually know
what happened there.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.289
But I think in a greater
context, most of us

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.540
had just moved to
Iceland, and there's

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.035
a lot of stuff that's
going on in world finance

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:18.779
and so on that is quite
reminiscent of the shenanigans

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.320
that were happening there a few
years ago, and I don't think,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.240
fundamentally, very
much has changed.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.550
So anyway, with those words,
I will give the word over

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.390
to Gudrun.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.723
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Thank you, Omar.

00:02:28.723 --> 00:02:30.909
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.200
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Thank you so
much, and a special thanks

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.310
to Omar for inviting me here
and organizing this event.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.710
It's a great opportunity
for me to be here with you.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.020
I have been giving this
talk mostly at financial

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.360
institutions and
government agencies,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.830
but I wrote this book, "Bringing
Down the Banking System,"

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.880
as a wrapping up this 2,400-page
report that we issued that

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.160
nobody read into manageable
size of 200 pages,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.930
but I wrote it for
non-financiers, let's say,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.460
if there's such a word.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.270
So it's great to finally be in
front of my targeted audience.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:21.690
Now, as Omar mentioned briefly,
97% of the Icelandic banking

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.890
sector collapsed
in October 2008,

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.980
and before we entered
into the investigation

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.200
of the Special
Investigation Commission,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.430
where I was actually
the first employee

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.800
to be hired by the Commission--
so I was there from day one

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.300
until the minute it
was published in 2012--

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.700
we sort of had an idea
why this happened.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.400
But obviously, that wasn't
enough for the Icelandic public

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.360
to be told that that was
a result of a rapid growth

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.090
of credit, and size of the
banking balance sheets to GDP,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.330
and inadequate
financial supervision.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.200
I mean, that's the
short, elevator story,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.220
but we needed to tell them
how exactly this is possible,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.000
and how do you do this--
expanding your banking

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.899
sector from being about
1 times GDP to 10 times

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:22.210
GDP at the peak?

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.490
We also needed to tell them why
would you ever want to do this,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.670
given that this is a really
risky strategy, so why would

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.530
you ever want to do this?

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.470
The third question we had
to answer was why on earth

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.550
didn't anybody stop
this development?

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.020
And finally, in my book,
I try to bring forward

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.840
to the rest of the
financial world

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.650
what we can learn
from this calamity.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.220
Now, I will ask you to
jot down your questions.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.750
We're going to save the best
for last-- your questions.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.370
It's quite a lot of material.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.430
It demands quite a
bit from the audience,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.980
so I'll ask you to wait
with your questions

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.640
until at the very
end, unless something

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.920
is horribly vague or confusing.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.060
Now, very briefly, on the SIC,
it was installed by Parliament,

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.080
and there were three people
appointed by the Parliament

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.240
to sit on the Commission.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.390
There was a Supreme Court
justice, Pall Hreinsson,

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.250
Sigridur Benediktsdottir, who
was a lecturer at the Economics

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.660
Department at Yale
University at the time,

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.380
and another lawyer,
Tryggvi Gunnarsson,

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.720
who's Althingi's Ombudsman.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.080
Althingi is the
Icelandic parliament.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.450
Now, the mandate was not
of any insignificance.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.850
It was to seek the truth, no
less, behind the events leading

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.820
up to the fall of
the Icelandic banks,

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.600
and what was also
quite challenging

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.990
in a small society--
and bear this in mind

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.290
throughout the lecture.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.750
Iceland is a large
country, relatively large,

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.580
but we are only 330,000,
roughly, who live there.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.375
So somebody told me
half of Frankfurt.

00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:26.890
Half of Frankfurt-- that struck
me as a quite a good benchmark.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:33.740
Now, the challenging part
was to basically find out

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.850
whether mistakes or
negligence had occurred

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.720
in the course of the
implementation of the laws

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.610
and other rules regulating,
or providing control for,

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.300
the financial market.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.650
And in addition, what
persons may be responsible?

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.160
Now, the degrees of
separation in Iceland

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.760
is obviously one or two, so
this is a delicate matter.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.450
This was a privilege to actually
be involved with this effort,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.060
simply because the
Icelandic parliament thought

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:15.750
that it would be impossible to
deliver a proper investigation

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:22.390
without full access to all
data that the Commission deemed

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.240
necessary to deliver
on their mission.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.220
Now, we basically had powers
to search all premises,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.930
seize evidence
considered necessary

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.580
for the purpose of
its investigation,

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.440
subpoena witnesses.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.650
And in return, we were to
report any suspicious contact

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:49.750
to the special prosecutor,
who was still working on cases

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.350
brought about as a result of
this investigation and other.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:59.280
The final product was
a 2,400-page report,

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.510
published 12th of April 2010,
and the task was quite big.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.700
We did not like the
Lehman examiner's report.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.100
It's also 2,400 pages.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:16.220
We'll go over that soon,
but just to tell you,

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.310
the scope of the research was
the third-largest bankruptcy

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.620
in history.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.730
And we had to go
into three banks--

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.890
not only one-- and all
surveillance authorities

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:38.200
involved with oversight
of the financial sector.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.840
In addition, a special
request from Parliament

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.539
was to investigate
the cross-ownership

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:47.390
of Icelandic firms,
and I think there,

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.630
the biggest contribution to the
rest of the world of finance

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.510
lies.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.810
This analysis into
the cross-ownership

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.290
of Icelandic firms.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.540
Now, we were 48 people.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.290
We're, again, 330,000
people living in Iceland,

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.960
and it was quite
remarkable that we

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.450
were able to find people who
were not conflicted in any way.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:18.020
Many of them had been
living here in the States.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:24.900
Most of them had done
research, were PhDs from here

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.702
in the States-- Yale,
Stanford, and elsewhere.

00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:33.150
So basically, with
all this data,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:41.470
we collected data from the
entire financial market,

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.570
funding of the banks, all
loan portfolios of the banks,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:50.450
so every single loan,
including Visa statements,

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:57.620
the salary data, and also, what
I'm particularly proud of-- we

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.320
gathered data from
the stock market,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.880
and down to basically
individual investors

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.650
on both sides of
the trade-- so this

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.570
is a high-frequency dataset.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.610
In addition to the data I
mentioned before, we also

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.320
received the entire registry
of enterprises in Iceland,

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.110
and that was essential
to be able to drill down

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.600
the cross-ownership of firms.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:34.510
Now, just for the
sake of comparison,

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.050
the cost of the
investigation-- you

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.120
can find the whole
report on this.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.260
There are selected chapters
translated in English.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.720
2,400 pages, 800
pages supplement

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.270
online-- it took us 15
months, and the cost

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.340
was $2.5 million US.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:59.510
Now, the examiner report on
the fall of Lehman Brothers

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.560
is also available online.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.990
It is 2,200 pages.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.140
It took them 15
months to get it done.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.800
The cost was $38
million-plus US.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.097
So you can see that
you can get experts

00:11:14.097 --> 00:11:15.180
from Iceland on the cheap.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.680
Now, to start answering
the questions I proposed

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.520
in the beginning--
how did this happen?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.480
At the early start,
funding was easy,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.980
and basically the bankers went
into the European medium-term

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:40.290
note market, and received
about 35 billion euros'

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.640
worth of bond issues.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.650
AUDIENCE: Sorry, the
European what market?

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.390
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: The European
medium-term note market.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:53.620
That is a standardized,
bond-issuance program.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:12:00.410
So you see here that
the columns here

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:04.430
show that the
European market had

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:08.470
a big appetite for the
Icelandic bonds in 2005.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.810
It dropped somewhat
in 2006, and you

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.860
see what opened up-- that was
the US medium-term note market.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.760
It opened up for
the Icelandic banks,

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.170
simply because of this
very nice feature.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.840
They had a stellar credit
rating that was largely

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.170
inherited by the Icelandic
state, which was virtually

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.920
debt-free at the time,
but they were also

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.570
willing to pay
high interest rates

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.400
at the level of other
emerging-market institutions

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.090
a with lower credit rating.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:44.010
Now, it was as if they didn't
really think this through.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.045
The appetite for issuing
bonds was enormous,

00:12:47.045 --> 00:12:52.610
but they were bond issues for
three- to five-year maturity,

00:12:52.610 --> 00:13:00.090
and in fact, the
first big payment

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:04.420
was too big for
them to deliver on.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.350
So in October 2008,
Glitnir bank went

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.180
to the Central Bank of
Iceland, and basically said

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.980
that they wouldn't be
able to meet this payment,

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.170
and asked for of a loan of
last resort, and from then on,

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.740
things started to
unravel quickly.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.700
Now, the terms were
good in the beginning,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.100
as credit rating went
through the roof.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.180
In 2007, they received
the highest grade,

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:38.020
top of the class, triple-A
rating from Moody's, which

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.530
Moody's corrected in
a couple of months.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:47.520
Moody's thought that these banks
were simply too big to fail,

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:55.850
and would be bailed out in
whichever circumstances,

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.610
but failed to recognize
that the banks had already

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.980
exceeded the GDP, where
everything we produce

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.450
in Iceland 10 times,
so we would never

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.940
be able to bail out those banks.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.660
Now, as you see here, it's
a nice-- here at Google,

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.720
the first thing you do
is to plot your data--

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.120
and here you see Kaupthing
five-year bond issues.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.500
At the beginning, they are
issuing 1 billion euros.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:29.100
At the time, at a rate around
20, 20 to 30, and it rapidly

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.410
grows.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.770
Here are some peculiar outliers.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:38.340
Somebody is accepting much
lower rate than the market is.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:44.520
Now, we did receive our warning.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.170
In 2006, a market
analyst started

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:52.750
to point out that this
rapid growth of the balance

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.100
sheets of the banks
was unsustainable,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.520
and, well, primarily,
Danske Bank

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.010
came up with this very nice
term for it-- the geysir crisis.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.040
And it fitted this
episode very well,

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.630
because the CDS spreads--
the Credit Default

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:14.860
Spreads-- they kind of blew
up, but settled down quickly

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.810
again at a lower level.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:23.380
But that did not measure up to
what was to happen later on,

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.050
when the big, blue
mountain blew up,

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:32.680
and we had CDS spreads going
through the 1,000 mark.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:37.400
Both Icelandic bankers
and officials alike

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.740
dismissed this market
signal completely,

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.730
and they claimed
that the CDS market

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.900
was marked by
collusion, ignorance--

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.660
it was a thin market,
and so on, and so forth.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.020
And it is just as if
they didn't really

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.590
know what they
were talking about,

00:15:55.590 --> 00:16:01.680
or they didn't really look,
because when the banks failed,

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.270
there were $70 billion
US outstanding CDS

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.150
contracts on those three banks.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.670
And again, comparing to Lehman,
outstanding CDS contracts

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.410
on Lehman were
$72 billion, so it

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:21.444
was, by no means, a liquid
market, in that sense.

00:16:21.444 --> 00:16:23.110
Of course, it's a
market with insurance,

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:27.640
so it's not going to behave
like stock markets, right?

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:35.210
Now, being faced with such
a high cost of funding,

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:41.990
the banks simply had to turn
elsewhere to refund the banks,

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.720
and where did they go?

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.530
They went into two directions.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.480
One was to go to the supremely
informed central banks,

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:56.500
and they managed to borrow the
equivalent of 9 billion euros

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.330
at the very height.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.200
Again, comparing to the
financial rescue package

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.440
that Iceland received from the
IMF and the rest of Scandinavia

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:13.170
was about 3.5 billion euros, so
a significant amount of money

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.819
they borrowed from
the central banks.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:19.079
And how did they
manage to do that?

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:25.310
Well, they backed it with
bank bonds, to large degree.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:28.170
Here you can see the
collateralized lending

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.990
from the Central
Bank of Iceland.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.340
This is denominated in ISK,
so you can see basically

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:39.510
how dependent they are of this
short-term, fine-tuning funding

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.410
facility from the central bank,
so for three years, they're

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:46.640
completely dependent here on
the $100 billion-- at the time,

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.540
was roughly half of the
budget of the Icelandic state.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.183
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:51.183 --> 00:17:52.266
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Say again?

00:17:52.266 --> 00:17:54.099
AUDIENCE: What's the
conversion [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:54.099 --> 00:17:57.990
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Roughly 100.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:04.730
Now, they backed it with
government-secured bonds,

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:09.800
but also with fellow bank
bonds, and that they did

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.440
at an increasing rate.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.540
The central bank
acknowledged that

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.070
this collateralized lending
was getting excessive,

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:25.900
so they tried to stem the
funding to three banks,

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.310
but the bankers really
didn't stop at that,

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.960
so they asked a rival,
small, cooperative bank

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.300
to aid them in the process of
virtually printing money out

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.220
of the Icelandic Central Bank.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.090
So what they did was they
issued new bonds, fresh bonds.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:46.510
That's a certain interest
term, and then they

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.480
turned to the rival bank, which
received the bank bonds, which

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.490
then, again, turned to the
Central Bank of Iceland

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:59.050
to get liquidity out the
Central Bank of Iceland.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:02.800
And the bankers reported it
to the Special Investigation

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.990
Commission that this was a
stunt that they played, and had

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.320
learned about from other
European bankers, which

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.480
is a little bit
worrying, obviously.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:20.030
Now, they did try to play the
same trick on the European

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.070
Central Bank.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:30.270
They placed bonds as
collateral against the loans

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.370
from the European
Central Bank, but you

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.950
see how they pick
up on it in May,

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:42.110
and the story goes
that the ECB basically

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:46.310
directed their demands towards
the governors of the Central

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.430
Bank of Iceland to have
the bankers take this out,

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.260
realizing that they
were swapping bonds.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:57.240
There was no original investor
backing them at the outset,

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.850
and after awhile, they basically
disappeared from the books

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.080
as collaterals of the ECB.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:11.230
Now, what they did,
though, and the amounts

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:17.110
were quite steep-- 4.5
billion euros they received

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.440
at the very top from the
European Central Bank--

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.200
so after having been asked to
take out the Icelandic bank

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.090
bonds, well, they replaced
them with CLOs and CDOs

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:33.580
that had ISK assets among them.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.920
So collateral in ISK,
in Icelandic krona,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.500
against the loan in euros is
not a good collateral at all,

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.150
so there's a whole
story about that.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:48.080
And the Icelandic
Central Bank, in fact,

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.270
bought these CLOs from
the European Central Bank

00:20:52.270 --> 00:21:00.070
in the year 2010, and
the European Central Bank

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:04.590
reported that it did
not lose anything

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:09.200
on the deals with
the Icelandic banks.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.135
That was not the same story
with the Icelandic central bank,

00:21:12.135 --> 00:21:17.080
which virtually became bankrupt,
as a result of receiving

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.100
collaterals that
they couldn't collect

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.490
after the banks had gone over.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.370
Back to the growth, and I know
I'm cheating here a little bit.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.580
I am showing you
here nominal growth,

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:37.850
but it was reported-- nominal
growth, 20-fold in seven years.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:42.050
So prior to getting involved
with the Special Investigation

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.520
Commission, I was working for
the IMF, where we were studying

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.650
rapid credit growth,
and I can tell you

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:53.790
that it's impossible
to find data

00:21:53.790 --> 00:22:01.030
that would show you larger
growth of any banking sector.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:07.980
Now, obviously, when you
see banks grow this fast,

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.880
some people get worried.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.770
They know that
institutional structure,

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:17.330
or an institutional
capacity, does not really

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.760
support this growth.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:24.900
People cannot extend
credit at this fast a pace,

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:29.640
and ensuring that all relevant
documents have been collected,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.055
and the credit scoring
has been proper.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.380
So the bankers
basically pointed out,

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.350
after receiving this
criticism, that they

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.890
were growing too fast.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.030
Well, we are diversifying.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.290
We are getting
outside of Iceland,

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:55.440
acquiring new institutions,
new banks, new endeavors.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.940
But when we looked at this, and
tried to verify this statement,

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:05.160
we saw that not only was the
acquisition growth large,

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:10.160
but the organic growth was also
quite large-- another world

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.650
record, basically.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:16.859
We saw the banks
grow 50%, 60%, 35%.

00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:17.650
This is phenomenal.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:27.100
So it surely was a strain on the
institutional infrastructure.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.910
Now, then you could
ask yourself, again

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.850
with the 330,000 people,
all of this money coming in,

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.250
what did they do with the money?

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.890
The Commission
basically was able to,

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:50.570
although the data that was a
little bit difficult there--

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.390
background variables
weren't properly collected--

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.560
but there are features in
the identification number,

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.770
or social security
number in Iceland,

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.860
that aided us in
categorizing the loans that

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.740
had been extended.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.300
And we found out that
about 60% of the loan books

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:12.280
were to foreign entities--
so implying diversification--

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:19.460
and to holding
companies in 2007.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.730
But after good cooperation
with Luxembourgian authorities,

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.410
because we didn't, obviously,
have the same data privileges

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:33.220
in the UK or Luxembourg
or elsewhere,

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.440
where the Icelandic
banks had operations.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:43.370
We did not have any access to
data from the subsidiaries.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.560
The Luxembourgian
authorities supplied us

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.477
with two data points,
where we could

00:24:49.477 --> 00:24:53.140
see that the maturity of the
loan books of the subsidiaries

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:59.490
were also somehow
connected to ISK risk,

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:05.320
so dismissing this statement
that the growth was primarily

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:10.100
outside of the country, and at
the hands of diversification.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:15.340
Now, back to that
small population,

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:19.190
you've got to wonder how
is it possible to extend

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:24.730
such an amount of credit, given
the legal constraint that one

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:28.950
banking institution can
only extend about 25%

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:35.290
of its equity base towards
a group of related parties?

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:41.270
Now, we think we
know how you do that,

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:45.520
and this is basically
how you do that.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.680
This is the cross-ownership
of firms in Iceland.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.890
The red dots
represent each firm,

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:56.170
and there are some ownership
connections to the next dot,

00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:03.590
but these are only large firms
in Iceland, so let's say,

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:08.330
500 million ISK is $5
million US, roughly,

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.930
is the balance sheet of
each and every firm here.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.170
You see where the nodes lead?

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:19.470
These nodes are the
banks themselves,

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.600
so this is the
interconnectedness

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.560
of the Icelandic economy
before the collapse.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:34.500
Then our task was to assess
who are the related parties,

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.070
according to the
definition of the law?

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.880
And using an algorithm
and this network analysis,

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.870
we were able to assess,
or rather come up

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:49.260
with an unbiased methodology,
to actually find out

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.930
who were connected, and here you
see just two random examples.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:58.610
And what was also a
little bit scary to see

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:02.080
is the circular
events that you see.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.910
Here is a firm A that
owns firm B that owns firm

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:09.490
C that owns firm A. So
under these circumstances,

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:14.810
virtually no equity, no
skin, is put in the game.

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:22.160
So one of the lessons is
that if we don't properly

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.310
analyze ownership
or ownership ties

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.840
or interconnectedness
in our system,

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:36.305
we know that agents that play
this game simply have-- the sky

00:27:36.305 --> 00:27:40.540
is the limit, so there's really
no limit to how much risk

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.750
they're willing to take,
because they are not

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:46.600
risking their own money at all.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:52.230
Now, after we had identified
the related parties,

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.410
we then merged them
to the portfolios

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:58.730
of the banks-- the loan
portfolios-- and lo and behold,

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:02.470
we found out that the borrowers
were, to a large extent,

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.030
the owners of the banks.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:09.810
It varied a little bit
in levels how much access

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.710
they had to their bank, but
here, this particular group,

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:19.730
Baugur Group, received the
equivalent of about 80%

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:26.960
of the equity base
of Glitnir, where

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.200
they were controlling
shareholders.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.830
So here you see the
legal limit is 25.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.240
They exceeded it
throughout the time.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.550
Now, here's their
business partner,

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.690
who also gained a
controlling stake at the bank

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:41.570
at some point.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.106
Somebody wants to venture
a guess when that happened?

00:28:44.106 --> 00:28:44.960
AUDIENCE: 2007.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:51.810
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: So yeah, it's
right here, in June 2007.

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:56.950
So as I say, it was the same
pattern in all three banks.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:01.120
Here Bjorgolfur
Thor Bjorgolfsson,

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.080
one of the controlling
stakeholders,

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:08.700
exceeded the 25% threshold
throughout the four-year period

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:12.890
we had data for.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.060
And the same goes for Exista,
controlling stakeholder

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.830
in Kaupthing bank, again,
dancing along the line

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.510
throughout the period.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:25.350
Now, obviously the
loan portfolios

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:30.490
were marked by excessive
risk, and the next task

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.900
was to see the payment
structure of these loans,

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.480
and that was also quite
shocking to discover

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.980
that not only had
they been extended

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:43.550
to holding companies that
were tied to the owners

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.970
to a large degree,
but also they were not

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.980
paying anything off the loans.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.000
They were not paying
interest rates,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.960
and they were not paying
off any of the loan

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.350
during the lifetime of
the loan, so bullet loans

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:59.720
became the largest
share of the portfolios.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.920
Then you wonder, what
type of collateral

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.570
are these borrowers
putting forward?

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:08.570
And that really matters.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.720
Because we had this beautiful
data privilege and this dataset

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.870
from the stock market, and we
had also access to the bank,

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:27.060
so we could see what was
inside of the custodian

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.150
accounts of the banks, because
that's an old trick in the book

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.660
to have your bank hold the
stocks that you are pledged,

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:37.370
so your ownership is
not disclosed at all.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.730
So what did they pledge?

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.920
Basically, to a large
degree, the banks

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.930
had received a
collateral in the form

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.330
of listed stocks in Iceland.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:59.410
There is a caveat here, because
the data quality on collateral

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:03.090
was incredibly poor,
so this was really

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:09.830
the only comprehensive
data that we could receive,

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.370
in terms of collateral.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.910
So this is a little bit
misrepresentative here,

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:18.350
but still we saw
that, for example,

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.650
FL Group was an investment
boutique, or investment

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:25.700
closed-end fund, in
fact, and about 70%

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.610
of all outstanding
shares in this firm

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:32.660
were pledged into
the banking sector.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:45.250
To our horror, though, we saw
that about 40% of Kaupthing

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:49.250
was pledged into Kaupthing
as collateral, or as treasury

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.530
stocks.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.900
Now, that is illegal.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.230
You are only allowed,
according to Icelandic law,

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:58.110
to hold 10% of treasury stocks.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:02.860
This is illegal in the States.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.370
At least if you do
have treasury stocks,

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:08.050
you need to deduct them
from your equity base.

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:13.820
It's money that hasn't
been paid into the firm,

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.510
or equity that hasn't
been paid into the firm.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.500
The following question,
after having discovered this,

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.340
we had to ask ourselves, how
did they behave in the stock

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.540
market, then, I mean,
now that they were

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.930
dependent on collaterals
from the stock market?

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:35.920
And lo and behold, we saw a
certain pattern there as well.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:41.880
Here you see Kaupthing
trading in own shares,

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:47.450
and Kaupthing is buying above
0, and they are selling below 0,

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:49.320
and the blue line
here represents

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:56.900
the price of the share price
of the Kaupthing stocks.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.040
And you immediately-- it
jumps out of the picture

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.220
that this is not
symmetric, so they

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.790
are buying close to
60% of the volume.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:09.240
Of all trades in
Kaupthing, they are

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.337
on the buying side
at the very end,

00:33:11.337 --> 00:33:13.170
but what are they doing
in terms of selling?

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.570
They're not selling anything.

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:19.910
So what were they then doing?

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.390
What type of business was this?

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:25.345
What we figured out was
that they were primarily--

00:33:25.345 --> 00:33:28.640
you see the blue columns
here-- they are above 0,

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.500
so they are being bought
on the stock exchange,

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.770
but Kaupthing is selling
over the counter.

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:42.860
Now, one of my favorite pictures
in the whole 2,400 pages

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.080
is right here.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.770
It represents the level of
leverage in the Icelandic stock

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.140
exchange.

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.680
It's a delta, so how
much are we increasing,

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:59.050
in terms of taking collateral
in the form of listed shares?

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:02.320
And as long as you are receiving
more and more collateral,

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.280
or you're accepting
more and more collateral

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.060
in the form of stocks they
are buying on the margin

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.655
more and more, you see
that the price is rising.

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:16.480
The red line there
leveling out--

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:21.370
as soon as you stop accepting
listed shares as collateral,

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:23.440
the price drops like a stone.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:28.184
So this is virtually a picture
of an asset price bubble.

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.430
AUDIENCE: Why were they
buying [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:44.231 --> 00:34:45.730
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Why
were they buying

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:47.920
all these shares in themselves?

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:53.170
Basically they had become quite
dependent on the share price,

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.340
and we will see it on
the next slide, which

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.180
added to their demise,
is that the largest

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.790
controlling
stakeholders had also

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:04.210
borrowed money from the big
investment houses in the US--

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.600
so Citigroup, Morgan
Stanley, and those--

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.880
and they had pledged
the Icelandic stocks

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.450
in the Icelandic
banks as collateral

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.940
against these
international loans.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:20.190
Now, after the stock market
had started to decline,

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:23.210
the Americans basically
called on the margin,

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:26.520
and what the bankers in
Iceland decided then-- well,

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.330
we can't allow this to
happen, because they

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.720
will go into the market,
and sell those shares,

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.210
and what will happen with
our pool of collaterals?

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.580
It will decline.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:38.750
So they decide to chip in,
and pay the margin calls,

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:42.580
and refund those shares that
were in themselves, accepting

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.500
their own shares as collateral.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:48.250
So basically, a year
before the banks

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.430
finally collapsed,
they had become

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:53.240
so dependent on their
own stock prices

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.230
that they decide
to bat for life,

00:35:56.230 --> 00:36:03.900
and take over this collateral
that is no collateral,

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.090
if they themselves go under.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.390
Which then, again, this
would have been fine

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:15.890
if they had deducted the
shares that they took

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:18.800
as collaterals from
the equity base,

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.300
but they forgot about that.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.770
So if we take that
into account--

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:28.620
and here you see we only
take that into account--

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.670
the capital adequacy
ratio that they reported

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:35.960
was misreported basically,
and here you see Glitnir.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.860
It's, in fact, close to
the legal limit, which

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:45.900
is 8%, a year before
the bank collapsed.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.940
For Landsbanki, it had already
gone below the 8% limit,

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.420
so there the Financial
Supervisory Authority

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:59.770
should have tapped in and
taken over the operations.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:04.390
And if you count
cross-financing--

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:06.650
financing of the
rivals-- in fact,

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:12.887
22% of the equity is basically
funded this way, and 36%, 33%,

00:37:12.887 --> 00:37:18.360
2008, so one third of the
equity was basically not there,

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.070
and in my mind, that is
falsification of equity,

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:24.620
but the report goes the route
that claiming that this is weak

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:30.010
equity that cannot be drawn
on in the case of bankruptcy.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:38.560
Now, you've got to start
wondering why people do this,

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:43.200
and the short answer
is, they became rich.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.710
Here you see the
incentive schemes

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.370
pushed for excessive
risk taking,

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:53.630
and just as a very
small evidence

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:59.330
of that is that here you see
the total share of base salary,

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:04.640
of total pay, in
2004 in Landsbanki.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:08.200
Here's the 99th percentile,
so the CEO is placed here,

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:12.900
and the key personnel--
they received about 40%

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.530
in base salary in 2004.

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:22.380
In 2007, it's below
10%, so economists--

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:26.160
we have sympathy towards the
decision-making process that

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.620
happens there.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:32.070
One, if you're not going to meet
your bonus target, you going

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.180
to reduce your
consumption by 90%?

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.810
No, there's is a
very strong incentive

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:42.830
to start manipulating
a little bit,

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.510
or extending the
evergreening loans,

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:47.010
and so on, and so forth--
rolling over loans,

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:51.549
so that the picture looks a bit
more rosy to meet the targets,

00:38:51.549 --> 00:38:52.965
and that is exactly
what happened.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.130
There's enough material for a
separate talk on the incentive

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:05.100
schemes themselves, but in
short, whether intentional

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:09.650
or not, the management
of the banks

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:13.530
used staff as vehicles
to falsify equity.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.810
In Landsbanki, for
example, stock options

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:23.610
were issued one day, not as
a bargaining tool in salary

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:26.800
negotiations, but
one day, we have

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.710
a record within Landsbanki,
where staffers were called up,

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:34.800
and said, hey, you've
got an option grant now.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.860
Please come up and sign.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:47.730
And the management decided
to hatch those options,

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:53.040
so basically in the beginning,
they lent money into SPVs

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.440
in Cayman Islands and
offshore, lent money

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:02.690
to have the SPV go into the
market to buy the stocks,

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:06.410
and hold them until
the options were vested

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:08.800
or they were exercised.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:14.500
Now, this is a rather unusual
and unnecessary hatch.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.290
As I say, we can
go into depth here,

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:22.050
but in short, obviously
the management

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:24.350
decides on the timing on
when to go into the market

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:27.520
and buy those shares, and
what happens when you inject

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:32.930
into the market billions of ISK
buying stocks in Landsbanki?

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:35.110
Well, the price will
go up, of course,

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.940
and the options will be
in the money immediately.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:42.070
Kaupthing started out with this,
but they faded out their option

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:47.380
program, and instead they
had their staff borrow money

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.950
from the bank to go themselves
into the stock market,

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.220
and buy the shares.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:59.450
The shares were a collateral
in that loan deal,

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:04.640
and therefore should have been
deducted from the equity base.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:09.095
Now, back to the funding side.

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:15.180
The banks were experiencing
incredibly high prices

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:18.880
on funding, or terms,
in the bond markets,

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.930
so apart from going
to central banks,

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:25.960
they went into the streets
of London and Amsterdam

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:31.127
to get money through
deposit collection,

00:41:31.127 --> 00:41:33.210
and here you can see the
total debt of Landsbanki.

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:34.570
It changes rapidly.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:39.340
The loans and deposits
become the largest share

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.010
of the funding structure.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:47.930
Now, as it is very risky to
extend credit out rapidly,

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:52.440
it is also very risky to
collect deposits very rapidly,

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.330
and they tend to
be not so loyal.

00:41:55.330 --> 00:42:00.620
And how were they ever able
to attract all these 300,000

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:04.010
depositors in the UK in
less than six months?

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.830
They basically offered
the highest rate.

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:14.570
And you're not supposed to
scrutinize this regression

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:15.070
analysis.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:18.430
This is very crude, and you
see that there is not very much

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:23.130
variation here, but
basically we saw

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:28.970
that if Landsbanki reached the
first place, as highest deposit

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:34.610
rates-- they attracted about
18 million, on average, a week

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:40.490
into the accounts, but if it
dropped down to fifth place,

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:46.810
they lost 16 million, so
these were not very sticky.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.090
It's very volatile
funding, and here

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:52.770
is a picture of basically outrun
on the bank that happened here

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.950
in the early of 2008.

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:57.910
There's a whole
story behind that,

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:00.332
but I will leave my
book to tell you.

00:43:00.332 --> 00:43:02.405
AUDIENCE: Are they able
to pay those high rates

00:43:02.405 --> 00:43:04.357
by attracting future customers?

00:43:04.357 --> 00:43:06.190
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: So the
question is, are they

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:07.990
able to pay those high rates?

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:11.300
Well, at the end of the
day, no, of course not.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.210
They were run upon.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:19.610
Well, as they collecting, they
paid the interest rates, yes,

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:22.959
but it was not sustainable
model, as it turned out.

00:43:22.959 --> 00:43:25.500
AUDIENCE: So is it sort of like
a pyramid-scheme thing, where

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:25.998
by offering higher
rates, we'll get

00:43:25.998 --> 00:43:27.581
a lot of [INAUDIBLE]
customers, and we

00:43:27.581 --> 00:43:30.310
can use [INAUDIBLE] deposits,
and pay the high rate?

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.060
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:33.480
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: So is it
like a Ponzi scheme, where

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:40.350
you are giving up high rates
as you have the program open,

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:41.830
and then you just disappear?

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:45.130
Yeah, well, it was not
intended like that,

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.990
but that is the effect of it.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:58.360
Now, as you can see here, here's
a random Icesave in April 2008,

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:02.190
and at the time, the
management of Landsbanki

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.790
reported it to the
Central Bank of Iceland

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:07.280
that with this
outflow, they would

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.920
survive for six more days.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:15.260
The Icelandic governors of
the Central Bank of Iceland

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.550
then reported that
to the government,

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:26.570
to the prime minister
and the foreign minister,

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:32.740
and there was really no
reaction to this news.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.530
Icesave has been the
largest foreign dispute

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:38.710
Iceland has had
since the Cod Wars,

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:45.420
and this is an ongoing saga,
and hasn't been fully resolved,

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:52.520
although the EFTA Court ruled on
whether the Icelandic state was

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:57.050
liable for the deposits, or
should pay out the deposit

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:00.310
insurance amount to
the foreign depositors.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:08.330
The Court ruled in
favor of Iceland

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:13.690
basically, so we have figured
out where the liability lies

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:17.533
with a state or with
an insurance fund that

00:45:17.533 --> 00:45:19.480
has been set up, and,
in fact, in this case,

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:23.310
the insurance fund is liable.

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:33.440
Now, as Lehman Brothers
failed, obviously that

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.590
proved to be an
accelerator, in terms

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:39.730
of deciding the fates
of the Icelandic banks.

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:42.590
After the collapse of
Lehman, the collaterals

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:48.180
that had been pledged
against loans from the ECB

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:53.110
fell sharply, so the ECB
started to call on the margin.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:46:01.320
Also, the depositors in
the UK and the Netherlands

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.910
became uneasy, so they started
to withdraw their funds

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:09.880
from the accounts, and
essentially, Landsbanki

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:21.350
was run upon, and since they had
collected the Icesave deposits

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:25.240
into a branch, which was
under the supervision

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.630
of the Icelandic Financial
Supervisory Authority,

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:33.830
the Brits had very
little means to step in.

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:37.700
They knew that Landsbanki
was not meeting its liquidity

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:41.220
requirements, because the
money was just rolling out,

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:45.070
so they they found
no other option

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:51.440
except for intervening
through a legal act that

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.160
has become very
controversial in Iceland--

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.400
the so-called Terrorist
Act, whose name is,

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:02.550
in fact, Anti-Terrorism, Crime,
and Security Act of 2001.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:08.630
So the deposits of Landsbanki
were moved out of Landsbanki,

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:14.770
and basically the fate of the
bank was therefore decided,

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:18.620
or they had met their
fate, let's say.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:26.710
But we know now that the
banks had little chance,

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:29.070
both because they were
so interconnected,

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:35.990
and they had not enough
equity as a buffer

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:41.870
to see any of their
assets go down in value.

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:49.921
Now, basically Kaupthing met
the same fate a day later.

00:47:49.921 --> 00:47:51.670
The story is a little
bit different there,

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:55.050
because Kaupthing adds, where
they were collecting deposits

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:58.240
from the UK residents
and elsewhere, was

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.670
done through a subsidiary.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:05.930
And this is one of the lessons
of the Icelandic episode

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:11.520
is the difference between
a subsidiary and branch,

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:15.550
and who is responsible for
the financial oversight.

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:20.130
Now, the Brits were responsible
for the oversight in this case,

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.760
and after Northern Rock
had failed-- first bank

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.660
in 150 years or so
to fail in the UK--

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:33.420
the supervisory authority became
quite worried that there might

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.900
be other vulnerabilities
in their system,

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.430
and what they
spotted immediately

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:39.700
were the Icelandic banks.

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:47.380
And basically the Deposit
Insurance Fund was underfunded,

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.740
so the British
depositors acknowledged

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:54.040
that in case of failure,
it would be difficult

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.840
for them to reclaim the money.

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.020
So in all of the
circumstances-- and obviously,

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.370
bear in mind that
Lehman had just

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:07.220
failed-- the British had seen
some movement of funds out

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:13.220
of the UK over to
the US just prior

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:17.640
to the collapse of Lehman, the
British authorities basically

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.220
set up a very stringent
liquidity rule

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.710
against Kaupthing saying,
95% of those deposits

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:27.190
that you are collecting
through Kaupthing Edge--

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:29.750
we need you to put
them into liquid funds,

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:36.150
into treasuries and papers that
can be converted into cash very

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:38.400
quickly.

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:44.250
So with this rule, the
Kaupthing management

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:47.450
should not have been able to
use it for their own good,

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:49.130
but, in fact, they
managed to trick

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:51.880
the financial supervisory
authority in the UK

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.800
for awhile, because they
engaged in a liquidity

00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.870
swap between the parent
company and the subsidiary.

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:04.400
So in essence, they counted
the money two or three times,

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.820
so the first time around, it
was counted as liquid money.

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:11.030
The second time
around it was just

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:14.760
their funds, which they could
do whatever with, and including

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.570
sending it up to Iceland
for the parent company

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:20.180
to meet their margins,
or pay off their bonds,

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:23.730
and so on, and so forth, and
that is exactly what happened.

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:31.250
Now, on top of this, so
there were 1.1 billion pounds

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.040
sterling engaged
in this, so missing

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.870
from the liquidity
pool of Kaupthing.

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:41.240
But on top of that,
the collateral

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:46.400
that they had pledged to
the subsidiary for lending

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.210
from the daughter company
declined in value,

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:54.380
but the subsidiary
was irrespectively

00:50:54.380 --> 00:51:01.540
willing to extend the credit
lines by 500 million pounds,

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.660
without taking any
collateral, and this

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:08.670
the British interpreted
as siphoning money up

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:12.450
through the chain of firms,
and up to the parent company.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:21.200
And as a result, having waited
for the management of Kaupthing

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.790
to react, the British
authorities deemed

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:29.630
it necessary to take over
the Kaupthing Edge deposits

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:33.420
and move them into ING,
and withdraw the bank

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.840
license from the
[INAUDIBLE] of KSF--

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:42.370
so a similar fate,
slightly different story.

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:49.520
Back to Iceland, the debt-free
state-- in early 2008,

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.740
suggestions were being made
to the Icelandic authorities

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:57.140
that it should turn
to the IMF for help.

00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:59.520
That was after the
Central Bank of Iceland

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.580
had tried to get credit
or foreign-exchange

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:06.190
swaps with central
banks in Europe,

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:08.940
and even here in
America, without success.

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:12.910
And that is a signal
that is fairly decisive--

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:16.780
a debt-free state unable
to get any credit anywhere.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:20.860
That should tell you
something about the situation.

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:25.550
The only takers in
the FX swap market

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:27.770
were the Scandinavian
central banks,

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:33.620
who, in turn, put forward very
strict conditions, in exchange

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.680
for the money swapped.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:43.000
And the conditions were at the
microeconomic management level,

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:53.180
such as, the centrally
negotiated wages cannot

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:56.060
increase in real terms.

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:59.880
The Icelandic state cannot take
on any further debt whatsoever,

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:08.930
so this is very invasive type
of debt covenance, if you will.

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:13.550
And as it turned out, very
few people knew about it

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:17.620
in Iceland, and the prime
minister did not even

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.490
disclose this information
to the entire cabinet,

00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:27.940
and as a result, he got
indicted and brought

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:32.400
before the special court in
Iceland that rules on breaches

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.630
on the part of ministers
in Iceland-- Landsdomur,

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:35.280
it's called.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.600
So for the first time in 100
years' history of that court,

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.230
the case was
brought against him.

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:47.340
Now, now you know how all this
happened, and why it happened.

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:49.300
So the next question
is, why didn't anybody

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.350
stop this development?

00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:57.270
And the short answer is, it was
too rapid of a credit growth,

00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:04.700
and there were too few
people to handle all of this,

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:09.610
or rather, the main
cause here is, basically

00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:11.590
the politicians
didn't acknowledge

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:15.470
the need for strong supervision.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:19.130
If you're going to build your
economic system on the pillars

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:21.140
of a financial
institution's being one

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.950
of the main industries
of the economy,

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:30.530
well, you need to have
something to back it up,

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:35.310
or strong oversight, and there,
the policymakers basically

00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:37.530
failed in Iceland.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:41.160
So we had the Financial
Supervisory Authorities

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.440
doing financial
oversight of something

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:48.920
that was 10 times the GDP of
Iceland with only 36 employees.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:52.860
And for a trained
statistician, such as myself,

00:54:52.860 --> 00:55:01.210
it was a shock to observe
that no proper data-analysis

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:03.590
equipment were used.

00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:08.330
Data was gathered in
Excel sheets of 47 sheets

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:11.960
from each and every
institution-- hundreds

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.650
of small and large financial
institutions in Iceland,

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:18.280
and this was the data
archiving and collection,

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:21.200
so it's impossible
to have an oversight

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.480
under these circumstances.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:29.550
So Financial Supervisory
Authorities, in short, there

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:32.160
were lack of experience
and incompetence,

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.965
lack of proper IT systems.

00:55:33.965 --> 00:55:39.830
Tool and processes for data
analysis weren't in place.

00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:41.710
There was lack of
authority and follow-up.

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:45.379
Cases were kept too
informal for too long.

00:55:45.379 --> 00:55:46.920
Violations of the
law went unnoticed,

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.120
and law was not enforced.

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:54.470
Now, the Central Bank of Iceland
did have some more insight

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:59.820
into the risk, and
also a legal obligation

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.360
to ensure financial
stability in the country.

00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:10.200
It, however, never formally
or informally conveyed it

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:14.900
to the government what needed
to be done to avert the risk,

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:18.650
and had it thought that they
lacked the legal means to do

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:24.520
so, they did not report that
either to the government.

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:29.690
Now, there were a host of
tools in the policy toolbox

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:34.250
that could have been used,
but were, in fact, not.

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:40.140
So one of the lessons-- and
he put it very nicely out,

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:43.880
Thorarinn Petursson, senior
economist of Central Bank,

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.940
the state of affairs in
Iceland at the time--

00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:48.420
"I think there is a fundamental
misunderstanding of what

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:51.760
financial supervision is
all about here in Iceland.

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.090
Not only at the FME, Financial
Supervisory Authorities,

00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:56.991
but also the Central Bank.

00:56:56.991 --> 00:56:58.990
They thought that the
role of these institutions

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:01.000
was to follow upon whether
the letter of the law

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.330
was met by those
under supervision.

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:06.850
So you are watching an entire
financial system falling off

00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:09.400
a cliff, and as long as
you are following the law,

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.030
you are fine."

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:16.170
So one of the recommendations
of the Turner review in Britain,

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:18.650
which was issued
after their crisis,

00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:21.060
is that the regulatory
and supervisory coverage

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:24.995
should follow the principle
of economic substance, and not

00:57:24.995 --> 00:57:27.590
a legal form.

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:31.320
Just to inform you
of the losses that

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:35.440
were incurred after the
collapse, about five times

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.900
GDP was written off in
a matter of four or five

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:43.190
months after the
system collapsed,

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:48.380
and these delicate findings,
or the challenges that we were

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:51.560
faced in the beginning,
this special investigation

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:57.310
commission ruled that on
the mistakes or negligence

00:57:57.310 --> 00:58:00.280
by ministers and public
officials in the period

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.140
leading up to the
collapse of the banks,

00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.020
the SIC is in the
opinion that the Prime

00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:06.090
Minister, the
Minister of Finance,

00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:09.050
the Minister of Business
Affairs, Director

00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:12.930
General of the FME, governors
of the Central Bank of Iceland

00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:16.910
showed negligence within
the meaning of Article 1.1

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:21.300
of the law on the Special
Investigation Commission.

00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:24.550
And as I told you before,
the prime minister

00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:27.750
was found guilty on one count
out of four of negligence

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:30.310
by a special court, Landsdomur.

00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:33.140
Now, fraud or failure
on part of the bankers

00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:35.030
is still being decided.

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:38.710
Some of them have already
received a sentence

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:43.020
on a regional level
or a local court.

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.470
Management of Kaupthing
has been sentenced

00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:48.900
to three to five years in
prison for fraudulent lending

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:51.210
practices and
market manipulation.

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:52.670
They have appealed.

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:56.810
Cases are pending against the
Landsbanki management for fraud

00:58:56.810 --> 00:59:00.440
and market manipulation, and
Larus Welding, CEO of Glitnir,

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:05.120
was found guilty, but
acquitted by the Supreme Court.

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:08.220
Several other cases are
pending against him.

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:13.890
The special prosecutor had
over 200 cases in total.

00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:16.420
58 are currently
under investigation.

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:18.350
20 indictments--
15 already brought

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:20.480
to court-- and eight
cases have been

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.610
ruled upon against
46 individuals,

00:59:23.610 --> 00:59:27.490
so this is already exceeding
your legal efforts,

00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:32.180
or prosecutional efforts,
looking into savings and loans

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:34.580
crisis in the '80s.

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.130
Now, what can we learn?

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.990
My husband is a human
factors engineer,

00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:47.830
and he has taught me how the
human mind perceives things

00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:49.940
inadequately, and
one of the things

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:55.510
is that we seem not to be
able to sense acceleration.

00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:58.960
We all know the story when we
are going over the speed limit,

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.800
and we withdraw to
the legal limit,

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.960
we find that we are
not moving at all.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:09.850
Taking this into account,
you don't put anybody

01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:13.010
at the seat of the F-18, is it?

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:15.100
18, 19, 16?

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:21.390
Thank you-- unless he or she
has several thousand hours

01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:22.680
in the air.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:28.300
So banks are like
monstrous machines,

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.850
so you need people that
have the proper training

01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:36.270
and the proper insight, and also
at the realm of the Financial

01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:38.350
Supervisory Authorities.

01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:47.580
So that said, it
is very important

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:51.730
that, as you do here
so well in America,

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:56.550
acknowledging the efforts that
go into further education,

01:00:56.550 --> 01:01:00.860
and, yeah, that's
the aim-- to put

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:03.230
the right people
at the right spot.

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:07.950
But another lesson is
the importance of equity.

01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:11.840
These monstrous
institutions, the banks,

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.020
are running at the
very low-equity ratio,

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.190
so there's not much
room for their assets

01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:22.980
to move downwards at all.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:25.730
This is one thing-- I
mean, now in Iceland we

01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:30.570
have banks that are set
up, or have a funding

01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:35.660
mix of up to 25%
equity, and it's

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:45.130
just that incentives
become very risky,

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:49.560
let's say, or people
engage in risky activities,

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.160
and it all depends on how
they are incentivized.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.610
So if you have your own
money in an enterprise,

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:58.770
you behave very
differently from where

01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:05.410
you have no money of your
own in the operation.

01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:09.050
Another lesson is
that bankers need

01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:12.840
to understand that when they
are lending money in the holding

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:20.710
companies, they have a
claim on the residual claim.

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:24.560
So these structures that I
showed you should theoretically

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.930
not be possible to construct,
simply because if you take

01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:32.280
into account that
you, the bank, you

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.650
are lending the money
for the equity part,

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:38.060
you should price it accordingly,
so there should be no money

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:40.810
left on the table
for the constructors

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:41.840
of these structures.

01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:47.665
So pricing obviously
failed enormously

01:02:47.665 --> 01:02:51.370
in the Icelandic banks.

01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:54.620
Supervision should be built
on [INAUDIBLE] substance.

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:58.700
We should try to have our
legal framework set up in a way

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.860
that it supports
potential policies that

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:08.640
need to be adjusted quickly.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:14.100
The letter of the law is
obviously fairly sticky.

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:18.730
It's difficult to change
in a short period of time.

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:22.640
The medium-term
effects in Iceland--

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.720
we had massive market
manipulation on our hands.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.440
People were not following
the legal letter.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:33.680
They were evading the rules
and the law, so as a result,

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:38.920
we have a clear case where
the markets break down.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.530
They just disappear, and
that is what happened.

01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:44.690
The bond market was
virtually non-functioning.

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:47.010
Stock market
virtually disappeared.

01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:50.290
There was no currency
market right after the fall,

01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:53.654
so in de facto, we had
imposed capital controls

01:03:53.654 --> 01:03:55.320
right after the
collapse, because nobody

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.630
wanted to trade the
Icelandic krona.

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:00.680
So there are a lot
of small stories

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.880
to learn from,
obviously, but I think

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.050
if there's only one that
I can leave you with,

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:12.050
it is that we know how our
system is interconnected.

01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:13.983
It is a question
whether you know

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:16.690
how your system
is interconnected.

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:20.480
And now I am open for questions.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:26.300
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:27.766
So to answer your
question, which

01:04:27.766 --> 01:04:29.390
was along the lines
that, what happened

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:30.690
to the Icelandic people?

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:33.630
How many are unemployed,
and so on, and so forth.

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:37.310
The short answer is, we had
a spike in the unemployment

01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:41.270
rate reaching 8%, 9%.

01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:44.500
It has come down to
4%, roughly, now.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.680
So we have had a history of very
low unemployment in Iceland.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.350
I mean, most of us had
three or three or four jobs,

01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:57.020
like you saw on my
profile, but Iceland

01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:00.400
has been portrayed, like
here in the US media,

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.120
as a poster child of economic
recovery after the crisis.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.820
But I have to tell
you, unfortunately,

01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:10.950
that the judges haven't
ruled on it yet.

01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:13.840
We have still got the most
challenge on our hand,

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.510
and that is to get
rid of the capital

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:18.150
controls that were
installed right after.

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:20.730
So, for example, if you're
traveling abroad from Iceland,

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:26.600
you can only bring $3,000
or so for your rental car

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.300
and your hotel, and
so on, and so forth,

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.890
so it's being sanctioned.

01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:32.370
Currency is being sanctioned.

01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:38.430
So net foreign direct
investment is at a historic low.

01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:40.700
Investment, in
general, is very low,

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.560
so people are seeing
their wages have

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:46.520
been cut in half in real terms.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.020
Even nominal terms
have been lowered.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.810
Government officials,
for example,

01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:57.260
haven't seen a raise
in eight years,

01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:01.840
so this is a big chunk of
a person's life's work,

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:09.294
or of career, so we are
not part of the woods yet.

01:06:09.294 --> 01:06:10.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:12.910
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: They
were primarily the loans

01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:18.188
to holding companies that
were just foam, or they were--

01:06:18.188 --> 01:06:19.771
AUDIENCE: The holding
companies didn't

01:06:19.771 --> 01:06:20.580
want to be [INAUDIBLE], or what?

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.230
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Yeah, they did.

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:26.350
The majority of them held the
stocks of the banks themselves,

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:30.920
who became bankrupt, and then
you had all this domino effect.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:35.000
Most firms in Iceland have
become technically bankrupt.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.170
That has been the
most challenge that we

01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:40.550
have been faced with after
the crash is to reorganize

01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:44.440
and restructure the loan
portfolios of the banks,

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:50.435
because more than every
other loan of the portfolios

01:06:50.435 --> 01:06:54.160
of the banks were nonperforming.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:58.290
That's a very good question
on how we kept politics out

01:06:58.290 --> 01:07:01.520
of the reporting on the
failures of the banks.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.480
That's your question?

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.565
AUDIENCE: More or less.

01:07:03.565 --> 01:07:05.340
I mean, we can't do that here.

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.710
How did you do it there?

01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:10.950
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: I think that you
might see different reactions

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:12.680
on part of your
politicians if you

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.570
had your 97% of your
banking sector collapse.

01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:19.190
It's just such a severity
of the situation that

01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:23.160
did not allow for any scrutiny.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.890
I mean, you can
wonder about reasons

01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:26.670
why the politicians,
for example,

01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:29.340
extended this type
of data access.

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:32.240
I mean, this is unheard of
that the one government that

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.850
has failed so miserably in
their policy making actually

01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:39.390
brings on themselves
an investigation where

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:41.895
they can be exposed, and that
is exactly what happened.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.850
But you've got to applaud
this type of behavior

01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:49.190
on part of the politicians.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.180
We're a small society.

01:07:56.180 --> 01:08:00.340
We were a trusting bunch
before the collapse,

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:05.960
and one of the guests that
I had in the audience at one

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.120
of the financial
institutions pointed out

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.380
that you need a healthy dose
of mistrust in any system,

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:13.290
and that was lacking.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:15.830
The mistrust was not
enough, but now we

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:25.060
swung from the totally trusting
system over to a full mistrust.

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:29.970
So there was a lot of scrutiny
on part of the public.

01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:33.250
Obviously we had a pots
and pans revolution,

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:35.000
where people were
banging on pots and pans

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.840
in front of Parliament,
so that was not

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:43.490
much room for politicians
to try to cast sand

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:47.130
into the eyes of
the voting public.

01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:48.729
In terms of incentives,
the question

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:51.060
was, what type of
prisons do you have,

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:56.100
where people involved in this
sentence of guilty verdict--

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:59.290
where can they expect
themselves to end up?

01:08:59.290 --> 01:09:07.359
And one answer is, the length
of the sentences in Iceland

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:11.170
are very short, so
as it turns out,

01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:13.300
we have had one case
of insider trading

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:16.399
that has been ruled upon,
and the person involved

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:20.529
has gone to jail for
six months total.

01:09:20.529 --> 01:09:22.399
The sentence was two years.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:24.060
If you behave well
in the prison,

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.660
you can get your sentence
halved, and then you

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:33.270
can do community service for
half of the remaining part,

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:42.340
so in this particular
instance, the expected value

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:45.810
was positive, so--

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:47.810
AUDIENCE: And the conditions
themselves are bad?

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:49.060
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Oh, very nice.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.180
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:54.270
You need to be trained to
understand acceleration

01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:55.970
and growth and what it means.

01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:59.330
Lawyers, for example, are
not trained in this way.

01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:08.790
But the explanations need to be
sought in the behavioral part,

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:12.820
and in small society,
there's a big hurdle effect.

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:14.770
People were just cheering
for those bankers,

01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:18.840
and the government officials
and the political leaders

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.100
were applauding the
people who were in charge,

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:28.700
and so we basically
risked being ridiculed,

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:33.110
and I was certainly one of those
who had been doing research

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:35.760
on credit growth especially.

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.580
I pointed it out a year and a
half before the banks failed,

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:42.780
and to tell you the truth,
there was no reaction to it

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:48.020
whatsoever, so
that's how that was.

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:50.430
Right, so what are the
capital controls that

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:53.290
are in place, and what
are they meant to prevent?

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:57.870
So they are meant to prevent a
capital outflow of the country,

01:10:57.870 --> 01:11:05.520
so if there are claims on the
bankrupt estates, for one,

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:10.930
there are also foreign investors
who own ISK-denominated bonds.

01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:13.050
They want to get
rid of their krona,

01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:16.840
and buy foreign exchange for
it, and leave the economy,

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.730
and if people do
that massively, you

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:23.680
have a run on the
bank situation.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.790
So you want to prevent
that to happen,

01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:28.950
because if you allow that,
the currency of the krona

01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:32.980
will devalue, and most
of mortgages in Iceland,

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:36.140
because we have had a history of
high inflation in our economy,

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:39.020
they are index-linked,
so they're

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.730
linked to the CPI index.

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:45.030
So if foreigners leave
rapidly, the system-- the krona

01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:48.410
devalues, and, for example,
debt of corporates,

01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:53.860
as well as households,
will increase, as a result.

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:57.810
So you will have a turbulence--
probably nonperforming loans,

01:11:57.810 --> 01:12:00.700
et cetera, so turbulence
in the financial sector.

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:04.870
Financial instability is what
you are trying to prevent.

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:06.700
Does it answer your question?

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:10.020
So thank you, everybody, for
showing up here, and giving me

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.980
these great questions to
answer-- inspiring questions.

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:13.880
Thank you so much.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:19.506
[APPLAUSE]
