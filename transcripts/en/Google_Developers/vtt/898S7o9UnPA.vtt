SEBASTIAN THRUN: It's a great
pleasure seeing all of you

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.690
this afternoon.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.810
If you paid attention
in Sundar's keynote,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.770
among all these
wonderful announcements

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.530
was a very small,
petite announcement

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.920
pertaining to education.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:38.080
Sundar announced what we call
a nanodegree online education

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.890
for Android development, which
means anybody in the room who

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.429
is either an Android developer
or aspires to be an Android

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:47.970
developer or wants
to work for Google

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.120
or one of its
partner companies now

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.690
has an opportunity to learn
from the best of the best what

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.652
it means to be a top
notch Android developer.

00:00:57.652 --> 00:00:59.110
We put together a
short video which

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.605
I want to show you about it.

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:01.595
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.860
-The reason why I'm
an Android developer

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.440
is because of the
platform's massive reach.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.720
Building for Android means that
you can build something here

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.296
and it will reach people all
the way across the world.

00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:14.790
In fact, the next billion
people coming online

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.885
will interact with the internet
for the very first time using

00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:19.160
only a mobile device.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.840
There's so many people who
are consumers of technology,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.810
but I think it's so
much more powerful

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.470
to be a creator of technology.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.450
Everyone has unique
experiences and strengths

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.840
and they can draw
on that and use

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.027
that to identify problems
in their community

00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:35.670
and then use technology
to solve that.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.930
I really feel like
there's a big opportunity

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.730
to show people that
they can create

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.060
something really amazing.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.646
You can imagine something
that you think should exist

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:47.230
and you can actually
go and build it.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.910
I can't think of anything
more powerful than that.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.135
You can start your journey
to become an Android

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:54.710
developer today with Udacity
and Google's nanodegree.

00:01:58.147 --> 00:02:01.100
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.780
SEBASTIAN THRUN: The person
who first and foremost

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.020
deserves credit is
actually sitting over there

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.750
in the first row.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.426
Peter, want to get
up for a second?

00:02:09.426 --> 00:02:11.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.670
This is Peter Lubbers,
who put together

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.850
a wonderful team of Googlers
to really bring education

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.210
to everybody, not just knowledge
and information, but education.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.110
And he teamed up with my
startup company called Udacity

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.870
to really change education.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.600
So let's go back a
few years and tell you

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.300
the story of how we came about.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.990
About four years ago, I
was busy raising Google X,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.130
working on self driving
cars, contact lenses that

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.100
could measure your
glucose level,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.880
balloons in the
stratosphere-- in fact,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.660
there's a parallel talk right
now about Project Loon--

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.450
and many other things, Google
Glass, when Peter Norvig,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.660
who is speaking in about
half an hour about education,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.160
and I decided to take a
Stanford class online.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.710
I was teaching in my free
time at Stanford, an advanced

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.480
artificial intelligence
class, and following

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.990
Sal Khan and many
other people I admire,

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.650
we decided to make it available
for the world, not just

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.520
Stanford students.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.420
So here's our context of this.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.740
At that time, colleges
were under fire.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.300
They had raised tuition
rates by about 7.5%

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.240
for 30 consecutive years.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.590
The nation was facing a credit
card debt of more than $1

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.580
trillion and the
return of investment

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.070
seemed just not to be there
to get a college education.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.190
So when Peter and I decided
to take this online for free,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.600
we started, inevitably and
unintentionally, a movement

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.960
called Massive Open
Online Courses, or MOOC.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.900
Many other companies followed--
EdX, Coursera, iversity,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.220
and many others.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.189
The thing that blew us
away was the sheer size

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:21.920
that you could reach
by going online.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.600
Now, for all of you,
that's completely obvious.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.580
From libraries to Google
is just completely obvious.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.650
It's 100,000 times bigger
a market, 100 million times

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.920
as big a market.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.810
But for education,
very few people

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.900
had really attained
global scale in education.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.410
To make a long story
short, the numbers

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.640
that came out of this
class were staggering.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.480
160,000 students signed
up in a short period.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.980
23,000 finished.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.110
This is a graduate level
artificial intelligence class.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.260
There is not 160,000 people in
the world who care about AI.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.690
We had an army of 1,950
volunteer translators

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.790
that translated the course into
44 languages in 195 countries.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.630
This became the biggest
course ever taught

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.070
in the history of colleges.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.060
In fact, I taught more
students in this class

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.390
than I can teach in
Stanford in 50 lifetimes.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.620
The cost of doing this
is, the cost of building

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.010
the engineering, recording
all the videos and exercises,

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.580
and paying all the fees
for service providers,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.630
was $0.60 per student.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:57.390
Compare this to a $50,000 a
year Stanford tuition rate.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.250
What was even more
staggering to me

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:07.170
was ranking the online students
with my Stanford students.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.050
To remind you, Stanford students
go through an ardent process

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.240
of admission.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.330
To get in, you have to be
wicked smart, the right age,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.610
the right SAT scores, and
a wonderful statement, all

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.910
these things.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.010
And even then, only a
few thousand students

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.240
get in every year, so they
ought to be the smartest

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.930
kids on the planet.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.370
However, when we compared,
based on identical homework

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.490
assignments and exams, online
students with those Stanford

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.500
students the top 412
students were online

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.550
and the strongest of
200 Stanford students

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.710
ranked number 413.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.650
As the course unfolded-- I'm
going to read this for you--

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.990
students started writing
me letters like this one.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.920
I'm going to start at
the third paragraph.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.420
"I'm completing the course from
remote areas of Afghanistan

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.860
and often don't have great
internet connectivity

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.930
or electricity or
internet connections that

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.660
wouldn't block YouTube.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.290
I spent the last few days under
incoming mortar and rocket

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.430
attacks, then
dodging checkpoints

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.310
under questionable legal
status to exfiltrate a war

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.470
zone to a third world airfield
until things settled down.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.580
I had about an hour of fairly
solid internet connectivity

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.570
to be able to get
the assignments done

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.490
and still managed a
respectable score.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.880
This a typical
week for me here."

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.830
This wasn't a typical
Stanford student.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.110
This was a brave soldier
fighting for a good cause

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.840
and trying to work on a
future past his military life.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.570
This lady works
40+ hours a week.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.230
She's a single mother of
two and her younger child

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.800
is only seven months old.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.970
She has no time to
concentrate or to dedicate

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.390
and she's been hanging onto
a class by her fingernails,

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:08.070
waiting to learn and to feel
a sense of accomplishment.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.780
"Just before homework
five was due,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.130
I suffered another series of
great, chaotic difficulties."

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.160
It's a long story, but
basically, baby has been sick

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.030
and someone [INAUDIBLE]
has lost their home,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.770
and their life became
really miserable.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.790
"Why am I telling you
so much personal stuff?

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.320
Because on November
13, I gave up.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.690
I told myself it was
ridiculous to think

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.120
I could justify
continuing this class,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.580
thinking taking the time, given
all the other problems that

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.030
surrounded me.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.000
And then on Monday
morning, I checked my email

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.541
and saw the note
you sent me Saturday

00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:40.799
and I stared at it for awhile.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:44.480
Then I sighed and told
myself I can't quit now.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.820
I took the midterm exam
and finished the course."

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.580
Now, unbeknownst to her,
I had sent every student

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.100
that was late an email,
about 40,000, which

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.910
prompted about 40,000
personal responses like those,

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.150
which I didn't all read.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.140
But still, there was a
moment here where I really

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.930
had to pause and
think, at Stanford,

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.760
I teach these wonderful kids
who are already extremely

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.690
privileged and I'm really
ignorant to the rest

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:18.120
of the world of people that
possibly need me much more,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.850
like single mothers
raising children

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.930
wanting to reenter the
workforce, and she's not alone.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.304
Here's a video that made me cry.

00:09:27.304 --> 00:09:28.180
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:28.800
-Hello.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.370
My name is Melody Bliss and I
was an advanced track student

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.610
at Stanford for the online
Introduction to Artificial

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.250
Intelligence class taught
by Professor Sebastian Thrun

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.310
and Peter Norvig.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.440
I am also a disabled woman going
through dialysis three times

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.590
a week.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.960
In addition, I am
still working full time

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.090
as a systems engineer
for a local company.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.940
Because of this, I
went to this class

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.090
knowing that I would
have serious constraints

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.550
upon my time, and that gave
me some trepidation going

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.540
into the class, since there
would be many days where,

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.240
due to the dialysis
or other factors,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.970
I just would not have the energy
to even watch a short video.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.030
The enthusiasm that the
professors exhibit, however,

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.750
throughout the class
engages you, energizes you,

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.430
and infects you with the same
enthusiasm for the subject.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.470
The short lectures
with quizzes helps

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.570
you realize that yes, you are
understanding the material,

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.200
and if you realize
that you are not,

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.330
it is easy to go back and review
the information until suddenly

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.800
you get that light bulb
over your head effect.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.460
What I love most
about this class,

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.290
however, is how it
has given me new ideas

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.560
and how I could possibly
implement AI practices

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.320
in the work that I do today.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.040
This has been one
of the best classes

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.030
that I have ever taken
and in my opinion

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.390
a wonderful use of the time
that I hold precious to me.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:55.010
So I urge you, if you are
considering taking this class,

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:55.920
to do so.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.840
It has changed my life and I
believe it can change yours,

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.675
too.

00:11:01.675 --> 00:11:03.110
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.706
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:06.312
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Thank you.

00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:08.110
I'm still getting
moved when I see this

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.390
and I've seen it many times.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.350
This was the beginning
when I realized

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.080
there's a mission
here, something

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.260
we do not well in society.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.710
Education is
unevenly distributed.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.592
We have the wrong
model of education

00:11:21.592 --> 00:11:23.050
and we don't reach
everybody, so it

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:28.660
was time for me to wake up
and do something about it.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:33.370
So we started Udacity, which
comes from the English word

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:37.170
"audacity," with
a single mission,

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.920
to truly democratize education.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.900
We believe if you give a
man a fish, or a woman,

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.450
the person has
dinner for one night,

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.430
but if you teach him or
her how to catch fish,

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.290
they have food for the
rest of their lives.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.200
We believe education is the
single most important thing

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.260
and should be a basic
human right codified

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.658
in the Constitution, the
right to free education.

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:04.048
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:04.048 --> 00:12:05.004
Thank you.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.050
The very first thing
in trying to go global

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.190
was to think about what
is the delivery method.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.450
Physical classrooms
don't scale very well,

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.240
so we decided to launch on
Android, on mobile platforms,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.890
and on web browsers, to reach
the 3.7 billion people who

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.900
are already connected to
mobile or the web today.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:38.380
We decided to focus a lot
on international students.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.310
I'm putting this picture
up because Google has just

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.300
announced an
initiative to translate

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:51.640
six Google led and Google
developed classes into Arabic

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:58.060
and launch career centers
on the ground in Egypt

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.690
and issue 2,000 scholarships
to students in Egypt.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.430
What makes me particularly
excited about that initiative

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:08.950
is that, especially
in the Arabic world, ,

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.220
there's a lack of
opportunity for young people,

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.785
and by creating
reputable, Google led,

00:13:15.785 --> 00:13:19.900
state of the art instruction, we
can possibly give young people

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.640
a path to be productive
members in the Western world,

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.940
which I think will really change
the course of this geographic

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.785
region.

00:13:27.785 --> 00:13:31.396
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:31.396 --> 00:13:33.020
To quote my friend
Thomas Friedman, who

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.950
visited my company
recently-- Thomas Friedman

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.590
is a New York Times columnist.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.410
He said, look, if there
is better education,

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.660
there would be less
reason to do things

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.960
like terrorism for some
people in these countries.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.230
In terms of going global,
Google and Udacity

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.210
have a long history
working together.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:58.270
We started about three
years ago and we let

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.580
students sign up for classes.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.820
We have a freemium product,
which I'll explain in a sec.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.310
And we signed up just south
of 900,000 students already.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.530
Not all these students
finished, but we

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.520
have a portfolio
of classes that we

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.220
teach students anything between
HTML5, game development,

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.290
proper app development,
Android, and many other things,

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.430
and that's just the beginning.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.730
With today's announcement,
or yesterday's announcement,

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.550
we extended it to
include certification

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.160
and we created the
nanodegree, which

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.340
I'll talk about in a second.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:37.070
The next thing we decided to
do is we wanted to make it fun.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:42.220
To me, sitting in a class with
500 other students watching

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.180
an aging professor
on stage telling me

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.420
the same story every year, in
and out again, is just not fun.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.050
As many reasons to go
to college are fun,

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.840
that is not one of them.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.190
So we wanted to
make learning fun.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:00.709
We wanted to use the internet
to make it as fun as possible.

00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:02.125
One of the things
that we realized

00:15:02.125 --> 00:15:05.060
is in a physical
classroom, you're

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.544
forced to take everybody
at the same thought

00:15:07.544 --> 00:15:08.960
at the same time,
just the way I'm

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.050
doing it with you right now.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.130
In the online world,
it's completely OK

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.420
if people go at
a different pace.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.020
That means you can make
education much more

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.440
interactive.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.100
You can wait for a student
and you can make it

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.610
more like a video game.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.911
We decided to put a very strong
project focus on education,

00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:30.660
and I'm going to show
some of the projects

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.800
that people have built.
There's numerous,

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.110
a huge number of
interesting projects,

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.567
but I just picked these two
out in the graphics class,

00:15:38.567 --> 00:15:40.900
and these are students who
had never programmed graphics

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:41.702
before.

00:15:41.702 --> 00:15:43.410
So here's what's called
the Musical Turk.

00:15:47.532 --> 00:15:48.260
Here you go.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.199
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:57.750
So this is a student who has
just taken his first graphics

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:04.130
class and decided to build
just a really fun app.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.700
He's obviously a music lover.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.030
So I can pick my
favorite composer

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.050
and you can
pre-guess what you're

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.055
about to hear by
looking at the picture.

00:16:16.055 --> 00:16:17.460
This is Liszt, Franz Liszt.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.885
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.670
Second project that
I dug out, again,

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.145
a student who has never
done graphics before.

00:16:34.145 --> 00:16:36.020
It takes awhile to load.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:43.520
And it's not perfect yet, but
this is a city driving project

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.030
which integrates head tracking.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.380
So here I'm in a car, and
if everything goes well,

00:16:50.380 --> 00:17:01.230
I can activate my own camera I
move my head left, right, left,

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:05.329
and then drive this car through
the city just using my head.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.490
I'm not very good at this.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.359
That's one of the
reasons why I actually

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:15.510
worked on self driving cars
because I'm a lousy driver.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:26.589
But I found it just
amazing how students really

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:33.770
built these really
amazing applications.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:34.270
Oops.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.139
I'm dying.

00:17:35.139 --> 00:17:36.555
Let's go back to
the presentation.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.690
So we decided projects are
so much better than lectures.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.530
You get to do something,
build something.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.550
But to become a really
good project person

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:55.290
and build a portfolio, you need
feedback, so we needed people,

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.250
so we started hiring.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.760
Hiring is hard.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.820
We hired dozens of people
that would sit at Udacity

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.060
and grade all these projects.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.200
And the company, when
we launched nanodegrees,

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.720
started growing almost
astronomically, roughly 5%

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.645
every week.

00:18:11.645 --> 00:18:16.580
We couldn't hire that fast,
so our projects fell back

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.919
and it took us two weeks to
grade them just like college.

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:21.460
And then we got
students complaining,

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.470
I'm paying a monthly fee
for a two week delay.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.980
You guys are getting
rich on my advantage.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.970
And then we decided
to follow the model

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:36.810
that Travis at Uber and Lift
and Airbnb and many others

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.280
had developed where your
workforce becomes global.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.220
We decided to democratize
not only the learning

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.210
part, but also the TA-ing
of classes, the code review.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.910
We built a global
code reviewer network

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.650
and we're beginning to build
a global mentor network.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.620
People all around
the world would now

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.100
be able to grab these
projects the same way an Uber

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.870
driver grabs your
request for a ride,

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.020
and then grade it really fast
and turn it around and give it

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.470
to the student.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.940
The student would assess
the quality of the grading

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.960
and we would then compensate
the grader in correspondence

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.790
to the work and the
quality of the workmanship.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.360
We launched this just
two or three months ago.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.990
We now have about 350
or so worldwide graders

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.730
in all countries.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.090
It's amazing.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:26.760
They turn around projects
almost always within a day,

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.310
mostly within an hour.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.460
So if you write your code
and you put it on GitHub

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.250
and you submit it to us,
you get detailed feedback

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.380
within an hour.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.742
Anybody who's been in
college will say, oh my god,

00:19:38.742 --> 00:19:39.450
this is possible?

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.440
These people make real money.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.200
They make real money.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.470
Actually, some of them
make more than me.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:57.150
So the monthly income
of our best global code

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.770
reviewer is more than $11,000.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.540
He's in South Africa,
does as a part time job

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.400
on the side over the
weekends, makes more with us

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.330
than with his main job.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.410
And I just put this graph up
to compare the typical salary

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.490
that the typical
part time instructor

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:19.720
makes in a US institution, which
is actually very, very low.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.450
And this big difference
in earning potential

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.070
is really the result
of true globalization.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.490
If we tear down the
wall of colleges

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.750
and open it up to
the world, then we

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:35.080
have an amazing ecosystem we can
build about learners and people

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.080
to help them to learn.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.650
Next, step five, we decided the
best opportunity that we have

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:48.300
that no college ever has is
to learn about our students.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.860
When we put up a new
video, we do a new quiz,

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.030
a new exercise, typically, we
have about 1,000 or so students

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.290
at the same location
and we can get

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:01.630
almost instantaneous data about
people's learning abilities.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:02.890
This is just one graph.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:07.490
It graphs the student progress
over time as they engage.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.790
Horizontal is time,
vertical is progress.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.240
It's shocking.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.580
Most college students
would be in a single line

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.040
because you're forced
to be in a single line.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.030
Advanced people lose.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.520
It's shocking to see
that some students stop

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:26.960
sleeping to finish the
course as fast as possible.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.300
In fact, one student
wrote a blog post about us

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.100
and called the
phenomenon, the feeling

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.840
of taking a class with us,
"binge learning," which

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.380
I loved because that's
what it should be.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.790
Step six.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.930
This is a big step for me.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.649
We wanted to make it
relevant, and that's

00:21:47.649 --> 00:21:49.190
the reason why I'm
here today and why

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:52.810
we're working with Peter
and his wonderful team.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.770
In areas, in ecosystems
as fast moving

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:59.500
as Android with more than a
billion active Android users

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.840
worldwide, many
more, it's important

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.180
that the education
is fresh, and that

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.780
is somewhat
irreconcilable with tenure

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.620
or with a primary
resource mission.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.730
I challenged anybody
to find a good Android

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.050
class in any college in
this country at this point

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.280
or anywhere in the world.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.020
There might be a few,
but by and large,

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.270
the speed at which academia is
able to adopt new technologies

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.060
is slow.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.700
And very often, in places
like Facebook and Twitter

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.070
and others, when you
come out of college,

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.820
you have to be retrained
to be suitable to be

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.160
working in the 21st century.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.190
That isn't to say that
colleges do a bad job.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.452
They're just very different.

00:22:42.452 --> 00:22:44.910
But we wanted to make it so
that it's really bleeding edge.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.070
The things announced
at this conference

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.850
are already available as a
course in our new nanodegree.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:52.170
So we teamed up with
companies, Google

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.390
being a wonderful
partner, and others,

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:58.140
to really bring top notch
education to everybody.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.670
And then finally, we really
wanted to focus on jobs.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:06.080
We believe that one of the core
value propositions of education

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.360
ought to be employment.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.410
So we created this new
thing called nanodegree.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.272
It never existed before.

00:23:13.272 --> 00:23:14.105
It's not accredited.

00:23:14.105 --> 00:23:16.330
There's no accreditation body.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.600
Colleges don't do it.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.380
It's a much smaller packaging
size than a college degree,

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.900
but it turns out
there's also no law

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.070
against inventing
new degrees, luckily,

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.110
so we could just do it.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.370
And we launched them.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:32.460
Typically, think of
them as six months long.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.550
They can be faster.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.110
In principle, you
could do it in a week.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.030
They can be slower.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.500
We care much more about
mastery than meeting

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:46.190
some artificial timelines,
but if you spend 10, 15,

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.199
20 hours a week on this and you
come with the right starting

00:23:50.199 --> 00:23:51.990
knowledge, you should
be able to compete it

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.790
in four to six months,
maybe nine months.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:58.170
We launched iOS, Front End
Development Programming,

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.390
Web Full Stack, Data
Analyst, and yesterday,

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.740
we announced Android
Developer, and we also

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.510
announced that we are
actively working on three more

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.640
Google led nanodegrees,
Entrepreneurship,

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.430
Cloud Development, and
Advanced Web Development.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:16.080
And I'm particularly
proud of Entrepreneurship

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.020
because it's something that
people outside the tech field

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.440
can benefit from and
international people can

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.010
benefit from.

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.940
If you look at
youth unemployment

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.040
in Greece and Spain
exceeding way past 50%.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.600
If we can teach them the tools
to be digital entrepreneurs,

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.890
we might be able
to get them dinner

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:34.070
for the rest of their lives.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:42.230
We have numerous examples
of people finding jobs.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.150
On the right side, you
see a Googler, Kelly,

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.180
who was a business
analyst and is now

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.670
a full stack
developer at Google,

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.650
and stayed at the same company.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.840
Vicky in the center, she
became a data engineer

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.480
from a business analyst intern.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.969
[INAUDIBLE] is a
golf professional

00:24:59.969 --> 00:25:02.260
who, by his own words, says
he wasn't quite good enough

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:06.340
to make the cut and he became
a full stack developer.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.230
We have working mothers who
want to reenter the workforce

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:14.610
and we have seafood managers
who become software engineers.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.590
And there's a really strong
vision here, I believe.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.760
When education was
invented, people

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.090
believed that one education
of a lifetime is enough.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.900
Today, people have
many different careers,

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.840
and what Google
enabled people to do

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.002
is to go from here to here,
to take this job over here,

00:25:33.002 --> 00:25:35.210
to be a high school teacher
and be hired into Google.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.640
So here's some of our students.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.060
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:40.560
-Hi.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.320
I'm Dennis Shen.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.153
You can call me Den.

00:25:42.153 --> 00:25:43.945
-My name is Maarten.

00:25:43.945 --> 00:25:47.040
-Ubuntu Obatarhe, [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.492
-My name is Febria.

00:25:48.492 --> 00:25:49.200
-Hello, everyone.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.090
My name is Evgenii.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.455
I'm from Sochi.

00:25:53.455 --> 00:25:54.810
-I'm Dan Stormont.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:55.680
-I'm Jessa.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.077
I'm a software engineer
from the Philippines.

00:25:58.077 --> 00:25:58.910
-My name is Genhady.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:00.590
I am 27.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:05.040
-I always wanted to do a
degree but I could not afford

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.280
moving out of my house either.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.400
-The existing
system of education,

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.660
I think it's pretty much
ripe for disruption.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.280
-I decided to change paths
and become a programmer.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.815
-I've been learning online
for as long as I can remember.

00:26:18.815 --> 00:26:23.270
-You kind of redefined what
I think is possible now.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.060
-I was amazed how
much I could learn

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.691
in a very short period of time.

00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:28.010
-Writing code is my passion.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.480
I enjoy it a lot.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.280
-The community is awesome.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.442
You get to help each
other out [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:34.442 --> 00:26:36.165
You get to ask questions.

00:26:36.165 --> 00:26:38.008
You get to answer them, too.

00:26:38.008 --> 00:26:39.872
-I find myself
having this ability

00:26:39.872 --> 00:26:41.490
to think in different ways.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:45.600
-It was a problem in my
village of my daily routine,

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.660
so I'm trying to solve
this problem with a piece

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.580
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.845
I solved my problem and
I didn't think about it.

00:26:52.845 --> 00:26:55.320
-Every day, I
discover new things.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.980
-It's been life changing.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.630
-And by the end of the course,
I can build my own Android

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.260
application.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.680
-I truly believe online learning
is the future of education.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.259
-I got the position of
Java developer in startup.

00:27:10.259 --> 00:27:13.752
-I manage the Google Developer
Group and the Women's Technical

00:27:13.752 --> 00:27:15.027
Group in my university.

00:27:15.027 --> 00:27:16.860
-And you can also keep
current on the things

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.060
that you need for
doing your job or just

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.170
to be a part of modern society.

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:25.508
-I adore programming and I have
developed some applications.

00:27:25.508 --> 00:27:29.260
-I have a wonderful wife
and a beautiful one-year-old

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.500
daughter, and I feel
more motivated than ever

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.110
to give my family a better life.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.950
-Every course has
application in my daily job

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:42.475
and gets me closer to my dream
of creating my own startup.

00:27:42.475 --> 00:27:45.260
-Well, this was my story.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.224
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:47.224 --> 00:27:50.480
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.510
So how much does this cost?

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:06.900
Well, staying in tune with the
idea of truly democratizing

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.320
education and making it
accessible to everybody,

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.180
we made the decision that
all our content, everything

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.220
we built, is available
online for free,

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.250
so it's the equivalent
of a free textbook.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:29.222
And I really want to
give kudos to Google.

00:28:29.222 --> 00:28:30.930
Sundar yesterday in
his keynote mentioned

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:34.440
that there was a $4
million injection of money,

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.550
and that was really the
money it took to put together

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.180
all the content,
all the exercises

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.590
and projects for the Android
nanodegree and beyond.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.330
However, as a
startup company, it's

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.280
not a good idea to give
everything away for free,

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.760
so we are truly a
freemium business.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.680
The services we provide
where we pay our global code

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:02.050
reviewers money need, of course,
financing from the students.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.120
We charge students
who want code feedback

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:09.150
and certification a $200
per month tuition fee.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.730
Now, that's a lot of
money, but it's much less

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.290
than you pay for pretty much
any college in this country.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.910
Now, this month, we
announced for the May cohort

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:24.180
and going forward that
if students finish,

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.190
they can ask for half
the tuition back.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.500
Thank you.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.490
Thank you.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:36.270
We did this because
we want the students

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:37.520
to go all the way to the end.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.460
It will incentivize
every student

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.470
to say, look, you
make money back.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.370
Udacity has a scholarship
program of 5,000 scholarships

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:49.900
for students in need, financed
in part by companies like AT&amp;T,

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.860
and Google, as I mentioned
at the beginning,

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.620
just announced 2,000 full
scholarships for students

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:55.920
in Egypt.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.170
And I hope that many Egyptian
students will sign up for this.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.170
What many people don't know
is Egyptian computer science

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:06.350
students have a much higher
female ratio than this country,

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:09.990
and one of our goals is to
really help diversify and bring

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.320
everybody into computer science
and software engineering, not

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.358
just male, middle
aged men like myself.

00:30:16.358 --> 00:30:19.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.110
Thank you.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:22.880
The last thing that I
found really amazing

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.530
is that Laszlo Bock
and his team at Google

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:29.280
have committed to do a
career summit in November,

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.750
and this is really
underlining the seriousness

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:32.740
of this education.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.200
The Android
Development nanodegree

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.920
is not a beginner
level, easy to do thing.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.340
It is serious education
with serious sweat

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:47.350
that we believe gets you to
the level of a nice, completely

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:50.420
competent Google employee
in software engineering.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.720
And to underline this, 50 of
the top Android nanodegree

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.940
finishers will be invited, all
expenses paid, to Google campus

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.120
in November to meet lots
of Googlers, including

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:09.110
Google's recruiters, to chat
about careers and experience

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.230
Google firsthand.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.960
I think Laszlo and
Peter and the teams

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.355
deserve a big applause
for doing this, because--

00:31:15.355 --> 00:31:18.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.760
It really sets the stage
for possibly a new way

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:27.970
of finding those 412 students
that beat the single strongest

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.370
Stanford student.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:33.420
Before I open up for
Q&amp;A, I want to also

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.860
share with you one video
that completely surprised me

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.740
by my own company and that
I've watched maybe 500 times.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.710
It is one of our professors,
in this case, a great colleague

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.400
from Brown University
and from Georgia Tech,

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.510
getting creative in
this meeting that you

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.430
wouldn't believe is possible.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:51.810
So let me go here.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:52.476

SEBASTIAN THRUN: This is
part of a Udacity class.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:28.830
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:31.550
This is professor--

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.242
-(SINGING) You've got some data.

00:32:33.242 --> 00:32:38.540
You need to find a
rule that can predict.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:44.610
You want a theta that works
for any instance that you pick.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.960
It's Bellman's curse.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.400
The classifer needs to--

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.290
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.406
SEBASTIAN THRUN: All right.

00:32:51.406 --> 00:32:52.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.737
You can actually go
online and see it.

00:32:54.737 --> 00:32:56.820
This course was actually
instructed by two people.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.440
And the second person
said he couldn't sing,

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.530
so we got a role for him.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.442
Let's see.

00:33:01.442 --> 00:33:03.100
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.130
-Saves your day, but
what a chilling plot

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:10.320
this is to find the
right hypothesis.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.100
You let your guard
down one small bit.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.920
Oh no, it seems you've underfit.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:21.674
Like scary films in cinema,
you're trapped in local minima.

00:33:21.674 --> 00:33:23.875
[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:23.875 --> 00:33:25.000
SEBASTIAN THRUN: All right.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.460
Questions?

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.170
There's microphones here.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:32.830
Come forward, please.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.208
Thank you.

00:33:34.208 --> 00:33:37.631
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:49.090
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm not
going to make a question.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:52.530
I just want to say
thank you because girls

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.110
like me can learn
more about code

00:33:56.110 --> 00:34:02.160
and this is very emotive for
me because seven months ago, I

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.670
didn't know anything
about coding,

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:11.820
and now I've got my own startup
up with 12,000 users in it.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:18.060
And I also belong
to a community that

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:22.670
is looking for seven
to 11-year-old girls

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:27.380
to learn more about code, so
I just want to say thank you.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.935
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Thank you.

00:34:28.935 --> 00:34:33.282
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:33.282 --> 00:34:35.710
Thank you.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.790
Please come visit us.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.719
Honestly, these are
the moments that

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:41.179
make me do what I want to do.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:41.679
Thank you.

00:34:46.904 --> 00:34:49.320
AUDIENCE: I'm actually more
of a database developer, which

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.230
I actually started
learning on my own.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:56.787
The company that my
husband was working for

00:34:56.787 --> 00:34:58.870
were willing to give me a
chance to do that, which

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:01.460
I know that's an
incredible circumstance

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.420
to end up in because most people
don't have something like that.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.130
But I was wondering
if-- I've actually

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.822
had quite a few women
in my area ask me,

00:35:09.822 --> 00:35:11.530
how do you get into
database development?

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:12.527
What can I do about it?

00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:14.110
Do you guys have
anything in the works

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:15.970
that you might be
looking to do that,

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:19.820
or can I put a bug
in your ear for that?

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.440
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We have a
class that we built with MongoDB

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.120
and we have several
classes with Cloudera where

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.150
we did data analysis,
some were with Salesforce,

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.550
but no nanodegree yet.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.120
We'd love to have a nanodegree

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.290
The model that's been
working is that companies,

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:36.770
mostly in Silicon Valley,
come to us, knock on our door,

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:39.820
and say, look, this is an area
we think is really important.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.720
And then we answer those queries
and say, let's get together

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.040
and see what it would take.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.820
How big is the market size?

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.760
Who will be the typical student?

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.220
And then we end up after a few
meetings defining a curriculum

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:55.430
that we believe
is bleeding edge.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:58.310
We definitely will
put a lot of oil

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:00.890
into the fire of building
more content and more

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.870
nanodegrees inside coding
and outside coding, to we're

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.130
extremely open to suggestions.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:12.540
My email is thrun@udacity.com
or thrun@stanford.edu.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.160
Please send me an email, OK?

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:14.660
Thank you.

00:36:18.772 --> 00:36:20.480
AUDIENCE: So it's a
really great product,

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.420
and I'm curious you have
any aspirations-- most

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.459
of the courses right now are
technology related-- for just

00:36:26.459 --> 00:36:28.500
a broader curriculum that
isn't necessarily based

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.740
on technology.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.060
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yes.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.780
The reason why we
focused on technology

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.730
is I think it's good
to be good in something

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:39.230
that's confined first and
really work with out the kinks.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:43.360
Also, technology is one of the
most employable areas today.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.339
With the entrepreneurship
nanodegree

00:36:45.339 --> 00:36:46.880
that we are building
right now, we're

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.710
branching out a little bit.

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:50.860
It's still technology
based in the sense

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.190
that we believe that
every entrepreneur has

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.200
to know a lot about
analytics and website domain

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.480
and mobile and so on, but it's
much more basic in some sense.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.620
As the company
hopefully grows, we

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.731
will look into adjacent areas.

00:37:05.731 --> 00:37:07.480
The thing we're probably
never going to do

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.355
is philosophy or art
history, or if we do it,

00:37:12.355 --> 00:37:13.980
I want to do it
completely differently.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.430
I want to do it in a way
that the people coming out

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:18.700
of these humanities
classes are absolutely

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.130
employable by Facebook and by
Google and by tech companies

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:23.504
because I think there's a huge
shortage of great humanity

00:37:23.504 --> 00:37:25.610
thinking in the tech field.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.870
But the way it's being
taught today, in my opinion,

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:28.790
is very separate.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:33.100
It's very disjoint from what
the workforce needs are,

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.570
and Udacity's promise
really is jobs.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:37.520
We want people to
find employment

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.260
as a proxy for
contributing to society.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.799
SEBASTIAN THRUN:
Yes, over there.

00:37:44.799 --> 00:37:45.340
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.377
So you've been a pioneer
in this technology

00:37:48.377 --> 00:37:50.960
that we've seen sort of explode
over the last couple of years.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.620
I've known people
who've taken courses

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.720
on EdX and Coursera
and Udacity and it's

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.980
changed all of their
lives considerably.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.280
What do you see as
the future of what

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.420
are now these fragmented
online education

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.894
courses like Khan Academy?

00:38:03.894 --> 00:38:05.310
There are some
that appear to have

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.240
very different educational
areas, but in the future,

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.020
do you see education
becoming more unified

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.519
or separate across these
companies, or what direction?

00:38:13.519 --> 00:38:15.560
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We're
certainly living right now

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.670
in an area of great
experimentation in education,

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:19.990
and it's wonderful, honestly.

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:21.720
It's been long overdue.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.740
And it's great to see so
many companies engaging

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.630
in the same space and
trying to innovate

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:27.380
and finding the right formula.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.200
It's completely obvious to
me that 50 years from now,

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.870
education will be what Larry
Page calls a toothbrush

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.560
technology, we use twice
a day for five minutes.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.420
It's completely obvious to
me that the Prussian picture

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.385
of childhood play,
go educate yourself,

00:38:44.385 --> 00:38:47.300
work, and retire is
obsolete, that we

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.670
have to intermix these things
and be lifelong learners.

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.520
And that means education
has to be available

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.550
wherever you go-- on your phone,
on your watch, on your devices,

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:59.814
and blend into a
physical, busy life.

00:38:59.814 --> 00:39:01.480
And that's basically
what we do and what

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.564
other companies are doing.

00:39:02.564 --> 00:39:03.980
It's also completely
obvious to me

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.340
it's going to be open,
democratic to everybody.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.700
We can't lock it up anymore.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.584
I think it's almost
a crime that we

00:39:09.584 --> 00:39:11.000
have this amazing,
great education

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.730
in this country, the best
education in the world,

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.530
and no one gets in.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.220
Almost nobody gets in.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.520
And it thrives from
exclusivity in that

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.850
to keep your ratings up,
you have to be exclusive.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:25.220
You can't be inclusive.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.680
So I think education
50 years from now

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.140
will be with us
all the time and it

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.450
will be an absolutely
great thing to do,

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.010
instead of watching
a movie, to go

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.690
learn a skill that you can
leverage to work and make

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:38.250
yourself smarter.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.640
The path there, who knows
what's going to happen?

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.530
I mean, obviously, I'm putting
my own time into my own company

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.114
and we're trying to do our
very best job to reinvent

00:39:47.114 --> 00:39:48.780
everything, from the
basic credentialing

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.730
system to the quality of the
videos to the experience,

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:54.320
but more important than
my company winning is

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.670
that somebody wins and really
breaks into this big wall

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.070
of existing education systems.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.039
Yes?

00:40:02.039 --> 00:40:04.080
AUDIENCE: So there are
claims that the completion

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.140
rates of these online
courses are really low.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:06.979
Is that correct?

00:40:06.979 --> 00:40:09.020
And if it's correct, have
you seen any difference

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.255
with such nanodegrees?

00:40:10.255 --> 00:40:11.130
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yes.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.490
The Massive Open Online
Courses have often

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.780
been critiqued for
completion rates

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.520
typically in the
order of 2% to 5%,

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.770
and our numbers are the same.

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:25.870
Obviously, when we
have paying students,

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:27.870
we drive up completion
because if you pay money,

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:29.560
you're more committed.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.110
But also, we found that by
offering intense services--

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:36.010
mentoring services, tutoring
services, and feedback--

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:37.620
we drive up completion rate.

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.820
I don't have a good
number right now.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.324
I ran it for one
of my own courses,

00:40:41.324 --> 00:40:42.740
which is a bit of
an exaggeration,

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.156
so it's not typical
for a company,

00:40:44.156 --> 00:40:47.680
but I'm teaching a course how
to program a self driving car.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.560
It's a robotics
class and it's being

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.390
taught as an open MOOC where
you get a 2.3% finishing rate.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:57.670
As Udacity, in this case,
also a Georgia Tech class

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.070
that is embedded
in the degree, we

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:04.340
get a completion
rate north of 90%.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:08.390
I think our typical completion
rates are more like 50% or so.

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:11.026
It's a factor of many things.

00:41:11.026 --> 00:41:12.400
It's a factor of
the fact that we

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.983
have no admissions
for our nanodegrees

00:41:13.983 --> 00:41:15.764
so people can just
come, so many people

00:41:15.764 --> 00:41:17.430
are not well fit for
the nanodegrees who

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.284
are working on this.

00:41:18.284 --> 00:41:20.700
The Android nanodegree now has
a little admissions hurdle.

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.710
You have to do a self test.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:29.370
Also, overall, I think that 50%
is certainly better than 3%,

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:31.130
and one of the things
my company cares

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:32.710
a lot about, every
single person,

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.805
is bringing this up to 100%.

00:41:34.805 --> 00:41:37.040
We really care about
educating not just

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.180
the top of students who could
probably learn from books,

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.130
but also the bottom of students.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:44.790
So come visit Udacity.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.984
Perhaps you'll sign up for
one of the nanodegrees,

00:41:46.984 --> 00:41:49.150
and then give us feedback
how we can make it better.

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:53.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:54.900
I'm Rasha.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:59.860
I now take the front end
nanodegree on Udacity.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:04.090
I actually won the sponsorship
money through Udacity contest

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:06.954
as well, which was awesome.

00:42:06.954 --> 00:42:08.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:12.060
I was wearing the cape in the
photo that I participated in.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.700
That's what made me win.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:17.980
Anyway, I've been following up
with Udacity and it's amazing.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:20.650
I love how easy it is to
actually build something

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:22.810
useful through the course.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:26.580
So you actually are very
proud by the end of the course

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.470
because you built something.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:30.720
I was wondering, because you
mentioned the partnership

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.090
with Egypt, why that
country, and is there

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:37.310
any plans for
localizing content,

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:39.684
for example, making it
available in Arabic?

00:42:39.684 --> 00:42:40.600
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.070
So the Egypt pilot involves
complete translations

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:48.840
into Arabic so that students
not even proficient in English

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.760
could complete the
basic experience

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.470
and take these courses.

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:56.730
Google has subtitled
their classes

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.520
for 10 different
languages, and we

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.270
are between 1 and 10
languages for other courses.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:06.530
Obviously, localization is a
big part of going international.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:09.420
India we have a lot of traction,
where many students already

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.080
speak native
English, and we have

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.280
plans to open a China
office and go into China

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.610
later this summer to
reach Chinese students.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.610
I am specifically
enthusiastic about Egypt.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:21.240
Google has a really
great relationship

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.730
with the Egyptian government
and the Egyptian government

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:27.090
is very eager to empower its own
people, so some of these things

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:28.200
came together.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.770
But for us, it's a
platform to reach

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:30.880
much more than just Egypt.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.750
It's a platform to reach
the entire peninsula

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.030
and really reach
a lot of people--

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:39.160
everybody, but hopefully a
lot of people who otherwise

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.860
would have no chance to
be a productive member

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:43.864
in the society.

00:43:43.864 --> 00:43:44.530
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:45.030
Thank you.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:50.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for what you're doing.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:53.590
I'm a professor at Cal
Poly in San Luis Obispo.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.670
I teach computer science
and Android development,

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:59.160
and so I'm the guy, in a
way, that you're replacing,

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.364
and that's OK.

00:44:01.364 --> 00:44:03.655
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We do have
open requisitions right now

00:44:03.655 --> 00:44:05.460
and we're not far from you.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.360
We pay well.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.060
AUDIENCE: You pay
well, probably better.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.260
I'm excited about
what is happening.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.070
I mean, I can relate
to what you're saying.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:16.320
It is very difficult
for a professor

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.430
to keep up with technology.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.240
I'm not a full time
Android developer.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.281
I teach a lot of courses.

00:44:21.281 --> 00:44:22.740
I get to teach
Android maybe once

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:26.740
a year, one quarter, one course,
and so it is a challenge.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.670
How do you see what
you're doing integrating,

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:31.520
or do you see it
integrating at all?

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.717
Can we leverage and work
together in different ways?

00:44:34.717 --> 00:44:36.425
Do you mind if I use
some of your content

00:44:36.425 --> 00:44:39.580
in some of my courses to scale
my courses, things like that?

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.080
SEBASTIAN THRUN:
All our content you

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.220
can use for free as
much as you want,

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.870
and if you charge tuition
based on our content,

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.445
please keep it, absolutely.

00:44:48.445 --> 00:44:54.070
Actually, I'm really impressed
that there was an Android

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:56.896
course in San Luis Obispo.

00:44:56.896 --> 00:44:58.270
I've seen very
few in the nation,

00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:00.020
so big kudos for
teaching Android.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.400
This is actually great.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:08.486
That's actually remarkable
because most professors teach

00:45:08.486 --> 00:45:09.860
what they did in
their PhD thesis

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.570
for the rest of
their career, myself

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:15.000
included when I was at Stanford.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.815
Things that come along
as fast as Android

00:45:16.815 --> 00:45:19.780
typically are completely
dismissed by academia,

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:21.499
and as a result,
students coming out

00:45:21.499 --> 00:45:23.040
don't have the skills
that they would

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.130
need, for example, to
be productive on day one

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:27.030
at Google.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:28.772
The truth is our
content is being

00:45:28.772 --> 00:45:30.980
used by many, many universities
and many high schools

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:31.730
and many colleges.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:36.370
In fact, Sal Khan started
an elementary school,

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:41.184
and my son is on it, and that
school uses one Udacity class.

00:45:41.184 --> 00:45:43.100
So the kids, the
10-year-olds, nine-year-olds,

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:48.120
are learning genomics on
Udacity, which blows my mind.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.756
Our goal really is to reach
as many people as possible

00:45:50.756 --> 00:45:52.380
and we are very
interested in feedback.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.588
So for example, if you use
materials in the classroom

00:45:54.588 --> 00:45:58.330
and find services that we
offer or content useful,

00:45:58.330 --> 00:45:59.560
please come back to us.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.140
Tell us how you used it.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.000
Come visit us.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.942
Our goal really is to-- looks
like it just lost sound.

00:46:06.942 --> 00:46:09.150
Maybe one last question in
the interest of time right

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.290
over here.

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:13.950
AUDIENCE: That's really funny
timing because my question was

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:17.850
going to be how professors
and university college

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:20.710
administrators are
reacting to this.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:22.670
So maybe you
answered my question,

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:26.330
but from your perspective, your
colleagues or ex-colleagues,

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:27.732
how are people reacting to this?

00:46:27.732 --> 00:46:29.190
Are they seeing
that there's a need

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.140
to change traditional
university education,

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.890
or at least change the
content or try and keep up

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:36.130
with content?

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:40.380
SEBASTIAN THRUN: When you go
out and think of something well

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:45.730
established like academia and
go to people and say, look,

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:50.530
we can do for $0.60 what you
guys charge $50,000 for, you

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:54.490
don't just end up with friends.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:58.890
So if you do a Google search on
my name about a year and a half

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:01.360
ago when we worked
with a local university

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:06.290
to make San Francisco
State's college education 10%

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:08.600
as expensive as
it is today, you'd

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.280
find a few labor unions taking
a little bit of an issue

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.490
with me, as was manifold.

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:17.092
One specific day, I bought
the New York Sunday Times

00:47:17.092 --> 00:47:19.300
and I wouldn't even have to
flip over the first page.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.758
Above the fold,
they called my work

00:47:20.758 --> 00:47:22.570
a flop and the
Financial Times said

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:25.330
we're going out of business.

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:29.650
I think the way it's coming out
is actually really interesting.

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:32.700
With all the rhetoric of
replacing college, which

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.350
of course hasn't happened, the
main quote, unquote "customer"

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:39.290
that we have is actually very
different in demographics.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:41.570
The main customers we have
are young professionals

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:44.290
and middle aged professionals
and some high aged

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:47.670
professionals typically
past college age,

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.240
and the reason why
that's the case

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:53.370
is there's an enormous
thirst for learning.

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:57.650
A generation ago, employment
lasted for a lifetime.

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:00.710
Today, employment lasts
4.6 years on average,

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:03.370
going to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics,

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.360
and tomorrow, it might
just last for a year.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.120
Ad hoc employment
through Airbnb and Uber

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.230
doesn't necessarily
last that long.

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:13.000
So I think especially
young people today

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.610
are completely
conscientious that they

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:18.830
have to stay on top of things
to be able to engage themselves.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:21.650
It's not OK anymore to
just get one college degree

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:22.900
and stay there.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.490
So the intersection between
our current customers

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:28.490
and college students at this
point is virtually zero,

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:31.030
and that has really calmed down
the discussion quite a bit.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:33.420
So we are reaching people
all around the world

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.710
that existing colleges
don't even want to reach.

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:37.490
Existing colleges
really specialize

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:41.889
on the age of 17 to 24
and are doing a good job.

00:48:41.889 --> 00:48:43.680
There's nothing bad
about going to college,

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.690
nothing bad about going
to Stanford or San

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:50.240
Luis Obispo Polytech,
but we are ending up

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.286
having this huge
number of people that

00:48:52.286 --> 00:48:53.660
currently are
completely excluded

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:57.040
from the educational system.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.246
In the interest of
time, thank you so much.

00:48:59.246 --> 00:49:02.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.420
One last shout out to
Peter Lubbers over here--

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.780
stand up again-- who is
doing the work at Google,

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:08.680
and his team.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.030
[APPLAUSE]
