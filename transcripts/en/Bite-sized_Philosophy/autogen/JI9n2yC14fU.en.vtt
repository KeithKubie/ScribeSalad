juveniles really liked to wrestle and
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.050
juveniles really liked to wrestle and
they wrestle just like humans beings

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
they wrestle just like humans beings
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.399
they wrestle just like humans beings
wrestle they pinned each other for

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409

count right and so so what you do is you

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
count right and so so what you do is you
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.319
count right and so so what you do is you
take juvenile rats and you can find out

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
take juvenile rats and you can find out
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.920
take juvenile rats and you can find out
that they want to play because you can

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
that they want to play because you can
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.440
that they want to play because you can
attach a spring to them and then they'll

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
attach a spring to them and then they'll
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.060
attach a spring to them and then they'll
try to run and you can measure how hard

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
try to run and you can measure how hard
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.800
try to run and you can measure how hard
they're running by how hard they're

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
they're running by how hard they're
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.029
they're running by how hard they're
pulling on the spring and then you can

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
pulling on the spring and then you can
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.979
pulling on the spring and then you can
estimate how motivated they are and so

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989
estimate how motivated they are and so
 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.990
estimate how motivated they are and so
you can find out that a nice well said

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
you can find out that a nice well said
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.580
you can find out that a nice well said
that whoo

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590

before he'll work for that so that you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140
before he'll work for that so that you
 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.229
before he'll work for that so that you
think while the rats motivated so the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239
think while the rats motivated so the
 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.880
think while the rats motivated so the
two rats go out there and they play and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890
two rats go out there and they play and
 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.059
two rats go out there and they play and
and so they're playing like dogs play

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069
and so they're playing like dogs play
 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.350

and everyone knows what that looks like
 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.059
and everyone knows what that looks like
if you're you know what if you have any

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069
if you're you know what if you have any
 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.130
if you're you know what if you have any
sense about dogs they kind of go like

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140
sense about dogs they kind of go like
 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.619
sense about dogs they kind of go like
this and kids do that and maybe you do

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629
this and kids do that and maybe you do
 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:37.880
this and kids do that and maybe you do
that with your wife if you're gonna play

and so sometimes she'd come at me like
this when we were playing round and I

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880

and she used to just get completely
 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.250
and she used to just get completely
annoyed about that and I thought right

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260
annoyed about that and I thought right
 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.440
annoyed about that and I thought right
that's what you do you just opened your

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450
that's what you do you just opened your
 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.000
that's what you do you just opened your
hands well she didn't know that either

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010
hands well she didn't know that either
 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.800

so she hadn't been played with enough

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810
so she hadn't been played with enough
 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.480
so she hadn't been played with enough
when she was a little rat and so anyways

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490
when she was a little rat and so anyways
 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.290
when she was a little rat and so anyways
uh anyway so you let the rap the little

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300
uh anyway so you let the rap the little
 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.790
uh anyway so you let the rap the little
rats go out there right and so let's

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800
rats go out there right and so let's
 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.080
rats go out there right and so let's
imagine one of them is ten percent

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090
imagine one of them is ten percent
 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.570
imagine one of them is ten percent
bigger than other and so that the ten

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580
bigger than other and so that the ten
 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.030
bigger than other and so that the ten
percent bigger rat wins because ten

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040
percent bigger rat wins because ten
 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.220
percent bigger rat wins because ten
percent is enough in rat way to ensure

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230
percent is enough in rat way to ensure
 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.570
percent is enough in rat way to ensure
that you're going to be the Pinner

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580
that you're going to be the Pinner
 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.570
that you're going to be the Pinner
rather than the penny okay so so that's

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580
rather than the penny okay so so that's
 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.280
rather than the penny okay so so that's
fine so in it Annette the rat throughout

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290
fine so in it Annette the rat throughout
