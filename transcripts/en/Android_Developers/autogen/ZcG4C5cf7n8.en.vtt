00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.120
My name is Kwon Dae-hyeon.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.879
I am currently running a game company called
'Zabob Studio'.

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.050
Our company has only two members, my wife
and myself.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.660
I founded this company when I married my wife
and resigned from my previous company in November

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.660
2013.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.520
We have made about ten games so far.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.149
Among them, our representative games are "ZOMBIE
JUDGEMENT DAY" and "INFINITY DUNGEON".

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:37.020
When we launched it, as a startup company
that cannot spend a lot of budget on marketing,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.230
we experienced a lot of stress about how we're
going to promote it.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.320
I guess every developer faces this problem.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.859
We tried to find ways to market our games
efficiently, at a lower cost.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.920
Great ideas are our competitive edge because
we cannot afford to develop or compete with

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.050
large-scale games.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.019
We tried painstakingly hard to figure out
what type of games would help us win this

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:59.019
competition based on this idea.

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.520
Fortunately, our game was selected as the
"Play Picks"

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.320
which helped us to promote our game to global
users.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.610
After the support from Google, we recorded
about 400,000 downloads for about two months,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.460
and
our sales revenue reached about 140 million

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.460
won.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.980
Of course, South Korea was the country that
loved our game the most.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.430
But downloads and sales revenue from the other
regions, including the United States, also

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.560
represented about 60%.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.790
One of the advantages of developing Android
games is the Google Play Game Service.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.450
This service enables developers to easily
access ready-to-use features required for

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.410
games, including ranking, achievements and
quests,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.860
and of course we have benefited a lot from
the service.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.270
You can also find a variety of statistics
in Google Play's developer console.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.860
The best part is that developers can communicate
with their users directly by replying to their

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.881
reviews,
and this definitely differentiates the console

00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:57.881
from others.

00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:02.090
The success of "ZOMEBIE JUDGEMENT DAY" and
"INFINITY DUNGEON" on the Google Play Store

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.100
gave us some much-needed funds.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.229
So we are satisfied that we can develop games
in a more affordable environment now.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.709
I think that while it is important to ensure
the completeness of a game,

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.150
it is more advantageous to release a game
early when it reaches a certain degree of

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
completion
and receive feedback from users and update

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.150
it, continuing to improve its service.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.950
We want Zabob Studio to become a "couple-run"
global game developer by pursuing this strategy.
