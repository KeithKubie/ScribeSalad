00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:09.517
(upbeat ethereal music)

00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:12.334
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:14.667
bipedal, naked, large brain,

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:21.686
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:25.922
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:29.275
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:31.358
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:34.640
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.557
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.622
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.977 --> 00:00:45.144
We shape the future from our
shared understand of the past.

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.197
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.197 --> 00:00:54.364
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:58.942
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:00.525
of humans like you.

00:01:22.113 --> 00:01:25.446
(upbeat staccato music)

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.707
(upbeat techno music)

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.359
- So, before I start, let me
explain the general approach

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.240
that I'm taking to the theme
of this symposium today.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.384
As an anthropologist, my first
port of call for addressing

00:01:54.384 --> 00:01:57.869
any question about human
beings has to be the place

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.080
where I've done field work.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.640
This is because while all
human beings are confronted

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.169
by the same fundamental
questions, and approach them

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:10.982
through the same fundamental
capacities that are afforded

00:02:10.982 --> 00:02:15.330
by their minds and bodies,
they always bring to the task

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.412
of framing the questions
and finding the answers,

00:02:18.412 --> 00:02:21.545
tools that are specific to
the historical and cultural

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:25.126
context in which they live and die.

00:02:25.126 --> 00:02:28.209
And to talk sensibly
about the human beings,

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.475
their questions and answers,

00:02:30.475 --> 00:02:33.566
one has to know this context well.

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:38.382
So, let me take you to Betania,
a small fishing village

00:02:38.382 --> 00:02:41.012
on the west coast of Madagascar.

00:02:41.012 --> 00:02:44.637
The inhabitants are fishing
folk who describe themselves

00:02:44.637 --> 00:02:47.648
as Vezo, people of the sea.

00:02:47.648 --> 00:02:49.871
This is where I've done
field work, on and off,

00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:52.383
for the past 30 years.

00:02:52.383 --> 00:02:55.593
During this time, I've
seen babies being born,

00:02:55.593 --> 00:02:59.760
children grow into adults,
adults age into wise elders,

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.252
and lots of people of all
ages die and been buried

00:03:04.252 --> 00:03:06.104
in the village cemetery.

00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:08.863
In Betania, when someone
dies, the whole village

00:03:08.863 --> 00:03:10.634
springs into action.

00:03:10.634 --> 00:03:13.919
Depending on the age and
the status of the deceased,

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:18.850
the funeral proceedings last
between one and four days.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.883
Each day villagers are expected
to attend two communal meals

00:03:22.883 --> 00:03:24.116
and a vigil.

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:27.902
As you can imagine, organizing
such events is a huge

00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:30.869
undertaking for the bereaved family.

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:33.835
And while a few individuals
are in charge of preparing

00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:36.886
the corpse and of dealing
with the deceased's closest

00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:40.503
and most distressed relatives,
the vast majority of

00:03:40.503 --> 00:03:44.902
family members will be busy
dealing with other things.

00:03:44.902 --> 00:03:48.100
Their first task is to
formally announce the death

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.860
to everyone who has a right to be told.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.404
A young boy is sent to all
the households in the village,

00:03:54.404 --> 00:03:57.956
older youths are dispatched
to more distant locations.

00:03:57.956 --> 00:04:00.468
A text is delivered to the radio station

00:04:00.468 --> 00:04:04.581
in the nearest town, a text
which announces who has died

00:04:04.581 --> 00:04:07.520
and lists all the names of
all the people the death

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.251
is being announced to.

00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:13.697
Meanwhile, money is urgently
collected from family members.

00:04:13.697 --> 00:04:16.533
The money is needed to buy
the vast quantities of rice

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:19.784
and meat for the communal
meals and the rum and coffee

00:04:19.784 --> 00:04:21.308
for the vigils.

00:04:21.308 --> 00:04:24.077
It is important that the
crowds are not let down,

00:04:24.077 --> 00:04:28.068
for example, by serving them
beans or fish instead of meat,

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:31.324
or by running out of rum
halfway through the night.

00:04:31.324 --> 00:04:32.930
(audience laughing)

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.657
It is shameful, mahamenatra,
to fail to pull it off.

00:04:37.657 --> 00:04:40.411
Not only because this shows
that the most immediate family

00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:44.487
doesn't have the necessary
resources but also,

00:04:44.487 --> 00:04:47.530
and perhaps most importantly,
because it shows that they

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.153
don't have enough relations
willing to help them out.

00:04:51.153 --> 00:04:53.784
In fact, everyone in
attendance is supposed to make

00:04:53.784 --> 00:04:56.298
a monetary contribution.

00:04:56.298 --> 00:05:00.375
As the crowds assemble, the
elders of the bereaved family

00:05:00.375 --> 00:05:03.827
set themselves up in one of their houses.

00:05:03.827 --> 00:05:07.693
There they receive representatives
of each of the village

00:05:07.693 --> 00:05:10.205
households and those
visitors who have come

00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:12.257
from further field.

00:05:12.257 --> 00:05:15.885
After a certain amount of
highly formalized exchanges,

00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:18.557
the visitors produce an
envelope while insisting

00:05:18.557 --> 00:05:22.140
that it's nothing big,
just a little thing.

00:05:23.075 --> 00:05:26.748
The envelope is accepted
by the elders who insist

00:05:26.748 --> 00:05:30.081
that it's not small, but a big thing.

00:05:30.081 --> 00:05:33.368
After some more back and
forth, the visitors leave,

00:05:33.368 --> 00:05:36.702
the envelope is opened, the money counted,

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:41.391
and the amount carefully written
down in a special notebook.

00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:44.433
The visitors will have
done the same at their end

00:05:44.433 --> 00:05:47.862
consulting their notebooks
to find out how much

00:05:47.862 --> 00:05:51.157
they had received from the
bereaved family last time they,

00:05:51.157 --> 00:05:54.074
themselves, had a funeral.

00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:58.057
And noting down the amounts
they're now contributing.

00:05:58.057 --> 00:06:00.192
In this way, all the time,

00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:03.682
people ensure that they
reciprocate the contributions

00:06:03.682 --> 00:06:07.026
they have received, thus
maintaining good relations

00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:08.837
and not losing face.

00:06:08.837 --> 00:06:11.759
This kind of reciprocation
doesn't always work

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.135
but it's always closely monitored.

00:06:14.135 --> 00:06:17.626
Such-and-such a family has
brought less than expected.

00:06:17.626 --> 00:06:19.843
Is it because they're
really struggling or because

00:06:19.843 --> 00:06:21.939
they are trying to slight us?

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.368
Another family has brought much more.

00:06:24.368 --> 00:06:27.582
Are they just being generous
or are they testing us

00:06:27.582 --> 00:06:28.896
to see whether we can match

00:06:28.896 --> 00:06:31.774
their contribution in the future?

00:06:31.774 --> 00:06:34.238
Now the reason I'm mentioning all of this,

00:06:34.238 --> 00:06:37.316
the announcing, the collecting,
the giving, the receiving,

00:06:37.316 --> 00:06:40.988
the writing down is that
these are the activities

00:06:40.988 --> 00:06:42.965
that dominate the funeral.

00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:47.362
Of course, funerals wouldn't
happen if there was no death.

00:06:47.362 --> 00:06:50.653
But the point I wish to stress
is that for the vast majority

00:06:50.653 --> 00:06:54.606
of people, the deceased is
actually quite peripheral

00:06:54.606 --> 00:06:58.037
to their experience and preoccupations.

00:06:58.037 --> 00:07:02.645
The same applies to their
emotional experience.

00:07:02.645 --> 00:07:05.970
Of course they are close
family members who are highly

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.137
distressed and grief stricken,
but for most participants

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:14.478
funerals elicit a variety
of emotions ranging from

00:07:14.478 --> 00:07:18.633
plain boredom to
alcohol-induced exhilaration,

00:07:18.633 --> 00:07:20.133
to sexual arousal.

00:07:21.144 --> 00:07:24.276
This last one applies
especially to youths who find

00:07:24.276 --> 00:07:27.443
in funerals the welcome
opportunity to meet visitors

00:07:27.443 --> 00:07:30.088
from distant villages who, with any luck,

00:07:30.088 --> 00:07:33.299
are not genealogically
related to them and are thus

00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:34.995
permissible sexual partners.

00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:38.945
Indeed, it's well known that
many long-lasting marriages

00:07:38.945 --> 00:07:41.289
started at the edges of a vigil.

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:43.056
(audience laughing)

00:07:43.056 --> 00:07:47.007
Now, to put all this into
context, consider that

00:07:47.007 --> 00:07:50.380
say for the crowds that
gather for the much rarer

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.001
construction of tombs, events
which are planned in advance

00:07:54.001 --> 00:07:58.168
and are announced, and therefore
have a better attendance,

00:07:59.218 --> 00:08:02.303
funerals are the largest
gatherings of people

00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:04.730
that villagers participate in.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.727
And they're events which give
them a firsthand experience

00:08:08.727 --> 00:08:12.797
of the large scale social
system to which they belong.

00:08:12.797 --> 00:08:15.510
Here are these hundreds of other people,

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.945
and he were are, my parents,
my children, my siblings,

00:08:19.945 --> 00:08:24.112
my in-laws, just one note of
this vast network of relations.

00:08:27.195 --> 00:08:30.938
And while funerals give people
a snapshot of the existing

00:08:30.938 --> 00:08:34.724
social landscape, they're also
occasions for acting on it

00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:36.255
and changing its shape.

00:08:36.255 --> 00:08:40.246
For example, by extending or
withdrawing the announcement

00:08:40.246 --> 00:08:43.760
of the death, by succeeding
or failing to put on

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.294
a good funeral, by giving a
small or a large or a balanced

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:51.835
contribution, and most
literally, by having sex,

00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:55.658
which has the potential of
adding new life to the mix.

00:08:55.658 --> 00:08:58.665
You will have noticed that
quite deliberately I've led you

00:08:58.665 --> 00:09:01.960
away from the deceased
and the raw emotions

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.855
that surround death.

00:09:03.855 --> 00:09:06.644
I've done so to dispel
the commonsense assumption

00:09:06.644 --> 00:09:11.112
that funerals are essentially
about death and grief

00:09:11.112 --> 00:09:15.086
and to stress the point that
they are instead largely about

00:09:15.086 --> 00:09:18.336
the gathering of crowds, the
expectations and obligations

00:09:18.336 --> 00:09:21.620
that people have, the
appraisal and manipulation

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.584
of the social relations
in which they live.

00:09:24.584 --> 00:09:28.751
Still, there is a dead body
at the center of it all.

00:09:29.771 --> 00:09:33.932
A body that is fast decomposing
and that, sooner or later,

00:09:33.932 --> 00:09:38.213
must be removed from the
village, taken to the cemetery,

00:09:38.213 --> 00:09:42.380
and placed inside a tomb, one
of the many large enclosures

00:09:44.092 --> 00:09:46.850
that are scattered around the sand dunes.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.754
Once the body is buried, an
elder gives an explanatory

00:09:50.754 --> 00:09:54.921
speech informing the other
dead of what has just happened.

00:09:56.022 --> 00:09:59.527
He will then state that
the deceased has arrived

00:09:59.527 --> 00:10:03.308
at the place where he is, plasy misy azy,

00:10:03.308 --> 00:10:06.385
but nothing more is left to
be done and that the crowd

00:10:06.385 --> 00:10:08.734
should now disperse and go home.

00:10:08.734 --> 00:10:13.668
The place where he or she
is is a misleadingly simple

00:10:13.668 --> 00:10:17.566
expression which, in
fact, captures key aspects

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:21.733
of the existential transformation
brought about by death.

00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:26.207
First note that this is not
an expression that is used

00:10:26.207 --> 00:10:29.283
to refer to the journeys of living people.

00:10:29.283 --> 00:10:32.982
Living people arrive here and
there but they don't arrive

00:10:32.982 --> 00:10:35.245
at the place where they are.

00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:36.892
This makes sense because living people

00:10:36.892 --> 00:10:38.582
are always on the move.

00:10:38.582 --> 00:10:41.750
They leave, they arrive,
and then they move on.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.004
Dead people, by contrast,
arrive inside their tombs

00:10:45.004 --> 00:10:47.308
and there they stay.

00:10:47.308 --> 00:10:49.814
Second, the expression
draws attention to the fact

00:10:49.814 --> 00:10:53.641
that the deceased arrives
at that specific place,

00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:56.228
this tomb, not another one.

00:10:56.228 --> 00:10:59.764
The choice of tomb is a
highly contentious affair.

00:10:59.764 --> 00:11:02.612
This is because as people
often told me by way of

00:11:02.612 --> 00:11:06.616
explanation, we can't cut
up corpses into pieces.

00:11:06.616 --> 00:11:10.109
In other words, the
deceased cannot be buried

00:11:10.109 --> 00:11:11.942
in more than one tomb.

00:11:12.864 --> 00:11:16.073
In theory, the choice
of burial is determined

00:11:16.073 --> 00:11:19.258
by strict rules which
say that children's bones

00:11:19.258 --> 00:11:23.051
belong to their mother unless
the father acquires them

00:11:23.051 --> 00:11:25.269
through ritual means.

00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:28.518
In practice, lots of other
factors can feed into

00:11:28.518 --> 00:11:30.116
the final decision.

00:11:30.116 --> 00:11:32.962
But the point is that
when the decision is made,

00:11:32.962 --> 00:11:34.206
it is final.

00:11:34.206 --> 00:11:37.437
The overall point I want
to get across is this.

00:11:37.437 --> 00:11:40.687
By the placing the dead in
the place where they are,

00:11:40.687 --> 00:11:44.107
the living create a radically
different social system

00:11:44.107 --> 00:11:47.567
to the one they experience
when they are alive.

00:11:47.567 --> 00:11:50.074
A system that lacks movement

00:11:50.074 --> 00:11:52.991
the dead arrive once and for all.

00:11:52.991 --> 00:11:56.364
A system that is not open to negotiation.

00:11:56.364 --> 00:11:58.951
The dead are either here or there.

00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:01.429
A system of social
relations that are no longer

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.357
a work in progress.

00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:06.809
The dead are no longer
susceptible to the vagaries

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:10.058
of personal success and
failures, likes and dislikes,

00:12:10.058 --> 00:12:12.647
distance and proximity, and so on.

00:12:12.647 --> 00:12:16.795
From this perspective, it's
not surprising that the tombs,

00:12:16.795 --> 00:12:19.250
which create this
alternative social system,

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.546
are the most solid and lasting
structures that people build.

00:12:23.546 --> 00:12:26.799
They used to be made of
hard wood but once cement

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:28.891
became available in the '60s,

00:12:28.891 --> 00:12:32.496
it soon became the
material of choice because,

00:12:32.496 --> 00:12:37.252
as people say, it's harder,
more durable, and movable.

00:12:37.252 --> 00:12:40.485
Given the eerie stillness of corpses,

00:12:40.485 --> 00:12:43.106
it's also not surprising that humans,

00:12:43.106 --> 00:12:46.837
not just in Madagascar, imagine
the transition from life

00:12:46.837 --> 00:12:50.078
to death as one that
turns the movement of life

00:12:50.078 --> 00:12:53.151
into immobility and that
removes the deceased

00:12:53.151 --> 00:12:56.061
from the give and take
of human interactions

00:12:56.061 --> 00:12:57.787
as we've just seen.

00:12:57.787 --> 00:13:01.190
But humans, not just in
Madagascar, seem also prone

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.837
to imagine something a
little more paradoxical.

00:13:04.837 --> 00:13:08.244
Namely that the social
systems created through death

00:13:08.244 --> 00:13:10.254
are long lasting.

00:13:10.254 --> 00:13:13.652
That they transcend the now on, now off,

00:13:13.652 --> 00:13:15.957
temporality of life.

00:13:15.957 --> 00:13:20.470
For this to happen, however,
something has to give.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.538
To put it in the most general terms,

00:13:23.538 --> 00:13:26.666
the complexity of life has to be reduced,

00:13:26.666 --> 00:13:29.571
the makeup of the living
person has to be stripped down

00:13:29.571 --> 00:13:33.210
to its core, its essence
has to be distilled

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.745
out of its many entanglements.

00:13:35.745 --> 00:13:38.730
Only when this happens can
people begin to imagine

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.186
that the present is just
a replica of the past

00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:45.496
and that the future will be
a replica of the present.

00:13:45.496 --> 00:13:47.706
In other words, they can
begin to imagine a system

00:13:47.706 --> 00:13:50.758
that defies the passage of time.

00:13:50.758 --> 00:13:53.129
I'm getting ahead of myself
here so let me give you

00:13:53.129 --> 00:13:55.385
a couple of examples to illustrate

00:13:55.385 --> 00:13:57.635
where I'm actually heading.

00:13:58.747 --> 00:14:03.661
First, to the Vezo, the living,
people say, have at least

00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:06.411
eight ancestral lines of descent.

00:14:07.355 --> 00:14:09.994
Those of their eight great grandparents.

00:14:09.994 --> 00:14:13.808
In fact, they would have more
if they could remember them.

00:14:13.808 --> 00:14:17.975
This means that in life,
each person is made up of

00:14:18.969 --> 00:14:23.308
at least eight known ancestral
parts which are unique

00:14:23.308 --> 00:14:26.489
to that person because only that person

00:14:26.489 --> 00:14:29.642
and her full siblings share
that exact combination

00:14:29.642 --> 00:14:32.093
of ancestral sources.

00:14:32.093 --> 00:14:34.104
And so when that person dies,

00:14:34.104 --> 00:14:37.507
that unique combination
also comes to an end.

00:14:37.507 --> 00:14:40.256
But now imagine that
when that person dies,

00:14:40.256 --> 00:14:43.121
she's buried inside
the tomb which contains

00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:47.173
only individuals who share
one of her eight ancestral

00:14:47.173 --> 00:14:48.649
lines of descent.

00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:52.424
In being placed there, all of
these individuals had seven

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:55.449
of their ancestral lines stripped away,

00:14:55.449 --> 00:14:59.697
thus being reduced to that
one that they have in common.

00:14:59.697 --> 00:15:02.561
And so instead of being
unique combinations that are

00:15:02.561 --> 00:15:07.108
here today and gone tomorrow,
they all become a replica

00:15:07.108 --> 00:15:11.548
of one another, a continuation
of that one line of ancestry.

00:15:11.548 --> 00:15:15.064
And so in and through death,
people begin to imagine

00:15:15.064 --> 00:15:19.075
a social grouping, what Vezo
called one kind of people,

00:15:19.075 --> 00:15:22.186
and anthropologists call
a unilineal descent group,

00:15:22.186 --> 00:15:25.341
which has continuity through time.

00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:27.801
Let me briefly turn to
another example to explain

00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:31.036
why death, in particular,
is such a powerful moment

00:15:31.036 --> 00:15:34.197
for imagining this type of continuity.

00:15:34.197 --> 00:15:37.188
For this I draw on the
work of anthropologist,

00:15:37.188 --> 00:15:41.278
Martha Macintyre, who has worked
on the island of Tubetube,

00:15:41.278 --> 00:15:43.569
one of the many islands
in the Masima region

00:15:43.569 --> 00:15:44.839
of Papua, New Guinea.

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:47.791
Here, as in many other
places in this region,

00:15:47.791 --> 00:15:50.540
the social groupings
that last through time

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.707
are named matrilineages, each
made up of all the people

00:15:55.825 --> 00:15:58.155
who can trace descent through women

00:15:58.155 --> 00:16:01.146
to the same female forebear.

00:16:01.146 --> 00:16:04.055
People here have a folk
theory of the human body

00:16:04.055 --> 00:16:08.222
which says that bones are
made up of mother's milk,

00:16:09.226 --> 00:16:12.751
which in turn is passed
from mother to daughter,

00:16:12.751 --> 00:16:14.474
down the generations.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:17.503
The bones, in other words,
are quintessentially maternal

00:16:17.503 --> 00:16:20.656
substance which is sourced all the way up

00:16:20.656 --> 00:16:23.178
to that founding female forebear.

00:16:23.178 --> 00:16:26.126
This means that quite
literally the members of the

00:16:26.126 --> 00:16:29.856
matrilineage share the exact same bones.

00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:34.772
When it comes to bones,
they are one kind of people.

00:16:34.772 --> 00:16:39.490
Each person, just a replica
of one another through time.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.604
But you can see the
problem with this idea.

00:16:42.604 --> 00:16:46.416
Living people, kicking,
screaming, crawling babies

00:16:46.416 --> 00:16:48.666
are not made of just bones.

00:16:50.264 --> 00:16:54.431
To be viable persons they
also need blood and flesh.

00:16:55.836 --> 00:16:59.355
This soft and wobbly stuff,
the folk theory goes,

00:16:59.355 --> 00:17:01.243
comes from the father.

00:17:01.243 --> 00:17:04.641
And because one's father belongs
to a different matrilineage

00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:06.282
from that of one's mother,

00:17:06.282 --> 00:17:08.579
the marriage would
otherwise be incestuous,

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:13.208
the living person can only
ever be a mixed-up person,

00:17:13.208 --> 00:17:17.670
an idiosyncratic combination
of these maternal bones

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.910
and those paternal blood and flesh.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.357
A combination which, like
the eight ancestral sources

00:17:24.357 --> 00:17:28.830
of the Vezo, is here
today and gone tomorrow.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.830
However, death resolves the problem.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:36.619
Quite literally, the process
of decomposition gets rid

00:17:36.619 --> 00:17:41.580
of the paternal stuff, leaving
just the maternal bones.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:46.202
In addition, funerals consist
of complex transactions

00:17:46.202 --> 00:17:50.793
in which goods that represent
flesh and blood are sent

00:17:50.793 --> 00:17:54.297
back to the family of the
father of the deceased,

00:17:54.297 --> 00:17:57.281
which originally
contributed to the person.

00:17:57.281 --> 00:18:01.051
In this way, funerals are
thought to de-conceive

00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:03.677
the person who has just died.

00:18:03.677 --> 00:18:06.836
As a result of all this,
the people of Tubetube

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:10.402
come to imagine the essence
of their matrilineage,

00:18:10.402 --> 00:18:14.906
the bones in their pure
and unadulterated form

00:18:14.906 --> 00:18:17.364
as lasting through time.

00:18:17.364 --> 00:18:21.129
Originating in the ancestral
past and ready to be passed on

00:18:21.129 --> 00:18:23.055
to the next generation.

00:18:23.055 --> 00:18:27.766
This, then, is why death
is a source of celebration.

00:18:27.766 --> 00:18:31.451
Sure, people are born to
produce, age, and die.

00:18:31.451 --> 00:18:35.169
As individuals they are here
today and gone tomorrow.

00:18:35.169 --> 00:18:38.566
But death lends itself,
aided by a lot of ritual

00:18:38.566 --> 00:18:42.053
and imaginative work, to
the creation of systems

00:18:42.053 --> 00:18:44.880
of social relations between
the dead and the living,

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.888
between the living and the unborn,

00:18:46.888 --> 00:18:50.285
which are long lasting,
defy the passage of time,

00:18:50.285 --> 00:18:53.042
and transcend death itself.

00:18:53.042 --> 00:18:56.040
Let me conclude with a
reflection on the contemporary

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.834
relevance of what I've
presented you today,

00:18:58.834 --> 00:19:03.263
drawing on material from some
very far off lands and people.

00:19:03.263 --> 00:19:06.462
The reflection is that there
is an obvious dark side

00:19:06.462 --> 00:19:08.669
to the celebration.

00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:11.331
A dark side, which my Vezo friends,

00:19:11.331 --> 00:19:14.533
I just state this without
having time to explain,

00:19:14.533 --> 00:19:18.700
have found ways of overcoming
but others have not.

00:19:20.093 --> 00:19:23.292
The dark side is that, as
you might have noticed,

00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:26.735
the process of creating
long lasting social systems

00:19:26.735 --> 00:19:30.674
based on kinds of people
that are nicely sorted

00:19:30.674 --> 00:19:35.380
into separate tombs or based
on the recovery of pure

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.052
and pristine bones gives rise
to a kind of essentialist

00:19:40.052 --> 00:19:44.270
thinking that can very quickly
turn into ethnic hatred,

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.206
parochial nationalism,
and racial discrimination.

00:19:48.206 --> 00:19:52.185
So that instead of building
walls around the dead,

00:19:52.185 --> 00:19:56.733
we find walls sprouting up
everywhere to divide people

00:19:56.733 --> 00:19:59.804
who are believed to be
essentially like us from people

00:19:59.804 --> 00:20:02.915
who are believed to be
essentially different from us.

00:20:02.915 --> 00:20:06.065
And when this happens,
the celebration is over.

00:20:06.065 --> 00:20:06.965
Thank you.

00:20:06.965 --> 00:20:10.235
(audience applauding)

00:20:10.235 --> 00:20:13.652
(upbeat ethereal music)
