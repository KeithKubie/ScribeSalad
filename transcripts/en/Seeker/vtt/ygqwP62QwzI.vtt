00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.690
We all know space rocks, but what about the
rocks in space?

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.090
Asteroids, Comets, and Meteors are hurtling
through the solar system.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.089
So how do you tell them apart and which rocks
could hit our planet? Comets pass near Earth

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.150
but they never make it to the surface.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.920
These cosmic snowballs form overtime in the
outer reaches of the solar system and are

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.420
made up of ice, rock and metal.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.180
If a comet gets too close to the sun, some
of the ice heats up and turns into a gas,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.170
creating a glowy layer and that famous tail.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.690
If a comet were to shed its ice, it’d become
an asteroid.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.690
Meh.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.510
These space rocks can be as big as an entire
country or as small as a chihuahua head.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.329
Most of the time, you can find them hanging
out in the asteroid belt, a rocky superhighway

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.250
between Mars and Jupiter.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.790
Pieces of rock that break off asteroids and
comets are called meteoroids.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.070
When a meteoroid enters the Earth’s atmosphere,
it burns up and causes friction that results

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.730
in a light phenomena.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.540
The streak of light is known as a meteor or
a shooting star.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.869
And if a meteoroid lands on Earth’s surface,
ah runaway, it becomes a meteorite.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.759
So the next time you’re gazing at the sky
at a shooting star, you’ll know exactly

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.450
what it is… and exactly what it isn’t.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.549
You can catch more episodes of Galactic Glossary
every Wednesday and to learn more about space

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.299
rocks, like the one that triggered the demise
of the dinosaurs, check out this video here.
