00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.660
- [Narrator] Miguel tracked
how much sleep he got

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.660
for 50 consecutive days and
made a histogram of the results.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.730
Which interval contains
the median sleep amount?

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.400
And so they're saying is it
this interval on the histogram

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.530
from six to 6.5, or this one
or this one, or any of these.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.680
Which of these intervals
contain the median.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.570
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.970
All right now let's work
through this together.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.050
And let's just remind ourselves
how we find the median.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.050
If I had the data points 11,
nine, seven, three, and two,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.860
the way that we find the
median is we can order it

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.680
from least to greatest or
actually you could do it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.640
from greatest to least, but
let's do least to greatest.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.170
So two, three, seven, nine, 11.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.790
And the median would be the middle number.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.030
And I have a clear middle number

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.550
because I have five data points.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.080
If I have an even number of data points,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.300
I still would want to order
them from least to greatest,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.300
so let's say that I have a
one, one, three, and a seven.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.750
But here, you don't have a clear middle.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.900
So the median would be the
mean of the middle two numbers.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.230
So in this situation,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.900
Miguel has an even number of data points.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.900
So the median would be the mean

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.900
of the 25th and 26th data point.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.460
These would be the middle two data points.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.220
So which interval here contains

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.540
the 25th and the 26th data point?

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.360
Well, we can start at the bottom.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.110
So we have, actually let's
just look at each interval

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.750
and think about how many
data points they have in it.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.450
This one has two, this one has nine,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.980
this one has 12, and I'm just reading out

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.300
how many data points there are
in each of these intervals.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.300
This one has 12, this one
has 11, see that there.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.343
This one has two and this one has two.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.630
So if we look at just this,
we have the two lowest,

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.830
if we look at the two
bottom intervals combined

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.790
we have the 11 lowest.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.970
If we look at the three bottom intervals,

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.900
we have the 11 plus, 12,
you have the 23 lowest.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.600
So this is the 23 lowest data points.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.600
And so the 24th, 25th, 26th, the next 12

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.410
data points starting from the bottom,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.850
starting from the lowest are going to be

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.640
in this next interval here.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.250
And we care about the 25th and the 26th,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.660
so they're definitely going
to be in this interval

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.563
from 7.5 hours of sleep
to eight hours of sleep.
