00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.360
PROFESSOR: I'm very
interested in teaching in ways

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.420
that really help you learn.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.640
And one of the most
difficult things to learn

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.960
is when you have to unlearn
something you believe.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.250
So if you have learned
a concept wrong

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.630
in your previous
education and learnings,

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.973
your mind is really
reluctant to let go of it.

00:00:46.973 --> 00:00:47.960
OK?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.140
And I have a wife who is a
middle school science teacher.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.860
She also has a PhD in biology.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.750
But she really studies
to understand kids

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.050
and how they learn.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.500
And MIT students aren't much
different from 6th graders,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.541
to tell you the truth,
when it comes to learning.

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:04.144
None of us are.

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:05.935
But they're just a
little more transparent.

00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:13.430
What you can do to help a
person unlearn something they've

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.960
learned wrong, the
best time is when

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.980
you run into something
called a "discrepant event."

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.685
So when you think
you know the answer,

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:23.850
and I'm asking you these
questions, and you're wrong,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.730
really try to figure
out what it is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.250
you believe that
led you to that,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.372
and see if you can undo that
in getting to the answer.

00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:32.830
So some of these
concept questions,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.440
if you'd like to talk
about them further,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.800
I think they're great for
discussions in your recitation

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.300
section.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.940
Look at Professor Gossard here.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.620
So talk about these
things, and really try

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.690
to get to the bottom
of why you perhaps

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.040
had a concept that wasn't
quite up to what you needed.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.080
OK.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.670
We're going to move on.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.910
OK.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.850
Now we're going to get on
to talking about velocities

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.290
in rotating frames.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.690
And by velocities, I
also mean derivatives

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.320
of vectors in rotating frames.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.800
Just to give you a quick
reminder of where we started

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.900
this conversation,
this is concept

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:36.320
if you have three points-- A,
B, and O in this fixed frame.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:44.240
This is r A with respect
to O, B with respect to A,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.550
and B with respect
to O, all vectors.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.900
And we're interested
in computing

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.150
the velocities of,
say, point B. So we

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.880
were talking about the
derivative with respect

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.650
to time of this vector.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.360
And we can make it up as a sum
of the derivatives with respect

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.930
to time of these
other two vectors.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.370
But now there's a
really important point.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.870
When you're taking
time derivatives,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.450
you have to be
explicit about what

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.765
it's with respect to--
what frame of reference

00:03:28.765 --> 00:03:29.640
you're talking about.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.580
In this case we want to know
the velocity with respect

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.110
to this reference frame.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.520
So both of these
derivatives have

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.640
to be taken with
respect to that frame.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.780
Well this one's easy.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.000
This is purely translational.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.980
It has nothing to do
with rotations, or won't.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.910
We're going to think in terms
of having an object out here.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.320
So maybe a rigid body to which
we have attached a rotating

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.660
frame at A. And I'll call
this the rotating reference

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.200
frame A x prime y prime.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.260
And it might be rotating.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.000
But this point is just the
point with which we describe

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.520
the translation of the body.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.150
So this one's pretty easy.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.029
This one's just the velocity
of A with respect to O.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:21.800
But this one has complications.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.210
And I'm going to do it first,
the answer to this, just

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.110
intuitively-- appeal
to your intuition

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.710
about why this should be.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.910
So this is my merry-go-round.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.180
And I've set up my
little coordinate system.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.200
This is my A, x prime y
prime coordinate system.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.000
I've stuck my dog
here on the x-axis.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.280
And if he's running
some direction,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.550
he has a velocity with respect
to this reference frame.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.210
If you're here at A, watch
it, and you'll see him moving.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.400
And it will have nothing
to do with the rotation.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.410
You will just see
the dog moving.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.260
And if this is rotating, and
you're sitting there rotating

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.650
with it watching the dog, does
the motion of the dog change?

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.670
You just see it just
the same way, right?

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:12.260
OK.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.340
So there's one part of the
motion of the dog that's

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.340
with respect to
this frame that has

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.540
nothing to do with rotation.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.250
OK.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.050
So now let's say in an outside,
and from an outside point

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.800
of view, if we
measure the velocity

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.620
of the dog with respect
to point A-- that's

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.250
the one you can see-- and
to observer outside says

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.580
what's the velocity of
dog with respect to A,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.275
will the answer differ
if there's rotation?

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.360
OK.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.590
Now, what we're
going to find out

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.580
is that there's actually
two contributions.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.840
So the dog running with
respect to this merry-go-round

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.930
is one contribution
to the velocity.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.410
There's another contribution
that comes from the fact

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.700
that you're sitting
out there watching,

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.180
and you see definitely the dog
move when the thing rotates,

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.880
right?

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.380
OK.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.880
And if we only do that,
if the only rotation--

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.430
and we'll do a case where
the dog's not running, just

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.280
sitting still--
what's the velocity

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.165
of the dog with respect to
point A due to the rotation?

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.820
I mean you've done lots
of problems like this.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.470
This is just pure
rotation problem.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.980
You know the angular
rate-- theta dot, or omega.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.300
What's the velocity of
point B if point A is fixed

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.730
and this thing rotates?

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.780
r omega.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.900
You all know that.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.840
OK.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.540
And then we'll call the velocity
of the dog relative to point

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.280
A due to the fact that he
is moving in this frame,

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.040
we'll call that
velocity to the dog.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.520
From the point of view of in the
frame is a different quantity.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.622
They're both vectors, and
you can add them together.

00:07:04.622 --> 00:07:06.205
So in fact the
answer-- I'm just going

00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:09.720
to give you the answer to this
problem-- the answer to this

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.860
is the velocity of
A with respect to O

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:24.010
plus the derivative of r B/A
with respect to time as seen

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:29.660
from within the A
xyz prime frame,

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.710
plus a term here
due to rotation.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:41.640
And we know that the magnitude
of this answer is some r omega.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.045
We know it looks like r omega.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.760
So to interpret this as
meaning the derivative

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:55.500
of this vector-- this thing--
as if you were in the frame.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.450
And that accounts
for the dog running.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.850
This is just the dog running.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.360
And mathematically, I
actually find it easier

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.310
to say what this
piece means is this

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.180
is the velocity of
the dog with respect

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:20.960
to A with omega equal to 0.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.870
It's the same thing.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.490
This is what you see
if there's no rotation.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.100
That piece.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.980
And this is the
piece with rotation.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.350
But I want you to think
something through here.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.760
Come on.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.419
I'm still learning
how to do this.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:42.919
OK.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.590
So I have my little
reference frames like this.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.620
I'm going to rotate it in this
direction, which given xyz

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.570
ought to be in that direction.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.680
So the rotation rate,
if it's going like this,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.100
I'm going to give
it a constant value,

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:05.620
is that the vector omega is some
omega in the k hat direction,

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.270
right?

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:16.540
And I have on this
body-- here's my wheel,

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:23.770
and here's B, and here's A.
And this is my little x-axis,

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.230
my x-prime axis.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:31.240
And it has associated with it
a lowercase i hat unit vector.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.910
And off in this
direction then would

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.860
be the y prime with
a j hat unit vector.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.700
OK.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.340
So what's the vector r B/A?

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.290
How would you write it in vector
notation in components here?

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.820
So this is r B/A
from here to here.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.313
And what's its direction?

00:09:57.313 --> 00:09:59.240
AUDIENCE: i hat?

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.249
PROFESSOR: i hat.

00:10:00.249 --> 00:10:01.540
And is it positive or negative?

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.110
So this is the vector.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:15.210
At some magnitude r B/A in
the positive i hat direction,

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.860
the arrow goes,
when you say r B/A,

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.280
this is B with respect to
A, the arrow goes with B.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.485
So this, it's
positive r B/A i hat.

00:10:25.485 --> 00:10:29.690
And what is the velocity that
we have discovered up here,

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.350
the velocity of B
with respect to A as

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.980
measured inside of A xyz?

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.180
That's this piece here.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.777
In vector terms?

00:10:41.777 --> 00:10:43.610
And we've figured out
what its velocity was.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.320
It's some r omega.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.320
The r's r B/A-- the magnitude,
the length of that r.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.040
Clearly got to be this
length right here.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.800
And the omega is given.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.180
So what direction?

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.896
You know that the
magnitudes are omega.

00:11:00.896 --> 00:11:01.770
What's the direction?

00:11:07.764 --> 00:11:08.730
AUDIENCE: j hat?

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.438
PROFESSOR: j hat.

00:11:09.438 --> 00:11:10.470
OK.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.360
So what we're saying
is the velocity

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:21.160
of B with respect to A as seen
from inside this A frame is

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:31.780
r B/A omega with respect to
O in the j hat direction.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.996
Now this has a k
associated with it.

00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:37.370
That has an i
associated with it.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.550
And this has a j
associated with it.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:43.164
So as a product r omega,
what kind of product is it?

00:11:43.164 --> 00:11:44.330
What you know about vectors?

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.630
What does it have to be?

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.160
Is it a dot product
between omega and r?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.242
Is it a cross product?

00:11:51.242 --> 00:11:52.960
I hear somebody
saying cross product.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.880
But what's the order?

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.380
So I want you to figure
out-- just deduce

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.230
what the vector
notation is that gets

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.749
you the right velocity--
the correct velocity--

00:12:01.749 --> 00:12:03.415
correct magnitude and
correct direction.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.150
So the answer is
positive r omega j.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.550
AUDIENCE: Omega cross r?

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.510
PROFESSOR: Omega.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.850
AUDIENCE: Cross to the r?

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:20.891
PROFESSOR: Omega cross r.

00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:29.660
So I hear one person, omega
with respect to O cross r B/A.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.220
And these are now both vectors.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.390
Anybody else?

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.989
So if we just think
about unit vector,

00:12:34.989 --> 00:12:36.030
actually, let's check it.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.880
This is k hat direction.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.170
This was i hat direction.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.330
And k cross i is positive j.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.015
So that works.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.980
So in general-- this is,
in fact, the correct answer

00:12:51.980 --> 00:13:01.370
in general-- is that this term
here is omega with respect

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:09.260
to O cross r B/A. You're
going to use that a lot.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:20.500
So to summarize, then--
while that's coming down,

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:30.620
the velocity of this dog
in a stationary frame where

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:35.150
A is stationary for a moment is
entirely due to the rotation,

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.320
and it's omega cross r B/A.
And now if the dog starts

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.470
to run with respect to
this reference frame,

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.520
he has some velocity,
which is the other piece

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.400
is velocity of B with
respect to A as seen from A--

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.610
or as you would compute,
you'd just set momentarily,

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.380
omega equal to zero.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.840
And finally then, the
total formula for velocity.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.720
So the velocity
of B with respect

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.280
to O-- some point on a
rotating reference frame--

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:15.696
is the velocity of
the frame plus--

00:14:15.696 --> 00:14:18.330
I won't write it as
a derivative now.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:23.610
Plus the velocity
of the point, but as

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:29.180
seen from the point of view
of somebody in the frame,

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:37.780
plus omega with respect
to O cross r B/A.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.000
So this is an important formula.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.370
You're going to use it a lot.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.640
Couple of subtle points in here.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.490
This one-- this thing from as
seen from inside the frame.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:55.870
It's also the partial
derivative of r B/A with respect

00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:00.570
to t when omega with
respect to O equals zero.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.460
That's another way to say this.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.980
And this term is
another subtlety.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.907
I was careful to write
with respect to O. Yes?

00:15:12.907 --> 00:15:17.786
AUDIENCE: To make sure I'm not
confused here on this vector

00:15:17.786 --> 00:15:18.286
right there.

00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:23.665
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:15:23.665 --> 00:15:27.088
AUDIENCE: That leftmost term
is the middle one there?

00:15:27.088 --> 00:15:28.570
Or the right one?

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.810
PROFESSOR: So this was
when we were working

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:37.710
with just the velocity due
to the motion of the dog

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:40.490
due to rotation
plus-- actually this

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.066
was rotation-- what did I say?

00:15:44.066 --> 00:15:47.482
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
experiments.

00:15:47.482 --> 00:15:50.166
That the term on the
left is the motion

00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:52.298
that you can see from the frame.

00:15:52.298 --> 00:15:53.923
From the right is
the rotation that you

00:15:53.923 --> 00:15:56.270
don't see in the [INAUDIBLE],
but needs to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.080
PROFESSOR: And I can't remember
how I got to this point.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.710
But I think I was making
a couple of points,

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.860
and rammed them together.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.480
So this is the correct.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.690
Don't focus on this.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.410
This is the summary.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:12.380
This thing is now
rotating, and translating,

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.220
and the dog's running.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.400
And I want you to be
able to write down

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.590
the total velocity
of the point B

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:27.400
as seen from a fixed reference
frame fixed on the ground.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.600
This is with respect to O.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.400
It has three
terms-- the velocity

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:40.280
of A, the velocity of the
dog relative to the body

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.180
it's on here, and
finally, the component

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.180
of the velocity--
contribution of the velocity

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.630
that you see that's
due to the rotation.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:54.360
Now this turns out to be
a really powerful formula.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.560
It's a generalization.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:03.880
It's a special case of
a very general formula.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.740
Let me catch up
in my notes here.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.099
Because the following
statement is true.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:35.950
So the time derivative
of any vector

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:44.080
that's defined in
a rotating frame

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:51.100
is given by-- and we'll
call it just some vector

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.095
A. It might be, for
example, angular momentum.

00:17:54.095 --> 00:17:56.590
In fact we'll use
this formula a lot

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.940
when talking about
angular momentum.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:04.825
The time derivative
of this vector A--

00:18:04.825 --> 00:18:09.260
whatever it represents--
position, velocity,

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:17.130
angular momentum-- as seen from
a reference frame xy-- O xyz,

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:27.850
reference frame O-- is made
up of the derivative of A from

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:31.316
inside the frame plus--

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.150
So it's the same thing.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:49.720
This was the derivative of r
B/A. Has two pieces-- the piece

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.980
that came from the dog
running and the piece that

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.690
comes from rotation.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.680
Any vector, this piece is true.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.160
It's the derivative
of the vector

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.590
inside the frame in which it's
defined plus omega with respect

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:10.510
to the reference frame you want
the derivative in cross A. Very

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:11.390
powerful formula.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:25.090
This now is covered in a
couple of different places

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.140
in the readings, and
in the handout that's

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.560
posted called "Kinematics."

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.570
So you should read
by now the portion

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.832
of the kinematics thing,
at least on velocities.

00:19:34.832 --> 00:19:37.060
The second half of
that kinematics handout

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.160
is about acceleration.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.740
So we're going to
use this formula

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.560
to go from velocity
to acceleration.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.420
I saw a couple hands up.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.383
Yes?

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:47.281
AUDIENCE: So what is the
difference between O sub

00:19:47.281 --> 00:19:49.213
xyz and A sub xyz?

00:19:49.213 --> 00:19:51.050
Where are they [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:51.780
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:58.410
So this is a
merry-go-round on a train,

00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:59.780
and you're looking down on it.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.950
And the train can move.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.550
And we fixed to the
ground, not moving,

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:12.030
a reference frame we call O.
And I want to know in this case

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.280
the velocity of the
dog running around

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.650
on this merry-go-round
with respect to O.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:24.290
It's the sum of three
vector contributions--

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:28.710
the velocity of the
train, the velocity

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:35.990
of the dog with respect to
the merry-go-round-- this

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.115
is velocity of the train.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.150
This is with respect
to the merry-go-round.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.990
And this is the velocity
that you see out there.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:52.620
So you're sitting in O. You
are in this fixed frame.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.170
Which brings up another
subtle point about velocities

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.890
and inertial frames.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:04.540
If you are at any fixed
point in an inertial frame--

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.710
you don't have to be
at O; you can be right

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:10.980
where you are-- this
term is always the same.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.900
The velocity of this moving
object relative to the frame

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.540
is the same to any
observer in the frame--

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.281
any fixed observer in the frame.

00:21:20.281 --> 00:21:20.780
OK?

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.395
And finally, the u.

00:21:24.395 --> 00:21:27.200
But the u, the part
of the contribution

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.290
to the velocity due to the
rotation of this thing,

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.850
you can see it from
out there, right?

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:31.810
It moves.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.830
Well, the rotation
contribution is this.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.370
The dog running around is this.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.300
And the movement of the
train is the first term.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.240
OK?

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:44.780
All right.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.620
And this is the general
formula for the derivative

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:54.280
of a vector in a
translating, rotating frame.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:54.810
Yeah?

00:21:54.810 --> 00:22:00.605
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] vectors
beyond the [INAUDIBLE] v

00:22:00.605 --> 00:22:02.858
of p with respect
to the [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:02.858 --> 00:22:04.316
PROFESSOR: I'm not
following, here.

00:22:04.316 --> 00:22:07.232
AUDIENCE: Are any
of the v, v of A,

00:22:07.232 --> 00:22:10.148
for example, or v of B
with respect to A, are they

00:22:10.148 --> 00:22:11.245
all vectors?

00:22:11.245 --> 00:22:12.620
PROFESSOR: These
are all vectors.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.190
And I've gotten
a little careless

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.340
about drawing my underlines
when I haven't broken them down

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.160
into components.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.590
This is a vector.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.400
And we can do
this, because we're

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.290
relying on formulas for
the sums of vectors.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.260
So it's the vector.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.120
There's a vector describing
the velocity of the train.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.590
For example, if it's moving in
the capital I hat direction,

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.350
you have to say that.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:41.240
And this may
actually be the dog.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.180
At the moment you catch
him, the frame's like this.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:51.070
And let's say he's running
in the y direction.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.840
His direction at
that instant in time

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.730
is in the lowercase
j hat direction

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.420
relative to this frame, right?

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.610
And that j hat
direction has some angle

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.040
with respect to
this frame, which

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:09.320
if you want to reduce
these velocities down

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.130
to the unit vectors
in the inertial frame,

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.930
you can do that.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.388
But you're going
to have to account

00:23:15.388 --> 00:23:19.930
for the angles of this reference
frame compared to that one.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.900
So cosine thetas and sine
thetas and that kind of thing.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:34.440
One important point about
this general expression

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.290
for the derivative of a vector
in a rotating frame, which

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.250
therefore applies to this
case, because this is just

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.970
the specific example of
derivative of a position

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.420
vector giving you velocity.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:54.130
This term and this
term-- these account

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.190
for the change in
length of the vector.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:03.100
So just to keep it real,
in terms of velocities,

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.530
you see a velocity
that's due to the fact

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.245
that the velocity vector
itself is changing in length.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.540
Or in this case, the r
vector is changing in length,

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.670
so the velocity has something
to do with the change in length.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:23.190
This term is due only to the
fact that it is rotating.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.280
If the dog's not running,
is his position vector

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.790
changing in length?

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.220
No.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.370
So this term here
comes from taking

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.140
this derivative of
the position vector

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.330
within the rotating frame.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.670
So this accounts for the change
in length of that position

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:42.570
vector.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:44.700
This accounts for the rotation.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:50.915
This term is the same as
seen from in any frame.

00:24:50.915 --> 00:24:51.790
This is the subtlety.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:59.030
This term, you get the same
answer if you see it from here.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.870
This velocity,
this contribution.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:07.040
The dog's speed with respect
to this frame it's in

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.370
is the same to you out
there in the fixed frame

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.240
as it is to somebody
sitting here

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.460
in the frame moving with him.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.305
Important point.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.640
It'll become more important
as you do problems.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.999
You need to remember
that doesn't matter

00:25:23.999 --> 00:25:25.040
where you're calculating.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.440
You're given the
velocity of the dog

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.960
in this frame, and
little i j k components,

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.810
it is in magnitude exactly
the same velocity as you would

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.784
see it in the fixed frame.

00:25:37.784 --> 00:25:39.950
But then you just have to
account for the right unit

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:41.190
vectors and so forth.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.062
Yes.

00:25:42.062 --> 00:25:44.894
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] is
the same as the frame,

00:25:44.894 --> 00:25:47.249
but the direction is changing?

00:25:47.249 --> 00:25:49.540
PROFESSOR: The direction is
the same in any frame also.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.410
It's just that you have
to decide which unit

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.772
vectors to represent it in.

00:25:54.772 --> 00:25:56.230
And when you're in
this frame, it's

00:25:56.230 --> 00:26:00.495
easiest to represent it
in little i j k, right?

00:26:00.495 --> 00:26:01.870
But if you're in
the fixed frame,

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:05.450
you may want to actually know
the velocity in the fixed

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.584
frames unit vectors, and there's
just geometric conversions

00:26:08.584 --> 00:26:09.500
that'll give you that.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.460
Yes.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.350
AUDIENCE: But if theta is like
a function of time [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:15.270
how would you use those?

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.190
Does it just work the same way?

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.320
PROFESSOR: So she says if
theta is a function of time,

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.220
if you were trying to convert--
this dog's running in the y

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.430
direction, which is going in
the master frame over there,

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.410
is going to have a component
in the negative capital I hat

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:34.480
and positive capital J
hat direction, right?

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.020
And you could break down--
let's say his velocity vector is

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.140
like this-- you could break it
down into a component that's

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.840
parallel to the
ground, and a component

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.470
perpendicular to the ground.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.630
And those then would be
in that reference frame.

00:26:51.347 --> 00:26:53.430
You've all, I would think,
have done some problems

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:55.690
using polar coordinates.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.390
And the conversion between
x and y and r and theta

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.820
is you used cosine
thetas and sine

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.400
thetas to compute it, right?

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.700
So read that handout
on kinematics,

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:16.940
because it proves this
formula by doing just that.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.890
It puts everything
in terms of thetas

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.370
that are functions of time.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.580
And it's kind of a
long, painful process,

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.100
but you can do
that, grind it out,

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.520
and you will then, when
you assemble the terms,

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.980
you end up with this.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.760
And once you know
this formula, it's

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.720
far, far easier
than to calculate

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.889
all this in terms of
thetas and theta dots,

00:27:38.889 --> 00:27:39.805
and sines and cosines.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:45.230
OK?

00:27:47.961 --> 00:27:48.460
All right.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.000
That's good.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.050
That's important stuff.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.997
We're going to make great
use of these formulas

00:27:52.997 --> 00:27:54.080
over the rest of the term.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.660
So I'm going to just take
a break from kinematics.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.480
It's time to talk a little
bit about Newton's laws,

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.010
because we really want to be
able to do dynamics problems.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.780
And so this has been about
describing the motion.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:19.124
And now we want to talk about
the laws on which we depend

00:28:19.124 --> 00:28:20.790
in order to be able
to calculate things,

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.600
and to draw, write equations
of motion and so forth.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.780
So any final questions
about kinematics?

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.520
Because I'm going
to change topics.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.454
Yes.

00:28:30.454 --> 00:28:34.406
AUDIENCE: So for that equation
to the [INAUDIBLE], then

00:28:34.406 --> 00:28:37.534
the acceleration of
[INAUDIBLE] with respect

00:28:37.534 --> 00:28:39.840
to the reference frame,
that's [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.779
is just zero, right?

00:28:41.779 --> 00:28:43.820
PROFESSOR: You're asking
about acceleration, now?

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:44.710
Do you really mean?

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:46.130
Is that what you mean?

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.515
Because I haven't talked
much about acceleration.

00:28:48.515 --> 00:28:51.490
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering,
because also [INAUDIBLE] x

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.367
to the velocity change.

00:28:53.367 --> 00:28:54.200
PROFESSOR: This one?

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:54.825
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:54.825 --> 00:28:59.960
PROFESSOR: So this equation
is true of any vector.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.240
This is basically
vector calculus.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.910
It's true of any vector
in a rotating frame.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.130
It's time derivative with
respect to a fixed frame.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.880
It is the derivative you
would see in the rotating

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.760
frame, which is just the
change of length of the vector,

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.640
and the part due to the fact
that you are making it rotate.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.490
And we'll do examples of this,
I promise you, very soon.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:22.840
So you'll see how it's applied.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.340
OK?

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.660
OK.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.700
So let's do a quick
review of Newton.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:51.770
So Newton's Laws.

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.270
He had three of them.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.900
And we're all pretty
familiar with the second.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.515
The first, though, is
called the law of inertia.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.780
And basically, the
first law says,

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.360
if an object is motionless
in the absence of forces,

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.030
what happens?

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.410
Stays motionless.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.200
Or, if it's at some
constant velocity

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.340
in the absence of forces it
stays at constant velocity,

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.370
right?

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:30.500
So these have been stated
many ways over the years.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.450
I'm just going to try to come up
with short ones for the board.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:31:05.000
So in the absence of
forces an object--

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.580
a particle-- moves
with constant velocity.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.740
In fact, Newton only talked
about motions of particles,

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.290
not as in little tiny things.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:17.160
Not about rigid bodies that
have finite dimensions.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.810
He thought of the planets,
appropriately, as particles.

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.030
Second law.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.710
Second law, I won't
write it all out.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:26.890
But basically F equals ma.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:30.350
Their vectors equals
the time derivative

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.547
of the linear momentum.

00:31:31.547 --> 00:31:33.130
That's what we know
as the second law.

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:38.030
The sum of all the
external forces

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.610
equals the mass times
the acceleration.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.460
Another statement
of the second law.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.646
OK?

00:31:44.646 --> 00:31:45.520
So you know that one.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.410
That's the one you're
most familiar with.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:48.200
Third one.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.006
What's the third one?

00:31:50.006 --> 00:31:52.910
AUDIENCE: Every action has an
equal and opposite reaction.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:56.660
PROFESSOR: So every action has
an equal and opposite reaction.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.510
And I'm going to draw
a picture for this one.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.800
So here's a particle.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.020
Here's another particle.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.070
This is particle 2.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.120
Particle 1.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.070
There's a force on
this particle that's

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.920
the force on 2 due
to the presence of 1.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.000
They've each got a little
gravity, little attraction

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:20.740
from one another.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:27.540
And this one has a force on
particle 1 due to particle 2.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.230
OK?

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.313
They could be two planets.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:38.570
And basically what he said
is that for every action,

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.010
there's an equal and
opposite reaction.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:47.210
That means that f 21
equals minus f 12.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.035
And this is called
the strong form

00:32:53.035 --> 00:33:01.450
of Newton's third law,
which the forces are equal,

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.870
opposite, and collinear.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:12.160
They actually point exactly
opposite one another.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.470
And this is true of
mechanical systems.

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:19.850
You get some rather
interesting subtleties

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.970
when you get into
electromagnetic fields,

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:23.897
and charged particles,
and things like that.

00:33:23.897 --> 00:33:25.480
So you have to think
really carefully.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:29.250
But for the mechanical
systems, the strong form

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.110
will suit us just fine.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.339
OK.

00:33:33.339 --> 00:33:34.380
Those are the three laws.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:41.540
Newton made one major
condition for those to be true.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.690
What is the assumption that
must be satisfied for these laws

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.094
to be true?

00:33:48.094 --> 00:33:50.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] an
inertial reference frame?

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:55.190
PROFESSOR: I hear "an inertial
reference frame," right?

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.770
And that's what he assumed.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.990
You have to be in an inertial
frame for these statements

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.110
to be true.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:05.510
So then what I want to spend
a few minutes talking about

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:09.845
is basically what's
an inertial frame.

00:34:09.845 --> 00:34:11.219
Because that's
going to be really

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:12.480
important in this subject.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.639
When you start getting on
things that move and rotate,

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:18.980
things sometimes
are not inertial.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.639
So I'm going to ask
you a quick question.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:24.090
So a reference frame.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:27.771
So we had our fixed frame up
there, sitting on the ground,

00:34:27.771 --> 00:34:28.520
here on the Earth.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.139
Is the Earth an inertial
reference frame, standing

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:33.360
here observing things?

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.540
I want a show of hands.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.820
I really want some
participation here.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.940
How many of you think
Earth's an inertial frame?

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:42.845
Raise your hand.

00:34:42.845 --> 00:34:44.550
It's true.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.580
How many think it's not true?

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.000
How many think it depends?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.250
On what?

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.250
AUDIENCE: What you
are focusing on.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.080
PROFESSOR: What the problem is.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.740
He says it depends on
what you're focusing on.

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.310
So it really depends on
the sizes of the forces

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.430
and the motion
you're interested in.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:10.890
Can you give me an example
in which the Earth cannot be

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:14.730
assumed to be an inertial frame?

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.240
Practical example?

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.740
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:18.890
Not practical.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.874
PROFESSOR: Impractical.

00:35:20.874 --> 00:35:23.850
AUDIENCE: The rotation
of Earth is slowing?

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.167
The rotation of the
Earth is slowing?

00:35:26.167 --> 00:35:28.000
PROFESSOR: Rotation of
the earth is slowing.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.850
That's interesting.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.900
To account for that, you would
definitely not be able to just

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.370
to assume we're inertial.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:37.710
But what's an everyday
example of where,

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.954
if you're trying to solve
a problem in this field,

00:35:40.954 --> 00:35:42.745
you couldn't make this
inertial assumption?

00:35:45.896 --> 00:35:47.820
AUDIENCE: Rotation
of the planets?

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.700
PROFESSOR: Well, no,
for the most part,

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.870
you could get most of it.

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.267
But, yeah.

00:35:52.267 --> 00:35:53.850
AUDIENCE: I think
the weather, really,

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.175
because the wind currents,
or like the ocean

00:35:56.175 --> 00:35:58.970
currents are affected by the
fact that the Earth is round.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.350
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:01.800
That's a good one.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.480
In order to account
for the circulation

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.920
you have to take into
account the Earth's motion.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.125
Let me give you an example.

00:36:10.125 --> 00:36:10.625
Clocks.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.200
Pendulum clocks.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.850
Does the speed of
a clock change?

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:24.550
Is it different at high
noon from midnight?

00:36:29.691 --> 00:36:30.440
What do you think?

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.930
Yes or no?

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:34.080
How many think that
the actual speed

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.950
of a clock-- the
length of a second--

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.220
would be different at
noon on the Earth--

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.274
a pendulum clock--
from midnight?

00:36:40.274 --> 00:36:41.690
How many think
that might be true?

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:42.880
It's different?

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.270
How many don't believe
that it would be true?

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.140
How many just not
raising their hands?

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.190
Come on you guys.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:49.130
Let's get with it.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.629
OK.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.590
So the effective
acceleration of gravity

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:58.800
that that pendulum feels
is different at noon

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.420
from midnight.

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:07.590
And one reason is because at
noon the sun's pulling away

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.890
from the surface of the
Earth, and at midnight

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:12.664
the sun's gravity is pulling
in the same direction

00:37:12.664 --> 00:37:14.080
as toward the
center of the Earth.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.990
The total effective
gravitational

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.410
pull that the
pendulum field changes

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.489
due to the rotation of
the Earth, what it feels.

00:37:21.489 --> 00:37:23.030
The sum of the forces
on the pendulum

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.200
includes the Earth's gravity
and the sun's gravity.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.790
And the moon also does this.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:29.750
So there's daily
variations in the speed

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:33.160
of pendulum clocks just
because of the Earth's

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.640
rotation with respect
to the sun and the moon.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:36.471
Yeah.

00:37:36.471 --> 00:37:39.560
AUDIENCE: Is that even great
enough to be measurable?

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.890
PROFESSOR: So she says,
"Is that even great enough

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:42.710
to be measurable?"

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.160
So I have a friend, a
guy named Hugh Hunt.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.950
He's a professor
that teaches dynamics

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:47.310
at Cambridge University.

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:52.010
And he is the keeper of
the Trinity College clock.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:53.990
Trinity College is
where Newton was.

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:56.620
So he took me to his clock
one day up in this tower.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.580
And it's got about a
two-meter pendulum on it.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.720
And he has got that
clock to run so

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:06.260
that it gains no more
than one second per month.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.910
He's really tuned
it up carefully.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.630
And the key to being
able to do that

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:15.672
is to do things on
monthly averages.

00:38:15.672 --> 00:38:18.110
So he's got it tuned
so that over a month

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:20.540
it just barely gains a tiny bit.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.370
But if you measure
it very carefully

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:26.320
over the course of the
day, it has amazingly large

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.320
fluctuations.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.830
One of them is due to the
thing I just described.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:34.460
So if you're really trying to
keep close time, it matters.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:34.960
OK.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.176
Another one is gunnery.

00:38:37.176 --> 00:38:38.670
You're shooting long range.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.920
You're trying to hit a target.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.750
The fact that the
earth rotates, you

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.640
will not hit the
target if you don't

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.545
account for the effects that are
caused by the Earth's rotation.

00:38:48.545 --> 00:38:49.920
And it's one of
the first reasons

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.997
that people got
into understanding

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:55.330
the importance of whether or
not it's an inertial frame,

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:59.430
was gunnery in the old days,
from naval ships and so forth.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:00.100
OK.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.724
So we have three laws.

00:39:01.724 --> 00:39:04.140
I want to talk a little bit
about the first and the third.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.940
We're going to use
the second a lot.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.015
So the first law, most
people think of the first law

00:39:09.015 --> 00:39:12.770
as being a special case
of the second, right?

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.950
It's just when there's no
forces, nothing changes.

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:19.780
But I think the first law
is useful in its own right.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.720
And one of the reasons why
it's called the law of inertia,

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.180
it's the law that
allows you to do a test

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.930
to discover whether
or not you're actually

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:30.220
in an inertial frame.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.770
Useful to be able to do that.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:36.372
So I'm going to
give you an example.

00:39:36.372 --> 00:39:38.330
And actually, I did want
to ask you a question.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:43.310
So three possible
answers to this question.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:49.730
An inertial frame
can-- how to pose this?

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:54.760
If you're in an inertial
frame, can it be accelerating?

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:59.480
If you're in an inertial
frame, can it be rotating?

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.460
Or if you're in
an inertial frame,

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:05.760
it can neither
accelerate or rotate.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.290
So which of those three
answers is the best answer

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:11.940
for conditions to be
in an inertial frame?

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.650
Non-accelerating,
non-rotating, or both?

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:17.240
How many believe
non-accelerating?

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:21.230
Just non-accelerating?

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.080
How many believe in
just not rotating?

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.130
How many believe both?

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:26.310
Both is right.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.260
If you are in a frame which
is rotating or accelerating

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.270
it's not inertial.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.770
OK.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:34.420
So just rotation causes
it not to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.940
So let's test that.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:40.070
I'm going to pick
two cases quickly.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:44.820
Let's use this law
of inertia to set up

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:48.350
a test to see if a couple
different frames are

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:49.320
in fact inertial.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.750
So I've got a cart here.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.430
And I'm sitting
here-- or you are.

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:04.220
We're sitting on the cart.

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:13.150
And this cart is accelerating.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:20.970
Acceleration of A
with respect to O

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:26.470
is, I'll call it a naught I hat.

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:29.770
This cart's accelerating in
that way, that direction,

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:31.540
the positive I hat direction.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.410
OK.

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:37.070
Now I'm sitting here on the
cart-- not very sensitive.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:41.490
And I want to test whether or
not I'm in an inertial frame.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:44.380
So let's pretend this cart,
I've got an air table there,

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.325
frictionless table.

00:41:45.325 --> 00:41:47.330
And I've got a hockey puck.

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:50.730
And I set it down on
the frictionless table

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.960
and let it go.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.920
What happens?

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.880
What do I observe?

00:41:57.327 --> 00:41:58.202
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:05.660
PROFESSOR: So the puck
will accelerate, you're

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.640
saying, towards me, right?

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.835
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:10.835 --> 00:42:11.460
PROFESSOR: Hmm.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.600
It'll move.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.490
So she says the puck will move
towards you if you let it go.

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:17.750
So is that an indication
of whether or not

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:18.950
you're in an inertial frame?

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:23.360
So the test-- this
is first law, now.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.690
So the test-- if
you're in this frame,

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:28.940
and you want to know whether or
not this is an inertial frame,

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.730
and I claim you can set
this puck out there,

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:36.024
if you're in an inertial
frame, what should it do?

00:42:36.024 --> 00:42:36.910
Not move.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:39.830
If it moves, there's
something going on.

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:41.370
Something fishy, right?

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:42.210
OK.

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:46.530
So the acceleration--
and we'll call

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:51.250
the puck at B. So
the acceleration of B

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:53.320
with respect to O-- and
there's no rotation here.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.320
So the acceleration of
B with respect to O,

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.710
it can be written as
the acceleration of A

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:02.250
with respect to O, plus
the acceleration of B

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:11.280
with respect to A.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.990
Now this is O here.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:16.547
This is an inertial frame.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.390
And if it's an inertial
frame, and there

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:26.670
are no forces in the x
direction acting on this puck,

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.260
then I'm going to say that the
sum of the forces on that puck

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.100
equal zero.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.000
And therefore, what can I
say about the acceleration

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.440
of the puck?

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.589
What's the acceleration of
the puck as seen from O?

00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:42.380
It's gotta be zero.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:47.390
If no forces-- so the summation
of the forces with respect

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:51.190
to this O frame in
the x direction,

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:54.830
if there's zero, that
implies the acceleration of B

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:56.770
with respect to O
is got to be zero.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:06.730
Knowing that, I can now solve
for the acceleration of B

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:09.610
with respect to A.
And that's going

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.315
to be minus the acceleration
of A with respect to O.

00:44:13.315 --> 00:44:18.425
And that's minus a naught I hat.

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:27.420
So you are correct in
saying that it moves.

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:31.390
But it actually accelerates.

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:35.354
From your point of view, what
you see sitting there in A,

00:44:35.354 --> 00:44:36.895
you were going to
see this accelerate

00:44:36.895 --> 00:44:38.310
in the opposite direction.

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.080
And that's a dead
giveaway that you're not

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.890
in an inertial frame.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:42.390
OK.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.910
Come on.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:55.270
OK.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.460
So a little harder problem.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:08.863
Now we've got our
merry-go-round.

00:45:08.863 --> 00:45:10.220
OK.

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.220
And it's fixed.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.395
Not on the train.

00:45:12.395 --> 00:45:14.220
It's just sitting here.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.160
But it can spin.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.340
And you're sitting
at A. So you're

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:24.040
up above this merry-go-round
looking down on it.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.937
And it's rotating.

00:45:25.937 --> 00:45:27.520
Out there you're in
an inertial frame.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.728
But now you come over to
here, and you sit right here

00:45:29.728 --> 00:45:31.840
at the center.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.390
And if you're right
at the center,

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:36.200
you might not actually
feel a thing, right?

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.820
And there's no windows.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:43.330
So this could be a spaceship
out there, slowly rolling over.

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:46.450
So you're sitting
inside of this system,

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:49.200
no windows, right at the
center, can't feel a thing.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.350
And I want you to
construct a test-- be

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:54.810
using the first law-- that'll
tell you whether or not

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:56.350
you're in an inertial frame.

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:57.110
What might you do?

00:46:02.185 --> 00:46:04.310
AUDIENCE: Set a ball down
on the ground [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:05.556
roll off to the edge.

00:46:05.556 --> 00:46:06.430
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:07.804
He says set a ball
on the ground,

00:46:07.804 --> 00:46:09.330
and see if it rolls
out to the edge.

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:09.830
Right?

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:12.010
See if it moves.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:14.302
AUDIENCE: Just [INAUDIBLE]
is this [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:14.302 --> 00:46:16.510
under the effect of gravity,
or is there [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:24.140
PROFESSOR: Let's really
make it a merry-go-round.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.880
So there's gravity.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.770
So I want gravity
to be useful here.

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:29.630
It keeps the thing
on the surface.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.400
Doesn't just go drifting off.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.760
So yeah, let's say
we have gravity.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.260
The axis is vertical.

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.430
You're sitting here, but
you can't see outside,

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:40.280
and you want to do this test.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.240
So do you agree if
you set the ball down,

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.030
you might learn something?

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.830
OK.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:48.190
So you set the ball down.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:55.310
And you're here watching.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.050
And here's the ball.

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:00.030
And let's say you've got
a ball, and you actually

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.380
have a string on the ball.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.490
Set it out there.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.800
So initially you've got
this ball out there.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.710
And you're sitting
here at the center.

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:19.610
And this merry-go-round's
going round and around.

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:23.200
What can you sense
that tells you

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.570
that you're not in
an inertial frame,

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:27.050
if you're holding
onto this string?

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:30.130
Does the ball
move, first of all?

00:47:32.376 --> 00:47:34.000
Would the ball move
if I'm sitting here

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.958
hanging onto the string,
and I set it out there

00:47:35.958 --> 00:47:37.560
and set it down?

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:38.480
No, it won't move.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.920
But what do you
feel in the string?

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.020
Tension in the string.

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:42.580
OK.

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.520
So now you've got
indication number one

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.811
that there's something fishy.

00:47:47.811 --> 00:47:48.310
OK.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:49.518
Now you let go of the string.

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.270
What should happen?

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:56.590
So you [INAUDIBLE] go out.

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:57.420
All right.

00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:00.340
But now I'm going to ask you
a little harder question.

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:05.104
What direction should the ball
travel in once you release it?

00:48:08.008 --> 00:48:09.460
AUDIENCE: Radially outwards.

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.668
PROFESSOR: Radially outwards.

00:48:10.668 --> 00:48:13.790
I have one shot at
radially outwards.

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:14.720
Any other thoughts?

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.136
AUDIENCE: From
your point of view,

00:48:16.136 --> 00:48:18.136
it wouldn't seem to
go in a straight line.

00:48:18.136 --> 00:48:21.270
It would seem to
curve off to one side.

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:25.110
PROFESSOR: So I
have one postulate

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:28.790
that it will curve-- it will
go away and curve off, right?

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:31.160
Which way would it curve?

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.790
So you're saying not radially.

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:34.052
You say it's going to curve.

00:48:34.052 --> 00:48:35.350
AUDIENCE: Opposite direction
that you're spinning.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:36.683
PROFESSOR: Opposite to the spin.

00:48:36.683 --> 00:48:40.239
He says it will curve
opposite to the spin.

00:48:40.239 --> 00:48:42.030
AUDIENCE: But only from
your point of view.

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:43.405
PROFESSOR: This
is from the point

00:48:43.405 --> 00:48:47.619
of view on the merry-go-round.

00:48:47.619 --> 00:48:49.160
Point of view off
the merry-go-round,

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.790
might be easier to reason this.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:55.070
So now you're up above the
merry-go-round in an inertial

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:57.590
frame, up above this
merry-go-round, just

00:48:57.590 --> 00:49:01.670
looking down, like sitting up in
a tree and looking down on it.

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:02.540
What do you see?

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:11.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE], but if
you're on the merry-go-round

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.405
then you [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:12.405 --> 00:49:13.280
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.030
So this is an argument for if
you're on the merry-go-round,

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.070
you'll see radial motion.

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:20.490
If you're in the tree,
you'll see the curve.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:21.550
So we're going to do--

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:23.508
AUDIENCE: I would like
to retract my statement.

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:27.240
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:27.740
All right.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:29.790
I think we'd better
take a vote here.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:38.860
So the possible answers are
from-- how do we frame this?

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:43.840
From an inertial frame,
looking down on it,

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.660
answer A is it will
go in a curved path.

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:52.310
Answer B is it will go in
a straight, radial line.

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:57.900
Answer C is it does--
any other guesses?

00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.950
No other guesses.

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:00.880
So it's the only two choices.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.670
It curves, or it goes in
a straight, radial line.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:06.210
So how many vote for-- and
everybody has to participate.

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:09.060
How many vote for it goes
a straight radial line?

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:09.940
Let's have it.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.772
Straight out radial line
from the point of view

00:50:12.772 --> 00:50:13.980
of the fixed reference frame.

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:15.450
OK.

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:16.220
A goodly number.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:16.780
OK.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.400
How many from the point of view
of that fixed frame, looking

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.050
down on it, will see it curve?

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.900
How many vote for that?

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.800
And how many didn't vote?

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.460
Those are don't knows, huh?

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.670
All right.

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:33.130
So A and B are wrong.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.880
A and B are dead wrong.

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:42.720
And you could have
figured out what

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.540
the answer is if you went
right back to basics, back

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:48.180
to Newton's Laws.

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:56.170
When the string is released, the
sum of the forces on the object

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:57.760
are what?

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.970
In the direction
that it can travel.

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:02.350
Still got gravity
pushing on it, but it

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:04.200
can't go in that direction.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.010
So if you did a
free body diagram,

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:12.145
what are the forces in that
horizontal [? direct ?] plane

00:51:12.145 --> 00:51:13.020
that it's sitting on?

00:51:16.401 --> 00:51:17.642
I hear centrifugal force.

00:51:17.642 --> 00:51:18.475
I hear frictionless.

00:51:18.475 --> 00:51:20.260
Let's make the
table frictionless

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:22.250
so it can easy to move.

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.110
No friction.

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:25.186
I hear centrifugal force.

00:51:25.186 --> 00:51:25.940
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:29.368
PROFESSOR: He says zero.

00:51:29.368 --> 00:51:31.604
AUDIENCE: There's
the force that you

00:51:31.604 --> 00:51:34.835
get from tangent of
[? to ?] less perpendicular

00:51:34.835 --> 00:51:36.823
to the radial direction.

00:51:36.823 --> 00:51:39.308
PROFESSOR: What's perpendicular
to the radial direction?

00:51:39.308 --> 00:51:42.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] it had
to [INAUDIBLE] B traveling

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.775
[INAUDIBLE] at one point had
to have [INAUDIBLE] force

00:51:44.775 --> 00:51:49.506
with tangential to the circle.

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:51.880
PROFESSOR: So you were the
one that provided that for us.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.340
You're on the merry-go-round.

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:55.680
You set it out there,
and held the string.

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.140
You set out there
in some radius r.

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:01.870
And so because when you set it
down, you're already turning.

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:04.790
So you just set it down with
respect to the merry-go-round.

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:05.556
It's not moving.

00:52:05.556 --> 00:52:06.430
You just set it down.

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:08.020
OK?

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:12.800
What are the forces-- so just
draw the free-body diagram.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.940
Here's this puck.

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.760
And you've released the string.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:21.400
And you got mg downwards,
and you have a normal force

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.440
upwards.

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:26.270
And you have no friction.

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:28.920
And I hear centrifugal
force, but--

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.460
PROFESSOR: Well,
that was a guess.

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:36.430
Somebody said straight
out, and the answer is no.

00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:38.632
And we're going
to figure it out.

00:52:38.632 --> 00:52:40.590
First of all, we've got
to sort out the forces.

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:43.560
Well, what are the
forces on this thing?

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.640
So I heard centrifugal force.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.654
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think the only
force is the centrifugal force.

00:52:48.654 --> 00:52:52.450
But there was a velocity
that's not caused by the force.

00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:55.943
So the velocity that you got was
velocity that you told us about

00:52:55.943 --> 00:52:59.295
that [INAUDIBLE]
that starts out--

00:52:59.295 --> 00:53:00.420
PROFESSOR: You set it down.

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.000
And once you set it
down, it's there.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:02.996
And then?

00:53:02.996 --> 00:53:04.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah, your
initial velocity

00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:06.804
from setting it out there.

00:53:06.804 --> 00:53:08.232
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:53:08.232 --> 00:53:10.945
AUDIENCE: The change in
direction-- the force only

00:53:10.945 --> 00:53:13.370
change direction of the ball.

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:16.037
But once the string cuts,
and the direction no longer

00:53:16.037 --> 00:53:18.705
changes, and the ball only
goes the direction that

00:53:18.705 --> 00:53:21.620
is tangential to the circle.

00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:23.585
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:53:23.585 --> 00:53:25.040
The man has it right.

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.490
You probably couldn't hear him.

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:28.250
He says that when
you let it go, it

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:31.430
goes tangential to the circle.

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:33.210
And that's true.

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:35.710
The forces on in
this direction--

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:39.290
in the horizontal direction--
once you release the object,

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:41.940
there are no forces.

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:46.530
Centrifugal force is a
construction of convenience

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:48.340
called a fictitious force.

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:49.750
And we'll talk about that later.

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:52.270
It is not a real force.

00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:55.380
It as a result of
an acceleration.

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:57.410
And it's the result of
the acceleration when you

00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:59.010
are making it go in a circle.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.250
There is indeed--
that tension is

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:03.760
what some people call the
centrifugal force holding it

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.260
there.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.980
But once you release it,
that's no longer there.

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:09.900
And if there are
no external forces

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:13.640
acting on the object in the
horizontal direction, what's

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.990
the mass times the acceleration?

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:17.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:19.580
PROFESSOR: Therefore
what's the acceleration?

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:20.840
Zero.

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:21.660
And its velocity.

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.508
What's its velocity at
that moment in time?

00:54:24.508 --> 00:54:25.436
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:25.436 --> 00:54:28.164
PROFESSOR: Omega.

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:29.580
R omega.

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.700
So you have an R omega velocity.

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:34.010
It's tangential to the motion.

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:42.100
So let's make this my
little x, and this my axes

00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.980
attached to the merry-go-round.

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:48.270
This thing is moving
in the j-hat direction

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:54.430
at R B with respect to A
in the j-hat direction.

00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:59.750
That is the velocity
of B with respect to A

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:02.778
at the moment you release it.

00:55:02.778 --> 00:55:03.670
OK?

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:07.800
So it had better run off
tangential to the circle

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.110
at the moment of release.

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:10.670
So let's test it.

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:14.200
Now I want you to be my
quality control person.

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:16.519
If I smack somebody with
this, I'm going to hurt them.

00:55:16.519 --> 00:55:17.060
AUDIENCE: No.

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.780
PROFESSOR: Squeeze it.

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.880
Soft and harmless, right?

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.790
OK.

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:24.960
So when should I
release it if I want

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.320
to hit the MIT sweatshirt
sitting up there?

00:55:32.264 --> 00:55:34.110
When it's out here, right?

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:35.375
I'll see if I can do it.

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:46.044
All right.

00:55:46.044 --> 00:55:47.210
I'd better not try it again.

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:50.166
I probably can't do
it twice in a row.

00:55:50.166 --> 00:55:51.790
AUDIENCE: But that
was a straight line.

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:53.430
PROFESSOR: It was
in a straight line.

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:54.055
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:54.055 --> 00:55:55.490
So one of the guesses was--

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:59.210
PROFESSOR: Radial straight
line was one guess.

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:00.070
This is?

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:01.558
AUDIENCE: Tangential
straight line.

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:02.550
PROFESSOR: Got it.

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:06.703
So this tangential straight
line is the right answer.

00:56:06.703 --> 00:56:08.152
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the velocity

00:56:08.152 --> 00:56:11.540
is equal to the
radius [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:13.375
PROFESSOR: I can't
quite hear you.

00:56:13.375 --> 00:56:16.285
AUDIENCE: Here it says that
the velocity of [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:16.285 --> 00:56:18.710
PROFESSOR: Ah, I left
out the omega, didn't I?

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:21.040
Sorry about that.

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:26.820
So it is omega is the
result of omega cross r B/A.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:31.446
So it's omega with respect to
O, r B/A in the j direction.

00:56:31.446 --> 00:56:32.322
Yeah.

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:35.214
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
person on the merry-go-round

00:56:35.214 --> 00:56:36.657
does not see that.

00:56:36.657 --> 00:56:37.240
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.570
So actually I
almost forgot this.

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:41.290
She is talking about
what does the person

00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:42.560
see on the merry-go-round?

00:56:45.442 --> 00:56:47.400
What do you actually see
on the merry-go-round?

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:51.330
Certainly doesn't go radial.

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:53.800
We've proven that, right?

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.670
But the person on
the merry-go-round,

00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:59.890
is you're turning, and
this thing is going off

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:04.510
in a straight line with
respect to the fixed frame,

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:06.480
and you're turning away from it.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:10.900
So looking down on
it, I release it here.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.490
It goes off in that direction.

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:16.520
Your point of observation,
you see it here.

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:22.460
But now a short time later, when
you've rotated to this point,

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:25.200
and you're just
keeping your eye on it,

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.640
you see this thing
start to move.

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.850
But this is the spot
that it was sitting on,

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:32.930
which is now moved to here.

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:35.530
But its position is now there.

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:37.300
You see it moving away from you.

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:42.580
And as you get up to,
say, here, then it

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:48.069
will have moved out
a radius this far.

00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:50.110
Well, actually it's not--
you don't know how fast

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:52.330
you're-- well, you're actually
going exactly the same speed it

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:52.830
is.

00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:57.610
So you've gone the
arc length here.

00:57:57.610 --> 00:58:02.280
It's gone a quarter of a
circle out to about there.

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.360
Same point right here.

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.090
But now you see it as
being going off like that.

00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:10.040
To you, it's hooking off
in the direction opposite

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.800
to the direction of rotation.

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.630
So the young man up there
who described that early on

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:16.910
was exactly right.

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:21.177
So from your point of view,
it goes mrrmm, like that.

00:58:21.177 --> 00:58:22.760
And then if you go
all the way around,

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.880
it'll appear to come back.

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:27.370
It'll be further
away, but you'll

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:29.600
be back down to the point
where you see it released.

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:34.440
So it'll look like it goes
from your point of view.

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:35.970
OK.

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:36.530
Good one.

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:47.220
OK, we've got a
few minutes left.

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:50.507
I want to do something really
important with the third law.

00:58:50.507 --> 00:58:52.340
So the first law's
actually pretty important

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:54.545
and very handy.

00:58:54.545 --> 00:58:56.670
The second law, we're going
to make lots of use of.

00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:59.010
So I want to talk a minute
about the third law.

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:08.090
The third law is responsible
for a law that we use,

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:10.650
or an application that
we use all the time.

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:13.500
And let's see how
this works out.

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.070
So Newton's third
law is the one that

00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:17.530
says F 21 is equal to F 12.

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:24.170
So we have these two particles.

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:31.040
And I called them 2 and 1.

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:36.780
And I'll give this
one mass 1, mass 2.

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:39.650
And I'm going to say
second law tells me

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:50.250
that the sum of the forces,
vectors, external forces, on 2

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:54.130
is-- and this one,
let's say it has things,

00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:55.830
active forces acting on it.

00:59:55.830 --> 00:59:57.940
F i's.

00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:02.120
And it has this little f 21.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:09.730
So the forces here are
the external forces

01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:21.220
that are vectors, plus f,
[? some ?] of the forces on 2.

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.290
So forces on 2 due to 1.

01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:26.146
That's external influence
of the other particle.

01:00:26.146 --> 01:00:27.930
OK?

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:40.520
And this had better be equal
to m 2 a 2, I'll call it.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.100
And with respect to some
fixed, some inertial frame.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:49.210
So the sum of all these external
forces on that particle 2

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.460
had better be equal to the
mass times the acceleration

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.120
of particle 2.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.370
And the same thing can
be said about particle 1.

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:58.260
So I've really
confused things here.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.910
There's 2, and there's 1.

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:01.610
Boy.

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:02.720
OK.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.210
Guys, help keep me honest here.

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:08.300
So now that we can say
the sum of the forces on 1

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:16.560
is equal to these external
applied forces, plus f 12--

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.610
the force caused
by the other body.

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:23.387
And those had better
equal to m 1 a 1/0.

01:01:23.387 --> 01:01:23.886
OK.

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:37.970
And these are also equal to the
time derivative of m 2 v 2/0.

01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:40.990
That's the momentum, the time
derivative of the momentum.

01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:43.930
It's fixed mass, so it's
just the derivative velocity

01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:44.900
gives the acceleration.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.320
So these are clearly
the same formula.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:53.880
And this is a time derivative
of m 1 v 1 with respect to O dt.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:02:00.370
And we call that
P 2 dot, P 1 dot.

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:02.681
So these are statements
that are applying second law

01:02:02.681 --> 01:02:03.805
to each of these particles.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:19.310
So if I want to compute the
total momentum of the system.

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:23.300
So the linear momentum, the
total momentum of the system

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:27.070
is going to be P 1 plus P 2.

01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:28.990
They're vectors.

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:32.640
And I want to take
the time derivative

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.510
of that total momentum.

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:40.950
Just the time
derivative of a sum

01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:42.460
is the sum of the
time derivatives.

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:46.225
And so I get a P 1
dot plus a P 2 dot.

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:50.600
But I know what those are.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.175
I have expressions for them.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:04.750
So this is F 1 external
forces plus f 12

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:14.790
plus the F 2 external
forces plus f 21.

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:15.700
These two things.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.570
This one plus this
one, basically,

01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:23.410
is the sum of the two time
derivatives of the momentum.

01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:26.380
But what's the sum of
this term and that term?

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.054
AUDIENCE: Zero.

01:03:27.054 --> 01:03:27.720
PROFESSOR: Zero.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.260
And that then allows
you to say that this

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:45.890
is the sum of the external
forces on a system is

01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:49.272
equal to the time rate of
change of the linear momentum

01:03:49.272 --> 01:03:49.855
of the system.

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:56.670
OK.

01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:00.180
And that's basically
this statement.

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.160
And it has nothing to
do with internal forces.

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:13.050
And this allows you
to say that the time

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:16.930
rate of change of the linear
momentum of a rigid body,

01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:19.720
for example.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.885
So a rigid body is
made up of a whole mess

01:04:22.885 --> 01:04:25.430
of different particles.

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:28.100
You could separate this into a
whole bunch of little chunks,

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:33.560
and treat each one of them as a
particle which has connection,

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.210
has forces with
particles next to it.

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:39.140
And all those internal
forces-- so these

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:43.390
are the internal forces--
all of those internal forces

01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:45.830
are equal and
opposite and cancel.

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:47.780
So it's really
the third law that

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:51.300
allows you to say if you
have a system of particles

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:54.690
that the time rate of
change of the total momentum

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:58.050
of the system is zero if there's
no external forces acting

01:04:58.050 --> 01:04:58.550
on it.

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:01.510
And that's where you get the
conservation of momentum--

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:04.692
the law of conservation
of momentum.

01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:05.600
OK.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.580
That's a consequence
of the third law.

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:15.960
OK.

01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:55.950
So you have a homework problem
that has just about this.

01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:58.840
You have a bunch of particles.

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.230
m 1.

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:03.128
m i.

01:06:03.128 --> 01:06:10.830
r 1 with respect to O.
r i with respect to O.

01:06:10.830 --> 01:06:13.779
And you have all these
particles out there.

01:06:13.779 --> 01:06:15.320
And I want to find
the center of mass

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.445
of this group of particles.

01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:22.340
So the center of
mass is a vector.

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:24.900
And let's just say it's here.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:31.000
So I'm looking for r
G with respect to O.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.910
So it's a quantity
that I defined--

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:40.566
r G with respect to O-- times
the summation of the m i's.

01:06:40.566 --> 01:06:44.560
So I'm postulating there's
a place out there that if I

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.120
multiply it by the sum of the
m i's, I get the same answer

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:54.520
as if I summed the m i r i/O's.

01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:59.930
And I'm going to define
the center of mass

01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:07.450
as r G with respect to O is
the summation of each particle

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:12.140
times its position
vector divided

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:13.920
by the sum of the
masses, which is just

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.398
the total mass of the system.

01:07:16.398 --> 01:07:17.210
OK?

01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:19.910
And that's a definition
of center of mass.

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:21.490
And this is a vector.

01:07:21.490 --> 01:07:23.470
And these are vectors.

01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:24.020
OK?

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:26.380
So that's all there is
to the center of mass.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:45.240
And if I take a time
derivative of r G/O,

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:52.025
then it's equal to the summation
of the m i times the r i/O's.

01:07:52.025 --> 01:07:53.650
But they're timed
derivatives-- and I'm

01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:55.608
going to put a dot right
there, so I don't have

01:07:55.608 --> 01:07:59.010
to write out d by dt-- over MT.

01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:05.800
But that's just the summation of
the individual momenta of each

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.470
of the particles over MT.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.235
Very handy little formula.

01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:20.600
And if I take another
time derivative,

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:25.729
so I get an r G/O
double dot, then it's

01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:32.029
just the summation of
the time derivatives

01:08:32.029 --> 01:08:35.160
of the individual
momenta again over this.

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.189
So this is a statement.

01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:37.569
We move this to the other side.

01:08:37.569 --> 01:08:44.720
M T r G/O double dot
equals the summation

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.010
of the timed derivatives
of the individual momenta.

01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:53.520
And that's the total
momentum of the system

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.189
times its timed derivative.

01:08:55.189 --> 01:09:02.420
So just from third
law, you can come up

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:06.740
with all of the linear
momentum formulas.

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:09.229
This is a statement
for rigid body.

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:13.399
The mass times the acceleration
of the center of mass.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:16.899
The total mass of a rigid
body times the acceleration

01:09:16.899 --> 01:09:20.069
of the center of mass
is equal to the time

01:09:20.069 --> 01:09:23.481
rate of change of the total
momentum of that object.

01:09:23.481 --> 01:09:24.439
Very important formula.

01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:26.020
You've used it a lot, right?

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.990
So I'll tell you a quick story,
and then we'll knock off.

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:33.270
So two, three years ago,
we have doctoral exams

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:34.899
in mechanical engineering.

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:37.479
And in the dynamics oral
exam, we had eight students

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:39.229
a few years ago.

01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:42.120
And they were asked to find the
center of mass of an object.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.910
It was just a step
in a harder problem.

01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:46.810
And seven out of
the eight students

01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:49.260
could not remember
the definition

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:50.840
of the center of mass.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.037
Now they could do Lagrange
equations and nasty dynamics

01:09:54.037 --> 01:09:55.620
problems, but they'd
kind of forgotten

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:58.290
some of these really,
really basic things.

01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:01.910
So I have one demo
to show you, just

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:03.520
to illustrate center of mass.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:08.490
So center of mass, we
know how to calculate it.

01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:10.570
And this is a rod.

01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:13.657
How can I simply find the
center of mass of this thing?

01:10:13.657 --> 01:10:14.790
AUDIENCE: Balance it.

01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:16.861
PROFESSOR: Balance it.

01:10:16.861 --> 01:10:17.360
OK.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.980
Young lady here says
move my fingers.

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:22.210
Where do you think
the center of mass is?

01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:23.130
Right in the middle.

01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:23.410
OK.

01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:23.993
Let's find it.

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.330
Should this work, by the way?

01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:32.330
You ever done this?

01:10:35.762 --> 01:10:37.345
All right, the center
of mass, I ought

01:10:37.345 --> 01:10:39.435
to be able to just about
balance this thing there.

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:41.060
So the center of mass
is in the middle.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:41.960
That's because I cheated.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.418
I put a piece of
steel in this end.

01:10:43.418 --> 01:10:44.709
OK?

01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:46.010
All right.

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:49.729
But indeed, you might figure out
why is it that I can actually

01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:50.770
do this and make it work.

01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:51.530
You can do it with a broomstick.

01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:53.340
You can do it with any object.

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:56.330
The key is it'll work so long
as the friction coefficients are

01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:58.550
the same on both fingers.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:01.050
It's really easy to find
center of mass that way.

01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:03.230
So this got a little
steel weight in the end.

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:03.730
OK.

01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:05.220
We're done for today.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:09.150
And see you on Thursday.
