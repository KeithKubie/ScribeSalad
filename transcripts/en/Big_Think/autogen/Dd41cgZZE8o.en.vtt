yourself one of things that's
 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.230
yourself one of things that's
challenging when you're extremely

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.999
challenging when you're extremely
talented at something is that it's

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
talented at something is that it's
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.730
talented at something is that it's
really easy for you and so you generally

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
really easy for you and so you generally
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.339
really easy for you and so you generally

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
generally don't value it as much as that
 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.460
generally don't value it as much as that
think that's really hard and so

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
think that's really hard and so
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.830
think that's really hard and so
somebody else can see that in you

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840
somebody else can see that in you
 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.980
somebody else can see that in you
frequently much better than you can and

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990
frequently much better than you can and
 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.870
frequently much better than you can and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.530
uniquely meant to create here so finding
one other person to share that with a
