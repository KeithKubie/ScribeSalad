00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.510
Let's say I've been researching
some stocks to potentially

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.350
invest in, and I feel
pretty good at my ability

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.510
to predict how good a
company's going to do relative

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.600
to people's expectations, or
the market's expectations.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.770
And in particular, I focus
on companies A and B.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.420
And in the case of
company A, I think

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.801
it's going to do a lot worse
than the market expects

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:21.300
it to do.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.120
So I'm tempted to short it.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.080
And in the case of
company B, I think

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.010
it's going to do much better
than the market expects.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.270
So I'm tempted to
buy it, or go long.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.640
But there's one thing
about this process that

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.830
gets me a little
bit uncomfortable.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.082
I have confidence in my ability
to pick out companies that

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.540
are going to
outperform the market,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.280
or are going to
under-perform the market,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.050
but I have no
confidence in my ability

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.570
to predict to the market.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.046
So in general-- let me draw
a little chart of the market,

00:00:51.046 --> 00:00:52.546
this is the market
price, maybe this

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:55.220
is the S&amp;P 500 or the
NASDAQ-- and I've just

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.340
found that it's as good as
random, as opposed to me trying

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.060
to pick out bottoms
of the markets,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.460
or tops of the markets,
and all the rest.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.099
And so my fear is, what
happens if I buy company B,

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.150
based on my sound research,
and then the market goes down?

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.105
Then company B will
probably still go down.

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:11.980
Maybe it won't go down
as much as the market,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.380
but it will still go
down, and I'll lose money.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.100
Or what if I short company
A and the market goes up?

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.730
Maybe company A won't go a won't
go up as much as the market,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.150
but I'll still lose money
on my short position, which

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.830
is essentially a bet that the
stock is going to go down.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.150
So is there some
arrangement I can do,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.520
some combination of
buying company B,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.250
and selling or
shorting company A,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.430
that will essentially hedge
out a lot of this market risk?

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.670
And as you can
imagine, there is.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.930
And I won't go into all of the
statistics of it, and beta,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.220
and you can really try to
statistically hedge out

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.270
the market risk.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.916
But the general idea
is, if you really

00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:55.790
think this is going to
outperform the market,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.862
or definitely
outperform company A,

00:01:57.862 --> 00:01:59.570
and if you think A
going to under-perform

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.600
the market, or definitely
under-perform relative

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.170
to company B, you can
buy a similar amount of B

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.820
as you will short company
A. So in this case,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.860
let's just do one share.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.860
You can obviously do
multiples of this.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.080
You buy one, let me
write it over here.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.750
So you buy one
share of company B,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.604
and you sell, or you short,
one share of company A.

00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:27.020
You borrow the
share, you sell it,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.790
you'll have to buy
it at a future date.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.190
So you short, I
shouldn't say one share,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.360
you short two shares of
company A. And the reason

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.420
why I'm saying two shares of
company A instead of one share,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.390
is because A is only $5 per
share, and B is $10 per share.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.240
So I want to do roughly
the same amount.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.980
And once again, you can do
fancier statistics on it

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.412
to tweak it, so you can
see how much they actually

00:02:52.412 --> 00:02:53.870
move with the
market, but we're not

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.411
going to worry about
that right here.

00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:58.420
So for simplicity,
what we've done here

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.500
is we've taken a long position,
let me write it over here.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.252
We've taken a long
position in B,

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:09.420
and we have a $10 long
position, and we've

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.930
taken a short position
in A, and it is also

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.680
a $10 short position.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.390
Once again, because
A is $5 per share--

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.330
so we took two shares of A-- it
makes the same dollar amount.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
Now, and maybe I'll save
this for the next video,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.410
I want you to think about what
happens if the market moves

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.330
up or down, but B outperforms
A, or A outperforms B.
