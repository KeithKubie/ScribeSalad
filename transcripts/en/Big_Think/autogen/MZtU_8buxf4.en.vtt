understanding of how final financial
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.469
understanding of how final financial
markets operate and what is the

markets operate and what is the
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.210
markets operate and what is the
relationship between prices in the

relationship between prices in the
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.800

financial market and the real world and

financial market and the real world and
and I think that our current

and I think that our current
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.429
and I think that our current
understanding is is inappropriate that

understanding is is inappropriate that
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.340

financial markets are what their role is

financial markets are what their role is

the prevailing paradigm is that markets

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899
the prevailing paradigm is that markets
 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.109
the prevailing paradigm is that markets
somehow reflect the the real world that

somehow reflect the the real world that
 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.899
somehow reflect the the real world that
that there is some kind of an

that there is some kind of an

that there is some kind of an

equilibrium price or markets tend
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.719
equilibrium price or markets tend
towards an equilibrium which would be an

towards an equilibrium which would be an
 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.360
towards an equilibrium which would be an

that are appropriate to that moment and

that there are deviations from that

neutral accounter of reflector of of the

real world and accurate reflector that
there's a correspondence and that is

there's a correspondence and that is
 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.099
there's a correspondence and that is
false and I put forward a different

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109
false and I put forward a different
 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.210

paradigm which actually does explain

paradigm which actually does explain

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109
what has happened why it has happened
 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.490
what has happened why it has happened
and it differs from the prevailing

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500
and it differs from the prevailing
 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.880
and it differs from the prevailing
paradigm in two respects one is that

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890
paradigm in two respects one is that
 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.370
paradigm in two respects one is that
financial markets are always a biased

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380
financial markets are always a biased
 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.069
financial markets are always a biased
and distorted reflection of the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079
and distorted reflection of the
 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.780
and distorted reflection of the
underlying reality there's always a bias

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790
underlying reality there's always a bias
 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.940
underlying reality there's always a bias
or distortion and secondly that that

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950
or distortion and secondly that that
 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.390
or distortion and secondly that that
bias or distortion has a way of

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400
bias or distortion has a way of
 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.990
bias or distortion has a way of
affecting the underlying reality so

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000
affecting the underlying reality so
 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.780
affecting the underlying reality so
market prices are not a passive

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790
market prices are not a passive
 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.199
market prices are not a passive
reflection but they are an active

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209
reflection but they are an active
 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.960
reflection but they are an active
ingredient in shaping the course of

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970
ingredient in shaping the course of
 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.530
ingredient in shaping the course of
events at this so there's a two-way

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540
events at this so there's a two-way
 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.259
events at this so there's a two-way
connection you know affecting and

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269
connection you know affecting and
 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.129
connection you know affecting and
reflecting and I call this reflectivity

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139
reflecting and I call this reflectivity
 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:59.099
reflecting and I call this reflectivity
and that is inherent in financial

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109
and that is inherent in financial
 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.809
and that is inherent in financial
