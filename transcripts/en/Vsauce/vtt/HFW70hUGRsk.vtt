00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
Wait, hold on a second.
I have a tail?

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.100
Whoa!
And how many red dots

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.000
can you count?
Look close. It's episode 50

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.529
of IMG!
Static electricity and packaging peanuts are always fun

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.260
together,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.500
so is the creation of atom,
even though cats and dogs can do it too.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.260
Oh, and this giraffe is having a fun
time, because he's being

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.289
kissed by a giraffe.
Peek-a-boo.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.520
Peek-a-boo.
The only thing more delicious than a hamburger

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.730
eye makeup are Vsauce nails.
And,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.840
if you walk around with your lips
puckered, from certain perspectives this

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.289
will happen. And is this a guy with no neck
wearing a purple shirt or is it...

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.620
wait, what? Now, this picture exhibits a
similar illusion. Get it?

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.640
It's just like this girl with a hairy
arm that I showed in a previous IMG!

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.340
Now, speaking of hair, here are some
wonderfully rigid structures

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.420
drawn

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.899
with hair-thin thread.
Even Chewbacca

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.340
is hair. And here's a pretty scene that
from far away or with your eyes squinted

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.780
looks like a skull.
Aww, a cute duck.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.360
Gosh, dang it.
Short of the Week illustrated something

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.630
interesting.
The top 10 grossing films over periods of

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.400
10 years.
Blue titles are original ideas,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.020
gray represents adaptations and pink represents

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.200
sequels.
Now, watch what happened as time went on.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.200
In 2011, there wasn't a single

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.619
original movie idea in the top 10.
Tetris tights.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.620
Now, let's watch a bunch of dogs

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.270
wearing shoes.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.970
Here's a transformer who becomes a Game Boy.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.659
And if your chin folds,
combined with your forehead creases

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.990
you wind up like this.
Draw bridge? Okay, if you say so.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.720
And if you want to see a visualization
of the last 100 years

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.000
of shark attacks,
the National Post has this mammoth,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.230
showing where in the world and where on the
body people became victims.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.790
On Facebook, Kess warned us about the very serious

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.760
issue of drowning. LOL. And Leonardo showed us crayons carved into Star Wars shapes.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.090
But you won't get lost with this giant
comprehensive math

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.459
of the entire Star Wars galaxy.
If you'd rather map something

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.920
fewer light years across,
check out this site, where you can see a map of the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.880
wind, its patterns, as it invisibly tangles itself

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.069
across the USA.
Geographies of the World's Knowledge is a free booklet

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.720
available as a PDF or an iPad book and it shows

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.840
the distribution of knowledge in the
Internet age. The size of each country

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.560
is relative to number of people in it

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.180
who have access to Internet.
Its redness

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.280
is equal to the percentage.
And this map

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.910
shows the distribution of heavy metal
bands from around the world.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.130
Now look at this from a distance and you will see

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.769
yourself. With most Vsauce videos end it's
like the end of a schools zone,

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.120
but when IMG number 50 is over,
it's the end of a

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.520
cool zone.
So, kitty, turn off the lights, because

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.380
as always,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.380
thanks for watching.
