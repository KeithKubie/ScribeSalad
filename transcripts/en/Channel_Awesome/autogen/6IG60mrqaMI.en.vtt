was<00:15:31.250><c> just</c><00:15:31.400><c> curious</c><00:15:31.670><c> I</c><00:15:32.000><c> guess</c><00:15:32.540><c> the</c><00:15:32.750><c> commenters</c>

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:33.380 align:start position:0%

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.350 align:start position:0%
was just curious I guess the commenters
I'm<00:15:33.560><c> sure</c><00:15:33.770><c> will</c><00:15:34.010><c> say</c><00:15:34.160><c> yeah</c><00:15:34.340><c> but</c><00:15:34.640><c> my</c><00:15:35.060><c> guess</c>

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sure will say yeah but my guess
 

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.150 align:start position:0%
I'm sure will say yeah but my guess
would<00:15:35.570><c> be</c><00:15:35.630><c> no</c><00:15:35.750><c> because</c><00:15:36.380><c> I</c><00:15:36.410><c> think</c><00:15:36.680><c> it's</c><00:15:37.010><c> usually</c>

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
would be no because I think it's usually
 

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.970 align:start position:0%
would be no because I think it's usually
the<00:15:37.550><c> triangle</c><00:15:38.150><c> like</c><00:15:38.480><c> that</c><00:15:38.510><c> rainbows</c><00:15:39.170><c> rainbow</c>

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:39.980 align:start position:0%
