00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.580
Imagine this: you've been lost in a forest for a couple days.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.460
You've been looking for your way back to civilization, when you finally find the right path and you're on your way home.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.660
There's one problem though.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:31.000
Separating you from your way out of there is an extremely wobbly, cricking, and sky-level bridge that's stationed in the middle of a forest canyon.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.220
Now tell me, how are you feeling right at this moment?

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.740
Unless you're Tarzan, you're probably scared out of your mind right now.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.840
You're eyes are nervously blinking and aiming to get a good enough image. You're fidgeting with your hands. You feel your face swelling up with sweat.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.240
You're unsure whether or not you'll make it out alive.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.740
Don't those symptoms sound a little familiar? Like when going on a promising first date.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.940
Or when you're in the movie theater because your friends dragged you to see the latest horror movie. Or a job interview to land that dream position.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.440
In other words, we're aroused.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:14.120
Scientists define arousal as alertness, engagement, and a heightened level of physical activity, such as an elevated heart rate.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.060
Psychologists, Donald Dutton and Arthur Aron, conducted a classic experiment, testing attraction.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:28.560
They put men on to two different bridges. One was an extremely shaky, tall one, like the one we discussed earlier, while the other was a more stable, shorter one.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.680
Dutton and Aron speculated that walking across the bridge stirred up a sense of arousal,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.160
and that these participants would mistakenly think they were attracted to the female experimenter that greeted them.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.940
However, the two psychologists state that the arousal wouldn't derive from the experimenter's attractiveness,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.900
but rather it's a result of the intensiveness of crossing the shaky bridge.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.940
Their findings were interesting. The males who crossed the wobbly bridge were more likely to call the experimenter,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.980
and their story of the picture contained more sexual content..

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.100
Scientists say the men on the less sturdy bridge mistakenly took this arousal yielded from crossing the bridge

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.160
and assumed it was because they were attracted to the female experimenter, then pursuing her and calling her later.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.920
Dr. Benjamin Le states that this misplacing of attraction can be directly tied to effective dating advice.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.660
If you want your date to potentially feel more aroused around you, pick out a scary activity.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.040
Watching a horror movie. Going to a scary tourist attraction for a theme park.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.020
Web searching haunted locations--that are legal and safe--or picking out an activity that they fear, but want to overcome.
