00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.440
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.696
&gt;&gt; My name in Kevin Solivan.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.960
I'm the Sunday and Features
Editor of the Washington Post,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.166
which is a charter
sponsor of this event.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.110
I have to say that it's-- as a
long time and very loyal employee

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:19.273
of the Washington Post, I've
always found Timothy Egan

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.256
of the New York Times to be
just incredibly annoying.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.130
[ Laughter ]

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.646
&gt;&gt; The guy is freakishly talented.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.673
He is also a very nice man,
which I hate even more.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.420
He was part of the 2001 series

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.893
in the New York Times called
How Racist Lived in America,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.280
that one that's full of surprise.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.220
Not satisfied to squash the
opposition that way, he had to go on

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.033
and started writing books.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.106
He wrote one called the Worst
Hard Time, which is a history

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.426
of the Dust Bowl, which naturally
won the National Book Award.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.510
[ Applause ]

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.326
&gt;&gt; Most recently, he has written--

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.526
[inaudible] here to
talk about today--

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.926
is a book called The Big Burn:
Teddy Roosevelt and the Fire

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.966
that Saved America, which details
the great fire of 1910 that burned

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.666
about three million acres and helped
shape the modern US Force Service.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.236
So Timothy, I just wanted to
let you know, if you get tired

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.776
of conquering the world and
you want to come for at work

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.510
for a real newspaper,
we have a space

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.176
for you at the Washington Post.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.240
Welcome.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.740
[ Applause ]

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.973
&gt;&gt; Now, the Washington Post,
is that a newspaper, or--

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.116
still being published,
some kind of website?

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.176
No. Thank you so much.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.243
As a fellow Irishman, and
I'm cutting in tons of slack

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.110
and I told them I have
the last word.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.976
Welcome all of you.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.043
Thank you for coming to this event.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.363
I am a native of the Puget Sound
region in Washington State,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.856
and I think our high today is
probably gonna be 62 degrees.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.650
So I wish I could just
hook up a giant vent

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.416
to that natural air-conditioning
that comes off of Puget Sound

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:58.693
and pour it all into here
and give you a little bit

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.046
of what keeps us cool.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.580
But I can't.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.846
So instead, I'm going to talk
briefly about the biggest wild fire

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.513
in our history and two
remarkable characters;

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.703
President Teddy Roosevelt,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.623
and the incredibly
excentric Gifford Pinchot,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.050
and how these two easterners,
these two sons of privilege,

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.460
actually changed the
country for the better

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.480
and forever through this fire.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.990
So let me talk about this, just
give you a sense of the size.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.096
It was exactly a 100 years ago
last month, August 21, 1910,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.853
that a wild fire broke out
of the northern Rockies,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900
and we have never seen
anything like it since.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.050
In 36 hours, a day and a half,
three million acres burned.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.050
Now, how big is three million acres?

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.043
Well, as a westerner,
it doesn't seem big,

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.510
but it's the size of Connecticut.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.510
So it's all of Connecticut burning
border to border in 36 hours.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.130
This fire destroyed five towns,
removed them from the map,

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.043
it killed about a 100 people, it
burned in excess of 2000 degrees,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.306
it leapt from tree to tree,
going so fast that men

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.346
and horses could not outrun
it, it was an absolute disaster

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.230
from every point of view;
lost of lives, lost of woods,

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.016
lost of the ecosystem, except
for it changed America.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.040
It had this ironic effect of saving
the fledgling United States Forest

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.733
Service, and therefore,
saving this public lands dream

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.823
which was just this little
fledgling thing that Teddy Roosevelt

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.603
and Gifford Pinchot started, and was
nearly dead when the fire happened.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.110
So I started wanting to tell a
rather classic story of human beings

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.566
versus nature and that's
really what I'm drawn to.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.683
That's why I love the Dust Bowl
story, because you have these acts

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.323
of hubris, you have people
pushing the earth to the extreme,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.030
you have people thinking they
can outwit Mother Nature,

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.860
and then nature gets its revenge.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.053
And I saw that in this fire too.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.613
And I was gonna write this story
that was just gonna be this geewhiz,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.846
how cool is that fire story about,
you know, incredible temperatures

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.310
and people diving into streams
and having little estrus

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.566
for air while the fire jump over
them so they could live and hope

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.586
that they-- well, being in the
stream, it would spare their life.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.293
But I got so drawn to
this fabulous backstory

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.133
of Teddy Roosevelt
and Gifford Pinchot.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:20.726
Now, a quick word about Roosevelt.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.620
Most of you already know this.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.620
He was our youngest president.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.403
Of course, he became president
after McKinley was assassinated.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.246
That's youngest to assume
the presidency not elected.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.960
He wrote 14 books before
his 40th birthday.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.060
He was a very sickly child.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.820
He was told that he would have to
cultivate a life for the indoors,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.340
that he should stay
away from the outdoors,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.940
and he said I will
not live that way.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.606
I will will my way to strength.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.930
So he built his body up in college,
he defied the doctor's predictions

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.673
that he could not be a man of the
outdoors, and when he was young,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.840
he fell in love with this absolutely
gorgeous woman he met at Harvard,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.230
and wrote this sonnets
to her and talked

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.736
about her being the most perfect
thing that he had ever seen or met,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.736
marries her, gets a
career in New York Politics

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.036
in the New York Assembly,
and they [inaudible] branch

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.770
of the republican party.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.103
In his young 20s, he is the--

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.286
on his way to being the top ranking
republican in New York Assembly,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.320
and then something absolutely
catastrophic happens to him.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.486
On Valentines Day,
February 14, 1884, his wife,

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:30.346
his beautiful young wife is
giving birth to their first child,

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.023
Alice was her name, on their home
across the street from Central Park

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.843
on 57th Avenue in New York City.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.703
She dies at childbirth.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.506
Roosevelt is absolutely struck.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.270
He is stunned.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.620
He goes upstairs to the top floor
of his townhouse he is living in,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.720
and his mother dies on the same day.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.430
So Teddy Roosevelt lose--
loses his wife and his mother

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.356
on Valentine's Day, 1884, and for
those of you who are privileged

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.426
to look at the-- his diaries here,
the Library of Congress as I did,

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.010
you see on February 14, this great
writer, this prolific author,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.960
this most amazing,
this man who was--

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.016
who could dash off 10,000 words
before noon in letters and prose,

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.400
writes a single thing on the
diary page on February 14.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.793
He writes a giant X, and
he writes underneath that,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.680
"The light has gone out of my life."

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.220
So he resigns his position
in the New York Assembly,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.576
he gives his young baby
daughter to his sister to raise,

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.716
and he goes out west
to Dakota Territory.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.210
And there, he lives
for almost two years

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.050
in about an area the
size of this stage.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.683
He has his books and his buffalo
rug, and he has his fireplace,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.920
and he runs cattle 14 hours a day,
and the west makes him whole again.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.503
The west makes-- gets
rid of his grief.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.960
And so, he says later,
"I owe more to the west

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.880
than any other man
can ever imagine."

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.813
But something else happened
to him when he was out there.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.040
He saw that the Eden of America,
which he'd always dreamed

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.556
of as a little kid, the
bison that roamed the plains,

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.213
the birds that blotted out
the sky in the pacific flyway,

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.530
they were disappearing, that we were
killing this Eden a hundred years

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.176
into our nation.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.176
So it makes a sort of a
conservationist of him,

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.376
even though there is no such word.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.310
Now, fast forward.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.036
McKinley is assassinated, Roosevelt
is hiking in the Adirondacks,

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.183
he comes down prematurely.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.090
It turns out they told him
McKinley's probably gonna live.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.026
Roosevelt goes back up
into the Adirondacks,

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.543
the secret service comes and gets
him again, and he comes all the way

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.576
out by horseback, by
hiking, by buggy.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.390
And this time, McKinley does die,
and Roosevelt is made our president.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.426
And he says, "I wanted to
transform the Republican Party"--

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.353
his exact words-- "into
a fairly radical party."

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.993
And part of his dream is
conservation, public land,

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.170
that we're not going to be
like Europe, where they'll--

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:57.370
you had to ask the
lords of the manor

00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.036
if you wanted to use the woods.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.770
We're not gonna be like England,
where less than 1 percent

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.303
of its land is owned by the public.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.636
We're gonna take the
great public domain,

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:07.503
that left over from
Louisiana purchase,

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.523
all the land that we purchased
from the European nations,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.636
the land we pushed the Indians
off of as well, and we're going

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.396
to give it to the public.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.073
And in order to do that, he needs
Gifford Pinchot, who is this,

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.186
I said incredibly excentric
person, born of vast wealth.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.033
He grew up in Gray
Towers in Pennsylvania,

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.126
a castle that had 63
turrets and 27 fireplaces,

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.883
and he sleeps on a stone pillow.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:36.630
He goes out by himself and
prefers sleeping on the ground.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.770
He is an esthetic.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.303
He is very odd individual.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.436
People can't figure him out.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.903
But he also sees that this great
dream of America is being ruined.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:47.656
So Roosevelt gets Pinchot
on as his top aid.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.750
Now, Pinchot is to Roosevelt what
Rahm Emanuel is to Barrack Obama.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.336
He is Karl Rove to George Bush.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.693
And they write that the way
they came up with the idea

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.873
for conservation was
during these episodes

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.680
of skinny-dipping in the Potomac.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:07.550
So the secret service
would hold their clothes

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.650
and they would be swimming
nude, and one time,

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.490
the fresh ambassador joined
them, and Roosevelt says

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.976
that the French ambassador said,
"I insist on keeping my gloves."

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.110
Nude expect for his gloves.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.576
And he said, "Why do you do this?"

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.460
And the French ambassador said,
"There might be ladies present."

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.360
[ Laughter ]

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:27.926
&gt;&gt; So this is who these
two individuals are.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.523
They are rugged outdoorsmen, they
go for these triathlons essentially

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:33.700
up in Rock Creek Park where
they'll pound out six mile hikes,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:37.550
scale these rock walls, and end
up swimming nude in the Potomac.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.210
Again, I can only imagine Emanuel
nude in Potomac with Obama,

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.366
talks about health care reform.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.056
And one other thing, just to throw
enough-- another variable into this.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.736
The love of Pinchot's
live had also died.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:00.090
This woman he was madly in love
with had died at a young age.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:00.406
&gt;&gt; But Pinchot then,
because it was a psychic age,

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.526
fell in love with the ghost.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.090
So for 20 years, Pinchot-- this is
a secret that was not deciphered

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:14.403
until a 100 years later-- he was
spiritually sealed to a ghost.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:14.736
So he would write in his diary,
had a great dinner with Teddy,

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.976
Laura enjoyed it as well.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.753
And who is Laura?

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.533
Laura is the ghost who
he-- appears with him.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.640
And he wrote this all in code.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:26.973
He would say, "Another bright day."

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.306
Bright day meant Laura
appeared that day.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:30.686
Or he would say a cloudy day when
his long lost love did not appear.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:35.590
So these are the two individuals
founding American conservation.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.550
Now, one more thing, and
I'll get to the fire.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:41.413
They're gifted, as you
should be in politics,

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.206
by having fantastic enemies.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.410
It is the gilded age.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.613
It is-- there's never been a greater
disparity of wealth in our history,

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.456
well, until just a few years
ago as a matter of fact.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.290
[ Laughter ]

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.290
&gt;&gt; So you had this one,
United States senator,

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.313
Senator Clark from Montana,
whose dream in life was

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.133
to be the riches person
who ever lived.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.026
And he accumulates 200 million
dollars in the copper trade,

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.706
and he moves to New York.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.260
He's the senator from Montana, and
he builds this mansion in New York,

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:09.576
and he never goes back to Montana.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:11.990
And he has one goal in life
as a United States senator.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.203
His one goal is to stop the creation
of United States Forest Service.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:19.703
He thinks this is horrible
that they're going

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.936
to give the land to the people.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.136
The land belongs to the
gilded age robber barrens.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.136
They can't do this.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.403
Now, Mark Twin had
called this Senator Clark,

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:30.613
just to give you a sense
of how, well, you know,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:33.280
we sort of lost the
lost art of insults,

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:35.676
but this is what Twin
said about Senator Clark.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:43.003
"He is the most disgusting creature
that the republic has yet produced."

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.400
Succinct to the point,
you know, nails him.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.840
So this is his enemy.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:49.743
Also, he had an enemy in JP Morgan.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.910
When Roosevelt left office in
1909, he went off to Africa,

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.963
and Morgan famously said, "I
trust some lian will do its duty."

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360
[ Laughter ]

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:03.843
&gt;&gt; He loved this.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:05.843
He welcomed this.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.843
Roosevelt welcomed their hatred.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.843
He was a traitor to their class.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.976
He said once, "There is not in
the world a more ignoble character

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.110
than the mere money
getting American,

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.956
insensitive to every duty
regardless of principle,

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.280
bent only on amassing a fortune."

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.350
So they're outlet is
the forest service.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:24.756
They create by executive order more
than 200 million acres who are--

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:29.196
it's this land that
belongs to you and I.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.206
They always talked about it
belonging to the little people.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.320
They would use that
term, little people.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:36.836
I guess, it didn't really
mean people under 5 foot 4,

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.770
but that's the term they used.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.103
And so, he leaves office in 1909,
Taft takes over, President Taft.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.930
Taft is the exact opposite
of Roosevelt.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.743
He is 350 pounds of insecurity,
he claims all he wants

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.260
to do is take a long
bath in the afternoon,

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.693
have a nap, and eat in peace.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.426
He's conflict diverse.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.760
And so, he lets the
conservation dream die.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:01.766
He lets this thing that Roosevelt
and Pinchot put together,

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.506
just lets congress
nibble it to death.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.833
And they're dismantling the young
United States Forest Service.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.980
It's 5-year-old when
on August 21, 1910,

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.040
a wind comes out of
the southwest and kicks

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.940
up into 70 mile an hour winds, and
starts this giant conflagration.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.820
And that becomes the Big Burn.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.686
Now, we had never tried
to fight a wild fire

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.460
as a nation in our history.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.660
We do now.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.526
Anyone who grows up in the west
knows that summers are full

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.773
of yellow-shirted men and women
going around from fire to fire,

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.563
and half the budget of the
forest service is trying

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.530
to prevent wild fire.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.730
But we never did before.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.586
So they assembled an army of
10,000 people, mostly immigrants.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.453
They said, in a quote from Courier
Magazine, " There were Scotsmen

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.693
and Negroes, Italians and Danes,
Micks, Macks and Scandihoovians."

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:56.950
[ Laughter ]

00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.513
&gt;&gt; And on top of that, you
had African-American soldiers,

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.910
the buffalo shoulders, who are
always sent around the west

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.063
to do the sort of dirty work.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.953
They had to put down the labor
insurrections, they had to go

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.460
into town that were under martial
law for different labor problems.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:11.686
They were sent to fight this fire.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:13.760
So you had, in place, the young
United States Forest Service,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.680
all these immigrants,
I traced the death

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.093
of these two Italian boys who'd
come from this little tiny village

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.183
on the Italian-French border, and
ended up dying in the American West

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.303
for 25 cents an hour in the
service of Gifford Pinchot

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.396
and Teddy Roosevelt's dream.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.463
They had this entire army of
people, but they were helpless,

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.950
absolutely helpless
when this fire blew up.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.086
You know, there was
a great t-shirt I saw

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.486
after the San Francisco
earthquake which I covered

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.286
for the New York Times in 1989.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:47.620
Remember, that was the World Series
between Oakland and San Francisco,

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:50.943
and the earthquake
interrupted the World Series,

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:56.390
and people had this t-shirt
that said, "Nature bats last."

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.140
And that's the story of a Dust Bowl.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.746
It's also that story of this fire.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.213
They had 10,000 people in place,
and they couldn't do anything.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.440
They were utterly helpless.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.053
Now, I want you to imagine what
a 70 mile an hour wind is like.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.826
It's classified officially
as a hurricane force wind.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:14.316
And I was a knucklehead once for
a history channel documentary

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.483
where they're recreating
the Dust Bowl storm,

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.883
and they fired up these giant fans.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.330
They said, "Tim, just get up
there in the ground over their."

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:24.683
And they brought this flatbed
truck in these two giant fans.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:27.523
They said, "We're gonna
whip this thing up

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.723
and see what it does to you."

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.056
So they got up to 45 miles an
hour, and they're like [inaudible].

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.723
They got up to 50, and
I'm holding my ground.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.390
When they got to 70,
I was a tumbleweed.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:37.716
I was just completely thrown back.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:40.450
That's was this fire was, except
that it was carrying, you know,

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:47.236
embers the size of a horse's
thigh, and just burning detritus,

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:48.383
and it was leaping from
tree top to tree top.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:49.583
It was an utter-- they
call these fires blowups.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:52.496
They create their own
weather systems.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.070
It's a beast in search of oxygen.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:01.336
So men would go onto these mining
shafts to try to hide it out

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:01.933
and think they could--
they would live,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.260
and the fire itself would steel the
oxygen out of these mining shafts.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.406
It would find them.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.650
You had whole platoons of people
died in these mining shafts.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:11.686
Not of the fire itself, but of
the oxygen that came and got them.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.640
So the fire lasts 36 hours,
burns the three million acres,

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.926
burns the five towns to the
ground, kills a hundred people,

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.486
but Roosevelt uses it as
do all great politicians,

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.903
as a mythic turning point.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:34.423
These brave young Americans died on
behalf of the conservation dream.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.470
He makes it like losing
warriors in battle.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:40.680
He makes it not a losing cause,
but he makes it a calling cause,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:44.310
something that is worth
fighting for.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:47.636
So what happens?

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:48.940
You owe most of your forest, your
national forest in the east coast

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.046
to this wild fire, because
there was bill in congress

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.263
that had been stalled through
all of Roosevelt's administration

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.370
that would have created national
forests in Virginia, Pennsylvania,

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:02.290
New England, all throughout
the east coast.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.743
And it was always stalled.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.046
After the fire happened,
these young men were heroes,

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.306
it changed almost overnight.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:11.683
The act passed, the forest
service was expanded,

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.596
and the forest service was
saved in and of itself.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.570
So, you know, great
politicians use events.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:23.363
And, you know, not
even great politicians.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:25.350
But throughout history going
back to earliest times,

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:30.376
people have used events,
battles, catastrophes,

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.716
things to mold public
opinion, to say,

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.476
"And this really was
the founding myth

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:37.650
of the United States
Forest Service."

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.450
So in conclusion, our legacy is--

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.946
I mentioned this in a column in
the other day, and I got a lot

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:45.056
of email notes from people in Europe
who were just actually jealous,

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.340
and I was sort of rubbing
it in to old Europe.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.920
We have an area twice, twice the
size of France that belongs to all

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.463
of us, and its national
parks, its national forest,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.953
its Bureau of Land Management,
its National Wild Life Refugees,

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:06.653
all of it is ours,
it's our birthright.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.460
You're born an American
citizen, that's yours.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:12.510
[ Applause ]

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.403
&gt;&gt; And my idea is that we owe this,

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:26.223
the survival of this public
lands dream to this one event

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.106
from a hundred years ago.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.973
By the way-- and I'll take
some questions in a moment.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.030
You can still see, if you go back
as I did, to the northern Rockies

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:33.366
in Idaho and Montana
where this fire burned.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.053
Some of the skeletal
remains of this great fire,

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.213
you'll see standing chard, just
real dark and little skeletons,

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.533
bits of cedar or pine that
were part of this thing.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.610
But you can't see any
indication of the towns.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:50.150
I walked into these
towns that were some

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.016
of the most brawling
wide open saloon towns.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.126
One young United States forest
ranger, when he was sent to one

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.560
of these towns, they were
in the national forest,

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.296
but they were like deadwood,
they were like you know, drifter,

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:03.623
workers working on the railroad.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:06.303
One forest ranger, fresh out of
Yale, which Pinchot had endowed

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:09.196
to make the first forestry
school, was shocked.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:11.866
He sent a telegram back to Mazula
forest service headquarters.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.113
He said, "Two undesirable
prostitutes setting

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.880
up business on public land.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.520
What should I do?"

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.490
And some smart aleck got a
hold of the telegram in Mazula,

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.816
and he wired back, "Get
two desirable ones."

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.370
[ Laughter ]

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.420
&gt;&gt; And I was speaking last fall
in California at a bookstore,

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:37.746
and a woman came up
to me, and she pulled

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.633
out this little plastic folder,
and she showed me the telegram.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.040
It said, "Get to desirable ones."

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.033
He said, "That was my grandfather."

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.846
And I said, "That's so cool.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.050
What a line."

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.916
You know, what a great line.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.383
So our legacy is we have a United
States Forest Service now that's

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.050
among, the-- you know,
people don't think well

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.383
of federal workers generally,
when you [inaudible].

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.356
But the forest service and the park
service is very well thought of,

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.010
and our legacy is that
public land as well.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.210
So thank you.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.086
I'll take some questions.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000


00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.710
[ Applause ]

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.290
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.623
Two quick questions.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:23.756
One is how did you
get into the story?

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.640
I mean, how did you get motivated
to do a story on the Big Burn?

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:28.343
It doesn't normally
roll off one's tongue.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:35.203
And second of all, how do we capture
this moment of the BP oil spill,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.343
et cetera, et cetera, to move
the conservation movement further

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.083
to energy conservation?

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Great question.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.016
In case you didn't hear, she said
how did I get the story basically,

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:46.016
then how did we capture
this movement?

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.416
Well, I grew up in the west.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:50.616
I'm a third generation
westerner, and you know,

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.683
we were big Irish catholic family,
and we didn't a summer home,

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.550
we didn't have any extra land.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.350
We had the national forest.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.753
So my mom would haul all seven of
us Egan kids, because my dad didn't

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.080
like to camp, and we'd go out in
this giant smelly canvass tent,

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.876
and you know, seven kids.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.076
I mean, it was great for us.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:10.410
My mom went crazy.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.810
But I love public lands.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.956
I learned to love, you know,
the high mountains of Montana,

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:15.490
the trout streams of
Idaho, these beautiful lakes

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:18.793
that you'd dive into,
just like Pinchot

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.746
and Roosevelt, skinny dip in them.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.283
And I'd always sort
of heard of this fire.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.096
It had this sort of, you know,
the Big Burn was background.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.670
You know, the Big Burn
was on a mystic lost

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.400
to the midst of times sort of thing.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.933
And then when-- after I wrote
the story about the Dust Bowl,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.576
I guess I wanted to move from
element, dust, to another, fire,

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:40.006
and just sort of go through
the big elements, and again,

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.490
I wouldn't have done the book if
it was just about the burn itself.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:50.790
But I got so entranced by these two
characters, Roosevelt and Pinchot,

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.906
and their early founding
of the forest service,

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.383
and the ecos of our age right now,
the fact that it was the high--

00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.163
the peak of immigration that
they actually passed laws

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.680
to keep Italians from
coming into the country,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.546
'cause it's the peak
of Italian immigration.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.946
There are two million
Italians a year coming into,

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.480
and a lot of those
guys-- well, not a lot--

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.213
but a number of them
died in this fire.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.246
I mean, it was amazing to go
to Italy and see this grave

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.846
in this tiny little
village up in the Italian--

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.766
not the [inaudible] on the French
border, and listing the name

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.260
of these two boys, say
died in the American West,

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.390
[foreign language],
in this big fire.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.253
So I love the parallel story
to ours, with the immigrants

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.860
and with just the fascination of
how you found something like that.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.520
As to the other thing, how do
you keep the movement going,

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.493
there is only really one way.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.293
I don't look at this
as a political thing.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:40.960
I know it probably sounds political.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:42.636
You know, love of the
outdoors is something that--

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.616
it's like religion, I guess.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.816
You have a moment at some point

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:50.416
where you see something
that's beautiful.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.733
Or you're on a walk, or you're going
for a swim, or you catch a fish,

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.300
or you see a sunset, you just
have some connection to nature.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.663
You can't argue this abstractly.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.260
You can, but it won't
win converts over.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:03.276
What happens is you
have magical moments.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.123
And I think, now, I was happy

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.123
to see the national park
visitation figures are up this year

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.190
after being down for 10 years.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:12.343
And you know what's the most
used land in the United States?

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:14.973
It's Gifford Pinchot's
National Forest.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.120
They get something like 400
million user visits a year.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.133
So I think that's how
you renew the dream,

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.773
is you make people fall in love.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:24.673
You introduce children
to the outdoors.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.026
All of my kids, you know, hike
with me and love it to the extent,

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:29.683
as long as they can text and stuff.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.690
[ Laughter ]

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:34.756
&gt;&gt; So that's it.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:36.956
I went on too long.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.690
Yes, sir?

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:40.490
&gt;&gt; How did Teddy Roosevelt
respond or react

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:42.630
to Gifford's believed spiritual
relationship with this dead person?

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:45.213
Did he believe she was
with him all the time?

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.153
Or did they have to use
a medium to communicate.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.313
&gt;&gt; No. You can imagine what
a scandal it would be--

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:53.866
again, if it got out in the press,

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:55.956
chief aid to president
lives with spirit.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:58.890
No. It was an age where a lot
of people were visiting mystics

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.236
and going-- and I saw one of the
letters that said to Pinchot,

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.823
"He shouldn't use these mediums.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.210
He should use the better
known mediums."

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.246
They said, "Don't use
these promiscuous mediums

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.246
that sometimes bring the other
spirits into the seance."

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.966
But Roosevelt never knew.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.273
It was the best kept secret
of Gifford Pinchot's life.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.043
It was only deciphered about
10 years ago by a scholar

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:23.293
who noticed how he would talk about
Laura, that was the woman's name,

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.000
by these coded words, by saying
a bright day or a cloudy day.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.173
Now, Pinchot told one person.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:34.603
He lived with his mother
on Rhode Island Avenue,

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.643
and he told his mother.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:39.303
He wore black for a year after his
beloved died, and then one day,

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.423
he showed up, the black--
he was not wearing black,

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.410
and he had a skip in his step.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.743
And his mother said, "What's
up with you, Gifford?'

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:48.943
He said, "I'm married."

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.810
And she said, "What?"

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:52.846
He said, "Yes, Laura and I
are now sealed for eternity."

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:53.953
And she said, "Don't you
ever bring this up again."

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:56.756
She said, "You will not be
married to a dead person."

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:00.163
So he never brought it up again.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:02.830
So, one person knew
his secret; his mother.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:04.856
And again, then a scholar
deciphered it 10 years ago.

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:06.773
I wonder though, Roosevelt
was not exactly a romantic,

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.400
though he did love the outdoors
and he love poetry, and he was--

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.666
he had so many interests.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.466
I mean, anyone who comes to
Roosevelt sort of called,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.283
those sort fall in love with him,
'cause his interests were so broad.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.583
But I think if he knew this, he
would have slapped Pinchot around.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:25.206
And I have a scene, by the way,

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:27.540
where they're boxing
in their undies.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.046
It's when they first meet and
Roosevelt is governor in Albany,

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.700
and it's a winter night, and
Pinchot meets him, and you know,

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.833
they're sort of strange guys.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.300
They don't wanna have a drink, they
don't wanna-- they wanna fight.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.650
So they stripped down to their
underpants and boxed for 45 minutes,

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.080
and then they take a brake, and they
wrestle, and Pinchot writes later

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.010
in his diary, "I had-- I'm a modest
man, but I had a distinct pleasure

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:50.530
of knocking the future president
of the United States on his pins."

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:54.530
[ Laughter ]

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.670
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you for both of your books.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.646
They were very easy to read
and brings history alive.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.226
I'm interested in your thought.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.956
In The Worst Hard Time, I think
you give a very vivid description

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.066
of the role that government
policy, in terms of home steadying

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:13.366
and agriculture policy,
contributed to the conditions

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.513
that led to the Dust Bowl.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.180
And you know, given the contributing
factors towards climate change

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.993
today, what are your observations in
terms of some kind catalytic event?

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.083
&gt;&gt; The old tricky climate
change question.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:33.693
Well, they actually did change
the climate in the Dust Bowl.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.540
I mean, they ripped up an area more
than a 100 million acres, an area,

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:41.570
you know, bigger than
the size of Pensylvania.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.793
That was part of the greatest
grassland the world have ever known.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.013
I mean, you had this delicate
ecosystem evolved over 10,000 years.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:49.263
You had 30 million bison roamed
over, these great, you know,

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:53.736
herbivores who only
needed grass to survive.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:55.593
You had Native Americans who
only needed buffalo to kill,

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:58.880
and you know, everybody
got along pretty well.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.613
This was the last great
bit of settlement.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:04.890
More people home steadied in the
20th century than home steadied

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.560
in the 19th, 'cause they doubled the
Homestead Act to try to get everyone

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.273
to take up this land that had been
called the great American dessert.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:14.386
And I don't blame these
people, because these are people

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:16.943
who were kicked around
all over the globe.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.133
They were the Scotch-Irish
who had been the cannon fodder

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.366
on the confederate side of the
Civil War, they were, you know,

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:24.673
Latinos that came up from
the South, they were Germans

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.576
who didn't own land in old
Germany, and they transported their

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.996
who villages intact from
Germany or the Russian step,

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.093
and just plopped them down on the
American Midwest, in some cases,

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:37.946
with the same name of the town.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.780
So you have a Pfeiffer or a
Katherine Step that's moved

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.263
from Russia or Germany and
plopped down in the Kansas.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.823
And they never owned a
piece of dirt in their life.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:48.770
No one in their own
family had ever--

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:50.823
so I don't blame the
people for getting

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:52.840
in on this last great Homestead Act.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.126
It was a marvelous thing.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.523
And for a while, it all looked
like it was going to work.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.130
But it didn't.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.283
The rain stopped coming, this is
a dry area, you can't farm their.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.843
It's meant to be grass.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.456
It's meant for cattle or bison.

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:09.390
You can't tear up this ground.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:09.896
So in very short [inaudible], it's
a mini-parable of climate change.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.350
It really is.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.350
And this isn't me who
came to this conclusion.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.483
This isn't-- these aren't scholars,
these aren't people who are

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.083
on the payroll of Al Gore.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.016
The farmers and the women and
men who lived to this era,

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.193
who I was so privileged to
spend so much time with,

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.106
they're leaving in the planet now.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.573
They are all in their 90s.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.240
They have this story inside of them.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.106
I was so privileged to be able to
able to sit down in their homes

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.456
in Kansas and Oklahoma and
Texas and hear these stories.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.823
They told me they screwed up.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.320
They told me they pushed
nature too far.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:44.453
So when people ask me about
the climate change questions,

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.726
it's really simple.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:48.660
We-- they did change the climate.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.460
They changed an entire ecosystem,
and nature got its revenge.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.583
It's what I said earlier
about nature bats last.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:55.456
And it doesn't take a scholar,
or it doesn't take a politician

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:58.416
on the payroll to one of the big
green agencies to tell you this.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:01.253
These farmers told me this
'cause they saw what happened.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.270
So I think we all need to--
by the way, I was really glad.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.490
When my son was taking AP
History in high school,

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.470
I looked at this history of
book, real thick history book,

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:15.346
and I opened it up to the index to
Dust Bowl, I was right in the middle

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.660
of my research, did one paragraph

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:19.620
on the Dust Bowl in
the AP History book.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.520
I was shocked.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.320
And now, you know, so many
people have taken to the story.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.166
Ken Burns is doing a documentary
next year, and he'll bring it

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.100
to a lot of people as well.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.513
So I mean, a lot of people
see this story for what it is;

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.460
a man-caused disaster that has so
many great threads of history in it.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:40.890
So I'm glad to see we're
trying to learn from it.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:43.603
And also, one final thing.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:45.726
Again, I was so privileged to talk
to those people before they left,

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.946
'cause they are just
remarkable folks.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:49.783
They're a little hard to get
going after awhile, but--

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:53.123
especially the men who tend not
to a motor talk unless you talk

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.283
in sports, but they
were just fabulous.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:58.703
I guess I have time
for one more question.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:03.650
&gt;&gt; My question is about urban fires.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.340
I evacuated our home almost
20 years ago in Oakland,

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.206
California as we saw
the flames come across.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:11.406
Originally from the east coast,
couldn't really grasp the idea

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.166
that a fire could jump three ways,

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.433
burn 3,000 homes, and
devastate a city.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.466
I understand the idea of a forest
service focusing on large kinds

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.406
of forest fires, but what about
the urban fires that go on?

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.620
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:31.430
The number one thing that's
sucking up all the money

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.016
in the public land agencies right
now is fighting what they call the

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.336
Urban Wildland Interface.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.203
And it's really simple.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:41.076
In the last generation, 20 million
people have moved into areas next

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:45.810
to public land, next to
BLM, or forest service land,

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:47.103
that's part of a natural fire zone.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:49.730
Nature wants to burn in those areas.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:51.466
These are forest that need to
burn, in some cases, every 20 years

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.326
for the trees to regenerate.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.460
So you suddenly have 20 million
Americans living in this fire zone.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.473
There-- you know, that
land didn't change.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:03.980
We changed.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.713
We moved to the fire zone.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.513
And they often get upset at
the public lands agencies,

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.046
and they don't like some
of the rules and that.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.660
But as soon as a fire breaks out,
they want them there immediately.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.100
They wanted them there to save them.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.633
So it's an ongoing education.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.566
And I've covered a lot
of fires in the west,

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.033
dating to the Yellowstone fire more

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.270
than 20 years ago, and
we've learned a lot.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:25.900
I think people are starting to
realize that if you're going to live

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.613
in that zone, you're gonna have
certain things on your roof,

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.593
you're gonna have a little, you
know, a little protection zone,

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.013
you know, it's different
than the east coast.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.160
It really is.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.360
You are living in a fire
zone, that's what it is.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.893
Anyway, thank you so much.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.226
I appreciate it.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.186
It's a privilege to be here.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
