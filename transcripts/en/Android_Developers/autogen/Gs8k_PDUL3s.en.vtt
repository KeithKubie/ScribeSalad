guessing many of you don't really know

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
guessing many of you don't really know
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.150

much about the show since this is our
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.529
much about the show since this is our
first time and we haven't really talked

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539
first time and we haven't really talked
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.770
first time and we haven't really talked
much about it very briefly I just want

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
much about it very briefly I just want
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.410

Meyer Daniel Pham and Ian Lewis they
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.149
Meyer Daniel Pham and Ian Lewis they
look at apps that are nominated to the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
look at apps that are nominated to the
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.890
look at apps that are nominated to the
team through Google moderator they look

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
team through Google moderator they look
 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.810
team through Google moderator they look
at those apps and they inspect ways in

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
at those apps and they inspect ways in
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.910
at those apps and they inspect ways in
which they can you know improve the apps

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
which they can you know improve the apps
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.219
which they can you know improve the apps
they look at you know what potentially

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
they look at you know what potentially
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.100
they look at you know what potentially
could be fixed what what the apps do

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
could be fixed what what the apps do
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.999
could be fixed what what the apps do
wrong things like that and so this this

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
wrong things like that and so this this
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.330
wrong things like that and so this this

look at the visual and interaction
 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.359
look at the visual and interaction
design aspects of some of these apps and

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
design aspects of some of these apps and
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.719
design aspects of some of these apps and
see how those can be improved so today

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
see how those can be improved so today
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.690
see how those can be improved so today
in this first show we're gonna look at

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
in this first show we're gonna look at
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.840
in this first show we're gonna look at
three apps from the the Friday app

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850

at those specific screens from those
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.109
at those specific screens from those
apps and look at how we can kind of

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
apps and look at how we can kind of
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.940
apps and look at how we can kind of
reimagine or rework them to better

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
reimagine or rework them to better
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.039

follow our guidelines from the Android
 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.800
follow our guidelines from the Android
design site and in general how to just

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
design site and in general how to just
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.070
design site and in general how to just
overall improve the design of the apps

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080
overall improve the design of the apps
 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.170
overall improve the design of the apps
so with that let's get started let's

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
so with that let's get started let's
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.840

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720
the very first step we're switch to the
 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.560
the very first step we're switch to the
demo here and you can see that we're

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570
demo here and you can see that we're
 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.750
demo here and you can see that we're
using a fancy little setup using a drop

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760
using a fancy little setup using a drop
 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.610
using a fancy little setup using a drop

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620
box thanks to the developers of the
 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.040
box thanks to the developers of the
Dropbox app we're gonna look at the very

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050
Dropbox app we're gonna look at the very
 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.690
Dropbox app we're gonna look at the very
first app which is London Underground so

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700
first app which is London Underground so
 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.160
first app which is London Underground so
you know this is actually one of the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170
you know this is actually one of the
 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.170
you know this is actually one of the
screens from the app this is the live

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180
screens from the app this is the live
 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.840
screens from the app this is the live
information screen you get to this get

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850
information screen you get to this get
 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.430
information screen you get to this get
to this screen from the top level one

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440
to this screen from the top level one
 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.530
to this screen from the top level one
there's this little icon it's kind of

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540

things like access to weather if you
 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.910
things like access to weather if you
look down here it gives you access to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920
look down here it gives you access to
 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.340
look down here it gives you access to
weather at the very bottom and then it

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350
weather at the very bottom and then it
 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.630
weather at the very bottom and then it
also tells you like the current

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640
also tells you like the current
 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.550
also tells you like the current
departure boards and then it actually

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560
departure boards and then it actually
 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.050
departure boards and then it actually
even notices in this is something that I

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060
even notices in this is something that I
 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.750

straightforward screen Nick do you have
 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.410
straightforward screen Nick do you have
any initial comments on kind of the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420
any initial comments on kind of the
 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.240
any initial comments on kind of the
screens useless since you are you know

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250
screens useless since you are you know
 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.400

coming from London you have any ideas

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410
coming from London you have any ideas
 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.760
coming from London you have any ideas
yeah yeah you're doing two london-based

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770
yeah yeah you're doing two london-based
 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.120
yeah yeah you're doing two london-based
apps with me here in London I think when

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130
apps with me here in London I think when
 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.470
apps with me here in London I think when
I look at this screen you pulled out the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480
I look at this screen you pulled out the
 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.350
I look at this screen you pulled out the
first thing I think is it's fairly iOS

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360
first thing I think is it's fairly iOS
 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.110
first thing I think is it's fairly iOS
styles that's my gut reaction where you

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120
styles that's my gut reaction where you
 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.460
styles that's my gut reaction where you
have the kind of the rounded white

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470
have the kind of the rounded white
 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.970
have the kind of the rounded white
sections that's the first thing which

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980
sections that's the first thing which
 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.210
sections that's the first thing which
I'm having me reading they have made an

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220
I'm having me reading they have made an
 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.830
I'm having me reading they have made an
attempt to adopt some things like we

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840
attempt to adopt some things like we
 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.270
attempt to adopt some things like we
have an action bar

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280
have an action bar
 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.740
have an action bar
although choosing some some slightly

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750
although choosing some some slightly
 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.270
although choosing some some slightly
non-standard styling within which we'll

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280
non-standard styling within which we'll
 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.430
non-standard styling within which we'll
get into later but yeah the first thing

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440
get into later but yeah the first thing
 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.110
get into later but yeah the first thing
that jumps out to me is is the iOS nice

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120
that jumps out to me is is the iOS nice
 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.880
that jumps out to me is is the iOS nice
yeah absolutely and you could tell just

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890
yeah absolutely and you could tell just
 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.800
yeah absolutely and you could tell just
by you know like you mentioned the the

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810
by you know like you mentioned the the
 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.920
by you know like you mentioned the the
kind of rounded grouped list items and

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930
kind of rounded grouped list items and
 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.770
kind of rounded grouped list items and
in this gray background so yeah that's

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780
in this gray background so yeah that's
 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.450
in this gray background so yeah that's
definitely kind of a styling from a

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460
definitely kind of a styling from a
 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.220
definitely kind of a styling from a
different platform so that's one of the

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230
different platform so that's one of the
 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.960
different platform so that's one of the
third first things you'll notice in the

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970
third first things you'll notice in the
 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.330
third first things you'll notice in the
redesign coming up one of the first

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340
redesign coming up one of the first
 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.040
redesign coming up one of the first
things that we changed the other thing

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050
things that we changed the other thing
 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.950
things that we changed the other thing
the thing that stuck out to me was you

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960
the thing that stuck out to me was you
 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.150
the thing that stuck out to me was you
know

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160
know
 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.670
know
a lot of space dedicated here to showing

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680
a lot of space dedicated here to showing
 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.830
a lot of space dedicated here to showing
all the different lines all the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840
all the different lines all the
 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.390
all the different lines all the
different lines of the London

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400
different lines of the London
 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.980
different lines of the London
Underground for example the Bakerloo the

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990
Underground for example the Bakerloo the
 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.720
Underground for example the Bakerloo the
central the Circle Line and all of them

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730
central the Circle Line and all of them
 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.390
central the Circle Line and all of them
have good service so it seems like it's

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400
have good service so it seems like it's
 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.640
have good service so it seems like it's
just showing a lot of information that's

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650
just showing a lot of information that's
 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.900
just showing a lot of information that's
the same it's not really useful

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910
the same it's not really useful
 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.850
the same it's not really useful
information seeing that everything is

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860
information seeing that everything is
 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.190
information seeing that everything is
good service so if I'm say taking the

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200
good service so if I'm say taking the
 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.560
good service so if I'm say taking the
Waterloo line you'll notice here in the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570
Waterloo line you'll notice here in the
 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.240
Waterloo line you'll notice here in the
second screenshot this is kind of the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250
second screenshot this is kind of the
 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.540
second screenshot this is kind of the
scrolled down version if you scroll down

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550
scrolled down version if you scroll down
 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.700
scrolled down version if you scroll down
then you have to you know find Waterloo

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710
then you have to you know find Waterloo
 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.260
then you have to you know find Waterloo
and then only then see that there's

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270
and then only then see that there's
 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.470
and then only then see that there's
minor delays so that was one thing that

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480
minor delays so that was one thing that
 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.150
minor delays so that was one thing that
struck out to me that to see any actual

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160
struck out to me that to see any actual
 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.610
struck out to me that to see any actual
I guess actionable information about the

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620
I guess actionable information about the
 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.080
I guess actionable information about the
status of certain lines you have to

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090
status of certain lines you have to
 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.730
status of certain lines you have to
scroll and that's that's never a good

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740
scroll and that's that's never a good
 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.090
scroll and that's that's never a good
thing

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100
 
 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.260
 
actually as a Londoner if I'm putting

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270
actually as a Londoner if I'm putting
 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.060
actually as a Londoner if I'm putting
out this app I'm going to the live

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070
out this app I'm going to the live
 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.360
out this app I'm going to the live
information it's probably because I you

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370
information it's probably because I you
 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.740
information it's probably because I you
know I'm heading towards a specific line

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750
know I'm heading towards a specific line
 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.910
know I'm heading towards a specific line
and I want to know if there's anything

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920
and I want to know if there's anything
 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.280
and I want to know if there's anything
going on so I want that information in

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290
going on so I want that information in
 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.680
going on so I want that information in
like first but first and foremost right

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690
like first but first and foremost right
 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.410
like first but first and foremost right
at the top yeah okay so let's let's talk

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420
at the top yeah okay so let's let's talk
 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.730
at the top yeah okay so let's let's talk
a little bit about some of the other

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740
a little bit about some of the other
 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.740
a little bit about some of the other
interactional elements so the first

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750
interactional elements so the first
 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.060
interactional elements so the first
thing you well one of the first things I

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070
thing you well one of the first things I
 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.850
thing you well one of the first things I
the other one of the second things I

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860
the other one of the second things I
 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.010
the other one of the second things I
guess I noticed was that there's no up

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020
guess I noticed was that there's no up
 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.110
guess I noticed was that there's no up
button right so this is a subsequent

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120
button right so this is a subsequent
 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.460
button right so this is a subsequent
screen so there should be some way of

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470
screen so there should be some way of
 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.440
screen so there should be some way of
getting up in the hierarchy of the act

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450
getting up in the hierarchy of the act
 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.750
getting up in the hierarchy of the act
there's there's an icon here but there's

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760
there's there's an icon here but there's
 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.620
there's there's an icon here but there's
no up caret indicating you can go up the

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630
no up caret indicating you can go up the
 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.510
no up caret indicating you can go up the
other thing is that the action bar has a

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520
other thing is that the action bar has a
 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.640
other thing is that the action bar has a
bold title and while that's you know

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650
bold title and while that's you know
 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.710
bold title and while that's you know
sometimes okay well that's often okay

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720
sometimes okay well that's often okay
 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.780
sometimes okay well that's often okay
it's a little non-standard so it kind of

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790
it's a little non-standard so it kind of
 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.000
it's a little non-standard so it kind of
takes takes away some of the visual

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010
takes takes away some of the visual
 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.690
takes takes away some of the visual
attention from the content of the screen

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700
attention from the content of the screen
 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.060
attention from the content of the screen
and also this is kind of curious there's

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070
and also this is kind of curious there's
 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.370
and also this is kind of curious there's
an update button somewhere in the middle

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380
an update button somewhere in the middle
 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.070
an update button somewhere in the middle
here and really that's probably

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080
here and really that's probably
 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.600
here and really that's probably
something that should be kind of like a

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610
something that should be kind of like a
 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.430
something that should be kind of like a
refresh action potentially in the action

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440
refresh action potentially in the action
 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.370
refresh action potentially in the action
bar so with that one yet on the action

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380
bar so with that one yet on the action
 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.140
bar so with that one yet on the action
bar icon like didn't we come across in

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150
bar icon like didn't we come across in
 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.580
bar icon like didn't we come across in
screenshot but the highlight is

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590
screenshot but the highlight is
 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.200
screenshot but the highlight is
non-standard as well so when you touch

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210
non-standard as well so when you touch
 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.680
non-standard as well so when you touch
the icon the highlight behind it is kind

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690
the icon the highlight behind it is kind
 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.380
the icon the highlight behind it is kind
of tall and narrow like there's a very

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390
of tall and narrow like there's a very
 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.080
of tall and narrow like there's a very
there's a very standard max limit

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090
there's a very standard max limit
 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.050
there's a very standard max limit
there's a very standard kind of size and

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060
there's a very standard kind of size and
 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.670
there's a very standard kind of size and
shape that you would expect with these

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680
shape that you would expect with these
 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.959
shape that you would expect with these
controls and that's probably important

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969
controls and that's probably important
 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:41.789
controls and that's probably important
the importance of the actionbar that is

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:41.799
the importance of the actionbar that is
 

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:43.649
the importance of the actionbar that is
very familiar to the users so every time

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:43.659
very familiar to the users so every time
 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:45.569
very familiar to the users so every time
you kind of deviate from from that

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:45.579
you kind of deviate from from that
 

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:47.639
you kind of deviate from from that
standard kind of size and shape then all

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:47.649
standard kind of size and shape then all
 

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:48.989
standard kind of size and shape then all
of a sudden it's introducing like a

00:06:48.989 --> 00:06:48.999
of a sudden it's introducing like a
 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:50.369
of a sudden it's introducing like a
common typical kind of speed bump

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:50.379
common typical kind of speed bump
 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:51.899
common typical kind of speed bump
do we users where something just feels

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:51.909
do we users where something just feels
 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:53.819
do we users where something just feels
slightly off yeah I'd say it sounds

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:53.829
slightly off yeah I'd say it sounds
 

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:55.139
slightly off yeah I'd say it sounds
maybe but that can give really

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:55.149
maybe but that can give really
 

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:56.789
maybe but that can give really
contributes to making your app feel very

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:56.799
contributes to making your app feel very
 

00:06:56.799 --> 00:07:01.139
contributes to making your app feel very
easy to you yeah the last thing I want

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:01.149
easy to you yeah the last thing I want
 

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:02.279
easy to you yeah the last thing I want
to point out before we jump into the

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:02.289
to point out before we jump into the
 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.829
to point out before we jump into the
redesign version is the send us feedback

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:04.839

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.409
link generally for things that are
secondary things like you know settings

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:10.419
secondary things like you know settings

or send feedback or logout or things
like that we generally try to put that

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699
like that we generally try to put that
 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:17.249
like that we generally try to put that
into the action overflow since that's

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:17.259
into the action overflow since that's
 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:19.159
into the action overflow since that's
really what it's for it's for

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:19.169
really what it's for it's for
 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:21.929

Corrections that you know users wouldn't

00:07:21.929 --> 00:07:21.939
Corrections that you know users wouldn't
 

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:24.329
Corrections that you know users wouldn't
really use in a regular basis you know

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:24.339
really use in a regular basis you know
 

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:27.149
really use in a regular basis you know
so you know if 10% of the time even 1%

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:27.159
so you know if 10% of the time even 1%
 

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:28.529
so you know if 10% of the time even 1%
of the time they're gonna be using send

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:28.539
of the time they're gonna be using send
 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:30.929
of the time they're gonna be using send
us feedback you may want to just go put

00:07:30.929 --> 00:07:30.939
us feedback you may want to just go put
 

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:32.729
us feedback you may want to just go put
it in the action overflow so moving on

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:32.739
it in the action overflow so moving on
 

00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:34.559
it in the action overflow so moving on
we're gonna we're running a little short

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:34.569
we're gonna we're running a little short
 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:37.139
we're gonna we're running a little short
in time I guess for this part let's jump

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:37.149
in time I guess for this part let's jump
 

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:40.649
in time I guess for this part let's jump
into the redesign so this is a

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:40.659
into the redesign so this is a
 

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:44.009
into the redesign so this is a
reimagining of this screen and I'm going

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:44.019
reimagining of this screen and I'm going
 

00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:45.989
reimagining of this screen and I'm going
to quickly zoom in here and so you'll

00:07:45.989 --> 00:07:45.999
to quickly zoom in here and so you'll
 

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:47.749
to quickly zoom in here and so you'll
notice that we've changed some of the

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759
notice that we've changed some of the
 

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.269
notice that we've changed some of the
some of the colors one of the things

00:07:51.269 --> 00:07:51.279
some of the colors one of the things
 

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:53.339
some of the colors one of the things
that we started with was the the dark

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:53.349
that we started with was the the dark
 

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:55.499
that we started with was the the dark
action bar theme and this isn't kind of

00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:55.509
action bar theme and this isn't kind of
 

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:56.790
action bar theme and this isn't kind of
you know something that you should do

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800
you know something that you should do
 

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.339
you know something that you should do
for any app but it kind of conveys a

00:07:59.339 --> 00:07:59.349
for any app but it kind of conveys a
 

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:01.919
for any app but it kind of conveys a
pretty nice contrast between actions and

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:01.929
pretty nice contrast between actions and
 

00:08:01.929 --> 00:08:06.209
pretty nice contrast between actions and
screen content also we put weather as a

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:06.219
screen content also we put weather as a
 

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:09.469
screen content also we put weather as a
second tab that you can swipe over to

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479
second tab that you can swipe over to
 

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:11.669
second tab that you can swipe over to
since weather is you know potentially

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:11.679
since weather is you know potentially
 

00:08:11.679 --> 00:08:14.850
since weather is you know potentially
something that that is fairly important

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:14.860
something that that is fairly important
 

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.469
something that that is fairly important
this isn't kind of necessary but you

00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479
this isn't kind of necessary but you
 

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:20.249
this isn't kind of necessary but you
know it is it is a nice touch the other

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:20.259
know it is it is a nice touch the other
 

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:21.629
know it is it is a nice touch the other
thing that you'll notice here is that we

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:21.639
thing that you'll notice here is that we
 

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:25.439
thing that you'll notice here is that we
we took that list of all the different

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:25.449
we took that list of all the different
 

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:27.209
we took that list of all the different
lines the circle line the Bakerloo line

00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:27.219
lines the circle line the Bakerloo line
 

00:08:27.219 --> 00:08:29.189
lines the circle line the Bakerloo line
the district line we collapsed that only

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199
the district line we collapsed that only
 

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.809
the district line we collapsed that only
into what the user wants to see which is

00:08:30.809 --> 00:08:30.819
into what the user wants to see which is
 

00:08:30.819 --> 00:08:33.029
into what the user wants to see which is
exceptions right exceptions to the

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039
exceptions right exceptions to the
 

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.699
exceptions right exceptions to the
almost always well running lemon on the

00:08:35.699 --> 00:08:35.709
almost always well running lemon on the
 

00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:37.199
almost always well running lemon on the
ground so in this case you'll notice

00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:37.209
ground so in this case you'll notice
 

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:40.769
ground so in this case you'll notice
that is that true Nick is the under gun

00:08:40.769 --> 00:08:40.779
that is that true Nick is the under gun
 

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:44.189
that is that true Nick is the under gun
actually done pretty well yeah awesome

00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:44.199
actually done pretty well yeah awesome
 

00:08:44.199 --> 00:08:46.319
actually done pretty well yeah awesome
so right now I'm guessing that we would

00:08:46.319 --> 00:08:46.329
so right now I'm guessing that we would
 

00:08:46.329 --> 00:08:49.879
so right now I'm guessing that we would
see no exceptions in the South but so

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:49.889
see no exceptions in the South but so
 

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:52.169
see no exceptions in the South but so
you see that you know the circle line is

00:08:52.169 --> 00:08:52.179
you see that you know the circle line is
 

00:08:52.179 --> 00:08:54.220
you see that you know the circle line is
closed and this is just you know

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.230
closed and this is just you know
 

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.259
closed and this is just you know
an imaginary situation the circle line

00:08:56.259 --> 00:08:56.269
an imaginary situation the circle line
 

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:57.550
an imaginary situation the circle line
is closed there's a little bit of

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560
is closed there's a little bit of
 

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.410
is closed there's a little bit of
iconography to indicate that on top of

00:08:59.410 --> 00:08:59.420
iconography to indicate that on top of
 

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.490
iconography to indicate that on top of
the yellow color for the circle line and

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:03.500
the yellow color for the circle line and
 

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.259
the yellow color for the circle line and
then minor delays and the Waterloo line

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:05.269
then minor delays and the Waterloo line
 

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:09.160
then minor delays and the Waterloo line
you see that below and you'll see that

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:09.170
you see that below and you'll see that
 

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:10.900
you see that below and you'll see that
we actually use holo styling throughout

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:10.910
we actually use holo styling throughout
 

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.910
we actually use holo styling throughout
we use these kind of standard list

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:12.920
we use these kind of standard list
 

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.210
we use these kind of standard list
headings that have this kind of all caps

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:16.220
headings that have this kind of all caps
 

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:22.740
headings that have this kind of all caps
12 SP text and then below those two

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:22.750
12 SP text and then below those two
 

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.389
12 SP text and then below those two
exceptions we actually just say as a as

00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399
exceptions we actually just say as a as
 

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:28.540
exceptions we actually just say as a as
kind of an additional confirmation to

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:28.550
kind of an additional confirmation to
 

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.189
kind of an additional confirmation to
the user that all the other lines have

00:09:30.189 --> 00:09:30.199
the user that all the other lines have
 

00:09:30.199 --> 00:09:31.689
the user that all the other lines have
good service on them

app is M parking and so this basically I
 

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.590
app is M parking and so this basically I
don't really know how to use this app

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600
don't really know how to use this app
 

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.180
don't really know how to use this app

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:49.690
with it with appropriate SMS now let's
 

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.880
with it with appropriate SMS now let's
attach them and then you just hit a

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:50.890
attach them and then you just hit a
 

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.210
attach them and then you just hit a
button and it sends this its message

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.220
button and it sends this its message
 

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.670
button and it sends this its message
interesting so and you try this out at

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:56.680
interesting so and you try this out at
 

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.020
interesting so and you try this out at
what point that it actually send the SMS

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.030
what point that it actually send the SMS
 

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:03.420
what point that it actually send the SMS
was it outside of the screen so the

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:03.430
was it outside of the screen so the
 

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:04.620
was it outside of the screen so the
screen we're looking at now is one of

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:04.630
screen we're looking at now is one of
 

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.910
screen we're looking at now is one of
the cert ones this is where you actually

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920
the cert ones this is where you actually
 

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.040
the cert ones this is where you actually
configure a parking zone what are you

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:08.050
configure a parking zone what are you

to and how on that kind of covers you
 

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.980
to and how on that kind of covers you
for so once you've configured this then

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:13.990
for so once you've configured this then
 

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.280
for so once you've configured this then
on

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:14.290
on
 

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.740
on
on the very like homescreen it'll show

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:16.750
on the very like homescreen it'll show
 

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.620
on the very like homescreen it'll show
all the zones you've configured and the

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:18.630
all the zones you've configured and the

first we see when you open the app is

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.050
first we see when you open the app is
 

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.960
first we see when you open the app is
just hit that one of the zones you've

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:24.970
just hit that one of the zones you've
 

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.009
just hit that one of the zones you've
saved and it will send the message and

00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:28.019
saved and it will send the message and

basically give you parking access so

00:13:30.749 --> 00:13:30.759
basically give you parking access so
 

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:32.069
basically give you parking access so
this is one of the kind of setup screens

00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079
this is one of the kind of setup screens
 

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:33.300
this is one of the kind of setup screens
you would go through in configuration

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:33.310
you would go through in configuration
 

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.699
you would go through in configuration
you have to do this step so basically

00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:35.709
you have to do this step so basically
 

00:13:35.709 --> 00:13:36.960
you have to do this step so basically
you wouldn't use this on an everyday

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:36.970
you wouldn't use this on an everyday
 

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.329
you wouldn't use this on an everyday
basis right so things like speed and

00:13:39.329 --> 00:13:39.339
basis right so things like speed and
 

00:13:39.339 --> 00:13:41.430
basis right so things like speed and
like you know in general if you're using

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440
like you know in general if you're using
 

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.470
like you know in general if you're using
something on an everyday basis you want

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480
something on an everyday basis you want
 

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.819
something on an everyday basis you want
to minimize the number of inputs right

00:13:44.819 --> 00:13:44.829
to minimize the number of inputs right
 

00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:46.439
to minimize the number of inputs right
you want to make it quick and easy for

00:13:46.439 --> 00:13:46.449
you want to make it quick and easy for
 

00:13:46.449 --> 00:13:48.269
you want to make it quick and easy for
the user to just you know fly through

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279
the user to just you know fly through
 

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:50.009
the user to just you know fly through
and obviously not make mistakes but this

00:13:50.009 --> 00:13:50.019
and obviously not make mistakes but this
 

00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:52.639
and obviously not make mistakes but this
is kind of an auxilary screenwriting

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:52.649
is kind of an auxilary screenwriting
 

00:13:52.649 --> 00:13:55.620
is kind of an auxilary screenwriting
yeah I can imagine you probably install

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:55.630
yeah I can imagine you probably install
 

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.210
yeah I can imagine you probably install
this app and configure three or four

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:57.220
this app and configure three or four
 

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.740
this app and configure three or four
parking zones which you commonly click

00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:58.750
parking zones which you commonly click
 

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.519
parking zones which you commonly click
plan yeah okay so let's talk about what

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:02.529
plan yeah okay so let's talk about what
 

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:05.430
plan yeah okay so let's talk about what

reverting that's a whole issue in itself
 

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.730

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:26.019
but that's just kind of one of the first
 

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:27.199

so the problem there is that they're not
 

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:40.400
so the problem there is that they're not
really aligned with the content itself

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:40.410
really aligned with the content itself
 

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.720

out that this color chooser seems a

00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519
out that this color chooser seems a
 

00:15:56.519 --> 00:15:59.809

tell this from the screenshot but the

00:16:01.489 --> 00:16:01.499
tell this from the screenshot but the
 

00:16:01.499 --> 00:16:03.199
tell this from the screenshot but the
background color is the currently

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:03.209
background color is the currently
 

00:16:03.209 --> 00:16:06.379
background color is the currently
selected color so if I touch yellow here

00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:06.389
selected color so if I touch yellow here
 

00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:07.639

it would actually change the background
 

00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:09.439
it would actually change the background
color of that to yellow so that's it's

00:16:09.439 --> 00:16:09.449
color of that to yellow so that's it's
 

00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:11.389
color of that to yellow so that's it's
not a very common way of indicating

in Berlin the other thing you'll notice
 

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.200
in Berlin the other thing you'll notice
is that we we realigned all of the

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:06.210
is that we we realigned all of the
 

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.970
is that we we realigned all of the
labels and actually we remove the name

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980
labels and actually we remove the name
 

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.080
labels and actually we remove the name
label because it's almost

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.090
label because it's almost
 

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.460

self-explanatory that you're currently
editing this specific zone but we took

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:15.780
editing this specific zone but we took
 

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.960
editing this specific zone but we took
all the other labels like SMS number and

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:17.970
all the other labels like SMS number and
 

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.480
all the other labels like SMS number and
period suffix and we aligned them with

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:20.490
period suffix and we aligned them with
 

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.710
period suffix and we aligned them with
the content and this is something that

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720
the content and this is something that
 

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.480
the content and this is something that
is a little tricky to do the framework

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:23.490
is a little tricky to do the framework
 

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.280
is a little tricky to do the framework
currently but it's something that you

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:25.290
currently but it's something that you
 

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.650
currently but it's something that you
can actually do correctly with a couple

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:27.660
can actually do correctly with a couple
 

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.680
can actually do correctly with a couple
of tweaks here padding the other thing

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:30.690
of tweaks here padding the other thing
 

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.620
of tweaks here padding the other thing
is that we dropped period suffix so if

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:33.630
is that we dropped period suffix so if
 

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.180
is that we dropped period suffix so if
you notice here period suffix was to the

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:35.190
you notice here period suffix was to the
 

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.220
you notice here period suffix was to the
right of SMS number and that conveyed to

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:37.230
right of SMS number and that conveyed to
 

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.610
right of SMS number and that conveyed to
me at least it conveyed a sense of

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:39.620
me at least it conveyed a sense of
 

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.560
me at least it conveyed a sense of
sequence so that like the period suffix

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:42.570
sequence so that like the period suffix
 

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.160
sequence so that like the period suffix
is almost the suffix to the SMS number

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:45.170
is almost the suffix to the SMS number
 

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.420
is almost the suffix to the SMS number
and again speaking this is coming from

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:47.430
and again speaking this is coming from
 

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.740

after SMS number so you move that down

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320
after SMS number so you move that down
 

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.520
after SMS number so you move that down
to the bottom and then lastly we we made

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:01.530
to the bottom and then lastly we we made
 

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.700

kind of input screen as well is is using
 

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.049
kind of input screen as well is is using
the appropriate input types so this is a

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:17.059
the appropriate input types so this is a
 

00:20:17.059 --> 00:20:19.880

necessarily fixed but improve so one of
 

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.510
necessarily fixed but improve so one of
the one of the first things that I

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520
the one of the first things that I
 

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.990
the one of the first things that I
noticed was that this map drop-down this

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000
noticed was that this map drop-down this
 

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.580
noticed was that this map drop-down this
is the zooming is kind of wonky right

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:33.590
is the zooming is kind of wonky right
 

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.029
is the zooming is kind of wonky right
now

00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039
now
 

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:37.149
now
this map drop-down this spinner is kind

00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159
this map drop-down this spinner is kind
 

00:23:37.159 --> 00:23:39.580
this map drop-down this spinner is kind
of off in its own place somewhere in the

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:39.590
of off in its own place somewhere in the
 

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.620
of off in its own place somewhere in the
middle of the action bar I don't know if

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:41.630
middle of the action bar I don't know if
 

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:42.970
middle of the action bar I don't know if
that's intentional or just because the

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:42.980
that's intentional or just because the
 

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.390
that's intentional or just because the
logo is really wide but that's kind of

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400
logo is really wide but that's kind of
 

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.899
logo is really wide but that's kind of
like a weird place for it also the the

00:23:49.899 --> 00:23:49.909
like a weird place for it also the the
 

00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:52.240
like a weird place for it also the the
logo here the the placement of the logo

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:52.250
logo here the the placement of the logo
 

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.420
logo here the the placement of the logo
in the action bar and the

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:54.430
in the action bar and the
 

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.540
in the action bar and the
the blue I guess hollow dark border at

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:57.550
the blue I guess hollow dark border at
 

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.760
the blue I guess hollow dark border at
the bottom of the action bar just seems

00:23:59.760 --> 00:23:59.770
the bottom of the action bar just seems
 

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.710
the bottom of the action bar just seems
kind of out of place especially in it's

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720
kind of out of place especially in it's
 

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.340
kind of out of place especially in it's
such a visually rich app like this the

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:05.350
such a visually rich app like this the
 

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.220
such a visually rich app like this the
other thing I'll note is that these

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:07.230
other thing I'll note is that these
 

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:10.470
other thing I'll note is that these
these buttons here kind of have styling

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480
these buttons here kind of have styling
 

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.320
these buttons here kind of have styling
from a different platform and you can't

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:13.330
from a different platform and you can't
 

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.480
from a different platform and you can't
see this in the screenshot but touching

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:15.490
see this in the screenshot but touching
 

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.190
see this in the screenshot but touching
on the bubble doesn't actually do

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200
on the bubble doesn't actually do
 

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.280
on the bubble doesn't actually do
anything to get into the in or to see

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:20.290
anything to get into the in or to see
 

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.710
anything to get into the in or to see
the details for that stop you have to

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720
the details for that stop you have to
 

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.350
the details for that stop you have to
touch on the this blue button here and

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360
touch on the this blue button here and
 

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.390
touch on the this blue button here and
then this is basically a shortcut to see

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:27.400
then this is basically a shortcut to see
 

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:33.030
then this is basically a shortcut to see
the bus route map for that stuff the bus

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:33.040
the bus route map for that stuff the bus
 

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.500
the bus route map for that stuff the bus
the bus route is actually one of the

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:34.510
the bus route is actually one of the
 

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.090
the bus route is actually one of the
most useful functions of this

we changed this this bubble this pop up

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880
we changed this this bubble this pop up
 

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.690
we changed this this bubble this pop up
bubble so that it uses a styling very

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:37.700
bubble so that it uses a styling very
 

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.409
bubble so that it uses a styling very
similar to the Maps app and touching on

00:28:41.409 --> 00:28:41.419
similar to the Maps app and touching on

the entire bubble will take you to the
details as opposed to having this kind

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600
details as opposed to having this kind
 

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.799
details as opposed to having this kind
of separate icon here and then there's

00:28:47.799 --> 00:28:47.809
of separate icon here and then there's
 

00:28:47.809 --> 00:28:49.930
of separate icon here and then there's
this additional action button that takes

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:49.940
this additional action button that takes
 

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.419
this additional action button that takes
you to you know takes you to the route

00:28:52.419 --> 00:28:52.429
you to you know takes you to the route
 

00:28:52.429 --> 00:28:56.890
you to you know takes you to the route
map so that's that's a very high level

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:56.900
map so that's that's a very high level
 

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:01.539
map so that's that's a very high level
the redesign Nick any any thoughts yeah

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:01.549
the redesign Nick any any thoughts yeah
 

00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:03.669
the redesign Nick any any thoughts yeah
one of my favorite changes here is the

00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679
one of my favorite changes here is the
 

00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:05.440
one of my favorite changes here is the
use of the overlay action bar as well I

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:05.450
use of the overlay action bar as well I
 

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.870
use of the overlay action bar as well I
mean I think that really with the map

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:07.880
mean I think that really with the map
 

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.460
mean I think that really with the map
application especially really really

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:09.470
application especially really really
 

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:11.049
application especially really really
stands out that you get to see this kind

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:11.059
stands out that you get to see this kind
 

00:29:11.059 --> 00:29:12.850
stands out that you get to see this kind
of like whole logic canvas across the

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:12.860
of like whole logic canvas across the
 

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.010
of like whole logic canvas across the
way I think that works pretty well here

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:15.020
way I think that works pretty well here
 

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.750
way I think that works pretty well here
as well yeah and Adam pointed this out

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760
as well yeah and Adam pointed this out
 

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.340
as well yeah and Adam pointed this out
as well so you can see here what we did

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:18.350
as well so you can see here what we did
 

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.159
as well so you can see here what we did
here was we used not a black action bar

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:21.169
here was we used not a black action bar
 

00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:23.140
here was we used not a black action bar
but it's I think it's like one one one

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:23.150
but it's I think it's like one one one
 

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.650
but it's I think it's like one one one
or two to two hex color with opacity so

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:26.660
or two to two hex color with opacity so
 

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.960
or two to two hex color with opacity so
even setting the opacity to like 90

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:28.970
even setting the opacity to like 90
 

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:30.850
even setting the opacity to like 90
percent and using it like Nick mentioned

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:30.860
percent and using it like Nick mentioned
 

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.039
percent and using it like Nick mentioned
in overlay mode gives the feeling that

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:33.049
in overlay mode gives the feeling that
 

00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:35.110
in overlay mode gives the feeling that
the entire screen is really your canvas

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120
the entire screen is really your canvas
 

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.909
the entire screen is really your canvas
the map moves across the entire screen

00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919
the map moves across the entire screen
 

00:29:36.919 --> 00:29:39.100
the map moves across the entire screen
so that definitely helps convey a sense

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:39.110
so that definitely helps convey a sense
 

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.310
so that definitely helps convey a sense
of a sense of you know content is in

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320
of a sense of you know content is in
 

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.169
of a sense of you know content is in

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.280
basically okay so it's 11 o'clock I

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:51.290
think that that's it for this week but
 

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:54.730
think that that's it for this week but
before we cut off any parting thoughts

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:54.740
before we cut off any parting thoughts
 

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.080
before we cut off any parting thoughts
from Nick first and I'll go after no

00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.090
from Nick first and I'll go after no
 

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.840
from Nick first and I'll go after no

a really good way to demonstrate a
 

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:07.690
a really good way to demonstrate a
before and after a good way to

before and after a good way to
 

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.419
before and after a good way to
demonstrate the strengths of designing

00:30:10.419 --> 00:30:10.429
demonstrate the strengths of designing
 

00:30:10.429 --> 00:30:11.860
