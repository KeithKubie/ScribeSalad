00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:03.180
(rock music)

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.064
- Welcome to the Jeselnik
and Rosenthal Vanity Project.

00:00:06.064 --> 00:00:07.080
- JRVP

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.410
- [Woman] Junior Vice President.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.500
- Two and a half years
later true love rises again.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.380
- You think you watched
football last weekend?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.860
Then you're a damn fool,
you watched nothing.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.080
The season stars now.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.191
- Right where we're
taping this in Hollywood,

00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:24.060
Bernstein High, the Los Angeles Times

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.520
reporting that allegations
that two students

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.150
at the high school spiked
their high school team's water

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.860
at a junior varsity football practice

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.801
with a male enhancement drug
has prompted an investigation

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:42.801
that led to the dismissal of
varsity coach Luis Barajas.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.230
- Now Greg, when they
say male enhancement,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.150
I know you've got a little bit

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.750
of everything back at your home,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.280
do you know which one it was
and what are the effects?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.930
- They didn't specify, I mean,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.130
I would assume it was a
Viagra or Cialis like product.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.330
They did not even find evidence

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.610
that the students actually
drank the contaminated water.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.430
They spoke to some doctors

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.183
who said they would really
need to know how much you drank

00:01:09.183 --> 00:01:11.470
of this male enhancement product

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.610
to know what the effects could
be on a high school student

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.300
but I think we could all imagine.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.670
- Here's what I'll say, okay,

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.280
and this should be common sense.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.535
First of all, this was junior varsity team

00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:25.470
and in the JV anything goes.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.670
Secondly, how do you know if a bunch of

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.350
13 and 14 year olds have taken Viagra?

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.680
That's like a placebo
for a 14 year old boy.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.336
We're talking Flintstone
vitamin level uselessness

00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:38.010
to a 14 year old boy,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.670
and they put it in the
water during practice.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.640
Listen, if you love the game

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.490
the way my father loved the game

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.850
and my grandfather loved the game

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.010
then you practice with a full erection

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.340
or you sit in the sidelines flaccid.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.220
Because you must be injured

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.880
if you're not running sprints in full pads

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.830
with all the blood in your penis.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.230
God damn, PC culture is ruining the game.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.010
- I don't even get to
follow up on the fact

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.560
that you're dad and grandfather

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.900
used to play football
with a full on erection.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.980
- They played against each other

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.490
so we heard all the stories.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.323
I don't know how it worked
out, but yeah, full blown.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.930
Like, they started to wear cups

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.370
just so you wouldn't be able to find out

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.340
if they had the erection or not.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.690
So then you could like, I'm
okay to go in the game coach

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.297
kinda thing, you know, like--

00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:23.790
- What were Thanksgivings like

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.800
in the backyard of the Jeselnik household?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.260
- I mean, it was fun,
we didn't play football.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.570
We just kind of just sat around

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.830
and kind of like threw the football around

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.599
with erections.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.016
