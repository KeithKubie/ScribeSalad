Hi, I'm Mano Marks,

00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:05.167
and it's my pleasure today
to introduce

00:00:05.167 --> 00:00:06.367
Bjorn Sandvik.

00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:08.033
He is a project manager

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:10.501
at the United Nations
Association of Norway.

00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:13.100
He's got
a Masters in Science

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.834
in Geographic
Information Systems

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:17.400
from the University
of Edinburgh,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.934
and he's a web developer
and author

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:22.133
of the Thematic Mapping blog.

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.968
And he is here today
to talk about

00:00:23.968 --> 00:00:26.434
using KML for
thematic mapping

00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:27.968
and explain
how KML documents

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:29.267
can be generated on the fly

00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:32.634
using the now open source
thematic mapping engine.

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:39.334
Sandvik:
Thank you.

00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:41.200
First of all,
I want to thank

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.968
Mano and Michael
for inviting me

00:00:42.968 --> 00:00:44.267
all the way from Norway.

00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:45.434
It's nice to be here.

00:00:45.434 --> 00:00:47.701
I'd guess it's
20 degrees warmer

00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:50.234
than in Oslo
before I left.

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:53.601
Um...I'm going
to give this presentation

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:57.367
and I will focus on how

00:00:57.367 --> 00:01:00.300
KML can be used
for thematic mapping.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.901
And, um, so I will show you
different techniques

00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:08.100
of how you can use
the thematic mapping techniques

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.367
in KML,

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:11.534
and I will also show
how you can use

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:12.868
the thematic mapping
engine--

00:01:12.868 --> 00:01:16.100
which, as you said,
which is now open source--

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.200
to generate these
on the fly in a web browser.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.868
And I also want to talk

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:25.334
about some
Google Earth issues,

00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:27.267
some improvements
I would like to suggest

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:30.634
so it could be more easy
to use for thematic mapping.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:36.133
Um, I will start with

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.133
a common
thematic mapping technique

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.334
called
"proportional symbols."

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.968
And I will identify
three different ways

00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:48.634
of making these symbols
in KML.

00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:52.033
And the first one is
to use the image icons,

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:53.767
to scale them,

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:56.968
and, um, this technique
is my favorite.

00:01:56.968 --> 00:01:58.601
And I think it's
the most useful

00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:03.400
way of making
proportional symbols in KML.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.601
Uh, this one just shows
with the default push pins.

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:10.767
And here they are scaled
so they are proportional

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:14.234
to the population
in each country.

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:17.567
Uh, the background here
is the NASA City Lights,

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:20.100
and, um, this
is one thing I like

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.000
with using your browser
for thematic mapping--

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.400
is that you are
able to combine

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.167
raster data and
vector data very easily.

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:30.501
Um, yes.

00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:33.100
So what you can do
is that you can,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.801
just, uh, reference
another image,

00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:40.601
uh, and then scale them
according to a numerical

00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:45.167
or a statistical value.

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:47.367
So basically,
this can be any image.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.634
So you can have
geometric images

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:51.968
or they can be
pictographic.

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:59.801
Uh, KML also has
the possibility

00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:03.634
to colorize
the image icons.

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.734
And that is also very good
for thematic mapping.

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:08.934
So here that it--
you could represent

00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:10.734
two different variables.

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:12.767
But here this--
the same variables

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:17.267
are represented by
both color and scale.

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:18.934
So what--basically
what I've done is just

00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:22.367
make a white circle
on the transparent background,

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:25.801
and then they are
scaled and colorized

00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:27.467
in KML directly.

00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:37.200
So this is just a short
KML of--how it's done.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.734
So the symbol is--
sorry--

00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:43.033
referenced
in a shared style,

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:46.000
and then they are
colorized and scaled

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.400
for each place mark
or each country.

00:03:52.234 --> 00:03:57.000
There is one problem
with this in Google Earth,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.367
and that is the--
it's a problem of--

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:02.968
that the size
is affected by viewports.

00:04:02.968 --> 00:04:04.234
And that is--
the reason is that

00:04:04.234 --> 00:04:07.033
there are two different ways
of changing the size

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:08.100
of the Earth.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.801
You can either
zoom in and out

00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:13.667
or you can actually change
the size of the window.

00:04:13.667 --> 00:04:15.567
And I can
give an example.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.133
So if I'm zooming
in and out,

00:04:29.133 --> 00:04:34.334
you will see the--
the size is adjusting.

00:04:34.334 --> 00:04:38.467
But if I'm changing
the size of the window,

00:04:38.467 --> 00:04:40.667
you will see
they maintain their size--

00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:43.033
all the icons.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:45.167
And I'm not sure if
there is a special reason

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:47.267
for this behavior
or if it's, uh,

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:48.334
like a bug.

00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:49.801
But the--
this is a problem,

00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:52.167
especially with the new
Google Earth plug-in,

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.501
because very often
you won't use the whole screen

00:04:54.501 --> 00:04:56.033
to show the maps,

00:04:56.033 --> 00:04:59.067
and you will just use like a--
in the frame or something.

00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:00.534
And then,
you can't really--

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:03.934
you don't really know
how big the icons will show

00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:05.200
up on the screen.

00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:11.934
Uh, another problem
is with Google Maps.

00:05:11.934 --> 00:05:13.300
If you want to use
these techniques

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.501
to visualize the KML
in Google Maps,

00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:18.567
uh, Google Maps only--

00:05:18.567 --> 00:05:21.400
it has--it has a fixed size
for all the icons.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.734
So they won't be scaled.

00:05:23.734 --> 00:05:26.534
And you are not able
to colorize them either.

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.567
So basically,
this technique only works

00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:33.434
so far in--
in Google Earth.

00:05:33.434 --> 00:05:35.767
The other technique
is to actually

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:37.400
draw the polygons

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.868
using the KML
polygon elements.

00:05:42.868 --> 00:05:45.133
So basically,
what I'm doing here is

00:05:45.133 --> 00:05:48.100
to calculate the latitude
and longitude points

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.467
that makes up
a circle.

00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:51.868
And this is done
through a function.

00:05:51.868 --> 00:05:54.567
So by changing
the number of points,

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:55.868
as you can see here
in the bottom,

00:05:55.868 --> 00:05:59.801
you can obviously change the--
the shape of the symbol.

00:05:59.801 --> 00:06:01.968
So this sort of works.
There is a problem.

00:06:01.968 --> 00:06:04.801
What I like with the other
image icons technique

00:06:04.801 --> 00:06:07.968
is that the icons are always
facing the user.

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:10.534
But here they are more
like lying on the ground,

00:06:10.534 --> 00:06:12.400
and especially
in the 3-D interface.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.200
It's really hard
for the user

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.968
to compare
different countries

00:06:15.968 --> 00:06:19.167
when they are seen
in perspective.

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:22.434
Um, and it's--
another thing is

00:06:22.434 --> 00:06:23.834
that it's--
I think it's probably

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:25.667
the most com--
most complicated way

00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:28.501
of drawing a circle

00:06:28.501 --> 00:06:29.801
is this function,

00:06:29.801 --> 00:06:32.400
because basically,
for every single circle,

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.000
you have to calculate
all the latitude

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.767
and longitude points
to make up the circle.

00:06:36.767 --> 00:06:38.968
So one improvement
to KML code, for example,

00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:42.100
this could be done with
one line of SVG, for example--

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.000
could be to add support
for this directly in KML.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.367
Uh, the good thing
of this technique is that

00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:51.033
this one, even though it's
not so good in Google Earth,

00:06:51.033 --> 00:06:53.968
it works very well
on Google Maps.

00:06:53.968 --> 00:06:58.400
So the squares here,
they show up as true squares,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.834
while in--on Google Earth
they will kind of get skewed

00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:05.300
because
of that perspective.

00:07:08.467 --> 00:07:10.701
Uh, the third technique
that we're looking at

00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:14.400
is to use the Collada
objects or models

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.901
to make
proportional symbols.

00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:17.801
These are normally
used, like, for the cities

00:07:17.801 --> 00:07:20.033
and buildings,
but since you have possible--

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:22.968
you have the possibility
to scalethese models,

00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:26.868
you can also use them
for thematic mapping.

00:07:26.868 --> 00:07:31.200
So this is an example
of population shown as cubes.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.267
So here I'm using volume

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:36.934
as the thematic
mapping parameter.

00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:42.667
Another one, you--
of course you can have

00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:44.267
every model.

00:07:44.267 --> 00:07:46.834
So this was downloaded
from, uh,

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:49.767
Google Warehouse
and then scaled.

00:07:49.767 --> 00:07:50.934
So this is showing
the number

00:07:50.934 --> 00:07:55.868
of mobile phone
subscribers.

00:07:55.868 --> 00:08:00.467
Uh, one difficult thing
about using the Colladas

00:08:00.467 --> 00:08:02.968
is that
it's more difficult

00:08:02.968 --> 00:08:06.033
for the user
to compare 3-D symbols,

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:08.567
especially when they
are also in perspective.

00:08:08.567 --> 00:08:11.934
So and--one missing feature
is the possibility

00:08:11.934 --> 00:08:14.801
to actually be able
to click on the models

00:08:14.801 --> 00:08:16.234
to get the value.

00:08:16.234 --> 00:08:17.367
So far, you can only click

00:08:17.367 --> 00:08:19.234
on the image icons
and the polygons.

00:08:19.234 --> 00:08:21.968
But that would be a nice,
like, extension to have.

00:08:27.033 --> 00:08:28.701
So this is basically
how it's done.

00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:31.634
It's--I import
a model into SketchUp,

00:08:31.634 --> 00:08:34.467
and then
they are positioned

00:08:34.467 --> 00:08:38.701
and also scaled,
so all the different objects

00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:40.501
will have the same scale.

00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:44.033
And then I also give them
a default color.

00:08:44.033 --> 00:08:47.133
And by doing that,
I'm able to change the color

00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:50.000
later on when
I generate the maps

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.033
because Collada
is also in XML format

00:08:52.033 --> 00:08:53.567
so I can actually
read it into memory,

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:57.601
change the color, and then
save it to the KM set files.

00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:59.000
To do that on the fly.

00:09:03.367 --> 00:09:06.167
Okay, so that was
proportional symbols.

00:09:06.167 --> 00:09:07.868
Uh, the next one--

00:09:07.868 --> 00:09:09.901
popular thematic
mapping technique--

00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:12.767
is to use chart maps.

00:09:12.767 --> 00:09:17.701
Um, KML has no support
for charts, uh, natively.

00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:18.767
But what's very good

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.968
is that you have
the Google Chart API.

00:09:20.968 --> 00:09:24.601
And that is--it's
quite easy to embed or include

00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:29.167
charts from the API
into the KML file.

00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:32.767
So that's what
I've been doing here.

00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:35.934
Uh, the size of the charts
is still proportional

00:09:35.934 --> 00:09:37.467
to the total population,

00:09:37.467 --> 00:09:39.033
while the charts themselves,

00:09:39.033 --> 00:09:41.467
they show
the age distribution

00:09:41.467 --> 00:09:43.067
for each country.

00:09:47.567 --> 00:09:49.400
And the charts
can also be included

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.200
in the--
in the balloon.

00:09:56.767 --> 00:09:59.200
So another example,
with the bar charts.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.968
So it's good to use--
to show change over time.

00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:06.400
So this shows the declining
infant mortality rate

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.267
for African countries.

00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:20.267
Uh, a good thing
I like with, um...

00:10:20.267 --> 00:10:24.934
with KML is the possibility
to have extended data.

00:10:24.934 --> 00:10:28.767
And that is especially good
for the balloon style,

00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:31.701
where you can reference
this extended data.

00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:33.868
It's a much more, like,
cleaner way of making

00:10:33.868 --> 00:10:35.701
these types of maps.

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:37.801
So that I would also
like as an extension--

00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:39.801
that you could actually use
this extended data

00:10:39.801 --> 00:10:41.601
within
the whole place mark,

00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:43.567
not only within
the balloon style.

00:10:43.567 --> 00:10:45.033
It will be much
easier to make--

00:10:45.033 --> 00:10:47.634
kind of make these maps,

00:10:47.634 --> 00:10:49.467
and easier for people
to kind of understand

00:10:49.467 --> 00:10:50.868
what actually
is happening here.

00:10:57.968 --> 00:11:00.300
Okay, the next technique
is choropleths.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.601
It's probably
the most used and misused

00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:06.033
thematic mapping
technique.

00:11:06.033 --> 00:11:10.067
Um, you will see lots
of examples of choropleths

00:11:10.067 --> 00:11:13.167
on the web
also for KML.

00:11:13.167 --> 00:11:15.701
Um, you will
also see here that

00:11:15.701 --> 00:11:18.100
I have like a--
uh, color legends,

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.834
so this thematic
mapping engine

00:11:19.834 --> 00:11:22.601
is also able to make
the color legends on the fly.

00:11:22.601 --> 00:11:25.100
We'll show you later on
how this is achieved.

00:11:28.634 --> 00:11:32.167
Uh, another technique is
related to the choropleths

00:11:32.167 --> 00:11:34.067
where you--
instead of using color,

00:11:34.067 --> 00:11:37.601
you use the heights
of the polygons.

00:11:37.601 --> 00:11:40.334
Um, so I was
able to do this

00:11:40.334 --> 00:11:42.667
by using
extruded polygons,

00:11:42.667 --> 00:11:44.434
which is supported
in--in KML.

00:11:44.434 --> 00:11:47.634
So here the height
is proportional

00:11:47.634 --> 00:11:49.701
to the statistical value.

00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:52.334
So this map is showing
the infant mortality rates

00:11:52.334 --> 00:11:55.767
in Africa.

00:11:55.767 --> 00:11:58.801
What I think is improving
the view for the user

00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:01.033
is to add color as well.

00:12:01.033 --> 00:12:03.334
Again, this could be
like a different variable,

00:12:03.334 --> 00:12:06.100
but I think the best thing
is not to--to mix

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.367
when you use
these prism maps

00:12:08.367 --> 00:12:10.868
so actually it's
showing the same variables.

00:12:16.701 --> 00:12:19.734
Another example--
this is showing the population

00:12:19.734 --> 00:12:22.534
in municipalities
in Norway.

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:28.367
You will see Oslo here--
the capital.

00:12:28.367 --> 00:12:30.567
So these techniques
can be used on all scales

00:12:30.567 --> 00:12:32.968
on the whole globe
and also--

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.767
The problem with the prism
maps is there's holes,

00:12:39.767 --> 00:12:41.501
polygon holes.

00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:43.367
And the reason is that

00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:45.434
if you have a polygon
on the ground,

00:12:45.434 --> 00:12:48.634
you have the attribute
called a "clamp" to ground,

00:12:48.634 --> 00:12:51.267
so it's actually following
the surface of the Earth,

00:12:51.267 --> 00:12:52.801
the great circle.

00:12:52.801 --> 00:12:55.200
But when you
extrude polygons,

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.234
you don't have
such an option.

00:12:57.234 --> 00:13:00.968
So only the edges
of the polygons

00:13:00.968 --> 00:13:03.067
are extruded,
but not the interior.

00:13:03.067 --> 00:13:04.834
So when some countries
have, like,

00:13:04.834 --> 00:13:06.567
a low statistical value,

00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:08.167
they will have
a low altitude value,

00:13:08.167 --> 00:13:10.901
and these holes
will appear.

00:13:15.934 --> 00:13:19.868
So this one
is just a suggestion

00:13:19.868 --> 00:13:23.300
of how this could be
solved in KML.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.000
Then, instead of specifying
the altitude

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.067
for each vertex
of the polygon,

00:13:29.067 --> 00:13:30.901
you could have
another attribute

00:13:30.901 --> 00:13:32.634
where you only specify

00:13:32.634 --> 00:13:34.968
the altitude once

00:13:34.968 --> 00:13:37.067
and then the whole polygons
will be extruded

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:38.467
to that altitude.

00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:40.267
And then
you could also have

00:13:40.267 --> 00:13:42.267
an attribute, for example,
called "clamp"

00:13:42.267 --> 00:13:43.801
to altitude.

00:13:43.801 --> 00:13:45.868
So the whole polygon
will actually, like,

00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:47.334
follow the great circle.

00:13:53.901 --> 00:13:57.901
The next technique is
similar to the prism maps,

00:13:57.901 --> 00:13:59.868
but this is using
bars instead.

00:13:59.868 --> 00:14:02.400
So here I'm combining
the reg--

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.501
the technique for
the regular polygons

00:14:04.501 --> 00:14:07.334
and adding
the height attributes.

00:14:07.334 --> 00:14:10.133
So this one is showing
the number of internet users

00:14:10.133 --> 00:14:13.167
per 100 population.

00:14:13.167 --> 00:14:15.634
Um, what's possible
with the bars

00:14:15.634 --> 00:14:19.234
is that you can actually use--
show two different variables.

00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:20.667
A problem with this
is that

00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:22.501
there is a lot
of countries in Europe.

00:14:22.501 --> 00:14:25.868
So you get, like, a lot
of attention towards Europe,

00:14:25.868 --> 00:14:27.934
because even though
it's a small country,

00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:30.067
uh, with a tiny population,
it might still have,

00:14:30.067 --> 00:14:32.400
like, a big bar.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.133
So what you can do
is to have population

00:14:36.133 --> 00:14:38.167
as the radius
or the diameter

00:14:38.167 --> 00:14:40.234
of the bar,

00:14:40.234 --> 00:14:43.334
and then have the height--
and here also the color--

00:14:43.334 --> 00:14:45.534
to show
the statistical value.

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:56.667
The last technique I will
present is animated maps,

00:14:56.667 --> 00:15:00.801
and here I'm using the quite
simple but very powerful

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:05.567
KML time primitives
to make thematic maps.

00:15:05.567 --> 00:15:07.367
So I will show you
a few examples.

00:15:21.367 --> 00:15:26.767
So this one is one example
with the prism map.

00:15:26.767 --> 00:15:30.767
So this is the infant
mortality rate in 1960

00:15:30.767 --> 00:15:33.033
shown on this map.

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:36.901
So by dragging the slider,

00:15:36.901 --> 00:15:40.434
you can see how
the infant mortality rate

00:15:40.434 --> 00:15:43.567
is declining...

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:47.634
until 2005.

00:15:47.634 --> 00:15:48.734
And I think this is--

00:15:48.734 --> 00:15:50.701
it's a quite nice way
of doing it.

00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:52.634
You could do the same
only with color,

00:15:52.634 --> 00:15:55.167
but it's easier for
the eye to spot changes

00:15:55.167 --> 00:15:57.567
when you use height
and color.

00:16:04.934 --> 00:16:08.767
Uh, another example is,
again, with the mobile phones.

00:16:15.734 --> 00:16:19.601
So if I zoom in to...

00:16:19.601 --> 00:16:22.400
this one starts in 1980,
I know.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.300
You will see a tiny mobile
phone in--in Finland.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.701
[laughter]

00:16:28.701 --> 00:16:33.234
And also here you can see
the--how it changed things.

00:16:33.234 --> 00:16:37.834
Scandinavia is quite good in
the beginning of the 1980s.

00:16:37.834 --> 00:16:40.367
And then
it's really exploding

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:45.067
across Europe.

00:16:45.067 --> 00:16:47.601
So you would have
this view in 2005.

00:16:47.601 --> 00:16:50.901
So the highest number now of--
of mobile phone users--

00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:53.400
this is not per,
like, per population.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.501
It's not standardized.
This is total numbers.

00:16:55.501 --> 00:16:58.434
It's now in--in China.

00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:01.767
And, um, United States,
number two.

00:17:12.868 --> 00:17:15.634
Okay, so that
was the techniques.

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:18.033
Um, I figured out when I was
working on these techniques

00:17:18.033 --> 00:17:21.934
that it was quite complicated
to create these maps.

00:17:21.934 --> 00:17:24.934
Uh, I did this programically
in using PHP

00:17:24.934 --> 00:17:26.601
to generate the KML files.

00:17:26.601 --> 00:17:28.501
So what I thought was
it would be much easier

00:17:28.501 --> 00:17:31.801
if this could be done in
an easy-to-use web interface

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:33.234
for the user.

00:17:33.234 --> 00:17:35.834
So that's why I created
a thematic mapping engine,

00:17:35.834 --> 00:17:38.701
which was open-sourced this--
this Monday.

00:17:38.701 --> 00:17:40.701
So it's available
now on the web

00:17:40.701 --> 00:17:43.534
under, uh, GPL license.

00:17:43.534 --> 00:17:46.167
Um, I will give you
a short demonstration.

00:17:52.334 --> 00:17:56.734
Um, there are--there are
two ways of using this engine.

00:17:56.734 --> 00:17:59.067
You could either use it as--
in a web interface

00:17:59.067 --> 00:18:02.200
or you could use it in a--
as an API,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.434
which I will show later.

00:18:04.434 --> 00:18:06.167
So this is
the web interface.

00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:07.901
So what you can do
is that you can

00:18:07.901 --> 00:18:10.100
select
a statistical indicator.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:15.767
So I can, for example,
take...

00:18:15.767 --> 00:18:18.200
the infant
mortality rate again,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.400
and then select a year
you want to show,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.434
and then you can, uh,
choose one of the techniques.

00:18:26.434 --> 00:18:28.367
So all of the techniques
are shown--are here

00:18:28.367 --> 00:18:29.534
except the chart maps.

00:18:29.534 --> 00:18:31.701
It's not yet available.

00:18:31.701 --> 00:18:33.467
So I will take the prism.

00:18:33.467 --> 00:18:37.667
You can set the maximum
height of the prism

00:18:37.667 --> 00:18:40.601
and you can select
the colors

00:18:40.601 --> 00:18:43.267
you would
like to do--use.

00:18:43.267 --> 00:18:44.501
The color scale.

00:18:44.501 --> 00:18:48.133
By the--entering
the start and, uh--and color.

00:18:48.133 --> 00:18:49.167
And you can also choose

00:18:49.167 --> 00:18:51.601
between different
classifications

00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:53.634
for the data.

00:18:53.634 --> 00:18:55.567
So I will use
equal intervals,

00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:57.400
five classes,

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.033
and I would also like
to show the values

00:19:00.033 --> 00:19:01.834
and the names
of the countries

00:19:01.834 --> 00:19:04.667
on the top of the prism.

00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:06.767
So you can use--
do like this,

00:19:06.767 --> 00:19:09.501
and what was great
when I was working on this

00:19:09.501 --> 00:19:12.567
for my thesis
was that you--

00:19:12.567 --> 00:19:16.834
we got a Google Earth API
back in June.

00:19:16.834 --> 00:19:18.734
So--and that was very nice,
because then you didn't

00:19:18.734 --> 00:19:20.467
have to switch between
two applications.

00:19:20.467 --> 00:19:22.334
You can actually
see the data

00:19:22.334 --> 00:19:24.968
right away in the browser.

00:19:24.968 --> 00:19:27.267
So if you click "Preview,"

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:29.467
it will make the KML

00:19:29.467 --> 00:19:30.968
in the background
on the server

00:19:30.968 --> 00:19:35.567
and then show it instantly
in the browser.

00:19:35.567 --> 00:19:38.100
And if you zoom in here,
you will also see, like,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.067
the--the names
and the values.

00:19:44.133 --> 00:19:48.033
So now I'm just waiting
for the--Google Earth's API

00:19:48.033 --> 00:19:50.734
to support
the time slider.

00:19:50.734 --> 00:19:53.334
It's--I don't think it's--
you're not yet supporting it.

00:19:53.334 --> 00:19:55.501
So to show
the time animation,

00:19:55.501 --> 00:19:58.868
you have to download to--
to Google Earth instead.

00:19:58.868 --> 00:20:00.467
So that's another option.

00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:02.234
Can just click on this
and it will open

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:03.868
and download
the KML file.

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:18.234
So basically,
on a higher level,

00:20:18.234 --> 00:20:20.767
uh, this engine--
this is how it works.

00:20:20.767 --> 00:20:23.734
So it takes
statistical data

00:20:23.734 --> 00:20:27.234
and it needs the border
of the features

00:20:27.234 --> 00:20:29.367
and it needs
a set of parameters

00:20:29.367 --> 00:20:31.334
of how the map
is going to be.

00:20:31.334 --> 00:20:32.701
And then all this
is fed--

00:20:32.701 --> 00:20:34.734
fed into
the thematic mapping engine

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:37.834
and then it returns
uh, a KM set file

00:20:37.834 --> 00:20:40.834
which is then delivered
back to the browser.

00:20:40.834 --> 00:20:44.000
Uh, so far there
are two ways of, um,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.100
interacting
with the engine.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.734
You could either use
the web interface

00:20:46.734 --> 00:20:50.767
or you can access this
through a--as a PHP API.

00:20:50.767 --> 00:20:52.667
So if you have
a PHP application,

00:20:52.667 --> 00:20:54.901
you can, uh,
use the engine

00:20:54.901 --> 00:20:57.934
and use it with
your own data, for example.

00:20:57.934 --> 00:21:00.067
And one possible
extension would ma--

00:21:00.067 --> 00:21:02.701
would be to make this
as a web service

00:21:02.701 --> 00:21:04.934
so that you could do this
directly on the--

00:21:04.934 --> 00:21:07.667
on the internet
by passing the data

00:21:07.667 --> 00:21:09.167
to a web service.

00:21:13.267 --> 00:21:16.367
Just click through this.

00:21:16.367 --> 00:21:19.901
Uh, so
the web interface...

00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:23.400
uses Ajax
and JSON techniques

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.601
to kind of have this, um,

00:21:26.601 --> 00:21:30.467
rich, uh, interface.

00:21:30.467 --> 00:21:32.200
So it starts
by just asking

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.968
for all the
statistical indicators,

00:21:33.968 --> 00:21:36.701
and then it's delivered
back to the browser.

00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:38.968
And then when the user
selects one indicator,

00:21:38.968 --> 00:21:42.167
it asks for all
the available years.

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:45.267
And then aft--
when the user, uh,

00:21:45.267 --> 00:21:46.934
push the "Submit" button,

00:21:46.934 --> 00:21:49.934
uh, all the parameters
are sent to the server

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.100
and then the link
to the KML file

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.334
is returned to the browser.

00:21:54.334 --> 00:21:57.601
And if the Google Earth
API is used,

00:21:57.601 --> 00:22:00.267
it just instantly loads
the--the KML file.

00:22:03.767 --> 00:22:05.467
And this is what's
happening on the server.

00:22:05.467 --> 00:22:08.200
There is a form handler

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.000
that's--communicates
with the browser.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.100
And then I have divided
it into two classes,

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.000
so you could extend it
more easily to

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.167
and add other data sources.

00:22:17.167 --> 00:22:20.267
So all the data
are fetched from--

00:22:20.267 --> 00:22:23.367
so today from
a MyScale database.

00:22:23.367 --> 00:22:25.701
But by changing this class,
you can--

00:22:25.701 --> 00:22:27.501
as long as the data
is in the same format--

00:22:27.501 --> 00:22:31.601
you could easily tie it in
to another data source.

00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:34.133
So the first thing
is that it--

00:22:34.133 --> 00:22:37.434
it asks for all the data
it needs to make the map,

00:22:37.434 --> 00:22:40.033
and then the parameters--
thematic mapping parameters--

00:22:40.033 --> 00:22:43.701
and the data are handed
over to the engine,

00:22:43.701 --> 00:22:46.300
which then stores
the KM set file

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.000
on just the file server.

00:22:53.901 --> 00:22:58.300
So this is an example
of how we can use the API.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.234
So this is actually
all the code

00:23:00.234 --> 00:23:02.601
required to make
a choropleth map

00:23:02.601 --> 00:23:05.567
with a legend and title
and everything.

00:23:05.567 --> 00:23:07.868
So basically what you do
is to include

00:23:07.868 --> 00:23:12.734
the two classes
and then you--

00:23:12.734 --> 00:23:14.567
this is the, uh, number

00:23:14.567 --> 00:23:16.200
for identify--
for the indicator

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.534
and the year, and then
you add the parameters

00:23:19.534 --> 00:23:22.367
of how we want
the map to be.

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:25.968
And then you are asking
for the map here

00:23:25.968 --> 00:23:29.200
by passing the--the data store
and the parameters.

00:23:35.901 --> 00:23:38.601
I will not go into detail,
but this is, um--

00:23:38.601 --> 00:23:42.267
this one is showing
how the structure

00:23:42.267 --> 00:23:45.534
of the KML is--
how it's--it's made.

00:23:45.534 --> 00:23:48.667
So basically it takes--
to make--it makes the--

00:23:48.667 --> 00:23:50.767
all the shared styles first

00:23:50.767 --> 00:23:53.267
for each
thematic mapping technique,

00:23:53.267 --> 00:23:55.767
and then it's two loops--

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:59.767
uh, one, the outermost loops
is for each year

00:23:59.767 --> 00:24:01.868
and the innermost loop
is for each feature

00:24:01.868 --> 00:24:03.033
and country.

00:24:03.033 --> 00:24:05.701
And then it adds a place mark
for each country

00:24:05.701 --> 00:24:07.734
in the--
in the inner loop.

00:24:07.734 --> 00:24:10.234
This is just how
this is structured.

00:24:14.868 --> 00:24:17.901
Uh, the legends--
that was a challenge

00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:23.067
because KML has no support
for HTML overlays.

00:24:23.067 --> 00:24:25.000
It will only
support images.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.667
So what I had to do is
to generate on the fly

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:30.934
a PNG image
on the server.

00:24:30.934 --> 00:24:34.334
So then I used
a GD open-sourced library

00:24:34.334 --> 00:24:35.901
to make these legends,

00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:38.100
and then packed it with the--
with the other files

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.701
in the--in the KM sets.

00:24:43.901 --> 00:24:47.067
So this is, uh,
my suggestions

00:24:47.067 --> 00:24:50.434
for how Google Earth
could be improved.

00:24:50.434 --> 00:24:53.601
Um, the first thing
is the icon size

00:24:53.601 --> 00:24:56.701
of the different viewports
that I demonstrate.

00:24:56.701 --> 00:24:59.701
Um, I'm not sure if
there is a special reason

00:24:59.701 --> 00:25:01.934
for this behavior
or if it's possible to--

00:25:01.934 --> 00:25:03.634
to be solved.

00:25:03.634 --> 00:25:05.534
Uh, then another one
is that it's--

00:25:05.534 --> 00:25:07.400
it's really important
for thematic maps--

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.267
for the user
to be able to access

00:25:09.267 --> 00:25:12.367
or to find--
see the value of the symbol,

00:25:12.367 --> 00:25:13.934
so it's crucial
that the user

00:25:13.934 --> 00:25:15.467
can actually click
on the symbol

00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:18.367
and then see the value
behind that symbol.

00:25:18.367 --> 00:25:21.267
and so far it's--
it's only really working

00:25:21.267 --> 00:25:23.567
for, uh, the image icons.

00:25:23.567 --> 00:25:24.934
You can click
on the polygons

00:25:24.934 --> 00:25:26.934
but you need to press
the "Control" button,

00:25:26.934 --> 00:25:29.701
and I don't think, like,
the--many users

00:25:29.701 --> 00:25:31.667
really know about it.

00:25:31.667 --> 00:25:34.133
And also, the other problem--
the extruded polygons.

00:25:34.133 --> 00:25:35.601
If you click on them,

00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:38.234
it's not--you can't click on,
like, click on the wall

00:25:38.234 --> 00:25:40.133
or click on the roof
of the polygon.

00:25:40.133 --> 00:25:43.467
It will only identify
the click on the ground.

00:25:43.467 --> 00:25:46.467
So it's really hard to
be able to click correctly

00:25:46.467 --> 00:25:48.300
on the prism.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.968
And the same with
the Collada models.

00:25:49.968 --> 00:25:51.801
It would be really great
if you could actually click

00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:54.667
on the--on the model and
then open the--the balloon

00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:57.501
as--as with an icon.

00:25:57.501 --> 00:26:02.601
Um, another suggestion
is to have more base maps

00:26:02.601 --> 00:26:05.667
because, for thematic maps,
it's--it's really important

00:26:05.667 --> 00:26:07.968
that symbols are in focus

00:26:07.968 --> 00:26:10.334
and the default satellite
imagery, it's--

00:26:10.334 --> 00:26:13.467
it's very busy,
in a way.

00:26:13.467 --> 00:26:16.100
Uh, so it's--
it's kind of hard.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.000
It's not a big contrast
between the background

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.067
and the symbols.

00:26:19.067 --> 00:26:20.667
So what I did here
was to use

00:26:20.667 --> 00:26:24.267
the NASA, uh, City Lights.

00:26:24.267 --> 00:26:26.167
So it--what would
be nice is to maybe

00:26:26.167 --> 00:26:28.467
to have a few more options,

00:26:28.467 --> 00:26:30.601
and maybe some en-entry
that is not so--

00:26:30.601 --> 00:26:32.267
for example, the one
you have for Google Maps

00:26:32.267 --> 00:26:35.167
for--for topography.

00:26:35.167 --> 00:26:37.634
Uh, it's much better to use
for thematic maps

00:26:37.634 --> 00:26:40.567
than the satellite imagery.

00:26:40.567 --> 00:26:44.133
And lastly,
it would be nice

00:26:44.133 --> 00:26:46.100
if you could have,
maybe, for example,

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.901
a Google Legend API

00:26:47.901 --> 00:26:50.200
like you have
the Google Chart API.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.968
So as long as you--
you have to--

00:26:52.968 --> 00:26:54.834
as long as you--
there is no KML support

00:26:54.834 --> 00:26:57.167
for HTML overlays,
it would be nice

00:26:57.167 --> 00:26:58.634
if you could do this
as a service

00:26:58.634 --> 00:27:01.000
as with Google Chart API

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.834
to--to generate legends
on the fly.

00:27:03.834 --> 00:27:06.634
It will be much easier
for the--for the users.

00:27:10.534 --> 00:27:14.634
I will show you
one more application

00:27:14.634 --> 00:27:16.634
that is called
the "Earth Atlas,"

00:27:16.634 --> 00:27:21.400
which is also available,
uh, for download, open-source.

00:27:31.968 --> 00:27:33.400
And I think that's
the great thing

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.901
with the new Google Earth,
uh, API--

00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:41.434
is that you are able to build
your own mapping interface.

00:27:41.434 --> 00:27:43.267
And you, um,
have much more control.

00:27:43.267 --> 00:27:45.634
For example, when you
just give the KML file

00:27:45.634 --> 00:27:48.200
to the user, you kind of--
you are--

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.334
you can't really guide
a user in Google Earth

00:27:50.334 --> 00:27:51.767
in an easy way.

00:27:51.767 --> 00:27:54.701
So what I've done here
is to kind of make

00:27:54.701 --> 00:27:58.267
a little Google Earth-like
interface in the browser

00:27:58.267 --> 00:28:02.601
using a library
called "Ext."

00:28:02.601 --> 00:28:04.534
So here we'll see
you will have

00:28:04.534 --> 00:28:07.667
the possibility
to open and close

00:28:07.667 --> 00:28:09.601
and have various
options here.

00:28:09.601 --> 00:28:11.234
So you can,
for example,

00:28:11.234 --> 00:28:14.400
select infant mortality

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.167
right--right here
in the browser.

00:28:17.167 --> 00:28:21.400
And you can also choose
between different backgrounds.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.501
So you have the
Earth City Lights here.

00:28:24.501 --> 00:28:26.100
It's loading.

00:28:30.934 --> 00:28:33.667
Okay. Don't think
that's working now.

00:28:33.667 --> 00:28:35.200
And you also have access

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.767
to all the Google
Earth functionalities.

00:28:38.767 --> 00:28:41.901
So you can turn
on and on borders

00:28:41.901 --> 00:28:46.734
and have the various
options here on top.

00:28:46.734 --> 00:28:49.067
So it's very easy
for the user to--

00:28:49.067 --> 00:28:52.133
to have access
to the Google Earth API.

00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:58.767
Okay.
Here, it's coming.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.801
Okay.
That was all.

00:29:11.801 --> 00:29:13.400
But we'll
have some time for--

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.801
if there is
any questions.

00:29:19.734 --> 00:29:22.467
man:
Um, I see you've read
a couple of lines of...

00:29:22.467 --> 00:29:23.467
Sandvik:
Pardon?

00:29:23.467 --> 00:29:25.200
man:
Have you read...

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.434
[speaking indistinctly]

00:29:27.434 --> 00:29:30.767
Um, how are you addressing
the issue of normalization?

00:29:30.767 --> 00:29:34.868
[speaking indistinctly]

00:29:34.868 --> 00:29:36.133
Sandvik:
[sighs]

00:29:36.133 --> 00:29:39.567
There is a problem here
because it's kind of--

00:29:39.567 --> 00:29:40.701
what I'm actually doing

00:29:40.701 --> 00:29:42.968
is to give
the cartographic tool box

00:29:42.968 --> 00:29:44.701
to the user, so in a way,

00:29:44.701 --> 00:29:47.267
I'm--I'm kind of
expecting the user--

00:29:47.267 --> 00:29:50.534
that the user is knowing
what he or she is doing.

00:29:50.534 --> 00:29:54.067
So...

00:29:54.067 --> 00:29:57.267
yeah.

00:29:57.267 --> 00:30:00.767
So some of the indicators
that are available

00:30:00.767 --> 00:30:03.167
are normalized
and others are not.

00:30:03.167 --> 00:30:05.934
So, in a way,
I'm kind of suggesting

00:30:05.934 --> 00:30:09.067
I'm--I'm expecting
the user to know

00:30:09.067 --> 00:30:11.300
what will be
a correct view or not.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.567
[murmurs]

00:30:18.133 --> 00:30:21.667
man #2:
[speaking indistinctly]

00:30:21.667 --> 00:30:22.767
Sandvik:
Is more--

00:30:22.767 --> 00:30:23.834
man #2:
[speaking indistinctly]

00:30:23.834 --> 00:30:25.067
Sandvik:
Than the other.

00:30:25.067 --> 00:30:28.434
Um, I think
the mostly popular one

00:30:28.434 --> 00:30:31.234
but also misused
is the choropleths.

00:30:31.234 --> 00:30:33.834
Uh, when I had presented
these on the blog,

00:30:33.834 --> 00:30:35.767
I think I got, like,
the most attention

00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:37.033
on the prism maps.

00:30:37.033 --> 00:30:39.601
People like that--
that map.

00:30:39.601 --> 00:30:42.100
But the--that was also--
this is also

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.267
the techniques
were also criticized,

00:30:44.267 --> 00:30:46.267
especially the--
the prism maps

00:30:46.267 --> 00:30:49.534
and maybe also
the Collada objects--

00:30:49.534 --> 00:30:52.567
especially because this
is done in a 3-D interface,

00:30:52.567 --> 00:30:54.501
and you have the problem

00:30:54.501 --> 00:30:57.667
that it's not only
the size of the symbol--

00:30:57.667 --> 00:31:00.200
it's not only
the statistical value

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.067
that is affecting
the size of the symbol--

00:31:02.067 --> 00:31:06.767
it's also the distance
from, uh, the viewpoints.

00:31:06.767 --> 00:31:08.567
So if it's further away,

00:31:08.567 --> 00:31:10.267
the symbols will be smaller.

00:31:10.267 --> 00:31:12.467
But that's--that's a good
thing about image icons,

00:31:12.467 --> 00:31:14.968
because they're not
affected by perspectives.

00:31:14.968 --> 00:31:17.033
So when you have
the circles that I showed you,

00:31:17.033 --> 00:31:18.968
they will have
the same size

00:31:18.968 --> 00:31:22.934
uh, when--when
they're visualized.

00:31:22.934 --> 00:31:25.968
man #3:
[speaking indistinctly]

00:31:25.968 --> 00:31:27.400
Sandvik:
What I mean by "misused"?

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.634
man #3:
Choropleths...

00:31:30.634 --> 00:31:33.267
Sandvik:
Um, especially
also like a problem

00:31:33.267 --> 00:31:37.033
with normalization,
uh, and other issues.

00:31:37.033 --> 00:31:39.734
For example, um...

00:31:39.734 --> 00:31:43.834
a--a large country
will have a lot of focus

00:31:43.834 --> 00:31:47.167
because it's, like,
taking a lot of space

00:31:47.167 --> 00:31:49.234
[chuckles]
on the screen.

00:31:49.234 --> 00:31:52.067
Uh, and--but by--
but, if you,

00:31:52.067 --> 00:31:54.367
for example,
use a proportional symbol--

00:31:54.367 --> 00:31:57.334
and especially
if it's also, uh...

00:31:57.334 --> 00:31:59.133
you had these techniques
with the bars,

00:31:59.133 --> 00:32:02.167
where you could have
the radius or the diameter

00:32:02.167 --> 00:32:03.501
showing the population--

00:32:03.501 --> 00:32:06.167
you will have
a more correct view.

00:32:06.167 --> 00:32:07.367
Uh...

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:17.601
Mmm?

00:32:17.601 --> 00:32:20.267
man #4:
So, um, do you--
so as far as

00:32:20.267 --> 00:32:21.634
the web service part goes,

00:32:21.634 --> 00:32:23.968
have you given it thought
as to, I mean--

00:32:23.968 --> 00:32:26.334
do you actually plan on
creating a web server?

00:32:26.334 --> 00:32:27.467
Or have you
thought about it?

00:32:27.467 --> 00:32:28.934
Sandvik:
[chuckles]

00:32:28.934 --> 00:32:31.267
man #4:
Maybe platforms, too?

00:32:31.267 --> 00:32:34.033
Sandvik:
Um, right now
I have not yet decided

00:32:34.033 --> 00:32:35.267
what to do.

00:32:35.267 --> 00:32:37.667
Uh, and it's also,
like, a matter of time

00:32:37.667 --> 00:32:40.367
and finance how much
I will continue on.

00:32:40.367 --> 00:32:42.200
My--my--
what I like the most

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.133
is to actually make
the visualizations,

00:32:45.133 --> 00:32:47.400
uh, more than
the code behind, so.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.267
I think it would be--

00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:51.734
I would let it--give that
task to someone else

00:32:51.734 --> 00:32:54.901
maybe to make this
as a web service.

00:32:54.901 --> 00:32:57.634
Hmm.

00:32:57.634 --> 00:32:59.300
man #5:
Can you talk about
that data source?

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.367
[speaking indistinctly]

00:33:02.367 --> 00:33:04.601
The U.N. database...

00:33:04.601 --> 00:33:06.200
Sandvik:
Yeah, I forgot to mention

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.100
all the data is from
the U.N. data portal

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.067
that was just launched
back in February.

00:33:13.067 --> 00:33:16.200
And, um, it's
a great service.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.534
But they--
they don't have any

00:33:17.534 --> 00:33:18.868
visualization capabilities.

00:33:18.868 --> 00:33:22.501
But you can download
the data in an XML format.

00:33:22.501 --> 00:33:24.400
So I just
wrote the script--

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.534
well, I uploaded this data
to the MyScale database.

00:33:28.534 --> 00:33:32.667
Um, so basically,
that's what I'm doing--

00:33:32.667 --> 00:33:34.234
been doing.

00:33:34.234 --> 00:33:38.234
man #6:
How easy is that...

00:33:38.234 --> 00:33:40.033
Sandvik:
Um, it's not too difficult.

00:33:40.033 --> 00:33:43.667
It's, uh--the--
it's explained

00:33:43.667 --> 00:33:45.300
in the documentation.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.801
But basically
what the script--

00:33:47.801 --> 00:33:49.534
the--this data connector
is doing

00:33:49.534 --> 00:33:51.634
is that it's querying
the database

00:33:51.634 --> 00:33:54.968
and then it's making
an associative array

00:33:54.968 --> 00:33:56.734
of the data.

00:33:56.734 --> 00:33:58.701
So as long as--
if you write another script

00:33:58.701 --> 00:34:02.200
and just--returns
the same array of data,

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.968
you can feed it
into the engine and it's--

00:34:03.968 --> 00:34:05.033
it shouldn't complain.

00:34:05.033 --> 00:34:07.567
[chuckles]

00:34:07.567 --> 00:34:09.534
man #7:
What would it take to do
a Python interface?

00:34:09.534 --> 00:34:10.968
[speaking indistinctly]

00:34:10.968 --> 00:34:13.834
Sandvik:
Um, yeah.
I know Google loves Python.

00:34:13.834 --> 00:34:15.534
More than PHP.
[laughs]

00:34:15.534 --> 00:34:17.734
Um, I don't know.

00:34:17.734 --> 00:34:23.534
It's--this is about,
maybe 1,500 lines of code.

00:34:23.534 --> 00:34:27.667
Mmm.

00:34:27.667 --> 00:34:29.300
man #7:
And the source is already...

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.200
Sandvik:
Yeah, the source
is available, yeah.

00:34:33.667 --> 00:34:35.133
man #8:
Can you cover
your choice of buttons

00:34:35.133 --> 00:34:39.234
that you used
throughout...

00:34:39.234 --> 00:34:40.868
Sandvik:
[murmurs]

00:34:40.868 --> 00:34:44.200
I--the--the main reason
for having GPL

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:48.868
is that I'm using
the Ext JavaScript library,

00:34:48.868 --> 00:34:51.100
and that is GPL licensed.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.801
So in a way,
to be able to use that one,

00:34:53.801 --> 00:34:56.534
I had to choose
the same license.

00:34:56.534 --> 00:34:58.701
But it would be possible
to choose another license

00:34:58.701 --> 00:35:01.334
for the server
part of the--

00:35:01.334 --> 00:35:03.200
so if you're not using
the web interface

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.334
but only the API,
PHP API--

00:35:06.334 --> 00:35:08.067
but, uh, for simplicity
I decided

00:35:08.067 --> 00:35:10.234
to have the same license.

00:35:10.234 --> 00:35:11.567
Mmm.

00:35:11.567 --> 00:35:13.567
man #9:
There are--how many
types of visualizations

00:35:13.567 --> 00:35:16.234
can the KML system support?

00:35:16.234 --> 00:35:18.634
Sandvik:
That KML supports--

00:35:18.634 --> 00:35:19.968
man #9:
That KML doesn't support.

00:35:19.968 --> 00:35:21.701
Things it'd like
to do that...

00:35:21.701 --> 00:35:23.934
[speaking indistinctly]

00:35:23.934 --> 00:35:24.968
Or--or does it...

00:35:24.968 --> 00:35:27.400
[speaking indistinctly]

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.501
Sandvik:
I think it--

00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:29.601
man #9:
Or just thematic maps.

00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:30.934
Sandvik:
It's a lot--it's--

00:35:30.934 --> 00:35:34.267
it's not really tailored
towards thematic mapping.

00:35:34.267 --> 00:35:36.567
In--and thematic mapping
is--is not mentioned

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:40.467
in the--in the standard
document.

00:35:40.467 --> 00:35:42.734
But there are
some flexible structures

00:35:42.734 --> 00:35:44.501
that you are able to use.

00:35:44.501 --> 00:35:45.901
But still
it's quite complicated,

00:35:45.901 --> 00:35:48.000
and it's a little bit--
especially how

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.501
everything is--
is mixed together

00:35:50.501 --> 00:35:53.434
with the styles
and the attributes

00:35:53.434 --> 00:35:54.801
and the data.

00:35:54.801 --> 00:35:57.367
So it will be
much cleaner, for example,

00:35:57.367 --> 00:36:00.133
because you have to give
an altitude in meters,

00:36:00.133 --> 00:36:02.167
uh, well,
for the prism maps.

00:36:02.167 --> 00:36:03.467
It will be much better

00:36:03.467 --> 00:36:05.901
if you have
a more flexible structure

00:36:05.901 --> 00:36:07.667
just so you could
store the data,

00:36:07.667 --> 00:36:10.400
and maybe the connections
between the data

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.033
and the height,
for example, separately.

00:36:13.033 --> 00:36:14.801
Uh, so I think there is,
really,

00:36:14.801 --> 00:36:16.868
a lot of improvements.

00:36:16.868 --> 00:36:19.234
But what I like about KML--
it's quite simple

00:36:19.234 --> 00:36:21.734
and ef-efficient
to use, so.

00:36:21.734 --> 00:36:24.234
Uh, yeah,
I'm not sure what--

00:36:24.234 --> 00:36:28.767
what would be
the best way to go.

00:36:28.767 --> 00:36:30.501
man #10:
We saw with the mapping
of the countries,

00:36:30.501 --> 00:36:32.501
that the environmental
issue's been covered--

00:36:32.501 --> 00:36:37.067
um, non-country regions,
the oceans, boats.

00:36:37.067 --> 00:36:38.634
Sandvik:
Mmm.

00:36:38.634 --> 00:36:40.234
man #10:
Does this extend
to that easily?

00:36:40.234 --> 00:36:41.334
What do you...

00:36:41.334 --> 00:36:42.701
[speaking indistinctly]

00:36:42.701 --> 00:36:44.601
Sandvik:
You need different data.

00:36:44.601 --> 00:36:47.667
I haven't looked, uh,
a lot into that issue.

00:36:47.667 --> 00:36:48.834
But you have, like,

00:36:48.834 --> 00:36:50.834
other thematic mapping
techniques for that.

00:36:50.834 --> 00:36:53.367
Like the asymmetric maps,

00:36:53.367 --> 00:36:54.834
where you--
where you don't have

00:36:54.834 --> 00:36:56.634
country regions,
but you have regions

00:36:56.634 --> 00:36:59.100
following
the data themselves.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.133
And--

00:37:00.133 --> 00:37:01.467
man #10:
Atmosphere.

00:37:01.467 --> 00:37:03.767
Sandvik:
Yeah, so--
and it is possible.

00:37:03.767 --> 00:37:05.467
But then you need--

00:37:05.467 --> 00:37:07.133
because what I--
basically what I need

00:37:07.133 --> 00:37:09.400
is to have--how you have used
all the country borders.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.634
So then you need, uh,
the boundary data

00:37:11.634 --> 00:37:12.834
to be able to do it.

00:37:12.834 --> 00:37:15.000
What many people do
is they just, uh,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.834
make raster tiles,
for example,

00:37:17.834 --> 00:37:20.167
because that we can use--
do for everything.

00:37:20.167 --> 00:37:21.367
But I like especially if--

00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:23.100
if it's improved
that you can actually

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.234
click on all the elements,

00:37:24.234 --> 00:37:26.801
I think use the vector
features of KML

00:37:26.801 --> 00:37:27.968
is much more efficient,

00:37:27.968 --> 00:37:29.701
because the user
can interact with the--

00:37:29.701 --> 00:37:32.133
with the maps in--
in a different way.
