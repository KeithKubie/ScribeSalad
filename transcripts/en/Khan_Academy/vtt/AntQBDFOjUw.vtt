00:00:00.727 --> 00:00:02.643
- [Instructor] What I have
listed here is several

00:00:02.643 --> 00:00:06.209
of the derivative rules that
we've used in previous videos.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:08.563
If these things look unfamiliar
to you I encourage you

00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:11.619
to maybe to not watch this
video because in this video

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.242
we're going to think about
when do we apply these rules?

00:00:14.242 --> 00:00:17.006
What strategies and can
we algebraically convert

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.474
expressions so that we
can use a simpler rule?

00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:21.474
But this is a quick review,
this is of course the power

00:00:21.474 --> 00:00:26.002
rule right over here, very
handy for taking derivatives

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.169
of X raised to some power.

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:31.774
It's also we can use that
with the derivative properties

00:00:31.774 --> 00:00:35.536
of sums of derivatives or
differences of derivatives

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:38.287
to take derivatives of polynomials.

00:00:38.287 --> 00:00:41.523
This right over here is the product rule.

00:00:41.523 --> 00:00:43.763
If I have an expression that
I want to take the derivative

00:00:43.763 --> 00:00:46.086
of and I can think of it as
the product of two functions,

00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:48.674
well then the derivative is
going to be the derivative

00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:51.128
of the first function times
the second function plus

00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:55.303
the first function times the
derivative of the second.

00:00:55.303 --> 00:00:57.314
Once again if this looks
completely unfamiliar to you

00:00:57.314 --> 00:00:59.742
or you're a little shaky,
go watch the videos,

00:00:59.742 --> 00:01:02.703
do the practice on the power
rule and the product rule,

00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:05.891
or in this case the quotient rule.

00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:09.108
And the quotient rule is
a little bit more involved

00:01:09.108 --> 00:01:11.852
and we have practicing videos
on that and I always have

00:01:11.852 --> 00:01:13.999
mixed feelings about it
because if you don't remember

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:16.736
the quotient rule, you can
usually or you can always convert

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:20.531
a quotient into a product
by expressing this thing

00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:24.698
at the bottom as F of X times
G of X to the negative one.

00:01:26.434 --> 00:01:28.982
So you could take the
derivative with a combination

00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:32.575
of the products and this
fourth rule over here,

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:34.189
the chain rule.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.657
And if any of this is looking
unfamiliar again don't watch

00:01:38.657 --> 00:01:41.697
this video, this video is
for folks who are familiar

00:01:41.697 --> 00:01:44.464
with each of these derivative
rules or derivative

00:01:44.464 --> 00:01:46.751
techniques and now want to
think about well what are

00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:50.471
strategies for deciding
when to apply which.

00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:52.061
So let's do that.

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:55.835
Let's say that I have the
expression, let's say I'm

00:01:55.835 --> 00:02:00.002
interested in taking the
derivative of X squared plus X

00:02:04.226 --> 00:02:06.476
minus two over X minus one.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.222
Which of these rules or
techniques would you use?

00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:16.948
Well you might immediately
say hey look this looks like

00:02:16.948 --> 00:02:21.086
a rational expression, I
could say this is my F of X

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:25.193
right over here, I could
say this is my G of X right

00:02:25.193 --> 00:02:27.653
over here and I could
apply the quotient rule,

00:02:27.653 --> 00:02:30.932
this looks like a quotient
of two expressions.

00:02:30.932 --> 00:02:33.846
And you could do that and if
you do all the mathematics

00:02:33.846 --> 00:02:38.055
correctly, you will
get the correct answer.

00:02:38.055 --> 00:02:41.299
But in this case it's good
to just take a little time

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.371
to realize well can I
simplify this algebraically so

00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:47.441
maybe I can do a little bit less work?

00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:49.728
And if you look at it that
way, you might realize

00:02:49.728 --> 00:02:52.281
wait what if I factored this
numerator I can factor it

00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:54.948
as X plus two times X minus one.

00:02:57.572 --> 00:03:01.381
And then I could cancel these
two characters out and I can

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:04.241
say hey you know what this
is going to be the same thing

00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:07.712
as the derivative with
respect to X of X plus two.

00:03:07.712 --> 00:03:11.879
Derivative with respect to X
of X plus two, which is much

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.662
much much much more straightforward
than trying to apply

00:03:17.662 --> 00:03:19.334
the quotient rule.

00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:21.478
Here you would just take
the derivative with respect

00:03:21.478 --> 00:03:25.156
to X of X which is just going
to be one and the derivative

00:03:25.156 --> 00:03:27.263
with respect to X of two
is just going to be zero

00:03:27.263 --> 00:03:29.423
and so all of this is
going to simplify to one.

00:03:29.423 --> 00:03:31.812
If we're taking the derivative
of that, you're essentially

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:33.971
just using the power rule.

00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:37.271
And so once again just a
simple algebraic recognition

00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:40.451
things become much more simple.

00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:42.534
Let's do another example.

00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:47.314
So let's say that you were to
see, or someone were to ask

00:03:47.314 --> 00:03:51.314
you to take the derivative
with respect to X of,

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.856
let me see, so let's say
you had X squared plus two X

00:03:58.292 --> 00:03:59.792
minus five over X.

00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:07.104
So once again you might be
tempted to use the quotient

00:04:07.104 --> 00:04:09.987
rule, this looks like the
quotient of two expressions.

00:04:09.987 --> 00:04:12.515
But then you might realize
there's some algebraic

00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:14.852
manipulations I could
do to make this simpler.

00:04:14.852 --> 00:04:17.906
You could express this as a
product, you could say that

00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:21.395
this is the same thing as,
and I'm just going to focus on

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:23.699
what's inside the parentheses
or inside the brackets,

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.771
this is the same thing as X
to the negative one times X

00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:30.442
squared plus 2x minus five
and then you might want to

00:04:30.442 --> 00:04:32.359
apply the product rule.

00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:36.931
But there's even a better
simplification here.

00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:39.299
You could just divide each of
these terms by X or one way

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:43.216
to think about it distribute
this one over X across

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:45.375
all the terms, X to the
negative one is the same thing

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:48.644
as one over X and if you do
that X squared divided by X

00:04:48.644 --> 00:04:50.061
is going to be X.

00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:53.026
2x divided by X is going to
be two and then negative five

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:56.497
divided by X, well you could
write that as negative five

00:04:56.497 --> 00:05:01.025
over X or negative five
X to the negative one.

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:04.692
And now I'm taking the
derivative of this with respect

00:05:04.692 --> 00:05:07.882
to X is much easier than
using either the quotient

00:05:07.882 --> 00:05:09.382
or the power rule.

00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:13.365
This is going to be, let's
see the derivative of that

00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:16.049
is going to be one, derivative
of two is going to be zero

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:18.498
and here even though you
have a negative exponent,

00:05:18.498 --> 00:05:20.596
it might look a little
intimidating, this is just taken

00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:22.631
using the power rule.

00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:27.601
So negative one times
negative five is positive five

00:05:27.601 --> 00:05:31.792
X to the, if we take one
less than negative one we're

00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:33.940
going to go the negative two power.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.420
So once again making this
algebraic recognition simplified

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.920
things a good bit.

00:05:39.443 --> 00:05:43.379
Let's do a few more examples
of just starting to recognize

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.560
when we might be able to
simplify things to do things

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.948
a little bit easier.

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:53.115
So let's say that someone said
hey you take the derivative

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:58.193
with respect to X and I'm using
X as our variable that we're

00:05:58.193 --> 00:06:00.515
taking the derivative of
with respect to but obviously

00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:03.255
this works for any
variables that we are using.

00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:08.083
So let's say we're saying
square root of X over X squared.

00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:10.081
Pause this video and think
about how would you approach

00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:12.468
this if you want to take the
derivative with respect to X

00:06:12.468 --> 00:06:15.718
of the square root of X over X squared.

00:06:17.172 --> 00:06:19.225
Well once again you might
say this is a quotient of two

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.715
expressions, might try to
apply the quotient rule,

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:25.871
or you might recognize well
look this is the same thing,

00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:28.437
let me just focus on what's
inside the brackets, you could

00:06:28.437 --> 00:06:32.692
view this as X to the negative
two times the square root

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:36.494
of X and then you might
want to use the product rule

00:06:36.494 --> 00:06:39.477
but you could simplify this even better.

00:06:39.477 --> 00:06:42.227
You could say this is the same
thing as X to the negative

00:06:42.227 --> 00:06:45.315
two times X to the one half
power and now just using our

00:06:45.315 --> 00:06:48.772
exponent properties, negative
two plus one half is negative

00:06:48.772 --> 00:06:52.070
three halves, so this is the
derivative X to the negative

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.886
three halves power.

00:06:53.886 --> 00:06:56.846
And so here once again we
took something that we thought

00:06:56.846 --> 00:07:00.325
we might have to use the
quotient rule or use the product

00:07:00.325 --> 00:07:04.799
rule and now this just becomes
a straightforward using

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.852
the power rule.

00:07:06.852 --> 00:07:10.322
So this is just going to be
equal to, so bring the negative

00:07:10.322 --> 00:07:13.936
three halves out front,
negative three halves,

00:07:13.936 --> 00:07:18.103
X to the negative three halves
minus one is negative five

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:20.159
halves power.

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:23.027
So once again just before you,
especially if you're about

00:07:23.027 --> 00:07:25.044
to apply the quotient rule
and sometimes even the product

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:28.003
rule, just see is there an
algebraic simplification,

00:07:28.003 --> 00:07:30.803
sometimes a trigonometric
simplification that you can make

00:07:30.803 --> 00:07:34.995
that eases your job that
makes things less hairy?

00:07:34.995 --> 00:07:38.352
As a general tip I can't say
this is going to be always

00:07:38.352 --> 00:07:41.459
true but if you're taking some
type of exam and you're going

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:44.146
down some really hairy route
which the quotient rule

00:07:44.146 --> 00:07:47.299
will often take you, it's a
good sign that hey take a pause

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:50.798
before trying to run
through all of that algebra

00:07:50.798 --> 00:07:54.386
to apply the quotient
rule and see if you can

00:07:54.386 --> 00:07:55.719
simplify things.

00:07:56.754 --> 00:07:58.704
So let's give another example.

00:07:58.704 --> 00:08:02.662
In this one there's not an
obvious way and it really

00:08:02.662 --> 00:08:06.970
depends on what folks'
preferences are, but let's say you

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.303
want to take the derivative
with respect to X of one

00:08:10.303 --> 00:08:14.470
over 2x to the negative five,
sorry, one over 2x minus five

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.783
I should say.

00:08:18.372 --> 00:08:22.165
Well here you could immediately
apply the quotient rule here

00:08:22.165 --> 00:08:25.872
the numerator you view that as F of X.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.960
You could view this as the
same thing as the derivative

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.460
with respect to X.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.657
Instead of 2x minus five, let
me do that in the blue color.

00:08:35.657 --> 00:08:38.990
2x minus five to the negative one power.

00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:46.247
In this situation, you would
use a combination of the power

00:08:46.247 --> 00:08:48.247
rule and the chain rule.

00:08:49.603 --> 00:08:54.305
You would say okay my G of X
is 2x minus five and F of G

00:08:54.305 --> 00:08:58.403
of X is going to be this whole expression.

00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:00.917
And so if you applied the
chain rule, this is going to be

00:09:00.917 --> 00:09:05.084
the derivative of the
outside function, our F of X

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:08.353
with respect to the inside function.

00:09:08.353 --> 00:09:11.220
The derivative of F of G of
X with respect to G of X.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.785
So it's going to be negative,
we'll bring that negative

00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:16.812
out front, so we're
essentially just going to use

00:09:16.812 --> 00:09:18.148
the power rule here.

00:09:18.148 --> 00:09:21.936
Negative 2x minus five to
the negative two and then we

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:26.103
multiply that times the
derivative of the inside function.

00:09:27.495 --> 00:09:29.715
So the inside function's
derivative, the derivative

00:09:29.715 --> 00:09:32.373
of 2x is two, the derivative
of negative five is zero

00:09:32.373 --> 00:09:34.498
so it's going to be times two
and of course you can simplify

00:09:34.498 --> 00:09:38.353
so it's a negative two
times all of this business.

00:09:38.353 --> 00:09:41.186
Let me do one more example
here just to hit the point home

00:09:41.186 --> 00:09:44.529
and once again there isn't a
must way, there isn't a way

00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:47.919
that you have to do this,
but just let you appreciate

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:50.450
that there's multiple ways
to approach these types

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.700
of derivatives.

00:09:53.048 --> 00:09:54.996
So let's say someone said
take the derivative of 2x

00:09:54.996 --> 00:09:56.413
plus one squared.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.971
Pause the video and think
about how you would do that.

00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:01.988
Well one way to do it is
just to apply the chain rule

00:10:01.988 --> 00:10:04.081
just like we just did.

00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:06.084
So you could say alright here's
going to be the derivative

00:10:06.084 --> 00:10:07.956
of the outside with respect to the inside.

00:10:07.956 --> 00:10:11.821
So it's going to be two times
2x plus one to the first

00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:15.424
power, taking one less than
that times the derivative

00:10:15.424 --> 00:10:18.883
of the inside which is just
going to be two and so this

00:10:18.883 --> 00:10:21.587
is going to be equal to
four times 2x plus one,

00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:26.279
which is equal to, if we
want to distribute the four,

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:28.862
we could say it's 8x plus four.

00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:32.432
That's a completely
legitimate way of doing it.

00:10:32.432 --> 00:10:35.102
Now there are other ways of doing it.

00:10:35.102 --> 00:10:37.715
You could expand out
to X plus one squared.

00:10:37.715 --> 00:10:40.723
You could say hey this is the
same thing as the derivative

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:44.890
with respect to X of 2x squared
is going to be 4x squared

00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:51.109
and then two times the product
of these terms is going

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:53.480
to be plus 4x plus one.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.147
And now you would just
apply the power rule.

00:10:58.115 --> 00:10:59.636
It's a little bit of extra
algebra up front but you can

00:10:59.636 --> 00:11:01.505
just go straightforward with
the power rule and you're

00:11:01.505 --> 00:11:03.665
going to get this exact same thing.

00:11:03.665 --> 00:11:05.987
So the whole takeaway here is
pause look at your expression.

00:11:05.987 --> 00:11:09.412
See if there's a way to
simplify it and it's especially

00:11:09.412 --> 00:11:11.989
a good thing if you can get
out of using the quotient rule

00:11:11.989 --> 00:11:14.566
'cause that sometimes is
just hard to know or remember

00:11:14.566 --> 00:11:17.174
and even when you do remember
it, it can get quite hairy

00:11:17.174 --> 00:11:18.091
quite fast.
