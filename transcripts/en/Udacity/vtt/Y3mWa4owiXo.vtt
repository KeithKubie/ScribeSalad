How did we find out how many feet

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.430
We calculated the perimeter
of the 14 by 14 room.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.760
We did that by adding up all four sides.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.640
Remember that all four sides of
a square have the same length.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.040
If the length of a square is l,
what is the formula for

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.340
the perimeter of a square?

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.794
Is it 4 plus l, 4 divided by l,
l divided by 4 or 4 times l?

00:00:29.794 --> 00:00:31.959
