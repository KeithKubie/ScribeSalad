This is Adrienne Felt.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.000
Adrienne is a PhD student at Berkeley, and she's done a lot of interesting work

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
on computer security.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So what do our students need to understand about security?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
One of the first projects I looked at, which I actually worked here with Dr. Evans,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
was I use Facebook and I install and use Facebook applications.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Many of you may be familiar with the Washington Post Social Reader.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And at the time I was just curious.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.500
What are these doing with my data? How are they getting my data?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.000
How do these things work?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And so I decided to learn more about how they work,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and from there it led to basically what ended up becoming my thesis topic in a PhD program.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm still interested in how do applications get data and how do they use the data.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
When developers are writing applications that access users' private information

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
or resources like their location or their camera,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
they need to keep in mind that they need to a) respect users' privacy

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and only use the resources that they need to use,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and b) they have to be careful to build their applications in such a way

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that they don't accidentally leak this data to other applications.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So I primarily focus on Android development and security of Android applications.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
One thing that's really important for an Android application developer to know

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
is about the privacy and security of their applications.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So when a user installs an application from the Android Market,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
they're shown things called permissions, which are small warnings

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that tell the user about all of the resources that the application gets access to on their phone.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
For example, for this application I'm looking at,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the application can get access to location, the Internet, the list of contacts, camera, etc.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So the user is warned before the application installation is completed

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that the application can do all of these things.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So as a developer, it's important to only ask for access

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to resources that your application really needs.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Otherwise you might unnecessarily scare off users

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
who might otherwise want to install your application.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So one of the projects we built was a static analysis tool

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that analyzes the permission usage of Android applications

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
so that it can warn developers if developers are requesting more permissions

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
than they actually need for their applications to work.
